So I think he has the maturity to be ready for everything.\u201d Sarri, who usually reveals Chelsea\u2019s team selection relatively close to kick-off, was so incensed by Arrizabalaga\u2019s conduct that when told by the referee the final was to continue without the substitution, he stormed down the tunnel. The manager returned moments later having composed himself but had to be restrained by Antonio R\u00fcdiger from confronting the goalkeeper as Chelsea\u2019s players prepared for the shootout. Sarri was also involved in what appeared to be a heated discussion with the Chelsea captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, who would score his spot-kick shortly after. Yet Sarri denied his anger had disrupted preparations for the shootout. \u201cI needed a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really upset and I needed to return calm and in control of my mind. When the match started again, I was on the bench. And I still spoke with the players [before the shootout], very briefly, because we had only to kick penalties, so I have to say five names. Not tactics.\u201d Sarri put the failure of senior players other than David Luiz to speak to Arrizabalaga at the time down to the \u201cvery unusual situation\u201d that had left them, like the manager, \u201cvery shocked\u201d. Defeat by Spurs could leave Chelsea six points behind the top four and have serious implications for Sarri. Memories of the home support\u2019s angry dismissal of his tactics during last week\u2019s FA Cup defeat by Manchester United are still fresh and the manager, while empathising with the fans\u2019 discontent, urged the crowd to show \u201cmore support for my players, and not for me\u201d. \u201cThe goalkeeper is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe made a big mistake but he is really a very nice boy. There is only one difficulty: the results. The atmosphere in the training ground is really very good. The application of the players is better than before. The problem is to have results with consistency. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to play with the same level of application as in the last match because, mentally, we spent a lot in the match on Sunday.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally ... Newcastle United 2-0 Burnley. Louise Taylor was at St James\u2019 Park to see Toon continue their fine run and become a mid-table concern. Thanks for reading tonight\u2019s Clockwatch; make sure to come back tomorrow evening for some more hot Premier League action! Nighty night. Huddersfield Town 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers. Paul Wilson was at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium to watch the Terriers dramatically win an otherwise nondescript scrap with Wolves. Leicester City 2-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Paul Doyle was on hand at the King Power to witness a winning start for the all-new true-blue Brendan Rodgers. Cardiff City 0-3 Everton. Ben Fisher was at the Cardiff City Stadium to see Gylfi Sigurdsson turn Everton\u2019s season around. It\u2019s not just Newcastle who enjoyed their evening in the Premier League. Everton ended a run of three losses with a comprehensive victory at Cardiff, who remain in serious relegation trouble. Huddersfield are almost certainly going down, but a late Steve Mounie winner against mid-table Wolves will have given Jan Siewert hope for a Championship rebuild. And Leicester have a new manager and a new one-in-a-row winning sequence, no small thing seeing they\u2019d previously not won a league game in 2019. Brighton might have to start looking over their shoulder, though, as their winless streak continues, bringing the relegation zone into sharp focus. FULL TIME: Newcastle United 2-0 Burnley. The final final whistle of the evening sounds, and that\u2019s four home wins in a row for the Toon. They\u2019ve claimed 13 of the last 18 points on offer! Rafa Benitez really is a class act. They leapfrog Burnley into 13th spot on 31 points; Burnley drop to 15th on 30. Neither team is going down. James Tarkowski tangles with Joselu in the midfield, then as the Newcastle man falls, makes to stamp near his head. Then he leans over the prone player and has a word. That wasn\u2019t particularly edifying from Tarkowski, who could easily have caused a serious injury there. Inches in it. The ref sees nothing. Another mad scramble in the Newcastle box! The home side\u2019s nerves are betraying them. They can\u2019t get out at all. But Burnley are a little too desperate, and nobody\u2019s able to get a shot or a header away. The tension at St James\u2019 is palpable, two-goal cushion deep into injury time or no! Now Crouch has planted an elbow on Mohamed Diame\u2019s temple! That looked totally accidental, to be fair, as three players contested a high ball. But that\u2019s a very sore one for Diame, who is down getting treatment and not moving around so much. Happily he gets up, his head swathed in bandages. The board goes up for five added minutes, but it\u2019ll be a bit more than that now. Burnley spent a couple of minutes pinning Newcastle back there, looking for the goal that\u2019d rattle the home team\u2019s nerves. There was one almighty scramble in the six-yard box, a good old-fashioned lot of nonsense, but nobody in claret could toe-poke home. Meanwhile the veteran Peter Crouch, on in search of late glory for Burnley, steps on the top of man-of-the-match Fabian Schar\u2019s boot. It\u2019s a really clumsy challenge, as opposed to nasty, but he wasn\u2019t fully in control and can consider himself fortunate to only see yellow. Still a few minutes to go at St James\u2019 Park, where Newcastle still lead Burnley 2-0. Meanwhile there were some notable celebrations at the final whistles of the 7.45pm kick-offs, with Brendan Rodgers chuffed to bits with his new charges, and Jan Siewert cavorting with delight after securing his first win as Huddersfield boss. The Terriers are still going down, of course, unless something truly surreal unfolds, but there\u2019s a result worth getting carried away about, December and January having been such cruel months. Premier League Cardiff City 0-3 Everton Huddersfield Town 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers Leicester City 2-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Newcastle United 2-0 Burnley (L) Championship Bristol City 1-2 Birmingham City Hull City 2-1 Millwall QPR 1-0 Leeds Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Brentford GOAL! Huddersfield Town 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers (Mounie 90+1). Aaron Mooy crosses from the right, and Steve Mounie scores a dramatic late winner! Surely! If the Terriers can hold on, they\u2019ll end a long losing run that stretches back to November ... when they beat Wolves at Molineux. This is exactly how football works, isn\u2019t it?! GOAL! Cardiff City 0-3 Everton (Calvert-Lewin 90+3). A perfect evening\u2019s work for Everton, who snap their three-match losing run in style. Dominic Calvert-Lewin curls home an injury-time bonus, and they go into the Merseyside derby with an extra bounce in their step. Newcastle\u2019s Fabian Schar is in a rich vein of form right now. A couple of goals recently against Cardiff, an absolute pearler today against Burnley, and now he\u2019s just sprayed a magnificent 70-yard right-to-left crossfield pass towards Matt Ritchie, sending his team-mate into acres down his wing. The resulting cross isn\u2019t converted, Salomon Rondon unable to get an effort on target from a tight angle on the right, Miguel Almiron sending a curler towards the top left over the bar. Schar, though. Wonderful. It remains 2-0 to the hosts. QPR are hanging on for the win that\u2019d break their seven-game losing run. But only just, with Leeds pushing for an equaliser. Amid the same penalty-box scramble, Stuart Dallas should have slotted one into the bottom right from ten yards, while Patrick Bamford sent a close-range header straight at Joe Lumley. Nope! Rangers remain 1-0 up. Burnley aren\u2019t posing much of a threat to Newcastle right now. A free kick\u2019s won in the midfield. Tom Heaton hoicks it long into the Toon area and straight down Martin Dubravka\u2019s throat. They\u2019ve got nothing. So good against Spurs the other day, too. Such a strange game, football. \u201cAlmiron really is a gem of a talent,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cHow in heck did he end up plying his trade in the Dog &amp; Duck League that is MLS without having been snaffled up by a Big Club? Whoever scouted him for the Magpies deserves their bonus (which is probably a 10% off coupon for a replica shirt at a Certain High Street Retailer, but still).\u201d GOAL! Bristol City 1-2 Birmingham City (Diedhiou 66). Famara Diedhiou slams home a Matty Taylor knockdown from close range, and the hosts are back in it at Ashton Gate! GOAL! Cardiff City 0-2 Everton (Sigurdsson 66). A second for Gylfi Sigurdsson, and the Toffees are warming up nicely, just in time for the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon. GOAL! Leicester City 2-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (Propper 66). Davy Propper becomes the first manager to score a goal against Leicester in the Brendan Rodgers era. Not that we usually make note of things like that, but here we are and there it is. Meanwhile, Steve Mounie has just hit the side netting. That\u2019s as near as we\u2019ve come to excitement in the Huddersfield-Wolves match. In lieu of John Smith\u2019s related entertainment ... GOAL! Leicester City 2-0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (Vardy 63). Someone\u2019s happy to see the back of Claude Puel, eh. Cardiff are giving it a good go in their quest for an equaliser against Everton. Kenneth Zohore zipped past Michael Keane, but couldn\u2019t quite tee up Junior Hoilett in the centre. But other than that, we\u2019re in something of a nationwide lull. So here\u2019s a little entertaining whimsy from Vic Neale: \u201cJust having a \u2018idle thoughts of an idle fellow\u2019 moment, knowing perhaps this should be posted to The Knowledge. Which manager has had a full house of shirt colours? Brendan now has the colours: yellow, blue and white stripes, white, red, green and white hoops, and now blue in his managerial collage. What next: Villa/Burnley/West Ham? Wolves, maybe a red and white stripe number: Stoke? Or can I predict, if it all goes \u2018mammary-ascent\u2019, good old Blackpool beckons. Or is tangerine too close to orange? Ho hum.\u201d GOAL! Sheffield Wednesday 2-0 Brentford (Fletcher 48). A second goal for Steven Fletcher, a far-post header converting a right-wing cross. All going very well for Steve Bruce in his honeymoon period as Wednesday manager ... if you ignore the fact he was booked in the first half for yakking on far too much about some garden-variety foul or other. GOAL! QPR 1-0 Leeds United (Freeman 49). A cute flick in the six-yard box from Luke Freeman, converting a low cross from the right. And Leeds\u2019 hopes of regaining top spot in the Championship recede. GOAL! Bristol City 0-2 Birmingham City (Morrison 47). Connor Mahoney, who scored the opener for Blues, floats a free kick into the area, pretty much straight down the middle. Michael Morrison rises highest and plants a simple header into the bottom left. So easy! Back-to-back defeats for the Robins look very much on the cards now. HALF TIME: Newcastle United 2-0 Burnley. Newcastle take their two-goal lead into the break. But they shouldn\u2019t be doing so. Clarets defender James Tarkowski misses an absolute sitter! A free kick\u2019s sent into the Newcastle box. Ben Mee wins one header; Ashley Barnes another. And the ball drops to Tarkowski, three or four yards out, near the left-hand post and faced with an open net, Martin Dubravka having gone walkabout. But he slices an awful effort miles over, having got all his limbs tangled up, an awfully uncomfortable shape. He looked like a treble clef. What a miss! It\u2019s all happening now at St James\u2019 Park! First Burnley claim a penalty, as Gudmundsson tears in from the right and shoots wildly over. But was he impeded by Ritchie, coming in behind. Was there much contact? Replays aren\u2019t conclusive, but you can file that under our old pal Seen Them Given. Then up the other end, new boy Almiron turns on the jets and nearly latches onto a long ball down the left. Heaton in the Burnley goal does extremely well to slide out to the edge of his area, block, then get his arms out of the way as he slides out of the area. He springs up and clears. But after all that, it remains 2-0 to the hosts. GOAL! Newcastle United 2-0 Burnley (Longstaff 38). Matt Ritchie nearly runs the ball out of play down the left. But he manages to hook a cross into the mixer before it crosses the line. It\u2019s a dangerous cross, forcing Ben Mee to eyebrow away from the edge of his six-yard box. But he can only send the ball to the feet of local lad Sean Longstaff, eight yards out. Longstaff takes a touch and belts it into the bottom left. Burnley haven\u2019t got going against Newcastle at all. Simple passes are flying into touch. On the touchline, Sean Dyche swings pensively from a bottle of water. He may be trying to stop himself from slipping into a Pochettinoesque seethe ... or perhaps he\u2019s trying to work himself up, given his players might need a half-time salvo. And hold on ... Premier League Cardiff City 0-1 Everton Huddersfield Town 0-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers Leicester City 1-0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Newcastle United 1-0 Burnley (L) Championship Bristol City 0-1 Birmingham City Hull City 2-1 Millwall QPR 0- 0 Leeds Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 Brentford GOAL! Hull City 2-1 Millwall (Pugh 42). Todd Kane, on loan from Chelsea, works his way down the right. His low cross is trapped by Marc Pugh, another loanee, from Bournemouth; he whips it into the bottom left. That\u2019s a fine finish. GOAL! Bristol City 0-1 Birmingham City (Mahoney 42). A big stroke of luck for Blues, as Connor Mahoney cuts in from the left, shoots, and sees his shot - meant for the top right - deflected into the opposite corner. The keeper had no chance. GOAL! Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 Brentford (Fletcher 42). Barry Bannon releases Steven Fletcher with a long pass down the middle. Fletcher takes a touch and belts a shot into the top right from distance. GOAL! Cardiff City 0-1 Everton (Sigurdsson 41). Morgan Schneiderlin sends Seamus Coleman off down the right. Coleman cuts back for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who forces home from ten yards. GOAL! Newcastle United 1-0 Burnley (Schar 23). Oh this is a screamer! Nothing much seems to be happening at all, Newcastle probing very gently around the Burnley box. The visitors holding firm. And then suddenly, 25 yards out down the inside-right channel, Fabian Schar pings a glorious shot into the top right, off the post and in. That was real postage-stamp stuff, the keeper had no chance whatsoever! GOAL! Hull City 1-1 Millwall (Hutchinson 34). The Lions level it at the KCOM. An awful scramble in the six-yard box, instigated by a low right-wing cross from captain Steve Morison. A fresh-air swipe, then some pinball, and finally the vice-captain Shaun Hutchinson sweeps into the net from close range. Not a whole lot happening at St James\u2019 Park between Newcastle and Burnley, though it\u2019s hardly fair to single this match out. Anyway, two teams who have slowly rebuilt their confidence are taking turns to stroke the ball around in the midfield without taking any early risks. \u201cYesterday Celtic fans had Rodgers as their manager,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cToday they\u2019re blasted with photos of him surrounded by blue shirts that say King Power.\u201d Yes, it\u2019ll have felt like an extremely long day in the east end of Glasgow. Brighton haven\u2019t troubled Leicester much since falling behind. Pascal Gross nearly sends an absurd deflection over Kasper Schmeichel, but otherwise nothing doing. Chris Hughton\u2019s side need to cop on, and quick, because they\u2019ve not won in the Premier League since the turn of the calendar year, and are slipping alarmingly down the division. They\u2019re just three points ahead of 18th-placed Southampton. Though they are doing very well in the FA Cup. A repeat of 1983 is therefore on the cards. That year the Seagulls reached the final - and should have won, oh Gordon! - but also went down. In a world where the luck\u2019s spread evenly over time, they\u2019ll stay up this time round and beat Manchester United in the final. Birmingham striker Che Adams has just sent a rising pearler crashing off the underside of the crossbar at Bristol City. That was a sensational shot; in a world just and true, that would have flown into the top left. But it remains goalless. GOAL! Hull City 1-0 Millwall (Bowen 8). Jarrod Bowen opens the scoring at the KCOM. Markus Henriksen aims a shot towards the bottom right from the edge of the box. Bowen flicks it on, confusing keeper Jordan Archer, and in it goes. GOAL! Leicester City 1-0 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (Gray 10). Demarai Gray is sent away down the inside-right channel by Youri Tielemans. And Gray becomes the first goalscorer of the Brendan Rodgers era, technically, even if the new boss is hands off this evening. No early goals tonight. Cardiff are on the front foot against Everton, Leicester starting brightly against Brighton. And Huddersfield, struggling so badly, go close against Wolves through an early Jonathan Hogg shot. Huddersfield haven\u2019t won a game since November. The vanquished that day? Wolves, naturally. Everyone loves a neat story, so can the Terriers break this long miserable run? The new Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers takes his seat in the stands at the King Power. He\u2019s getting a very warm reception from the fans, beaming, beside himself with glee as he waves back with both hands. Earlier this evening, the former Celtic manager posed for pictures in the dressing room at the King Power. Blue shirts! Blue carpet! The sort of classy wood panelling usually only seen at grand old stadiums built years and years ago with old money! Remind you of anywhere else? Jock Wallace would have appreciated the aesthetic, put it that way. Huddersfield-Wolves team news. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santos names an unchanged side, but it\u2019s his opposite number doing all the legwork here. Terriers boss Jan Siewert makes eight changes. The big news: right-back Demeaco Duhaney and striker Karlan Grant both make their full Premier League debuts, while Jon Gorenc Stankovic makes only his second league start at centre-back. Alex Pritchard, Erik Durm, Terence Kongolo, Philip Billing and Steve Mounie all return. Newcastle-Burnley team news. Rafael Benitez makes just one change as the Toon look for a fourth successive win at St James\u2019 Park. Javier Manquillo replaces DeAndre Yedlin. His opposite number Sean Dyche also limits himself to a single act of tinkering: Johann Berg Gudmundsson comes in for Ashley Westwood. Leicester-Brighton team news. Demarai Gray and Ben Chilwell return for Leicester, replacing Rachid Ghezzal and Christian Fuchs. Former Leicester winger Anthony Knockaert is Brighton\u2019s only change; he comes in for Jurgen Locadia. And watching from the stands, ladies and gentlemen, in his new neighbourhood, Mr Rodgers! Cardiff-Everton team news. Both teams make five changes. Cardiff welcome back Aron Gunnarsson, Junior Hoilett, Bobby Reid, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Kenneth Zohore, while Seamus Coleman, Phil Jagielka, Morgan Schneiderlin, Theo Walcott and Dominic Calvert-Lewin return for Everton.

      "body": "<p>At last Huddersfield have lift-off. Not from the foot of the table, naturally, but a first win in three months and the first points gained since David Wagner\u2019s departure were secured through a stoppage-time goal from Steve Mouni\u00e9, just as a forgettable game seemed to be drifting towards a scoreless draw.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d Jan Siewert said. \u201cThe players deserved it so much because you couldn\u2019t believe how they have suffered in recent weeks, they have been so unlucky but still they work and fight.\u201d</p> <p>The victory takes Huddersfield to 14 points, still an unlikely platform for survival but at least they will now avoid the ignominy of sharing the record low of 11 set by Derby in 2007-08. Plus the Terriers can hold their heads high in the company of Wolves, who may be on the fringes of Europe but have somehow been responsible for donating six points to the Huddersfield cause. \u201cIt was not one of our best performances,\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough and we need to work harder.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, an evening low on quality and incident barely deserved its rousing finale. While Huddersfield have appeared resigned to their fate for some time, Wolves were unusually tepid, hardly managing an attempt at goal let alone a shot on target.</p> <p>The home side were predictably lacking in that respect, too, but when the substitute Aaron Mooy launched one last attack with a cross from the right, Willy Boly\u2019s deflection allowed Karlan Grant to shoot at Rui Patr\u00edcio. The goalkeeper saved with his legs but even though Mouni\u00e9 was on his knees he was still able to sweep the loose ball over the line.</p> <p>After losing all four matches of his tenure to date Siewert had decided it was time for drastic action, with no fewer than eight of the side who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/newcastle-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">lost against Newcastle at the weekend</a> dropping out of the starting lineup. Initially the effect was oddly the same. Huddersfield continued to pass the ball around crisply and confidently in midfield, as they have done all season, without offering anything remotely threatening in the final third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolves were guilty of much the same thing though they squandered a great chance to go ahead when Diogo Jota made his way to the goalline and crossed to Matt Doherty at the far post, who had a clear sight of goal but appeared not to be expecting the ball.</p> <p>Sadly that was just about the highlight of the first half until Alex Pritchard produced a clever cross for Grant to acrobatically slice wide. Huddersfield deserved something from the attack since Jon Stankovic\u2019s spirited attempt to set up a length-of-the-field breakaway from a Wolves corner had been cynically halted on the edge of the visitors\u2019 area by the chasing Ryan Bennett. The referee allowed play to continue while Huddersfield had the ball in a dangerous area, though once Grant had failed to take advantage he booked the Wolves defender.</p> <p>Those mild frissons of excitement apart, the most memorable aspect of a disappointing first half had been the two sets of supporters winding each other up. When the travelling fans chanted about the possibility of Town going down the home fans hit back with a reminder that their last league victory, way back in November, had come at Molineux. \u201cHow crap must you be, we beat you two-nil.\u201d</p> <p>The second half opened more promisingly, with Boly getting in the way of a goal-bound shot from Mouni\u00e9 and Stankovic having a header saved by Patr\u00edcio from the resulting corner. At the other end Jonas L\u00f6ssl came out to save at the feet of Jota after he had been played through by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. A clear chance arrived just before the hour when a Juninho Bacuna cross eluded Terence Kongolo in the area but sat up nicely at the far post for Mouni\u00e9, who could only find the side-netting with a close-range header.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811f4281cb45cb6e0ee6849c51751a59798907cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/811f4281cb45cb6e0ee6849c51751a59798907cd/0_281_4270_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Siewert celebrates Steve Mouni\u00e9\u2019s last-minute winner against Wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jan Siewert celebrates Steve Mouni\u00e9\u2019s last-minute winner against Wolves, which secured the first points Huddersfield have achieved under their new manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Early/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mooy went close when he came on for the last few minutes then Mouni\u00e9 curled a shot inches wide of a post with four minutes remaining. The crowd gasped in real time and groaned anew at the replay on the big screen.

Not from the foot of the table, naturally, but a first win in three months and the first points gained since David Wagner\u2019s departure were secured through a stoppage-time goal from Steve Mouni\u00e9, just as a forgettable game seemed to be drifting towards a scoreless draw. \u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d Jan Siewert said. \u201cThe players deserved it so much because you couldn\u2019t believe how they have suffered in recent weeks, they have been so unlucky but still they work and fight.\u201d The victory takes Huddersfield to 14 points, still an unlikely platform for survival but at least they will now avoid the ignominy of sharing the record low of 11 set by Derby in 2007-08. Plus the Terriers can hold their heads high in the company of Wolves, who may be on the fringes of Europe but have somehow been responsible for donating six points to the Huddersfield cause. \u201cIt was not one of our best performances,\u201d Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough and we need to work harder.\u201d Indeed, an evening low on quality and incident barely deserved its rousing finale. While Huddersfield have appeared resigned to their fate for some time, Wolves were unusually tepid, hardly managing an attempt at goal let alone a shot on target. The home side were predictably lacking in that respect, too, but when the substitute Aaron Mooy launched one last attack with a cross from the right, Willy Boly\u2019s deflection allowed Karlan Grant to shoot at Rui Patr\u00edcio. The goalkeeper saved with his legs but even though Mouni\u00e9 was on his knees he was still able to sweep the loose ball over the line. After losing all four matches of his tenure to date Siewert had decided it was time for drastic action, with no fewer than eight of the side who lost against Newcastle at the weekend dropping out of the starting lineup. Initially the effect was oddly the same. Huddersfield continued to pass the ball around crisply and confidently in midfield, as they have done all season, without offering anything remotely threatening in the final third. Wolves were guilty of much the same thing though they squandered a great chance to go ahead when Diogo Jota made his way to the goalline and crossed to Matt Doherty at the far post, who had a clear sight of goal but appeared not to be expecting the ball. Sadly that was just about the highlight of the first half until Alex Pritchard produced a clever cross for Grant to acrobatically slice wide. Huddersfield deserved something from the attack since Jon Stankovic\u2019s spirited attempt to set up a length-of-the-field breakaway from a Wolves corner had been cynically halted on the edge of the visitors\u2019 area by the chasing Ryan Bennett. The referee allowed play to continue while Huddersfield had the ball in a dangerous area, though once Grant had failed to take advantage he booked the Wolves defender. Those mild frissons of excitement apart, the most memorable aspect of a disappointing first half had been the two sets of supporters winding each other up. When the travelling fans chanted about the possibility of Town going down the home fans hit back with a reminder that their last league victory, way back in November, had come at Molineux. \u201cHow crap must you be, we beat you two-nil.\u201d The second half opened more promisingly, with Boly getting in the way of a goal-bound shot from Mouni\u00e9 and Stankovic having a header saved by Patr\u00edcio from the resulting corner. At the other end Jonas L\u00f6ssl came out to save at the feet of Jota after he had been played through by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. A clear chance arrived just before the hour when a Juninho Bacuna cross eluded Terence Kongolo in the area but sat up nicely at the far post for Mouni\u00e9, who could only find the side-netting with a close-range header. Mooy went close when he came on for the last few minutes then Mouni\u00e9 curled a shot inches wide of a post with four minutes remaining. The crowd gasped in real time and groaned anew at the replay on the big screen. That\u2019s the sort of season it has been at Huddersfield, but there was still time for a last-gasp winner. \u201cI might have one or two beers now,\u201d Siewert said. \u201cBut then it\u2019s back to working and fighting.\u201d",

Everton travelled to south Wales on the back of a 17-day break from their last match, a defeat to Watford, but did not showcase any noticeable strides made on the training ground until four minutes before the interval. It had the whiff of a simple training-ground move, from an incisive pass by Morgan Schneiderlin \u2013 impressive on his first start since October and one of five changes made by Silva \u2013 to slip in S\u00e9amus Coleman down the right flank, to Sigurdsson\u2019s sweeping finish beyond Neil Etheridge in the Cardiff goal.</p> <p>Strangled by expectation in recent weeks, Everton found some refreshing freedom after Sigurdsson\u2019s opener and, when Silva introduced Bernard on the hour mark, they quickly set about doubling their lead.</p> <p>Idrissa Gueye, an authoritative figure again in midfield, fed the Brazilian, who drove down the left flank with purpose, forcing Etheridge to palm away.

But there were a few encouraging signs here, namely the grace with which Sigurdsson performed throughout. Is the tide turning? \u201cWe hope, we hope,\u201d said Silva. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important game, it was important that we won the game to get that confidence that we need as a team. \u201cIt will be a different game at home with our fans [against Liverpool] and we expect a fantastic atmosphere in our stadium to push us on. One of the problems we have had this season was missing some consistency. We had two or three months very, very good and then after some bad results we are losing confidence. We have been up and down many times and it was an important win with a clean sheet.\u201d Sigurdsson left the field to a standing ovation from the away supporters, though perhaps a little disappointed at failing to register the perfect hat-trick after hitting sweet strikes with his left and right feet. In doing so, he became the leading Icelandic goalscorer in Premier League history, surpassing Eidur Gudjohnsen\u2019s tally of 55. \u201cYou are seeing a different Gylfi Sigurdsson this season \u2013 he deserved his goals,\u201d Silva added. \u201cI\u2019m sure next match we will see Gylfi playing with more confidence, apart from his qualities he is always giving everything to the team. This season we have given him a different role.\u201d Cardiff remain one place and one point above the relegation zone. Their starting lineup consisted of 11 footballers who played in the second tier last season and the side badly lacked bite. \u201cWe had a great opportunity to take the lead and then we made elementary mistakes to concede the goals,\u201d said Neil Warnock. \u201cI know he\u2019s cost \u00a350m but Sigurdsson does not need more than one chance to score, whereas we huffed and puffed around goal. That is the difference, isn\u2019t it? As disappointing as it was, we are not going to throw the towel in now.\u201d Silva said victory here was non-negotiable after they had lost eight of their previous 11 league games. Everton travelled to south Wales on the back of a 17-day break from their last match, a defeat to Watford, but did not showcase any noticeable strides made on the training ground until four minutes before the interval. It had the whiff of a simple training-ground move, from an incisive pass by Morgan Schneiderlin \u2013 impressive on his first start since October and one of five changes made by Silva \u2013 to slip in S\u00e9amus Coleman down the right flank, to Sigurdsson\u2019s sweeping finish beyond Neil Etheridge in the Cardiff goal. Strangled by expectation in recent weeks, Everton found some refreshing freedom after Sigurdsson\u2019s opener and, when Silva introduced Bernard on the hour mark, they quickly set about doubling their lead. Idrissa Gueye, an authoritative figure again in midfield, fed the Brazilian, who drove down the left flank with purpose, forcing Etheridge to palm away. The ball fell at the feet of Sigurdsson, who lashed the ball home with his left foot. By that point, Cardiff supporters had seen enough, though Everton were not finished, with Calvert-Lewin striking as any clouds hovering over Silva evaporated.",

      "body": "<p>For some middle and high schoolers, wearing a Maga hat has become not only a sign of their political allegiance, but an act of rebellion. There are many<a href=\"https://wcyb.com/news/local/students-at-tennessee-school-told-to-take-off-trump-gear\"> local news</a> reports about children being asked to remove them, or claiming they\u2019ve been abused for wearing one. Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle.</p> <p>Maddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example. She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so she\u2019s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it.</p> <p>School officials say they simply don\u2019t allow certain logos as part of the dress code, but Mueller has responded saying, \u201cto my knowledge, Trump is not a logo. It\u2019s a last name. It\u2019s just our president.</p> <p>\u201cHow is being a patriot in trying to show pride in your country \u2013 how is that inappropriate?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17dlcExZQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HT17dlcExZQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Soon after the story broke, Mueller made an appearance on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, claiming that the school was discriminating against her because she \u201cchecked today\u201d and saw four Hillary Clinton T-shirts, a Bernie Sanders hat, an Obama shirt and seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats. Ingraham asked Mueller if these items were worn \u201cin classrooms\u201d and she said yes.</p> <p>Ingraham said she had no reason to question Mueller\u2019s claim that she saw four students in Clinton hats, two years after the presidential election, or that she had checked to make sure they were still wearing them in class. She did call her \u201cedgy\u201d and \u201cbrave\u201d.</p> <p>In January, students from Covington Catholic high school on a trip to Washington made headlines after they were filmed apparently taunting a group of indigenous Americans. They were widely criticised by most of the media, but Fox and Friends painted them<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpSM1ItOxw\"> as victims of cruel online bullying</a> simply because they displayed their political beliefs. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/news/administration/396752-trump-sends-signed-hat-to-teen-who-had-maga-hat-taken-from-him\">Before that, a Texas 16-year-old</a> tweeted about having his hat stolen and a drink thrown at him, Trump himself sent over a Maga hat.</p> <p>Kelly Avants, the chief communication officer for the Clovis Unified school district, told a CBS affiliate that the school\u2019s dress code \u201cis for kids to feel safe at school and free of distractions so they can focus on learning\u201d.</p> <p>The district\u2019s dress code is available online and states that no hats or caps may be worn inside classrooms and offices. It also bans many logos and brands, and specifically bans clothing or apparel that can be worn for the purpose of \u201charassing, threatening, or intimidating others\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For some middle and high schoolers, wearing a Maga hat has become not only a sign of their political allegiance, but an act of rebellion. There are many local news reports about children being asked to remove them, or claiming they\u2019ve been abused for wearing one. Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle. Maddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example. She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so she\u2019s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it. School officials say they simply don\u2019t allow certain logos as part of the dress code, but Mueller has responded saying, \u201cto my knowledge, Trump is not a logo. It\u2019s a last name. It\u2019s just our president. \u201cHow is being a patriot in trying to show pride in your country \u2013 how is that inappropriate?\u201d Soon after the story broke, Mueller made an appearance on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, claiming that the school was discriminating against her because she \u201cchecked today\u201d and saw four Hillary Clinton T-shirts, a Bernie Sanders hat, an Obama shirt and seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats. Ingraham asked Mueller if these items were worn \u201cin classrooms\u201d and she said yes. Ingraham said she had no reason to question Mueller\u2019s claim that she saw four students in Clinton hats, two years after the presidential election, or that she had checked to make sure they were still wearing them in class. She did call her \u201cedgy\u201d and \u201cbrave\u201d. In January, students from Covington Catholic high school on a trip to Washington made headlines after they were filmed apparently taunting a group of indigenous Americans. They were widely criticised by most of the media, but Fox and Friends painted them as victims of cruel online bullying simply because they displayed their political beliefs. Before that, a Texas 16-year-old tweeted about having his hat stolen and a drink thrown at him, Trump himself sent over a Maga hat. Kelly Avants, the chief communication officer for the Clovis Unified school district, told a CBS affiliate that the school\u2019s dress code \u201cis for kids to feel safe at school and free of distractions so they can focus on learning\u201d. The district\u2019s dress code is available online and states that no hats or caps may be worn inside classrooms and offices. It also bans many logos and brands, and specifically bans clothing or apparel that can be worn for the purpose of \u201charassing, threatening, or intimidating others\u201d.",

The news that Cardinal George Pell \u2013 who until the weekend was in charge of the Holy See\u2019s finances and of rooting out corruption at the heart of the church \u2013 had been found guilty on five charges of sexual abuse was painful and shocking, said the Vatican. But survivors and activists were enraged at the church\u2019s decision not to strip Pell of his position as a cardinal, at least until the judicial process was exhausted. Pell, 77, has said he will appeal against the conviction, for which he will be sentenced on Wednesday. He is expected to face a prison term. The Vatican said the disgraced prelate had \u201creiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree\u201d. In the meantime, a ban on Pell exercising ministry or having contact with minors would remain in place. The cardinal\u2019s five-year term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday, and Pope Francis \u2013 who previously praised Pell for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse \u2013 removed him from his inner council of advisers in December. The outcome of the trial, which was subject to a gagging order until this week, was \u201cpainful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia,\u201d said Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican press spokesman. He added: \u201cWhile waiting for the final judgment, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the church is a safe house for everyone, especially for children and the most vulnerable.\u201d The father of one of the boys assaulted by Pell said the cardinal had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d. The man\u2019s son died of a heroin overdose 17 years after being molested by Pell as a 13-year-old chorister at Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.

Although the outcome of the trial was already known by senior figures at the Vatican, the verdict is likely to reverberate across the 1.2 billion-strong global church.

      "bodyText": "A federal appeals court rejected the justice department\u2019s second effort to undo AT&amp;T\u2019s $80bn purchase of Time Warner on Tuesday \u2013 dealing a probably decisive blow to opponents of the deal, including Donald Trump. In its ruling the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit unanimously affirmed a lower court ruling last June that found the 2018 deal was unlikely to harm competition. A three-judge panel found the trial court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion\u201d in approving AT&amp;T\u2019s acquisition of the entertainment giant, saying they found the government\u2019s argument that the judge in case had made clear errors was \u201cunpersuasive\u201d. David McAtee, AT&amp;T\u2019s general counsel, said \u201cthe merger of these innovative companies has already yielded significant consumer benefits, and it will continue to do so for years to come.\u201d He added: \u201cWe trust that today\u2019s unanimous decision from the DC circuit will end this litigation.\u201d The ruling will stand as one of the most significant losses for the justice department\u2019s antitrust division in a generation. The lawsuit was the first major antitrust action under the Trump administration \u2013 an action that was widely believed to be promoted behind the scenes by the president himself, who had made it a campaign pledge to block the deal and has made no secret of his antipathy for Time Warner-owned CNN. Four months before the justice department action, in July 2018, Trump had tweeted a meme of a WWE wrestling match with the president smacking down a figure with the CNN logo as its head. The video, which drew widespread condemnation as a presidential threat to press freedoms, came with the hashtags: #FraudNewsCNN #FNN. The plaintiff in the case, AT&amp;T, has consistently raised questions over whether the department\u2019s suit was politically motivated, while the justice department denied that politics played any part in its decision to litigate. Still, the case against the merger was highly unusual since it marked the first time in four decades that the government had litigated a \u201cvertical\u201d merger \u2013 one that combined two companies that didn\u2019t compete head-to-head and thus could not be accused of creating a monopolistic trading environment. Instead, the government argued that an AT&amp;T and Time Warner combination would have the power to force higher pay-TV prices on consumers. But at trial last year, the government struggled to make its case before the US district judge Richard Leon. According to transcripts obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Judge Leon criticized justice department lawyers for introducing irrelevant or repetitive points. \u201cDon\u2019t wear out your welcome,\u201d Leon said at one point over the six-week trial. In appealing against the ruling, the justice department argued that Judge Leon ignored \u201cfundamental principles of economics and common sense\u201d. In its ruling on Tuesday, the appeals court partially sided with the government, saying Judge Leon had \u201cmade some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore\u201d. But the panel said none of those errors were sufficient to undermine his decision to approve the deal.",

A crack along part of the Brunt ice shelf in Antarctica first appeared in October 2016, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). The crack is spreading to the east. This rift, known as the Halloween crack, is set to intersect with another fissure that was apparently stable for the past 35 years but is now accelerating north at a rate of around 2.5 miles a year. Once these two rifts meet, which could happen within weeks, an iceberg of at least 660sq miles is set to be loosened. This process, also known as calving, occurs naturally with ice shelves but \u201crecent changes are unfamiliar in this area\u201d and could lead to the destabilization of the Brunt ice shelf, Nasa warned. \u201cThe likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible,\u201d said Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with Nasa and the University of Maryland Baltimore County. While the anticipated iceberg is large by most measures, it is dwarfed by other recent Antarctic breakaways. In July 2017, one of the largest ever icebergs calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. At 2,200sq miles it was nearly twice the size of the US state of Delaware. The long-term future of Antarctic ice shelves will have a major influence on sea level rise around the world.

Notwithstanding the jubilant response of supporters of a People\u2019s Vote to Labour\u2019s shift this week, Corbyn is unlikely to be making tub-thumping speeches calling on voters to stop Brexit any time soon.

But survivors and activists are enraged at the church\u2019s decision not to strip Pell of his position as a cardinal, at least until the judicial process is exhausted. The Vatican says a ban on Pell exercising ministry or having contact with minors will remain in place.</p> <p>As Melissa Davey writes: \u201cMonths of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted.

Guardian Australia\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, who attended court every day during the trial, recounts the jury selection: \u201cNine men and five women were sworn in, among them a church pastor, a mathematician, a chef and a schoolteacher\u201d; Pell\u2019s demeanour: \u201cmoving slowly with the assistance of a cane because of an injured knee\u201d; what he ate for lunch: \u201cpickle sandwiches, sausage rolls and milkshakes\u201d; and the contrasting styles of the defence barrister, Robert Richter, who closed by warning jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake,\u201d and the crown prosecutor, Mark Gibson.

For example, in the 25 business days preceding the appointment \u2026 I had to attend 23 separate medical appointments with/for various family members. \u201cI requested a follow-up appointment to resolve this.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 27 February. Top stories The Vatican will await Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appeal before taking action. The news that Pell \u2013 who was in charge of the Holy See\u2019s finances and rooting out corruption at the heart of the church \u2013 had been found guilty on five charges of sexual abuse was \u201cpainful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia\u201d, said a Vatican press spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti. But survivors and activists are enraged at the church\u2019s decision not to strip Pell of his position as a cardinal, at least until the judicial process is exhausted. The Vatican says a ban on Pell exercising ministry or having contact with minors will remain in place. As Melissa Davey writes: \u201cMonths of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted. But the story is far from over.\u201d She can finally reveal what it was like inside the courtroom. Guardian Australia\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief, who attended court every day during the trial, recounts the jury selection: \u201cNine men and five women were sworn in, among them a church pastor, a mathematician, a chef and a schoolteacher\u201d; Pell\u2019s demeanour: \u201cmoving slowly with the assistance of a cane because of an injured knee\u201d; what he ate for lunch: \u201cpickle sandwiches, sausage rolls and milkshakes\u201d; and the contrasting styles of the defence barrister, Robert Richter, who closed by warning jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake,\u201d and the crown prosecutor, Mark Gibson. Here, in case you missed it, is David Marr on Pell\u2019s conviction. Scott Morrison is heading to Tasmania to support his \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d plan. As part of this week\u2019s attempted climate policy pivot, his government will flag a willingness to use its controversial taxpayer underwriting program for new power generation projects to boost the proposal, even though the project did not make a submission asking for support through that mechanism. A feasibility study for the Tasmanian interconnector proposal now being supported by the government makes it clear the benefits are greater \u201cwhen approximately 7,000MW of the national electricity market\u2019s present coal-fired generation capacity retires\u201d. The government\u2019s contentious ParentsNext welfare program is having \u201cdevastating\u201d impacts on participants, a Senate inquiry has been told. In one submission, the father of two children with autism said he had been handed a \u201cgeneric\u201d plan, which required him to take his daughter to a story-time session. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s diagnosis means this is poorly suited to her,\u201d he said. \u201cI explained and was ignored when I detailed the time commitments I already have. For example, in the 25 business days preceding the appointment \u2026 I had to attend 23 separate medical appointments with/for various family members. \u201cI requested a follow-up appointment to resolve this. Whilst waiting the week for my return interview, my payment was cut for noncompliance with the plan.\u201d World Theresa May has promised MPs the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit and possibly delay the departure date, while repeatedly declining to say whether or not she and the government would support such moves. In a significant first concession that Brexit could take place after 29 March, following months of insistence the deadline could not be shifted, May sought to appease restive Conservative backbenchers, but prompted concern from pro-Brexit MPs. Michael Cohen, longtime lawyer and aide to Donald Trump, is set to deliver explosive testimony to Congress and could detail how Trump broke the law while in office, according to US media reports. In one of the more awkward double bookings in diplomatic history, the Hanoi hotel meant to serve as the US press corps headquarters was also reserved by Kim Jong-un. Such cohabitation was never going to work for the North Korean security apparatus, which is not accustomed to dealing with inquisitive journalists. Meanwhile, Dutch customs officials at the port of Rotterdam have seized 90,000 bottles of vodka believed to have been destined for the North Korean leader and his army chiefs. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is under pressure to reject the resignation of his foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who had announced his departure on Monday with a condemnation of what he described as the \u201cdeadly poison\u201d of infighting among the country\u2019s parties and factions. Opinion and analysis A letter from Emma Thompson makes clear her reasons for quitting the film Luck after the disgraced executive John Lasseter was announced as the new head of Skydance Media, the production company behind the film. \u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year,\u201d Thomson wrote in a letter shared with the LA Times. \u201cBut I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d An old green notebook believed to contain poetry written by the notorious outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow has been put up for auction by Barrow\u2019s nephew. Parker was known to have written poetry. Jeff Guinn\u2019s biography of the outlaws, Go Down Together, recounts how she wrote verses \u2013 including The Story of Suicide Sal, about a naive country girl who falls for a man who lures her into crime \u2013 while in prison. But the notebook, which was among a collection of items belonging to Barrow\u2019s older sister Nell May Barrow and put up for auction by her son, reveals that Clyde Barrow also tried his hand as a poet. Sport \u201cWhen just last month Vic Marks used a few broad brushstrokes to describe \u2018a young batsman who commands attention \u2026 a left-hander who has a bit of swagger and likes to hit the ball\u2019, it was the first time the play of Shimron Hetmyer had been described for the Guardian reader,\u201d writes Andy Ball. \u201cWatching and reading about England\u2019s tour of the West Indies the picture of a 22-year-old of considerable style and promise has continued to fill out, as Hetmyer has blossomed into everyone\u2019s new favourite batsman.\u201d The former Sri Lanka opening bat and captain Sanath Jayasuriya has been banned from all cricket activities for two years after admitting breaching two counts of the International Cricket Council\u2019s anti-corruption code. Thinking time: Courts can\u2019t keep secrets in the internet age The lawyer and Guardian writer Richard Ackland writes that \u201cthe suppression order on the George Pell trial, which prevented media from reporting that the Catholic church\u2019s third most senior member had been found guilty of child sexual assault, left a pretty big gap in the community\u2019s knowledge of a serious event in the affairs of the nation\u201d. \u201cNow that we know there will be no second trial, the suppression order remaining in place against reporting the verdict on the first trial looks, to my mind and in this age of the ubiquitous internet, rather nonsensical. While the rest of the world has moved on and embraced the internet and its copious supply of information, the courts are stuck in another place. Can the jury system exist alongside an internet where information flows freely? Can judges admit that the internet exists? Do injunctions have a sensible place in the internet age? The idea that the administration of justice should take precedence over society\u2019s right to know is an idea whose time has run out.\u201d Media roundup Scott Morrison will announce a royal commission into the treatment of people with disabilities, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Senior government sources have confirmed that Ita Buttrose will lead the ABC, with an announcement likely this week, according to the Australian. The Washington Post reveals that the US military blocked Russian troll factory the Internet Research Agency \u2013 which is underwritten by an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin \u2013 from the internet during the 2018 midterms. Coming up Labor will announce a $3.2m fund to help country kids go to university amid new figures that show a vast disparity between city and regional university entrants rates. Labor and the Greens politicians are expected to accept a change.org petition at the ParentsNext Senate Inquiry in Melbourne today calling for the welfare program to be made voluntary.

The prime minister has not yet said how she or the government would vote on a no deal motion \u2013 that is irresponsible, as no deal would be deeply damaging for manufacturing, medicine supplies and food prices.

The government agreed to publish not the actual paper, but a summary of its contents, and it reads as if it has been drafted so as not to sound too shocking.</p> \n  <p>Still, even the civil service language cannot disguise the fact that it is saying some of the no-deal consequences would be profound. Here are some highlights.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The report says the flow of goods through Dover would be \u201cvery significantly reduced for months\u201d under a no-deal Brexit.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In particular, third country rules applied by the EU, including France, would mean that no goods are allowed to leave the port until they have provided the correct paperwork and have been customs cleared (including any necessary checks at the port, for example on products of animal origin). More significantly, member states would hold any goods which are not correctly customs cleared. This would hold up all goods where trades are not prepared, expected to be a significant proportion in the early period after exit day. The government\u2019s worst case planning assumption is that, as a result of French checks and lack of businesses readiness, the flow of goods through the short channel crossings (Dover and Eurotunnel) could be very significantly reduced for months. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says food prices would probably increase.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the time of year we will be leaving the EU, the UK is particularly reliant on the short channel crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario. As of February 2019, many businesses in the food supply industry are unprepared for a no deal scenario. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says there is \u201clittle evidence\u201d that businesses are ready for a no-deal Brexit, and that small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite communications from the government, there is little evidence that businesses are preparing in earnest for a no deal scenario, and evidence indicates that readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular is low. For example, without an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number, businesses would not be able to complete the necessary customs documentation for goods they are importing. As an EORI number registration is one of the most basic and straightforward parts of the process most businesses would need to undertake to prepare for no deal, this is assumed to be a generous indicator of overall readiness. As of February 2019 there had only been around 40,000 registrations for an EORI number, against an estimate of around 240,000 EU-only trading businesses. There is capacity to sign up 11,000 businesses per day, and so this position could change rapidly with behaviour change from businesses. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says extra customs checks alone could cost business \u00a313bn a year under a no-deal Brexit.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In a no-deal scenario, both the UK and EU would need to apply customs and excise rules and VAT to goods moving between the UK and EU, as they are currently applied to goods traded in the rest of the world. Every consignment would require a customs declaration, and so around 240,000 UK businesses that currently only trade with the EU would need to interact with customs processes for the first time, should they continue to trade with the EU. HMRC has estimated that the administrative burden on businesses from customs declarations alone, on current (2016) UK-EU trade in goods could be around \u00a313bn pa (not accounting for any behavioural change).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says it is impossible to predict the impact of new tariffs on businesses.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Industries would need to respond to the application of EU tariffs. These would vary by sector. While for some sectors (such as life sciences or electronics) the effect of any tariffs would be minor, other sectors would be more affected. For example, the EU would introduce tariffs of around 70% on beef and 45% on lamb exports, and 10% on finished automotive vehicles. This would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border. Given the unprecedented nature of the sort of economy-wide adjustment that would be required in a no-deal scenario, it is impossible to accurately predict the ability of businesses to adapt.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says businesses in Northern Ireland could go bust.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In a no-deal scenario there is an expectation of disruption to closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland. There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure, and/or relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment. Northern Ireland is particularly vulnerable given its high proportion of, and reliance upon SMEs (75% of all private sector employment) and the number of businesses who trade directly with Ireland (Northern Ireland\u2019s largest international export market). The agri-food sector is a disproportionately large part of Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and located predominantly in border/rural areas. It is particularly vulnerable given its reliance on cross-border supply chains in the production stage and in finished products.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It confirms that some EU trade deals would not be able to carry over after Brexit.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A number of the most critical international agreements have been signed and are on track to come into force on exit day, including on aviation and civil nuclear cooperation and safeguarding. Those that are not may not be in force on exit day. If contingency options were not in place, there would be a gap in coverage for some international agreements, the impact of which would vary depending on the nature and scale of the agreement.</p> \n   <p>Around 40 of these agreements are trade agreements. To date, the government has signed trade agreements with Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, members of the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) Economic Partnership Agreement, Israel and the Palestinian Authority ... if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, some agreements will not be concluded in time and therefore will not be in place for exit day. Agreements which will clearly not be in place for exit day are Andorra, Japan, Turkey, and San Marino; the government has set out further details in published guidance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says Britons travelling to the EU could be subject to full Schengen checks.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the absence of an alternative agreement, UK citizens would be treated as third country nationals by member states, and potentially be subject to full Schengen checks. This would mean they would no longer be able to use e-gates, and checks to enter EU member states could take longer than they currently do. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> \n  <p>My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T18:05:35.691Z\">at 6.05pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c75740fe4b007ceb38e8877\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T17:16:14.556Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Government publishes its assessment of impact of no-deal Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Brexit department has just published the government\u2019s assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit.

No one seriously thinks May wants to stop Brexit altogether. Some MPs would like to do this, but they don\u2019t include the leaders of either of the main parties. </p> \n  <p>Elsewhere in his interview Rees-Mogg sounded much less perturbed by May\u2019s announcement. At another point he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no evidence that a new deal can be agreed that would be acceptable to parliament in that period [between 29 March, the current Brexit date, and 30 June, the latest date for Brexit implied by May\u2019s statement]. So the cliff edge, if that is the term people want to use, has merely been moved back. And there is no willingness to delay beyond the new European parliament forming.

How long is the delay that we are contemplating? The prime minister seems to be giving us a date for a new cliff edge at the end of June, but is not the danger that we will merely continue the present pantomime performance through the next three months, and that the public will be dismayed as we approach that date and find that there is similar chaos about where we are going?</p> \n   <p>May I suggest that we contemplate a much calmer delay, that we have indicative votes following debates in this House, to see where a consensus or majority lies, and then that we prepare our position for the much more important long-term negotiations that have to take place on the eventual settlement?

A three-month extension of article 50 to the end of June, coupled with no European elections in the UK in May, would make it impossible for the UK to continue as a member state, according to EU sources.

But not for the first time, predictions about May being forced to commit have turned out to be misplaced. Her capacity for equivocation is extraordinary.</p> \n  <p>I summarised the main announcements in her statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/26/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-amid-reports-she-is-about-to-announce-u-turn-on-giving-mps-potential-vote-to-extend-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-5c753f0ae4b0405a56b476c7#block-5c753f0ae4b0405a56b476c7\">at 2.02pm</a>. But here are some thoughts on the political consequences.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) An extension of article 50 has, within the space of a week, gone from something that the government would scarcely discuss in public to a firm probability. </strong>May has announced a mechanism for how it might happen. And if, as the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler argues (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/26/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-amid-reports-she-is-about-to-announce-u-turn-on-giving-mps-potential-vote-to-extend-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-5c752a37e4b0bf6ca5d8387e#block-5c752a37e4b0bf6ca5d8387e\">12.04pm)</a>, May was hoping to use \u201cthree-way Brexit blackmail\u201d to encourage Brexiters, Labour and the EU to compromise ahead of the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, by creating a mechanism for an article 50 extension she has weakened the leverage that might help get her deal through parliament \u2013 making extension even more likely.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) As usual, May is treating EU thinking as an afterthought.</strong> May wants to let MPs vote for a short, one-off article 50 extension if her deal gets voted down. (Quite whether, in practice, she would be able to stop parliament pushing for a second extension is another matter.) But EU leaders have been clear that they would support either a short extension to allow MPs to pass the legislation needed to facilitate Brexit, or a long extension needed to allow the UK to make up its mind. A short extension to allow the UK to dither for three more months holds little attraction for them, and it is not obvious that that they would even agree. (For article 50 to be extended, the EU27 would have to support this unanimously.)</p> \n  <p><strong>3) May seems to have done enough to avert government resignations.</strong> MPs are still mulling over what she said, but the early indications are that she has done enough to satisfy those Tories who were planning to resign from government to back the Cooper amendment. Indeed, it is not even certain at this point whether the Cooper amendment will still be put to a vote.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carldinnen/status/1100406454530568192\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW; 2 of the ministers who had been threatening to resign tell me they will not now do so. <br>One says Mrs May has done enough \u201cFor the moment.\u201d</p>\u2014 Carl Dinnen (@carldinnen) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carldinnen/status/1100406454530568192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>4) Cleverly, May has also managed to appease the remainers without unduly provoking the ERG leavers.</strong> During her statement, it was striking how little criticism she received from Tory Brexiters, who until recently would have viewed any talk of an article 50 extension as a betrayal. It may just be that they are holding their fire. But equally it may be that, as Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested in an interview earlier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/26/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-amid-reports-she-is-about-to-announce-u-turn-on-giving-mps-potential-vote-to-extend-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-5c753e1de4b0405a56b476be#block-5c753e1de4b0405a56b476be\">1.27pm)</a>, they have concluded that May has not removed no deal as a prospect, but just delayed the point at which it might happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) But not so cleverly, May has just perpetuated the uncertainty. </strong>May won\u2019t even commit the government to whipping its MPs to vote for an article 50 extension if her deal fails and, as my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> points out (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/26/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-chairs-cabinet-amid-reports-she-is-about-to-announce-u-turn-on-giving-mps-potential-vote-to-extend-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-5c754e6be4b0bf6ca5d83a6c#block-5c754e6be4b0bf6ca5d83a6c\">2.37pm)</a>, this does not make life any easier for businesses trying to work out how seriously they need to take the risk of no deal.

I know too that members across the house are deeply concerned by the effect of the current uncertainty on businesses.</p> \n   <p>So today I want to reassure the house by making three further commitments.</p> \n   <p>First, we will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest.</p> \n   <p>Second, if the government has not won a meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March then it will \u2013 in addition to its obligations to table a neutral, amendable motion under section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act \u2013 table a motion to be voted on by Wednesday 13 March at the latest, asking this house if it supports leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for a future relationship on 29 March.</p> \n   <p>So the United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this house for that outcome.</p> \n   <p>Third, if the house, having rejected leaving with the deal negotiated with the EU, then rejects leaving on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement and future framework, the government will, on 14 March, bring forward a motion on whether parliament wants to seek a short limited extension to article 50 \u2013 and if the house votes for an extension, seek to agree that extension approved by the house with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.</p> \n   <p>These commitments all fit the timescale set out in the private member\u2019s bill in the name of [Yvette Cooper].</p> \n   <p>They are commitments I am making as prime minister and I will stick by them, as I have previous commitments to make statements and table amendable motions by specific dates.</p> \n   <p>Let me be clear, I do not want to see article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.</p> \n   <p>An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections. What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now? And the house should be clear that a short extension \u2013 not beyond the end of June \u2013 would almost certainly have to be a one-off. If we had not taken part in the European parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff-edge in a few months\u2019 time. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T13:09:48.647Z\">at 1.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c7537e4e4b0405a56b47651\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T12:59:53.891Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Corbyn says Labour accepts the result of the referendum.

In most referendums in the UK there has been no turnout threshold, although, as Farage pointed out, in the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution, there was a turnout threshold saying that the vote would only be valid if 40% of all registered voters, as well as a majority, voted yes.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s latest events: A no-deal Brexit is likely to have profound consequences for the UK, according to a government assessment. The report says food prices would probably increase, extra customs checks could cost business \u00a313bn a year and there is little evidence firms are ready for the changeover, among other dire warnings. A senior EU diplomat said the UK would be facing \u201cguaranteed no deal\u201d if MPs fail to back a Brexit agreement at the end of a three-month extension period. EU officials think 1 July is the final day the UK could remain an EU member state without taking part in European elections. Jeremy Corbyn faced some opposition to his plan to back a second referendum. According to a report, some shadow cabinet members were upset at the politics pf the move \u2013 and at having first heard about it via media reports. And here\u2019s a summary of Theresa May\u2019s statement this afternoon. We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now \u2013 thanks for reading and for all the comments. For more details on the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit imapct analysis, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has the full story: The DUP\u2019s leader and deputy leader, Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds, met the prime minister this afternoon in May\u2019s House of Commons office. Afterwards, Foster said: We support a sensible deal and a managed exit from the European Union. Parliament has mandated the prime minister to seek a replacement of the backstop. At that time, the prime minister committed to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. This position commanded a clear majority in parliament. Mrs May should deliver on those commitments. Experience in Northern Ireland has shown that extending deadlines does nothing to encourage a deal. A no-deal outcome can be avoided and it can be agreed long before 29 March. The European Union have it in their hands to avoid such an outcome. They know exactly what is required to achieve a deal which parliament can support. It\u2019s time for Dublin and Brussels to be in a deal-making mode. As Leslie mentioned, Labour has said it will back moves to set up a second referendum if it cannot force Theresa May to adandon her deal and adopt its Brexit stance this week. But the party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is facing problems of his own on that front: My colleagues, Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot, have the full story: And Politics Home has this: ... At the Shadow Cabinet meeting, normally-loyal frontbenchers lined up to attack the plan. Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon complained about the fact that the whole Shadow Cabinet had not been involved in the decision and added: \u201cWhy did we hear about it in the media?\u201d Labour chairman Ian Lavery, a long-standing opponent of a second referendum, said the new policy was \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d, while Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett also criticised the move. Leave-backing Labour MPs have already demanded that Mr Corbyn give his troops a free vote on any second referendum amendment. Meanwhile, Shadow Cabinet members also lined up to attack deputy leader Tom Watson for calling on Labour MPs to notify him if they make complaints anout anti-semitism or bullying by party members. Diane Abbott and Emily Thornberry were among those who criticised the move, saying he should not be setting up \u201ca shadow complaints process\u201d. In response, Mr Watson said he was trying to hold the party together following the resignations of nine Labour MPs in the past week. You can read the full article here. Speaking of the Independent Group, its MPs have tabled a cross-party amendment to pave the way for a second EU referendum \u2013 with the support of MPs in the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru. The amendment, for debate in the Commons on Wednesday, would instruct the prime minister to table a motion for debate and decision before 8 March, setting out the steps necessary for preparing a public vote on whether to leave the EU on terms agreed by parliament or remain a member. Chris Leslie, of TIG, has said: At this eleventh hour, it\u2019s vital that preparations take place for a People\u2019s Vote. This cross-party amendment would require the prime minister to take the steps needed now so the public could take control and break through the Brexit gridlock. There is no more time to waste. With Labour now signalling it may support a confirmatory referendum in the weeks ahead, there is no reason to hold back on vital measures to pave the way. If the Labour leadership support this amendment, we could make real progress on a People\u2019s Vote. Now is the time to put the national interest first. Parliament must act now. Chuka Umunna, who now sits in parliament with the Independent Group of MPs, says the government\u2019s assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit demonstrate that it would \u201cbe a catastrophe\u201d. These documents, which the Independent Group of MPs have forced this government to publish, paint a disastrous picture of the catastrophe which would befall our country if there is a no-deal Brexit. In light of what she knows, it is utterly irresponsible for the prime minister to keep a no-deal Brexit on the table, given the extreme damage it will do. These papers set out how food prices will rise, we may see panic buying, there will be severe disruption at the border, and jobs and livelihoods would immediately be put at risk. Today, she told the House of Commons she is listening but MPs have passed a motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit and yet she refuses to request an extension of the Article 50 process in order to stop no-deal happening. The prime minister is refusing to face down the hard-right extremists in her own party and put the national interest first. This is yet more evidence of our broken politics. We have no choice but to change it. The Labour MP, Chris Williamson, faces a dressing down from party officials after he helped to arrange a screening in parliament of a film defending Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party over comments about antisemitism. A party spokeswoman said it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for the Derby North MP to have booked a room in parliament next Monday for a screening of the film, titled Witch Hunt. Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, and the general secretary, Jennie Formby, are set to contact Williamson to stress their displeasure at his actions, and to ensure he cancels the booking. Witch Hunt takes a sceptical look at claims that Labour has experienced a problem with some antisemitic behaviour under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, focusing particularly on the case of Walker, who has been suspended from the party for more than two years. Walker was initially suspended after she wrote about Jewish people as \u201cfinanciers of the sugar and slave trade\u201d, but was then reinstated. She was suspended again in September 2016 after saying she had not found a definition of antisemitism she could work with, and questioning why Holocaust Memorial Day was not more wide-ranging. She is reportedly facing a party hearing next month. The Labour spokeswoman said: It\u2019s completely inappropriate to book a room for an event about an individual who is suspended from the party and subject to ongoing disciplinary procedures. This falls below the standards we expect of MPs. Responding to the prime minister\u2019s statement earlier this afternoon, the Labour MP Yvette Cooper has said: Parliament has forced the prime minister to agree to votes which can prevent a damaging and chaotic no deal \u2013 this is extremely important. As a result of our cross-party arguments and Bill, the prime minister today accepted most of the provisions of the Bill to provide for votes that can avert no deal on 29 March and extend Article 50 if there is no agreement in place. We have laid a new cross-party amendment to pin down and confirm the commitment made by the prime minister today to hold these votes and ensure that we do not just drift into a chaotic no deal. We have also laid the cross-party paving amendment for the Bill to ensure there is no backtracking from anyone in the cabinet or in the debate tomorrow on the prime minister\u2019s commitments. And we have tabled a third amendment to make time for a further day for Commons debate where additional amendments and options can be voted on. We will keep up the pressure on the government to prevent a chaotic no deal. The prime minister has not yet said how she or the government would vote on a no deal motion \u2013 that is irresponsible, as no deal would be deeply damaging for manufacturing, medicine supplies and food prices. The government should say now that they would vote against no deal as that would provide additional reassurance for businesses, public services and families currently struggling to prepare for no deal. The government\u2019s document about the impact of a no-deal Brexit (pdf) does not seem as alarmist as Anna Soubry, the MP who demanded it, suggested it might be. She wanted to see the briefing paper on this topic supplied to cabinet. The government agreed to publish not the actual paper, but a summary of its contents, and it reads as if it has been drafted so as not to sound too shocking. Still, even the civil service language cannot disguise the fact that it is saying some of the no-deal consequences would be profound. Here are some highlights. The report says the flow of goods through Dover would be \u201cvery significantly reduced for months\u201d under a no-deal Brexit. In particular, third country rules applied by the EU, including France, would mean that no goods are allowed to leave the port until they have provided the correct paperwork and have been customs cleared (including any necessary checks at the port, for example on products of animal origin). More significantly, member states would hold any goods which are not correctly customs cleared. This would hold up all goods where trades are not prepared, expected to be a significant proportion in the early period after exit day. The government\u2019s worst case planning assumption is that, as a result of French checks and lack of businesses readiness, the flow of goods through the short channel crossings (Dover and Eurotunnel) could be very significantly reduced for months. It says food prices would probably increase. At the time of year we will be leaving the EU, the UK is particularly reliant on the short channel crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario. As of February 2019, many businesses in the food supply industry are unprepared for a no deal scenario. It says there is \u201clittle evidence\u201d that businesses are ready for a no-deal Brexit, and that small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable. Despite communications from the government, there is little evidence that businesses are preparing in earnest for a no deal scenario, and evidence indicates that readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular is low. For example, without an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number, businesses would not be able to complete the necessary customs documentation for goods they are importing. As an EORI number registration is one of the most basic and straightforward parts of the process most businesses would need to undertake to prepare for no deal, this is assumed to be a generous indicator of overall readiness. As of February 2019 there had only been around 40,000 registrations for an EORI number, against an estimate of around 240,000 EU-only trading businesses. There is capacity to sign up 11,000 businesses per day, and so this position could change rapidly with behaviour change from businesses. It says extra customs checks alone could cost business \u00a313bn a year under a no-deal Brexit. In a no-deal scenario, both the UK and EU would need to apply customs and excise rules and VAT to goods moving between the UK and EU, as they are currently applied to goods traded in the rest of the world. Every consignment would require a customs declaration, and so around 240,000 UK businesses that currently only trade with the EU would need to interact with customs processes for the first time, should they continue to trade with the EU. HMRC has estimated that the administrative burden on businesses from customs declarations alone, on current (2016) UK-EU trade in goods could be around \u00a313bn pa (not accounting for any behavioural change). It says it is impossible to predict the impact of new tariffs on businesses. Industries would need to respond to the application of EU tariffs. These would vary by sector. While for some sectors (such as life sciences or electronics) the effect of any tariffs would be minor, other sectors would be more affected. For example, the EU would introduce tariffs of around 70% on beef and 45% on lamb exports, and 10% on finished automotive vehicles. This would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border. Given the unprecedented nature of the sort of economy-wide adjustment that would be required in a no-deal scenario, it is impossible to accurately predict the ability of businesses to adapt. It says businesses in Northern Ireland could go bust. In a no-deal scenario there is an expectation of disruption to closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland. There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure, and/or relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment. Northern Ireland is particularly vulnerable given its high proportion of, and reliance upon SMEs (75% of all private sector employment) and the number of businesses who trade directly with Ireland (Northern Ireland\u2019s largest international export market). The agri-food sector is a disproportionately large part of Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and located predominantly in border/rural areas. It is particularly vulnerable given its reliance on cross-border supply chains in the production stage and in finished products. It confirms that some EU trade deals would not be able to carry over after Brexit. A number of the most critical international agreements have been signed and are on track to come into force on exit day, including on aviation and civil nuclear cooperation and safeguarding. Those that are not may not be in force on exit day. If contingency options were not in place, there would be a gap in coverage for some international agreements, the impact of which would vary depending on the nature and scale of the agreement. Around 40 of these agreements are trade agreements. To date, the government has signed trade agreements with Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, members of the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) Economic Partnership Agreement, Israel and the Palestinian Authority ... if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, some agreements will not be concluded in time and therefore will not be in place for exit day. Agreements which will clearly not be in place for exit day are Andorra, Japan, Turkey, and San Marino; the government has set out further details in published guidance. It says Britons travelling to the EU could be subject to full Schengen checks. In the absence of an alternative agreement, UK citizens would be treated as third country nationals by member states, and potentially be subject to full Schengen checks. This would mean they would no longer be able to use e-gates, and checks to enter EU member states could take longer than they currently do. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The Brexit department has just published the government\u2019s assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. It is here (pdf). Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, which represents 50 or more of the most hardline Brexiters, has posted this tweet with a clip from his interview on Sky News earlier. Here is his quote in full. If Brexit were to be delayed to change the backstop to the Malthouse compromise, that would be positive. And to allow time for legislation to get through - that again would be perfectly acceptable. If it is being delayed, which is my suspicion, as a plot to stop Brexit altogether, then I think that would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit. It would be overthrowing the referendum result, two general elections, one to call for the referendum, one to endorse the referendum, and would undermine our democracy. This implies that the ERG are in full outrage mode about Theresa May\u2019s decision. But Rees-Mogg has erected a straw man to denounce. No one seriously thinks May wants to stop Brexit altogether. Some MPs would like to do this, but they don\u2019t include the leaders of either of the main parties. Elsewhere in his interview Rees-Mogg sounded much less perturbed by May\u2019s announcement. At another point he said: There is no evidence that a new deal can be agreed that would be acceptable to parliament in that period [between 29 March, the current Brexit date, and 30 June, the latest date for Brexit implied by May\u2019s statement]. So the cliff edge, if that is the term people want to use, has merely been moved back. And there is no willingness to delay beyond the new European parliament forming. So it [May\u2019s offer] doesn\u2019t offer parliament very much. And when he was asked whether ERG members might be more inclined to vote for May\u2019s deal as a result of today\u2019s announcement, to prevent article 50 being extended, he replied: This brinksmanship, this effort of \u2018call my bluff\u2019, is not going to change people\u2019s minds to back her deal. Here is the text of the government motion for tomorrow\u2019s Brexit debate. I don\u2019t often do reader requests, but in the comments BTL Exordium2190 said Ken Clarke\u2019s intervention during the statement should have been included. So here it is in full. This is what Clarke said: May I congratulate the prime minister on accepting that we are not remotely ready for the chaos of a no-deal departure on 29 March? I agree with her that no deal at any time would bring very damaging medium and long-term prospects for the British economy and our wellbeing. I will continue to vote for any withdrawal agreement that she manages to get with the other EU countries, but I doubt that she will command a majority for any such agreement in the near future. Can I turn to the real issue now? How long is the delay that we are contemplating? The prime minister seems to be giving us a date for a new cliff edge at the end of June, but is not the danger that we will merely continue the present pantomime performance through the next three months, and that the public will be dismayed as we approach that date and find that there is similar chaos about where we are going? May I suggest that we contemplate a much calmer delay, that we have indicative votes following debates in this House, to see where a consensus or majority lies, and then that we prepare our position for the much more important long-term negotiations that have to take place on the eventual settlement? We cannot have several more years of what we have had for the past two years. We have to start proper negotiations with the EU on what exactly we contemplate as our long-term relationships with the union. In response, Theresa May just said that she did not want an extension and that, if there had to be one, it should be \u201cas short as possible\u201d. The most emotional appeal to Theresa May during her statement came from the Labour MP Jess Phillips. Here it is. This BBC graphic is quite useful. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper says she will go ahead and table her amendment today. But she says Theresa May has conceded \u201cmost\u201d of what the amendment wants, and implies that if she receives further assurances tomorrow, she will not put it to a vote. This is from ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. The Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth has posted a short but revealing blog about today\u2019s cabinet. Here\u2019s an extract. There was considerable anger at Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke for how they have heaped pressure on May to offer this vote on a delay if the meaningful vote fails on 12 March. Liz Truss labelled them \u2018kamikaze cabinet ministers\u2019 and Andrea Leadsom was, I\u2019m told, audibly furious. Brandon Lewis, Julian Smith, Jeremy Wright, Damian Hinds and James Brokenshire all criticised the way this trio had behaved. The Times\u2019 Sam Coates says a no-deal Brexit may be more likely after Theresa May\u2019s announcement today. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who has been one of the main supporters of the Yvette Cooper bill, has said he thinks it is no longer necessary. The UK would be facing \u201cguaranteed no deal\u201d if MPs fail to back a Brexit agreement at the end of a three-month extension period, a senior EU diplomat has told the Guardian. EU officials think 1 July is the final day the UK could remain an EU member state without taking part in European elections. A three-month extension of article 50 to the end of June, coupled with no European elections in the UK in May, would make it impossible for the UK to continue as a member state, according to EU sources. The new parliament begins its work on 2 July. \u201cIt will be a no-return situation. If there is no solution then it is a guaranteed no deal,\u201d the senior diplomat said. The source expressed scepticism that a divided House of Commons would find in three months the consensus that has eluded MPs for more than two and a half years. There would be a doubt; it\u2019s difficult to imagine. If people cannot agree now, why would it be possible in three months? That being said, I don\u2019t see that the heads of state and government would say no [to a three-month extension]. Probably they will say \u2018let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s give them a last chance\u2019. During a three-month extension period, the EU would \u201caccelerate the no-deal planning\u201d the source added. Three months maximum and then it\u2019s clear for everyone that it is the only extension, the first and the last. Then the UK would not have European elections, it would have to finalise everything. The EU is open to longer extensions, with various options mooted from nine to 21 months. The longer option, until the end of 2020, is seen by some senior EU insiders as a political tactic designed by the European commission to frighten the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics into voting for the withdrawal agreement. This is from Nick Boles, one of the Tories backing the Yvette Cooper amendment. He seems to be saying that, although the amendment will still be tabled, if ministers offer sufficient assurances in the debate tomorrow, it may not be put to a vote. At the start of this week there were claims that tomorrow\u2019s vote would mark the moment when Theresa May, finally, had to make a choice between siding with the pro-Europeans in her government or the European Research Group (ERG), the faction in her party pushing for a harder Brexit. But not for the first time, predictions about May being forced to commit have turned out to be misplaced. Her capacity for equivocation is extraordinary. I summarised the main announcements in her statement at 2.02pm. But here are some thoughts on the political consequences. 1) An extension of article 50 has, within the space of a week, gone from something that the government would scarcely discuss in public to a firm probability. May has announced a mechanism for how it might happen. And if, as the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler argues (see 12.04pm), May was hoping to use \u201cthree-way Brexit blackmail\u201d to encourage Brexiters, Labour and the EU to compromise ahead of the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, by creating a mechanism for an article 50 extension she has weakened the leverage that might help get her deal through parliament \u2013 making extension even more likely. 2) As usual, May is treating EU thinking as an afterthought. May wants to let MPs vote for a short, one-off article 50 extension if her deal gets voted down. (Quite whether, in practice, she would be able to stop parliament pushing for a second extension is another matter.) But EU leaders have been clear that they would support either a short extension to allow MPs to pass the legislation needed to facilitate Brexit, or a long extension needed to allow the UK to make up its mind. A short extension to allow the UK to dither for three more months holds little attraction for them, and it is not obvious that that they would even agree. (For article 50 to be extended, the EU27 would have to support this unanimously.) 3) May seems to have done enough to avert government resignations. MPs are still mulling over what she said, but the early indications are that she has done enough to satisfy those Tories who were planning to resign from government to back the Cooper amendment. Indeed, it is not even certain at this point whether the Cooper amendment will still be put to a vote. 4) Cleverly, May has also managed to appease the remainers without unduly provoking the ERG leavers. During her statement, it was striking how little criticism she received from Tory Brexiters, who until recently would have viewed any talk of an article 50 extension as a betrayal. It may just be that they are holding their fire. But equally it may be that, as Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested in an interview earlier (see 1.27pm), they have concluded that May has not removed no deal as a prospect, but just delayed the point at which it might happen. 4) But not so cleverly, May has just perpetuated the uncertainty. May won\u2019t even commit the government to whipping its MPs to vote for an article 50 extension if her deal fails and, as my colleague Heather Stewart points out (see 2.37pm), this does not make life any easier for businesses trying to work out how seriously they need to take the risk of no deal. She seems to have pulled off a modest tactical success, while doing nothing to edge her party, or parliament, any closer to a long-term resolution of this crisis. MPs received a surprise in the House of Commons earlier when Theresa May used a catchphrase from a car insurance advert to explain the options on Brexit. As the Press Association reported, the prime minister quoted Compare the Market\u2019s TV ad to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who claimed May was \u201crunning down the clock\u201d before the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. Blackford accused the prime minister of wasting nine days of parliamentary time after she announced she was giving MPs a vote on delaying the Brexit departure date past 29 March. Responding, May said: If he wants to end the uncertainty \u2026 then he should vote for a deal. Simples. Politicians said they were \u201cstunned\u201d by the quote, with the Labour MP Rupa Huq tweeting: This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. And ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says Sir Oliver Letwin, another leading Tory supporter of the Cooper amendment, is satisfied with what May has promised. Theresa May has finally finished her statement. She was on her feet for just over two hours. I will post a snap analysis shortly. Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs who voted for the Cooper amendment last month, seems to be happy with Theresa May\u2019s offer. Yvette Cooper sounded far less happy with May\u2019s assurances when she spoke in the Commons earlier (see 1.19pm), but she has not said yet whether she will go ahead with her amendment and press it to a vote. Briefing journalists after the prime minister\u2019s statement, her spokesman repeatedly - and maddeningly - refused to say how the government would whip its MPs if it has to call a vote on 14 March on whether article 50 should be extended. He said: I think what you heard in the Commons was the prime minister\u2019s absolute determination to get a deal over the line in a way that the House of Commons can support it. That is her focus and that is what you would expect. Questions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day. I think it\u2019s important that we set these things out in order. Asked what length of extension the government will recommend, if her deal fails and MPs reject no deal, he pointed to the PM\u2019s words saying it would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d - and declined to say what the government would do to if MPs amend the motion to demand a longer period. Pressed on whether May was still willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t give parliament a vote if she wasn\u2019t willing to abide by it.\u201d But the conversation underlined the fact that what the PM has announced today is not \u201ctaking no deal off the table\u201d; she has simply accepted that if it comes to the crunch, she will allow MPs to bind her hands. It is not at all clear how all this is meant to help employers and investors attempting to weigh the probability of a no-deal Brexit - though it appears to have averted the risk of a rash of resignations on Wednesday. \u201cThere was broad cabinet agreement that this was the way to proceed,\u201d said her spokesman. The SNP\u2019s Peter Grant asks what will happen if MPs vote against both no deal and against extending article 50. Is it any coincidence that the day ahead is the Ides of March? May says the Commons will have decisions to take. Back in the Commons the Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards asks May to confirm that under her plan, if MPs vote to rule out no deal, and vote for an extension, the government will then enter an extension with no deal again an option. This is \u201cswimming round in circles\u201d, he says. May says she wants MPs to back her deal. Theresa Villiers, a leading Tory Brexiter, told the World at One that, although the prospect of an article 50 extension was \u201cfrustrating\u201d, the overall position had not changed significantly. She explained: It\u2019s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on March 29. But fundamentally it doesn\u2019t change the challenge that she has - she needs to get changes to the withdrawal treaty before it is capable of commanding support in parliament. She needs to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements which don\u2019t have the flaws of the withdrawal treaty at present. Villiers also said that, without a binding change to the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May\u2019s deal would not pass. Without binding treaty change it is hard to see how the prime minister gets her majority and overturns what was the most significant defeat for any government ever in the history of parliament. Richard Harrington, the business minister, told the World at One that he welcomed Theresa May\u2019s statement. He said: I\u2019m satisfied because for the first time she has acknowledged in a statement that parliament will be allowed to vote on ruling out no deal, which of course it overwhelmingly will. But Harrington, who has been threatening to resign if May does not allow MPs to rule out a no-deal Brexit (see 11.34am), also said that \u201ca lot depends on the detail\u201d and that he wanted to hear from Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the MPs involved in the Cooper amendment, before deciding whether or not to back Cooper. He explained: If they are satisfied that the effect is the same, then for me that is good enough. Here is Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, on the prime minister\u2019s statement. Moves to avert no deal in March are essential. There are now proposals from parliament and government. But they are just one step. To avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate. Compromise is the only way. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has been at the No 10 briefing. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says May has told MPs 108 times that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. If it does not, will people see that as a betrayal? May says she wants the UK to leave on time. Back in the Commons, Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy asks May how she personally would vote on extending article 50. People have a right to know, she says. May says Creasy has missed out the bit about the vote on her deal. She says she will be voting for her own deal. Theresa May\u2019s commitment to hold two votes \u2013 on a no-deal Brexit and a delay \u2013 has received a lukewarm reaction from the business community. Business leaders said that while the capitulation on the possibility of an extension to article 50 was a step in the right direction, it was no substitute for the urgently needed concrete deal. Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: The message from our members is clear, nearly 80% would choose to avoid a no-deal outcome. Too much information about that scenario is still missing \u2013 including from our own government \u2013 for firms to be ready in a few short weeks. Seeing the impasse continue may not be comfortable for businesses, but a disorderly exit could bring unbearable disruption for firms in sectors from farming to finance, manufacturing to business services, across the UK.\u201d Claire Walker, the co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While this a giant political leap for the prime minister, this is only a small step towards the clarity and precision that businesses need to chart their future direction. The overriding priority is still to assure businesses and communities that an unwanted \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario will not happen by default on 29 March. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s opening statement. May said that MPs will get a vote on Thursday 14 March on extending article 50 if the Commons has not passed a deal by then, and if MPs vote on Wednesday 13 March to reject no deal. But any extension would be short, and \u201calmost certainly ... a one-off\u201d, she said. She said it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to extend article 50 beyond the end of June because that would require the UK to take part in the European elections. (See 1.06pm.) She confirmed that the government would let MPs vote on matching EU laws whenever the EU strengthens workers\u2019 rights. But she also said that she was opposed to \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d, which is what Labour wants, and which would involve the UK automatically matching any EU move to boost rights. She explained: Not only would giving up control go against the spirit of the referendum result, it would also mean accepting new EU laws automatically, even if they were to reduce workers\u2019 rights or change them in a way that was not right for us. Instead, and in the interests of building support across the House, we are prepared to commit to giving parliament a vote on whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU standards in areas such as workers\u2019 rights and health and safety are judged to have been strengthened. The government will consult with businesses and trade Unions as it looks at new EU legislation and decides how the UK should respond. We will legislate to give our commitments on both non-regression and future developments force in UK law. And following further cross-party talks, we will shortly be bringing forward detailed proposals to ensure that as we leave the EU, we not only protect workers\u2019 rights, but continue to enhance them. She said the UK and the EU were working on how \u201calternative arrangements\u201d could replace the backstop in Ireland as a \u201cpriority\u201d. In a reference to the Malthouse compromise, which is favoured by Brexiters, she spoke about these \u201calternative arrangements\u201d in positive terms. But, by suggesting that these \u201calternative arrangements\u201d could be developed alongside the talks on the future trade deal, she implied they would not be ready in time to replace the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. She said: The UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland. This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them. Our aim is to ensure that, even if the full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go. I want to thank my Hon and Rt Hon friends for their contribution to this work and reaffirm that we are seized of the need to progress that work as quickly as possible. President Juncker has already agreed that the EU will give priority to this work. And the government expects that this will be an important strand of the next phase. The secretary of state for Exiting the EU will be having further discussions with Michel Barnier and we will announce details ahead of the meaningful vote. We will also be setting up domestic structures to support this work, including ensuring we can take advice from external experts involved in customs processes around the world, from businesses who trade with the EU and beyond \u2013 and, of course, from colleagues across the House. This will all be supported by civil service resource as well as funding for the government to help develop, test and pilot proposals which can form part of these alternative arrangements. She claimed that the UK would \u201cultimately\u201d make a success of a no-deal Brexit, but that it would bring \u201cvery serious challenges\u201d in the short term. As the government committed to the House last week, we are today publishing the paper assessing our readiness for no deal. I believe that if we have to, we will ultimately make a success of a no deal. But this paper provides an honest assessment of the very serious challenges it would bring in the short-term \u2013 and further reinforces why the best way for this House to honour the referendum result is to leave with a deal. She urged EU states to guarantee the rights of Britons living on the continent in the event of no deal. The UK has guaranteed the rights of EU nationals living in the UK in these circumstances, she said. But she said the EU could not offer a reciprocal guarantee. Member states would have to offer these guarantees unilaterally. At the very start of this process the UK sought to separate out this issue, but that was something which the EU has been consistent on. However, my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has written to all of his counterparts and we are holding further urgent discussions with member states to seek assurances on the rights of UK citizens. I urge all EU countries to make this guarantee and end the uncertainty for these citizens. She said that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to offer a second referendum on Brexit meant \u201cthe very credibility of our democracy at stake\u201d. She claimed that the UK and the EU were making \u201cgood progress\u201d in the talks intended to achieve a solution to the backstop problem. Robert Halfon, a Conservative, asks May if she will give MPs a vote on the \u201cNorway plus\u201d option if her deal fails. May says Halfon is getting ahead of things. John Whittingdale, a Tory Brexiter, says the EU often reaches an agreement at the very last minute. He says May should stick to her deadline. Labour\u2019s Owen Smith asks the question again. If there is a vote on 14 March, will the government vote in favour of extending article 50, or against? May, again, refuses to answer. She just says that what Smith said about welcoming her U-turn contradicted what other opposition MPs said about nothing having changed. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that she will not whip ministers to block an extension of article 50 in the possible vote on 14 March. May sidesteps the question. She just repeats her point about not wanting an article 50 extension. May refuses to confirm that she would whip Tory MPs to vote in favour of extending article 50 if a vote did take place on 14 March. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story on May\u2019s announcement. Anna Soubry, the former Tory who now sits as an Independent Group MP, says we are seeing can-kicking, at the same time as fudge is being created. (Is there a cliche competition going on?) She asks May to confirm that no deal remains on the table. Back in the Commons, Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, accuses May of \u201cbrowbeating the Commons\u201d. He says the public should be given a vote. On Sky News Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, says what May is proposing on giving MPs a vote to extend article 50 would not change much. He says she is only proposing a short extension, and there would still be a cliff edge. He says the threat of MPs voting for a short delay would not be enough to persuade Brexiters like himself to vote for May\u2019s deal. But if the delay were part of a project to delay Brexit altogether, that would be a huge betrayal, he says. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks why MPs should trust what May is promising today, given that she has gone back on her word in the past. Referring to the Cooper amendment (which Bradshaw is implicitly backing), May says she wants to maintain the current relationship between government and parliament. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement to MPs. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP behind the amendment intended to allow MPs to legislate to block a no-deal Brexit, says promised votes have been pulled in the past, and votes have been ignored. If there is no legislation in place, what assurances can MPs have that votes will take place and that the government will abide by them? And what will the government\u2019s policy be? Will it argue for an extension? May says what she proposed is government policy. She says she has honoured her promises to come back to the Commons and give MPs votes. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks what May would use the extra time granted by an article 50 extension for. May sidesteps the question, and says if MPs want to avoid no deal, they must vote for a deal. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, is the first Brexiter to ask a question. He does not protest about the decision to allow a vote on extending article 50 \u2013 in fact, he does not mention it at all \u2013 but instead he criticises the backstop arrangements. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says the SNP is already selecting candidates for the European elections. The Tories should do the same, he says. He says there are only 19 parliamentary days left until Brexit. Theresa May is running down the clock, he says. He says she should rule out no deal and extend article 50, and do it today. This is what Theresa May said in her opening statement about offering MPs a vote on extending article 50 if a Brexit deal has not been agreed by 12 March. As I committed to the house, the government will today table an amendable motion for debate tomorrow. But I know members across the house are genuinely worried that time is running out, that if the government doesn\u2019t come back with a further meaningful vote or it loses that vote, parliament won\u2019t have time to make its voice heard on the next steps. I know too that members across the house are deeply concerned by the effect of the current uncertainty on businesses. So today I want to reassure the house by making three further commitments. First, we will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest. Second, if the government has not won a meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March then it will \u2013 in addition to its obligations to table a neutral, amendable motion under section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act \u2013 table a motion to be voted on by Wednesday 13 March at the latest, asking this house if it supports leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for a future relationship on 29 March. So the United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this house for that outcome. Third, if the house, having rejected leaving with the deal negotiated with the EU, then rejects leaving on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement and future framework, the government will, on 14 March, bring forward a motion on whether parliament wants to seek a short limited extension to article 50 \u2013 and if the house votes for an extension, seek to agree that extension approved by the house with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension. These commitments all fit the timescale set out in the private member\u2019s bill in the name of [Yvette Cooper]. They are commitments I am making as prime minister and I will stick by them, as I have previous commitments to make statements and table amendable motions by specific dates. Let me be clear, I do not want to see article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March. An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections. What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now? And the house should be clear that a short extension \u2013 not beyond the end of June \u2013 would almost certainly have to be a one-off. If we had not taken part in the European parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff-edge in a few months\u2019 time. Corbyn says Labour accepts the result of the referendum. But it does not support May\u2019s botched plan. If May\u2019s plan does pass, Labour wants a confirmatory public vote, he says. He says May appears to be belatedly listening to MPs. Until May says what her alternative would be, she is continuing to run down the clock. If the government wants an extension, it should negotiate a Brexit deal acceptable to the Commons, he says. Corbyn says Labour has a credible plan that could bring the country together, provide certainty and protect jobs and industry. The UK would keep pace with the best practice on workers\u2019 rights, he says. He says what May promised on workers\u2019 rights (see 12.40pm) was \u201cway short of dynamic alignment\u201d [ie, keeping pace with the EU, if it strengthens workers\u2019 rights]. He says that some Tories want to use Brexit to weaken workers\u2019 rights. He recently visited Brussels, he says. He says he left with no doubt that Labour\u2019s Brexit plans are workable. Jeremy Corbyn is responding now. He asks May to confirm the withdrawal agreement is not being reopened. He says May has promised a vote. But May has promised a vote on a deal in December, in January, in February and in March. And only the January vote took place. He says May needs to explain what her plan B is. He says Labour will support the amendment from the Tory MP Alberto Costa on the rights of EU nationals tomorrow. He asks how MPs can vote on a deal before it has been agreed by the EU. May says, if the UK can leave with a deal, it will deliver certainty to the country. She says she hopes to get a deal the Commons can support. May says parliament gave the decision about leaving the EU to the people. But that is no longer Labour\u2019s position, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn wants to hold a \u201cdivisive\u201d referendum that would take this country \u201cright back to square one\u201d. May says the foreign secretary is writing to his EU counterparts asking them to offer assurances about the rights of Britons in the EU in the event of no deal. Turning to the Cooper amendment, May criticises it on the grounds that it would allow the Commons to take control of government negotiations. And she says an extension does not solve the problem. Ultimately the UK will have to leave with a deal, leave without a deal, or not leave. May says she wants to make three further commitments. First, she will hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on a deal by Tuesday 12 March. Second, if the government does not win that vote, it will table a motion to be voted on by 13 March at the latest asking MPs if they approve leaving the EU with no deal. Third, if MPs reject leaving with no deal in that vote, she will give them a vote on 14 March on whether parliament wants a short, limited extension to article 50. If MPs pass that motion, the government will seek to get that extension. She says she is making those commitments as PM, and she will stick with them as she has previous commitments. May says she does not want to extend article 50. And if it had to be extended beyond the end of June, the UK would need to take part in the European elections. What sort of signal to voters would that send, she asks. And she says any extension would almost certainly be a one-off, because otherwise the UK would have to take part in the European elections. And she says this means extending article 50 would create an even sharper cliff edge. May says the government is publishing its paper about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit. She says she thinks the UK would ultimately make a success of no deal. But there would be challenges. May turns to workers\u2019 rights. May says the government is willing to promise MPs a vote on whether to match any moves by the EU to increase workers\u2019 rights. May says she had a number of positive meetings at the EU-Arab summit. And she has spoken to the leaders of all EU states. She says both sides have agreed to review progress in the coming days. She says a joint work stream will consider the border in Northern Ireland. This will work in parallel with the talks on the future relationship. She says the EU has agreed to give priority to this work. Further details will be announced before the meaningful vote. And she says it will examine ideas from around the world, as well as from MPs. The civil service will help work on this idea. May tells MPs the UK and the EU are still seriously working on alternative procedures for the Northern Irish border. This is intended to reassure Brexiters who think the Malthouse compromise provides a solution to the backstop issue. Theresa May is starting her statement now. She says she said a fortnight ago she would come back to the Commons today if there were no deal. In the last two weeks she has been engaged in \u201cfocused discussions\u201d with the EU. They are making \u201cgood progress\u201d, she says. And these are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuennsberg. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on cabinet. This is from Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu. This is from the Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy on today\u2019s cabinet. My colleague Graeme Wearden has been covering Mark Carney\u2019s appearance at the Commons Treasury committee on his business live blog. You can read all the coverage here. And here is an excerpt. Q: Are there enough warehouses to handle the stockpiling necessary for a no-deal Brexit? No there are not, Mark Carney replies, saying that one of the issues facing UK firms is a shortage of warehouse space. There\u2019s a limit to warehousing capacity, and also how much you can stockpile to keep factories running, he adds, citing the just-in-time \u201clean supply chains\u201d used by the car industry and aerospace manufacturers. Q: So we\u2019re looking at chaos? Carney declines to use that particular word, saying only that it would be an economic shock. If Theresa May does tell MPs she will let them vote to extend article 50, she will be left eating her words. It is not a diet that appeals to any politician and, as the Times\u2019 Sam Coates points out, in May\u2019s case she is going to have quite a plateful. A no-deal exit from the European Union could result in failures among social care providers that could put vulnerable adults at risk and seriously affect local councils and the NHS, according to a leaked civil service document. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has the full story here. Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a good Twitter thread summing up what the EU thinks about what is going on in Westminster. It starts here. And here are two of her other posts; the concept of \u201cthree-way Brexit blackmail\u201d is one that definitely deserves a wide audience. This is from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on what to look out for in Theresa May\u2019s statement. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. This tweet begs more questions than it answers, not least: how would the government whip on the two motions for debate on 12 March? For extension, and against no deal? Or would MPs get a free vote on both? We will learn more soon. In normal circumstances ministers argue about policy in private but stick to an agreed line when speaking in public. Under the strains of Brexit that convention has frayed considerably \u2013 we are used to seeing ministers contradict each other in public - but this morning Richard Harrington, a junior business minister, has been negotiating in public with the prime minister - effectively giving her an ultimatum. On the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, he said that \u201cwarm words\u201d from Theresa May would not be enough and that he would resign unless he received a firm promise that she would allow MPs to vote to rule out a no-deal Brexit if her deal does not get passed. He told the programme: I\u2019m hoping today at the dispatch box the prime minister is going to say that she effectively rules out no deal, provides a parliamentary timetable for alternatives to be discussed; for example, a technical extension of article 50. But if she is not prepared to do that, tomorrow we will be voting on a number of amendments, one of which [the Yvette Cooper one] will basically take control of that decision to parliament, and provide the legislative mechanism to delay mechanism to delay Brexit by a short period. Asked what sort of assurance he wanted, he replied: It depends on the wording. Quite apart from the fact that she is an honourable person \u2013 I would believe her anyway if she told me \u2013 undertakings at the dispatch box are, not exactly legal undertakings, but effectively that ... Warm words alone will not be enough. It has to be a clear undertaking that she is prepared to remove no deal, to have a short extension to article 50 \u2013 not as a permanent thing, but to allow parliament to decide the way it wants to go in the future. Harrington is the most outspoken of all the government ministers worried about the prospect of a no-deal. But in the past he has delivered implicit resignation threats that have not materialised. At the time of the first \u201cnext steps\u201d Brexit vote, at the end of January, he suggested that if May did not rule out a no-deal Brexit by mid-February, he would rebel (see here and here). But Harrington and other pro-European ministers stayed in government, even though May did not promise a mechanism to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the time of the second \u201cnext steps\u201d vote. On that occasion there was no vote on an amendment designed to rule out no deal, and the pro-Europeans accepted May\u2019s decision to put off the crunch point until this week. The Office for National Statistics has published data on household income inequality for the financial year ending in 2018. It shows that income inequality increased slightly during the year, but that \u201cdespite the small increase, income inequality remains slightly lower than levels reached 11 years ago\u201d. Here is a chart showing how income inequality has varied since the 1980s, using the Gini coefficient measure. (The higher the coefficient, the higher inequality is.) Commenting on the figures, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: Today\u2019s evidence of surging income inequality shows that this Tory government is not creating an economy that works for the many. With falling business investment, downgraded forecasts of growth, and a manufacturing recession, we have an economy in tatters. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker, who flags up the next obvious question if Theresa May does announce that she will give MPs a vote on extending article 50 if her deal has not been passed by 12 March. This is from Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, on the subject of extending article 50. Baker is quoting a Telegraph article (paywall) by Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. Varoufakis was in favour of remain during the EU referendum, but he is a fierce critic of Brussels, because of his experience negotiating with the EU during the Eurozone crisis, and in his article he argues that the UK\u2019s best hope of getting a good deal from the EU would be to back no deal, or a permanent customs union. These are the two options most likely to force the EU to engage, he argues. On Sky\u2019s All Out Politics Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, said that the government did ever end up offering a referendum with a choice between remain and Theresa May\u2019s deal (as Labour is proposing \u2013 see 9.35am), he would abstain. He said: I tell you what I do resist - the very idea, that it appears Emily Thornberry [the shadow foreign secretary] is putting forward, that the referendum would be between remain and Mrs May\u2019s deal, which is Brexit in name only. I have to tell you, in those circumstances, I would not campaign and I would not vote. Because it would not offer me Brexit. When it would put to him that this would suit his opponents, Farage went on to suggest that leavers should organise a mass abstention, in the hope of delegitimising the result. \u201cYou have to have a certain level of turnout for any referendum to be valid,\u201d he said. Actually, that is not true. In most referendums in the UK there has been no turnout threshold, although, as Farage pointed out, in the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution, there was a turnout threshold saying that the vote would only be valid if 40% of all registered voters, as well as a majority, voted yes. This was widely seen as a wrecking amendment and, although there was a narrow majority for devolution, the result was invalid because the turnout was not high enough. The Labour Brexiter John Mann told the Today programme this morning that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to endorse a second referendum was \u201cabsurd\u201d. He explained: Voters won\u2019t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg, it didn\u2019t end very well for him on tuition fees. Our manifesto was unambiguous, we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn\u2019t do that and the voters - in very, very large numbers - will not accept that. The move would be \u201ccatastrophic to Labour in the Midlands and the north\u201d, Mann added. On the Today programme this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, confirmed that, if Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan gets approved by parliament, it is Labour\u2019s policy for it to be subject to a referendum, with remain an option. He said: We specifically agreed yesterday, as the Labour party, that if the prime minister\u2019s deal gets through, that deal should be subject to the lock, if you like, of a public vote in the way that Jeremy [Corbyn] spelled out yesterday. When it was put to him that a Labour party source told journalists last night that the party would not favour a referendum with May\u2019s deal or remain as the two options, Starmer replied: I don\u2019t know who said what. What I do know is you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night, setting out what the position is we agreed as the Labour party. The Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya has been released from prison after serving a month of her sentence for perverting the course of justice, the Press Association reports. Onasanya, who was expelled by the Labour party after she conviction, was driven out of HMP Bronzefield in Ashford in Surrey this morning. She was jailed for three months at the Old Bailey on January 29 after being convicted of perverting the course of justice by lying to avoid a speeding charge. On Sky\u2019s All Out Politics, asked about the reports that Theresa May will promise MPs a vote on extending article 50 if they do not pass a Brexit deal by 12 March, Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, said he would want to hear what May actually proposed. But he also pointed out that in the past she had cancelled a vote she had previously promised, as she did before Christmas when she postponed the original vote on her deal. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn don\u2019t have much in common, but they both deserve to be recognised as among the most stubborn individuals to hold high political office in recent times. And that makes what we are witnessing today all the more remarkable. Within 24 hours, they both seem to be engaged in remarkable policy shifts on Brexit. Corbyn has finally given the firm commitment to Labour backing a second referendum that he has been resisting for months (although the small print is important - more on that later). And, in an even bigger U-turn, May seems poised to promise MPs a vote on extending article 50. The Evening Standard first reported this yesterday, but details are sketchy and it seems that much will depend on what is actually decided at cabinet, which starts in half an hour. But there are multiple reports this morning saying that May will today confirm that, if the Commons does not pass a Brexit deal by March 12, MPs will get a chance to vote to extend article 50. Here is an extract from the Financial Times\u2019 story (paywall). Mrs May\u2019s allies hope that business leaders will rally behind the prime minister as she rules out a cliff-edge exit on March 29; the prospect of a disorderly exit has alarmed and infuriated corporate Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of hard work to get this far,\u201d said one cabinet colleague. \u201cWe need a wall of support for the PM to get this through the cabinet.\u201d Another minister said that an \u201cexplosion is guaranteed\u201d from Tory Brexiters when they are confronted with Mrs May\u2019s new strategy, which will ramp up pressure on Eurosceptics to back the prime minister\u2019s tweaked exit deal ... According to the prime minister\u2019s allies, if the Commons rejected the deal again then Mrs May would give MPs a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or to opt for \u201ca short extension\u201d to the article 50 exit process. This is from the Sun\u2019s version. At a summit in Egypt [on Monday], Mrs May was still publicly opposing any Article 50 extension, insisting: \u201cA delay doesn\u2019t deliver a deal\u201d. But No10 is now sure that Remain Tory ministers along with dozens of backbenchers comfortably have the numbers to defeat the Government in a showdown Commons vote on Wednesday. Unless the PM acts, as many as 60 Tory MPs are expected to back a cross party bid lead by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Tory grandee Sir Oliver Letwin to enforce a Brexit delay to avoid a No Deal cliff edge in just 31 days time. A senior government source who is aware of the PM\u2019s thinking said: \u201cThe decision for her now is how to avoid the worst case scenario, not what do we want to do. \u201cThat worst case scenario is losing control of Brexit if Cooper-Letwin passes, and that would be catastrophic.\u201d And here is an extract from what ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, posted on Facebook about this last night. As of tonight there was still uncertainty among her colleagues whether she would press the button on the volte face and put it to her cabinet tomorrow morning - where it will cause a furious row between Brexiters and remainers. The Brexiters are acutely aware that MPs would almost certainly vote to force the prime minister to delay Brexit and therefore prevent a no-deal departure on 29 March. However absent that promise of a vote for MPs, which the PM is expected to make when addressing the House tomorrow afternoon, somewhere between 15 and 25 ministers and parliamentary private secretaries - who hate the prospect of a no deal exit from the EU - were set to resign. Some 23 of these government rebels - who are led by David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark - met tonight. And 18 of them made clear they were ready to rejoin the backbenchers. On the Today programme this morning David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, refused to comment on the reports. But Margot James, the culture minister and one of three ministers who have written a joint article for today\u2019s Daily Mail saying the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit, confirmed that she was willing to resign over this issue. She said: All of us were agreed that we couldn\u2019t be part of a government that allowed the country to leave the EU without a deal. As D-day approaches, I think we felt honour-bound to actually do something to help prevent such catastrophe. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on household income inequality. 10am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs about Brexit. At some point today we are also expecting the government to publish its assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit, promised two weeks ago to avert a defeat on an amendment tabled by Anna Soubry demanding the release of the information. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit, and May\u2019s statement. I will post a summary when I finish, at around 5.30pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In an official document only published after repeated demands by the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the government also revealed it was behind on contingency planning for a third of \u201ccritical projects\u201d in relation to business and trade. The latest no-deal notice states: The economy would be 6%-9% smaller over the next 15 years than it otherwise might have been, in the event of no deal, in line with Bank of England forecasts. The flow of goods through Dover would be \u201cvery significantly reduced for months\u201d. With 30% of food coming from the EU, prices are likely to increase and there is a risk that panic buying might create shortages.

      "bodyText": "The French sports store Decathlon has cancelled a plan to put a sports hijab on the market in France after several politicians, including one from Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist party, called for a boycott. The retailer\u2019s plain, lightweight running headscarf, which covers the hair but not the face, is already on sale in Morocco and was to be extended to France and worldwide. But after a social media storm and outrage from some politicians against Muslim head coverings, the company backtracked and said the garment would not go on sale \u201cat the present time\u201d in France. Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, the health minister in Macron\u2019s government, said of the garment: \u201cIt\u2019s a vision of women that I don\u2019t share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf.\u201d Aurore Berg\u00e9, from Macron\u2019s centrist party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, tweeted her opposition, saying she would boycott the store which she accused of not respecting French values. She said: \u201cMy choice as a woman and citizen will be to no longer trust a brand which breaks with our values.\u201d Decathlon stood by its product, saying it had received more than 500 calls and emails on the topic on Tuesday, as well as insults and threats towards its staff. The row was the latest political storm over Muslim women\u2019s dress in France. In 2010, Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s right-wing government, banned full-face coverings in France and was accused by rights groups of stigmatising Muslim women. Schoolgirls have been banned from wearing veils in state schools since 2004 and public sector workers can not wear veils or outward religious symbols at work, because they must be seen as neutral. The hijab is not banned in public spaces, including sports grounds. Scores of mayors in French coastal towns issued beach bans on \u201cburkinis\u201d or full-body swimsuits worn by some Muslim women in 2016. Those bans were swiftly ruled illegal by France\u2019s highest administrative court, but there was a heated political row about the French principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 \u2013 secularism built on the strict separation of church and state. Rights groups warned that politicians were twisting and distorting the principle for political gain, and using it to deliberately target Muslims after a series of terrorist attacks. Fiona Lazaar, an MP from Macron\u2019s centrist party, tweeted that it was a shame that Decathlon had pulled the product, giving in to calls for a boycott and \u201cracist threats and unbridled islamophobia\u201d.",

It was Root\u2019s 14th ODI century in 116 innings, during which he became the fastest Englishman past 5,000 runs in the format and the fourth quickest overall. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t hit as many sixes as others might do, I still feel I can score as quickly,\u201d said Root. \u201cIt won\u2019t always be the case but it\u2019s an area I\u2019m always trying to get better [at].

You have to play to your strengths. You always look for ways to get better but getting the best out of yourself is the main thing.\u201d</p> <p>The Twenty20 series in St Lucia and St Kitts may be where some of England\u2019s fringe players get their chance to impress before the World Cup squad is selected, with Eoin Morgan\u2019s side expected to return to full strength on Wednesday in an attempt to take a 2-1 lead with one to play.

      "bodyText": "There are many who believe Joe Root, as captain of England\u2019s Test side and the keystone of a trailblazing one-day batting lineup, should shelve his Twenty20 ambitions in order to focus on his strengths and reduce his workload. Root, however, is not one of them. Speaking on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s fourth one-day international against West Indies in Grenada, where better weather is hoped for after Monday\u2019s washout, the 28-year-old outlined why he passed on the option to rest for the three-match Twenty20 series that ends this Caribbean tour. \u201cI love playing cricket for England, simple as that,\u201d said Root. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve not had much opportunity to play Twenty20 cricket in the last couple of years. I don\u2019t want to miss out on opportunities to play when I\u2019m fit and I feel I\u2019m in a good place.\u201d While Root is striving to repeat such short-form feats as his 44-ball 83 against South Africa in the 2016 World Twenty20 \u2013 a recent spell in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League was somewhat disappointing \u2013 then in ODI cricket he knows his game inside out. This came to the fore during the opening fixture in Barbados, when his controlled 102 from 97 balls helped England successfully chase a target of 361. It was Root\u2019s 14th ODI century in 116 innings, during which he became the fastest Englishman past 5,000 runs in the format and the fourth quickest overall. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t hit as many sixes as others might do, I still feel I can score as quickly,\u201d said Root. \u201cIt won\u2019t always be the case but it\u2019s an area I\u2019m always trying to get better [at]. If I can add that to what I\u2019ve got already, I\u2019d like to think you\u2019ll see even more improvement. \u201cI can\u2019t hit the ball over the stands like Chris Gayle can consistently, unless there is a gale-force wind and I\u2019ve got a top edge off a 95mph bowler. You have to play to your strengths. You always look for ways to get better but getting the best out of yourself is the main thing.\u201d The Twenty20 series in St Lucia and St Kitts may be where some of England\u2019s fringe players get their chance to impress before the World Cup squad is selected, with Eoin Morgan\u2019s side expected to return to full strength on Wednesday in an attempt to take a 2-1 lead with one to play. It means Ben Stokes is due to return after a minor ankle knock, with Alex Hales dropping back down. West Indies, meanwhile, will make a late decision on whether to add the newly arrived Andre Russell to their team. The Jamaican all-rounder\u2019s ability to bowl is possibly hampered by a long-standing knee problem but with the bat he still represents a significant threat. While Root will plough on to the end of the tour, the England management have now decided that Moeen Ali will join Stokes and Jos Buttler on the flight home after Saturday\u2019s fifth ODI in St Lucia, with Sam Curran, the left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, flying out as a slightly indirect replacement.

The current Ocado/Waitrose service has a customer base of 720,000 shoppers and the ambition would be to convert as many as possible to a new M&amp;S branded food offer.</p> <p>News of a potential alliance leaked in January but neither business would comment on the reports. However, their hand was forced when fresh details of the plan emerged. At the top end the proposed deal, which could be finalised as soon as Wednesday, Ocado\u2019s UK delivery business would be valued at up to \u00a31.8bn.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/21/ocado-flotation\" title=\"\">nearly a decade as an unloved listed company</a>, Ocado enjoyed a second coming last year after plans to sell its grocery-picking technology to other retailers finally took off. A string of contract wins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/us-deal-boosts-ocados-stock-market-value-above-5bn\">including with US supermarket giant Kroger</a>, helped the Ocado share price to double in 2018.</p> <p>Ocado was the top riser on the FTSE 100 after the retailers confirmed talks, up 12% at 990p, giving the company a market value of \u00a36.8bn. Shares in M&amp;S rose 3% to 303p, valuing it at \u00a34.9bn.</p> <p>M&amp;S declined to expand beyond its statement, which said: \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer confirms that it is in discussions with Ocado regarding a joint venture in UK retail. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any agreement or as to the timing of any such agreement.\u201d</p> <p>Ocado has worked with Waitrose for 20 years but the supply deal between the companies ends in September 2020. Although Ocado already works with Morrisons, the terms of the Waitrose contract would not permit Ocado to work with M&amp;S on the same basis, Ocado boss Tim Steiner confirmed to reporters earlier this month.</p> <p>Ocado and M&amp;S are thought to be trying to strike a deal before Friday, which is the deadline for Ocado to trigger an 18-month break clause with Waitrose.</p> <p>M&amp;S <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/this-is-not-just-any-online-grocer-ms-plans-food-delivery-service\">started experimenting with online food delivery</a> in 2017, but its chief executive Steve Rowe has been reluctant to pour money into it at a time when sales in its clothing and food departments are falling. A report in London\u2019s Evening Standard suggested M&amp;S would need to do a cash call on investors to fund the deal.</p> <p>Famous for inventing ready meals, M&amp;S\u2019s foodhalls are popular with small households and lazy chefs, so there are several hurdles to overcome if it is to become a destination for the weekly or monthly shop.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is thrashing out the terms of a \u00a31.8bn tie-up with Ocado to belatedly launch a grocery delivery service, replacing the online firm\u2019s current deal with Waitrose. Shares in both companies surged on Tuesday after they rushed out identical statements that confirmed they were in discussions over a deal in which M&amp;S would buy a 50% stake in Ocado\u2019s UK retail arm for up to \u00a3900m. M&amp;S will pay between \u00a3800m and \u00a3900m to enable it to make a late entry into the UK\u2019s \u00a311.4bn online grocery shopping market. The current Ocado/Waitrose service has a customer base of 720,000 shoppers and the ambition would be to convert as many as possible to a new M&amp;S branded food offer. News of a potential alliance leaked in January but neither business would comment on the reports. However, their hand was forced when fresh details of the plan emerged. At the top end the proposed deal, which could be finalised as soon as Wednesday, Ocado\u2019s UK delivery business would be valued at up to \u00a31.8bn. After nearly a decade as an unloved listed company, Ocado enjoyed a second coming last year after plans to sell its grocery-picking technology to other retailers finally took off. A string of contract wins, including with US supermarket giant Kroger, helped the Ocado share price to double in 2018. Ocado was the top riser on the FTSE 100 after the retailers confirmed talks, up 12% at 990p, giving the company a market value of \u00a36.8bn. Shares in M&amp;S rose 3% to 303p, valuing it at \u00a34.9bn. M&amp;S declined to expand beyond its statement, which said: \u201cMarks &amp; Spencer confirms that it is in discussions with Ocado regarding a joint venture in UK retail. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in any agreement or as to the timing of any such agreement.\u201d Ocado has worked with Waitrose for 20 years but the supply deal between the companies ends in September 2020. Although Ocado already works with Morrisons, the terms of the Waitrose contract would not permit Ocado to work with M&amp;S on the same basis, Ocado boss Tim Steiner confirmed to reporters earlier this month. Ocado and M&amp;S are thought to be trying to strike a deal before Friday, which is the deadline for Ocado to trigger an 18-month break clause with Waitrose. M&amp;S started experimenting with online food delivery in 2017, but its chief executive Steve Rowe has been reluctant to pour money into it at a time when sales in its clothing and food departments are falling. A report in London\u2019s Evening Standard suggested M&amp;S would need to do a cash call on investors to fund the deal. Famous for inventing ready meals, M&amp;S\u2019s foodhalls are popular with small households and lazy chefs, so there are several hurdles to overcome if it is to become a destination for the weekly or monthly shop. Its food departments sell just 7,000 products, compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops, with the average spend just \u00a313, well below Ocado\u2019s minimum order value of \u00a340. The traditional focus is on exclusive own-brand products rather than the big name grocery brands. Jefferies retail analyst James Grzinic said the proposed deal looked like a good one for Ocado but the runes were harder to read for M&amp;S: \u201cWe would be wary of the ability for the M&amp;S brand to support a basket size of the magnitude required to make the online economics work.\u201d The John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, was one of the early investors in Ocado but sold its holding for about \u00a3150m in 2011. During the past decade, the employee-owned retailer has been competing with Ocado via its own delivery service, Waitrose.com, which fills shoppers\u2019 orders from its stores\u2019 shelves, as well as a fulfilment centre in Coulsdon, south London. Waitrose.com covers 80% of UK postcodes. Ocado suffered a setback three weeks ago when a huge fire \u2013 on the same day as the company\u2019s annual results \u2013 destroyed its warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. After the fire, investors took fright, with more than \u00a31bn wiped off the firm\u2019s stock market value. However, the share price has been staging a recovery and is now close to pre-fire levels of about \u00a310.",

These are quite staggering findings with huge implications for the quality of care patients receive.\u201d Poor morale could exacerbate the already serious understaffing in the NHS, which has more than 100,000 unfilled vacancies \u2013 one in 11 of all posts. The survey found 51% of staff were considering leaving, 30% often thought about leaving the trust they worked for, 22% planned to look for a new job with a different trust in the next year and 16% intended to leave as soon as they could find another job. Almost half (46%) of respondents said their trust was so short of staff that they could not do their job properly. One in seven staff said they had been attacked by a patient or a patient\u2019s relative over the past year, especially ambulance crews and mental health staff. Just under one in five said they had been bullied, harassed or abused by a colleague and 28% had seen an error or near miss in the previous month, up three points year on year and the highest in five years. However, some positive findings emerged. More than six in 10 staff (62%) said they would recommend their trust as a place to work, 71% would recommend it as a place to be treated (up one point) and 81% were happy with the care they gave patients. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cI love the NHS \u2013 and it is nothing without its people, who dedicate their lives to caring for us in our times of greatest need. We must place the same emphasis on caring for the carers and our long-term plan for the NHS will build a more modern working culture where everyone feels supported and valued. \u201cIt is encouraging to see more staff taking pride in their organisation and feeling able to speak up when they have concerns. But there is so much more to do. Too many staff are feeling physical and mental strain at work, and bullying and discrimination levels are still far too high. This is not acceptable and I will do everything in my power to give NHS staff the support they deserve.\u201d",

But more importantly, if you want to understand why so many predictions were wrong, Corbyn\u2019s determination for democratic renewal has been underplayed, to the point of being ignored. The desire to reconnect meaningful levers between the party and its members has always been far more salient to his politics than any old guff about socialism in one country.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t influential leavers around the leadership, and without Keir Starmer\u2019s determination to stick to both the letter and spirit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/25/labour-conference-brexit-debate-starmer-increasingly-likely-to-vote-down-mays-brexit-deal-starmer-says-politics-live\" title=\"\">September\u2019s conference motion</a>, this may not have been the outcome. Key unions \u2013 the TSSA and, lately, the GMB \u2013 were significant. Organisations such as Another Europe is Possible and Remain Labour did the legwork of amassing 150 motions on Brexit to take to conference in the first place. Anyone could have lost confidence in the nation\u2019s appetite for remain, without data from Hope Not Hate and Best For Britain. And that ongoing tension many members felt, between despising Brexit as a manifestly far-right project, and wanting to maintain loyalty to a leader whose own preference was endlessly interpreted but often unclear, was bridged by Momentum. It was highly ambivalent on Europe but ultimately, also, more committed to party democracy than to a position on any single issue.</p> <p>Yet this new context in which we find ourselves, a real prospect of a public vote to swim out of this godforsaken Tory swamp, is a triumph of Labour members.</p> <p>This is important not because of any crowning determination to see credit situated where it is due \u2013 rather than ascribed, wildly, to the Independent Group. Rather, because if you want to actually know what a ratification vote would look like, and the remain campaign within it, this is no sudden scramble to put together some arguments and hope they\u2019re different enough to the self-interested status quoism of the Stronger In campaign of 2016. Labour\u2019s members have been working on a strategy for two years.</p> <p>The arguments split three ways: what does remain and reform actually mean, in terms of our relationship with the EU, and our hopes for the continent? What were the real problems unmasked by the referendum result, and what would it take to solve them? And finally, wouldn\u2019t it be inspiring to put these tired, abstract, 60s arguments behind us and concentrate on things that matter?</p> <p>The left in Europe need us, and we need them. We need one another to create the first carbon-free continent, and fast. We need to fight the rise of the far right together, for so many obvious reasons, not least the paradox that violent ethno-nationalists are working tirelessly across borders to cooperate with one another, and no single nation can meet that threat working alone. We need a transnational union movement, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/13/robin-hood-tax-economists-letter\" title=\"\">financial transaction tax</a>, an enforceable floor for corporation tax between countries; we need an entire constellation of cooperative measures so that no multinational can get its fingers burned over poor working conditions in Munich and immediately move to Krak\u00f3w, or Stoke.</p> <p>We need to defend such laws and regulations as were co-created along humane and social principles, and unpick the elements of the Lisbon treaty that sought to detach the market from democratic forces and regulatory oversight. The only progressive European voice I have ever heard supporting Brexit did so on the grounds that the UK was so often the impediment to action on climate, or on workers\u2019 rights, that the continent would be better off without us. If we have any ambitions of our own as a force for renewal, or any sense of solidarity in reforming a European project whose negative elements we partly created, we cannot accept that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/keir-starmer-labours-brexit-stance-is-either-credible-deal-or-remain\">Keir Starmer: Labour's Brexit stance is either credible deal or remain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFix Britain instead\u201d was the slogan for a second referendum suggested by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/labour-brexit-plan-remainers-leavers-norway-model-customs-model-eu\" title=\"\">Tom Kibasi</a>, the head of the IPPR thinktank.

None of this was driven by EU membership. All of it is more pressing, more meaningful and more within our grasp than any change to our relationship with the EU, which we have seen not just de-prioritise but obliterate the national agenda.</p> <p>There is some overlap between the third argument \u2013 let\u2019s move on \u2013 and the first two, yet it warrants its own category, because the appetite for it is just so strong: the almost unbearable lightness of being able to say no to more of this bilge; no more colonial fantasists; no more throwbacks invoking fake passions about the second world war; no more feckless aristocrats flapping their hands and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fine for that factory to close, manufacturing is so last century and besides, it would have closed anyway\u201d; no more nonsense about superiority and dominance and prowess, while trade deals unravel before they\u2019ve even been stitched; no more chancers taking crash courses in French geography, or Irish history or Chinese diplomacy in real time.

The desire to reconnect meaningful levers between the party and its members has always been far more salient to his politics than any old guff about socialism in one country. This isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t influential leavers around the leadership, and without Keir Starmer\u2019s determination to stick to both the letter and spirit of September\u2019s conference motion, this may not have been the outcome. Key unions \u2013 the TSSA and, lately, the GMB \u2013 were significant. Organisations such as Another Europe is Possible and Remain Labour did the legwork of amassing 150 motions on Brexit to take to conference in the first place. Anyone could have lost confidence in the nation\u2019s appetite for remain, without data from Hope Not Hate and Best For Britain. And that ongoing tension many members felt, between despising Brexit as a manifestly far-right project, and wanting to maintain loyalty to a leader whose own preference was endlessly interpreted but often unclear, was bridged by Momentum. It was highly ambivalent on Europe but ultimately, also, more committed to party democracy than to a position on any single issue. Yet this new context in which we find ourselves, a real prospect of a public vote to swim out of this godforsaken Tory swamp, is a triumph of Labour members. This is important not because of any crowning determination to see credit situated where it is due \u2013 rather than ascribed, wildly, to the Independent Group. Rather, because if you want to actually know what a ratification vote would look like, and the remain campaign within it, this is no sudden scramble to put together some arguments and hope they\u2019re different enough to the self-interested status quoism of the Stronger In campaign of 2016. Labour\u2019s members have been working on a strategy for two years. The arguments split three ways: what does remain and reform actually mean, in terms of our relationship with the EU, and our hopes for the continent? What were the real problems unmasked by the referendum result, and what would it take to solve them? And finally, wouldn\u2019t it be inspiring to put these tired, abstract, 60s arguments behind us and concentrate on things that matter? The left in Europe need us, and we need them. We need one another to create the first carbon-free continent, and fast. We need to fight the rise of the far right together, for so many obvious reasons, not least the paradox that violent ethno-nationalists are working tirelessly across borders to cooperate with one another, and no single nation can meet that threat working alone. We need a transnational union movement, a financial transaction tax, an enforceable floor for corporation tax between countries; we need an entire constellation of cooperative measures so that no multinational can get its fingers burned over poor working conditions in Munich and immediately move to Krak\u00f3w, or Stoke. We need to defend such laws and regulations as were co-created along humane and social principles, and unpick the elements of the Lisbon treaty that sought to detach the market from democratic forces and regulatory oversight. The only progressive European voice I have ever heard supporting Brexit did so on the grounds that the UK was so often the impediment to action on climate, or on workers\u2019 rights, that the continent would be better off without us. If we have any ambitions of our own as a force for renewal, or any sense of solidarity in reforming a European project whose negative elements we partly created, we cannot accept that. \u201cFix Britain instead\u201d was the slogan for a second referendum suggested by Tom Kibasi, the head of the IPPR thinktank. Its Prosperity and Justice inquiry last year drew together a set of realities that would be enough to make anybody angry: pathetic wage growth, housing inequality, income inequality, wealth inequality, high household debt, weak government investment, poor research and development, and a tax system that doesn\u2019t meet the needs of public services or the demands of social justice. None of this was driven by EU membership. All of it is more pressing, more meaningful and more within our grasp than any change to our relationship with the EU, which we have seen not just de-prioritise but obliterate the national agenda. There is some overlap between the third argument \u2013 let\u2019s move on \u2013 and the first two, yet it warrants its own category, because the appetite for it is just so strong: the almost unbearable lightness of being able to say no to more of this bilge; no more colonial fantasists; no more throwbacks invoking fake passions about the second world war; no more feckless aristocrats flapping their hands and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fine for that factory to close, manufacturing is so last century and besides, it would have closed anyway\u201d; no more nonsense about superiority and dominance and prowess, while trade deals unravel before they\u2019ve even been stitched; no more chancers taking crash courses in French geography, or Irish history or Chinese diplomacy in real time. Let\u2019s just move on, and talk about things that are real. This is how a remain campaign will be fought, and this is how it will be won. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

Western diplomats said an inspection of the grains stores in Hodeidah port had been carried out by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), but the warring sides still needed to agree on which road could be used to transport supplies from the site to needy recipients. Access to the stores had been denied for six months, and the UN has been warning that the food could rot. The UN is seeking $4.2bn in aid pledges for the whole of 2019, but was not expecting to reach that sum in one conference so early in the year. The main pledges included $500m from Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates each, as well as \u00a3200m from the UK and almost $21m from the United States. The US said it has provided a total of $721m since October 2017. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also each offered $250m in November 2018 for use this year. The Saudis and the UAE \u2013 largely supplied by US and and UK arms manufacturers \u2013 have been fighting to wrest control of the country back from a Houthi-led insurgency that has seized control of the capital, Sana\u2019a, the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, and large tracts of the north of the country bordering Saudi Arabia. The paradox that the wealthy combatants in the civil war are also the largest suppliers of humanitarian aid has been a feature of one of the most brutal and unforgiving of wars. The other big donors on Tuesday were the EU, providing \u20ac161.5m (\u00a3139m), and Kuwait, which provided $250m. In a joint statement, five aid agencies \u2013 Save the Children, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Care International and the International Rescue Committee \u2013 highlighted the paradox of the humanitarian donations from countries involved in the conflict. The statement said: \u201cWe desperately need commitments from some of the very same countries present today to allow unconditional access for humanitarian assistance and commercial imports to all parts of the country. We want to hear world leaders promise to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure such as schools and hospitals, and to hold to account those who disregard international law. \u201cThe countries selling arms to warring parties in Yemen need to stop these deals with immediate effect and put in place strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms, so that devastating weapons will no longer kill and injure civilians in Yemen. Arms must stop flowing into Yemen and political negotiations need to be supported by all involved in this conflict.\u201d With the talks on a possible withdrawal of Houthi troops out of three coastal ports, including Hodeidah, at an impasse, the UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt will fly to Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE the end of the week to assess the state of negotiations. At the summit in Geneva, UAE speakers accused the Houthis of showing no signs of being willing to honour the commitments made at a peace conference in Stockholm in December. But senior UAE ministers have spoken of waiting as long as June to assess the results of political talks before considering whether to resume an all-out attack on Hodeidah. It is estimated that 24 million people, or 80% of the population of Yemen, is in need of aid. The WFP is now reaching about 10 million Yemenis per month with food aid and hopes to scale up to 12 million this year.",

      "bodyText": "Public bodies have already spent close to \u00a310m on lawyers for the Grenfell Tower inquiry, and the final bill is expected to be many times higher when all the initial costs are added up. The first legal bills, which were disclosed in response to freedom of information requests by the Guardian, represent only a fraction of what could become one of the most expensive public inquiries in British history. A large number of lawyers, including 32 QCs, several of whom can charge \u00a3220 an hour, are dissecting the causes of the biggest single loss of life in London since the second world war. The costs to the taxpayer disclosed so far are equivalent to the amount spent on refurbishing the tower, a project that contributed to the June 2017 fire which claimed 72 lives. The bill is likely to rise significantly higher when fees for seven QCs, 11 barristers and 20 firms of solicitors who represented the bereaved, survivors and residents are published later this spring alongside the conclusions of the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, about what happened on the night of the fire. The legal costs for representing the families of the 96 people who died at Hillsborough before and during the two-year inquest which ended in 2016 eventually reached \u00a363.6m. According to disclosures, the Home Office, which is responsible for fire and rescue policy in England, has already spent \u00a32.1m on lawyers, while the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is expected to have spent \u00a35.8m by April. The London Fire Brigade has spent \u00a3600,000, including more than \u00a3250,000 for its lead counsel, Stephen Walsh QC, and his junior, Sarah Le Fevre. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, spent \u00a398,000 instructing counsel and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has spent \u00a3600,000, including nearly \u00a3240,000 on barristers. The Metropolitan police and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation are yet to respond to requests for information, but their spending is likely to push the figure for public bodies\u2019 spending beyond \u00a310m. Legal costs for the first nine months of the inquiry and the cost of renting rooms at the Holborn Bars conference complex will be published when Moore-Bick delivers his findings from phase one of the inquiry. Hearings into how the building was refurbished are unlikely to start before the end of the year, and lawyers have started to comb through 200,000 documents that are expected to be disclosed. Advocates for fair inquests and inquiries stressed it was right that there was \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the 568 people \u2013 mostly the bereaved, survivors and residents (BSRs) \u2013 who have been granted core participant status, the 10 public bodies and the 20 commercial organisations involved in the refurbishment. Deborah Coles, the director of the Inquest charity, said: \u201cAny concern about cost to the public purse should not fall on the families\u2019 side. The BSRs need to be represented to have their voices heard. You can\u2019t compromise on families\u2019 access to a process that is about finding the truth about what happened.\u201d The inquiry is preparing to move into new premises in west London before the second-phase hearings begin, partly to make room for more lawyers, whose numbers are expected to be swollen by the legal teams of the private companies involved in the refurbishment. Twenty companies, including the contractor Rydon, the cladding manufacturer Arconic and the architect Studio E, have already appointed 17 QCs, four barristers, one solicitor advocate and 20 firms of solicitors. Their costs are likely to be met by the companies themselves or their insurers. The inquiry\u2019s own legal team \u2013 four QCs, 22 junior counsel, 10 solicitors and a team of junior barristers and paralegals assembled to review hundreds of thousands of documents \u2013 will further increase the cost to the taxpayer. To limit rising costs, Moore-Bick has told interested parties to share lawyers where possible and has said costs will not be met for \u201csubstantial bodies\u201d or people, such as employees, whose costs could reasonably be expected to be met by such bodies. The cost of the 10-year Savile inquiry into Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland reached \u00a3195m.",

      "body": "<p>Over thousands of years, like humans everywhere, we became used to thinking of the sun, rain and wind as the backdrop to our lives \u2013 external entities over which we had no dominion. In the 21st century, this has become a delusion. The unpredictability of weather in the UK, particularly during summers that many wish were drier and sunnier, is associated by many people with what it means to be British. It has big variations \u2013 temperatures in the north of Scotland can be up to 20C lower than in southern England \u2013 and is characteristically unsettled due to the jet stream. </p> <p>Its unreliability may have aided those wishing to avoid the truth about global warming. But the evidence of our senses, as well as what meteorologists and other scientists tell us, is becoming overwhelming. While many people are enjoying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/26/uk-hottest-winter-day-ever\" title=\"\">this week\u2019s record-breaking temperatures</a> \u2013 20.3C in Wales on Monday, and 21.2C in London on Tuesday, the hottest winter days on record \u2013 many of the same people are also worried. Extreme or unusual weather in the UK is becoming widely recognised as an indication that the climate is changing, though this realisation has been a long time coming.</p> <p>That is understandable. Connections between one-off weather events and longer-term patterns must be drawn with caution. Greenhouse gas emissions do not explain everything. But over the past few years, the <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/\" title=\"\">science of weather attribution</a> has made dramatic advances.

      "bodyText": "Over thousands of years, like humans everywhere, we became used to thinking of the sun, rain and wind as the backdrop to our lives \u2013 external entities over which we had no dominion. In the 21st century, this has become a delusion. The unpredictability of weather in the UK, particularly during summers that many wish were drier and sunnier, is associated by many people with what it means to be British. It has big variations \u2013 temperatures in the north of Scotland can be up to 20C lower than in southern England \u2013 and is characteristically unsettled due to the jet stream. Its unreliability may have aided those wishing to avoid the truth about global warming. But the evidence of our senses, as well as what meteorologists and other scientists tell us, is becoming overwhelming. While many people are enjoying this week\u2019s record-breaking temperatures \u2013 20.3C in Wales on Monday, and 21.2C in London on Tuesday, the hottest winter days on record \u2013 many of the same people are also worried. Extreme or unusual weather in the UK is becoming widely recognised as an indication that the climate is changing, though this realisation has been a long time coming. That is understandable. Connections between one-off weather events and longer-term patterns must be drawn with caution. Greenhouse gas emissions do not explain everything. But over the past few years, the science of weather attribution has made dramatic advances. Using computer models combined with observational data, meteorologists can now analyse extreme events including floods, droughts and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer\u2019s UK heatwave, when average temperatures in June, July and August were 2C above pre-industrial levels, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases. Simply facing this reality as a nation would be a big step forward. For too long, and in defiance of evidence, climate deniers such as former chancellor Lord Lawson were offered prominent platforms to air their views without challenge. Partly as a consequence of such mixed messages, public opinion lags behind scientific knowledge. Recent survey data shows that while 93% of British people know climate change is happening, only 36% believe that humans are mainly responsible, while just 25% describe themselves as very worried. It is too soon to say whether this month\u2019s unseasonal warmth, following last year\u2019s extremes of cold and hot, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s warning that we have just 12 years in which to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C will shift minds further in the right direction.

Yet there\u2019s another billionaire sex scandal stealing the headlines this week: Patriots owner Robert Kraft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/22/robert-kraft-arrest-prostitution-new-england-patriots-owner-latest-news\">has been charged </a>with soliciting prostitution as part of a sex trafficking sting in Florida.</p> <p>Jokes of happy endings aside, Noah noted that the Kraft scandal wasn\u2019t merely a rich man paying for sex; investigators claim that the women involved weren\u2019t willing sex workers, and were forced to serve more than a thousand clients a year. \u201cSo this wasn\u2019t Pretty Woman. It\u2019s more like pretty horrific, which is why these are very serious charges \u2013 unless you\u2019re a Patriots fan,\u201d said Noah before clips of several diehard Patriots fans standing by their owner.</p> <p>The unwavering support for Kraft only demonstrated \u201cwhat\u2019s incredible about sports in America \u2013 if you\u2019re winning, there\u2019s no limit to what your fans will let you get away with,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>That being said, \u201cyou can call it insensitive for these people to just brush aside serious sex crimes like this, but you could also call it \u2018presidential\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at Trump\u2019s constant need for attention. Trump seemed particularly inflamed that the Oscars, held on Sunday night in Los Angeles, didn\u2019t even mention him; the closest anyone strayed to a presidential reference was Spike Lee\u2019s exhortation that Americans \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in the 2020 election. After the show, Trump tweeted disparagingly at Lee, who won his first Oscar for co-writing the screenplay for BlacKkKlansman.</p> <p>\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t mention Trump by name but Trump heard \u2018hate\u2019 and assumed it was about him,\u201d Meyers said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz40QpKQRtU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mz40QpKQRtU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In other news, CNN reported over the weekend that Trump is looking forward to sowing chaos and division among Democrats in the primaries, though those are still a year away. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tagline for a new sitcom \u2013 \u2018he\u2019s bad at government but great at causing chaos. Tune in this fall for The President is a Cat,\u201d Meyers mused.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/us-un-ambassador-kelly-knight-craft-trump-pick\">nomination</a> over the weekend of Kelly Craft as ambassador to the United Nations probably falls into the \u201ccausing chaos\u201d category. Craft, a prominent GOP donor and climate change skeptic, said in a 2017 interview that she believed \u201cthere are sciences on both sides that are accurate \u2026 I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science [on climate change].\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sounds like a sixth-grader who forgot to do a project for the science fair,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cAlso, there are not both sides. There\u2019s one side with all the world\u2019s scientists on it and then there\u2019s the other side, which is just Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjKFJ7UwdS0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NjKFJ7UwdS0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Over in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the hostless Oscars. \u201cThe theme for the Oscars this year was the Grammys,\u201d he said in reference to the show\u2019s numerous musical performances, including Adam Lambert and Queen, Bette Midler and a sensual reprise of A Star Is Born\u2019s breakout song, Shallow.</p> <p>\u201cLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had so much sexual chemistry that about a minute into the song, my wife started ovulating,\u201d Kimmel joked.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s Oscars were also \u201ca historic night for diversity\u201d \u2013 Black Panther won three Oscars, while Roma won three Oscars, including for best director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.</p> <p>Spike Lee won his first Oscar, and then got a shout-out from the president, who tweeted that it would \u201cbe nice if Spike Lee could read his notes\u201d and praised himself for doing more for African Americans than \u201calmost any other Pres!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like that \u2018almost any other Pres\u2019,\u201d Kimmel laughed before sarcastically adding, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that damn Lincoln, I\u2019d be number one!\u201d</p>",

During the summit, Pope Francis warned that abusers within the church would face the full \u201cwrath of God\u201d, also known as \u201cthe ultimate \u2018Just wait until Dad gets home\u2019\u201d, according to Noah. That sentence is serious \u2026 or not. \u201cMany people are pointing out that the wrath of God isn\u2019t a thing,\u201d Noah observed. \u201cYeah, I bet R Kelly heard this and he was like, \u2018Can I also take the wrath of God as my punishment?\u2019\u201d In still other sex scandal news, one of Trump\u2019s cabinet members, Alexander Acosta, is drawing closer scrutiny for his extremely light plea deal with the Florida billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who stood accused a decade ago of sex crimes with girls as young as 14. \u201cYes, you heard that right,\u201d Noah paused. \u201cEleven years ago, the man who is now Trump\u2019s labor secretary basically let a billionaire off the hook for abusing underage girls.\u201d President Trump\u2019s response? \u201cThat seems like a long time ago.\u201d \u201cThink about how crazy this is: there\u2019s a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet who helped a billionaire sex offender sweep a scandal under the rug,\u201d Noah said, incredulous. Yet there\u2019s another billionaire sex scandal stealing the headlines this week: Patriots owner Robert Kraft has been charged with soliciting prostitution as part of a sex trafficking sting in Florida. Jokes of happy endings aside, Noah noted that the Kraft scandal wasn\u2019t merely a rich man paying for sex; investigators claim that the women involved weren\u2019t willing sex workers, and were forced to serve more than a thousand clients a year. \u201cSo this wasn\u2019t Pretty Woman. It\u2019s more like pretty horrific, which is why these are very serious charges \u2013 unless you\u2019re a Patriots fan,\u201d said Noah before clips of several diehard Patriots fans standing by their owner. The unwavering support for Kraft only demonstrated \u201cwhat\u2019s incredible about sports in America \u2013 if you\u2019re winning, there\u2019s no limit to what your fans will let you get away with,\u201d Noah said. That being said, \u201cyou can call it insensitive for these people to just brush aside serious sex crimes like this, but you could also call it \u2018presidential\u2019.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at Trump\u2019s constant need for attention. Trump seemed particularly inflamed that the Oscars, held on Sunday night in Los Angeles, didn\u2019t even mention him; the closest anyone strayed to a presidential reference was Spike Lee\u2019s exhortation that Americans \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in the 2020 election. After the show, Trump tweeted disparagingly at Lee, who won his first Oscar for co-writing the screenplay for BlacKkKlansman. \u201cI love that he didn\u2019t mention Trump by name but Trump heard \u2018hate\u2019 and assumed it was about him,\u201d Meyers said. In other news, CNN reported over the weekend that Trump is looking forward to sowing chaos and division among Democrats in the primaries, though those are still a year away. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tagline for a new sitcom \u2013 \u2018he\u2019s bad at government but great at causing chaos. Tune in this fall for The President is a Cat,\u201d Meyers mused. Trump\u2019s nomination over the weekend of Kelly Craft as ambassador to the United Nations probably falls into the \u201ccausing chaos\u201d category. Craft, a prominent GOP donor and climate change skeptic, said in a 2017 interview that she believed \u201cthere are sciences on both sides that are accurate \u2026 I appreciate and I respect both sides of the science [on climate change].\u201d \u201cShe sounds like a sixth-grader who forgot to do a project for the science fair,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cAlso, there are not both sides. There\u2019s one side with all the world\u2019s scientists on it and then there\u2019s the other side, which is just Donald Trump.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel Over in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped the hostless Oscars. \u201cThe theme for the Oscars this year was the Grammys,\u201d he said in reference to the show\u2019s numerous musical performances, including Adam Lambert and Queen, Bette Midler and a sensual reprise of A Star Is Born\u2019s breakout song, Shallow. \u201cLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had so much sexual chemistry that about a minute into the song, my wife started ovulating,\u201d Kimmel joked. Sunday\u2019s Oscars were also \u201ca historic night for diversity\u201d \u2013 Black Panther won three Oscars, while Roma won three Oscars, including for best director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. Spike Lee won his first Oscar, and then got a shout-out from the president, who tweeted that it would \u201cbe nice if Spike Lee could read his notes\u201d and praised himself for doing more for African Americans than \u201calmost any other Pres!\u201d \u201cI like that \u2018almost any other Pres\u2019,\u201d Kimmel laughed before sarcastically adding, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that damn Lincoln, I\u2019d be number one!\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>Margaret Pollock, bassoonist on Mark Hollis\u2019s self-titled solo album</strong><br>Although it was 20 years ago, I clearly remember the session. I was curious to find out how the sound of a bassoon would fit in to an indie-rock band. Mark had written short \u2018sequences\u2019 of music that he planned to insert between tracks to link the whole album together, or to use as a backing for parts of the tracks.

There\u2019s nature and landscape all through his work, and such a sense of space and emotion. I sometimes find it so overwhelmingly intense that I\u2019m not robust enough to listen to it. Right now, I\u2019m in a park, surrounded by new white sloe blossom, listening to Eden and trying not to let anyone see the faces I\u2019m pulling.</p> <p><strong>Ryley Walker</strong><br>Mark Hollis wrote the playbook for so much of the music that I hold close to my heart. His music has the widest vision and somehow so much isolation: this sort of far-out, Technicolor world with a broken spirit that always gets back up. When I toured with the world\u2019s best storyteller, Danny Thompson [who played on The Colour of Spring and Spirit of Eden], I would ask him about Mark, expecting larger-than-life tales. All Danny said about him was that he was a \u201cmarvellous soul, loved his morning tea\u201d. Turning young record-heads on to Talk Talk and hearing reports back about their brain being shifted is such a thrill. I live for those conversations that begin with: \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t heard Laughing Stock?\u201d A massive loss, to say the least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ef3e0b1c66a313ffac9a270a3d446201fae6177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef3e0b1c66a313ffac9a270a3d446201fae6177/0_450_4315_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He was a genius\u2019 ...

It has one of the best hooks I\u2019ve ever heard and stands up for me as one of the best songs ever written. It always brings me joy when I hear it.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until 1994 that I discovered Talk Talk properly. When we started the very difficult process of recording our third album, Pygmalion, Neil [Halstead] was absorbed in Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. Naturally, this led to me listening to those records, and their influence can be heard throughout Pygmalion.</p> <p>With music, it is often the voice that my ears tend to absorb most. Mark\u2019s voice has such fragile beauty and warmth. Eden floors me every time I hear it \u2013 lyrically it\u2019s so beautiful, and the space and depth of the songs are simply wonderful. In my earlier years, I would have spent my time listening to these songs with headphones on and no doubt had a joint in hand. I still go back to these records time and time again \u2013 sans drugs \u2013 and let them wrap around me like a familiar friend. These records stir a myriad of emotions and give me comfort and peace. I am so sad to hear of Mark\u2019s passing.

I had it on repeat for months. It still illuminates the darkest of times for me and gives comfort where all else fails. Every sound is considered and meaningful and unashamedly emotional and raw. It showed me how powerful music could be, and awoke in me the urge to make music myself. Mark Hollis broke the mould gloriously and left us his truth in music \u2013 the honesty of it will forever be a tonic in my world.</p> <p><strong>Richard Reed Parry, Arcade Fire</strong><br>If there were ever records that defy description, it\u2019s Spirit of Eden, Laughing Stock, and Mark\u2019s solo record. I don\u2019t know of any other albums as confidently soft-spoken and utterly without precedent \u2013 where the sound of the room seems to be as important as any instrument, where the quality of an improvised single note, captured on tape the first time it\u2019s played, is far more important than any amount of rehearsing or catchy pop melody. This trinity of modern chamber, jazz, post-rock masterpieces are some of the most finely crafted albums ever made, with no discernible limits to their scope beyond their own gorgeous sense of self-restraint.</p> <p>I feel so thankful that any band could incorporate such vast amounts of space and silence into their albums: they really created a precedent for artful quietude. And then Mark went and set the quiet bar even higher with his solo album, a gloriously delicate and naturalistic piece of work that I struggle to find words for. I realise as I write that it\u2019s entirely unnecessary, and in fact all I want to say is, thank you for this music and the exquisite silences and spaces within it. They touched me and influenced and inspired me more than I will ever be able to quantify.</p> <p><strong>Jack Barnett, These New Puritans</strong><br>Mark stretched the boundaries of what could be called popular music. He wrote some of the best pop songs ever written, and made some of the best albums ever recorded. In a backslapping musical world of insipid dilettantes, Mark and his music stand for absolute conviction, absolute meaning and the absolute refusal to compromise your vision. We\u2019ve recorded a fair amount with Phill Brown, who engineered the later Talk Talk albums, and he told us so many inspiring and hilarious stories \u2013 a treasure trove of ways to disorient the received wisdom about how to make music \u2013 from which it sounds like Mark was a wonderful human being, too.</p> <p><strong>Felix White, the Maccabees</strong><br>My fleeting impression of Talk Talk was that they were a slightly cheesy synth 80s band that sounded a bit like Duran Duran. That was <em>kind</em> of true. But Mark\u2019s subsequently substantial impact on my life came as an introduction to the band\u2019s later work. After our first two records, my band were making an album that sounded like nothing we\u2019d done before, and to our record label, worryingly unpalatable. We were looking for historical reassurance that we might be able to continue while not exploding our lives in one gesture. Our manager told me to listen first to Colour of Spring, then Spirit of Eden. If Colour of Spring was a small lightning bulb, Spirit of Eden turned my head inside-out. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t live without it. I couldn\u2019t believe I <em>had</em> lived and made music for so long without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca/502_0_2854_3568/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Hollis performing in Dortmund, November 1984.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Musical prankster\u2019 \u2026 Hollis in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once you fall in love with an album, it\u2019s a delicate job to convince someone else to come to the same conclusion. You can be so drunk with your own connection to it that it can be extremely off-putting. There was a danger of that with me and Spirit of Eden. We\u2019d come home from parties and I\u2019d make everyone stop whatever they were doing and lie on the floor to listen to it in its entirety. If anyone moved, I\u2019d bolt upright to shush them. The thing was, it worked.</p> <p>After I had played his solo record [on repeat] as well, I watched the Live at Montreux video from 1986. The genius was in that 80s synth-pop band with mullets and vests and bongos. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more charming than Mark at the start of Talk Talk\u2019s Such a Shame video mouthing to the camera: \u201cHow you doing, you alriggghht?!\u201d before the song starts. As serious as his music would become, it felt like he was telling you: \u201cYeah, being in a band is really stupid, but it\u2019s really fun.\u201d That was just as powerful, really.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FezKvr5naI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1FezKvr5naI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Richard King, author</strong><br>The Talk Talk song New Grass appears on Laughing Stock, the final record credited to the group, and shares its title with an album by Albert Ayler. Laughing Stock was released on Verve, a company that had, in part, appealed to Mark and his remaining bandmates due to the label\u2019s association with jazz.</p> <p>From the group\u2019s inception, Hollis had experimented with song length and structure, but the final trilogy of studio recordings \u2013 The Colour of Spring, Laughing Stock and Mark Hollis \u2013 confirmed that these experiments were borne of an intensity and fearlessness that was equivalent to those of the jazz recordings he held in esteem. The very British, indeed very English emotional space he created in these three albums proved highly influential: the stadium ennui of Radiohead and Coldplay owes a substantial debt to Spirit of Eden\u2019s I Believe in You; the Talk Talk soundworld of diffuse instruments and seemingly random microphone placements first became a signature of post-rock, then familiar as a contemporary production technique.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/26/thank-you-for-soundtracking-my-life-readers-tributes-to-mark-hollis\">'Thank you for soundtracking my life': readers' tributes to Mark Hollis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite his innovations, he frequently sounded frustrated at having reached the limit of both the studio and his own ability. As a counterpoint, he regularly included passages of silence in his compositions. Today, these moments have an added poignancy. They prefigure his retreat from music and now, his death. He leaves a body of work entirely unique in its musical and emotional range: the revelatory sound of a private, British spirituality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cf555f961229a0adc14f08cf0d6c9ff5e01a1ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf555f961229a0adc14f08cf0d6c9ff5e01a1ca/0_115_6688_4013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hollis in London in 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Listening to his albums changes you for ever\u2019 \u2026 Hollis in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Peter Brewis, Field Music</strong><br>We didn\u2019t really know about Talk Talk or Mark Hollis until after he\u2019d stopped releasing music. But through the bands we loved in at the turn of the millennium, we started to find out about the profound influence those last four albums had had on musicians searching for something new, and something of their own. Mark Hollis was an essential part of that long line of music makers \u2013 Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Robert Wyatt, Can \u2013 who seemed to thrive on that search and in the process blurred the boundaries between pop, rock, jazz and classical. To us, his experiment seemed to be one of dynamics and form rather than timbre or technology \u2013 seeing what new things can be done with traditional instruments \u2013 and not in a flashy way, but quietly to the point of secrecy. And maybe it is that which still demands our attention. It was brave and that was hugely important to us.</p> <p><strong>Steven Wilson<br></strong>It\u2019s hard to think of any pop musician to whom the word \u201cintegrity\u201d would apply more than it does Mark. Perhaps Kate Bush. I still think of Spirit of Eden as the most admirable fuck-you to commerciality and the pop mainstream ever made \u2013 and, of course, it\u2019s a much better record than the previous holder of that award, Metal Machine Music. And I loved Mark for it. And on Laughing Stock, the minute-long, one-note noise guitar solo in the otherwise transcendently beautiful After the Flood is one of my favourite Mark moments, showcasing the musical prankster in him. His records still stand for me as the most beautiful pop music ever made, albums where every musical gesture seems somehow sacred. Listening to them changes you for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03b4aa5652b92995757f84de275f507f67210863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b4aa5652b92995757f84de275f507f67210863/0_0_5283_3172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talk Talk in Munich, September 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talk Talk in Munich, September 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dpa picture alliance/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Shara Worden, My Brightest Diamond</strong><br>The day I met drummer Earl Harvin for the first time, we rehearsed some songs and then he made pasta and played me records. It was the first of many listening parties in which we aligned our musical values. Earl played Mark Hollis\u2019 solo record that night and I was shocked by the silence and musical space in the arrangements. The recording quality was rich and warm. We sat listening without talking. That first listening session has defined the last 20 years of our musical relationship as My Brightest Diamond. Mark\u2019s voice, his aesthetic, his care for detail and his songs have been core for us: deeply resonant music to which we continually return.</p> <p><strong>Max Richter</strong><br>Mark Hollis\u2019s death robs us of a visionary talent. When we heard the news, the film mix I\u2019m working on ground to a halt, and we played Spirit of Eden instead. It\u2019s one of a tiny handful of records that I\u2019ve played regularly for decades. The first time I heard it, I felt like I\u2019d found a secret universe, one that contained something I\u2019d been been missing without my being aware of it, and that seemed to promise a way of making sense of the world. I read somewhere that a person\u2019s true legacy is what they leave behind in the hearts of others. By that measure, Mark Hollis left us a very beautiful legacy indeed.<br></p>",

Mary Epworth It\u2019s strangely appropriate that Mark has slipped away while the strangest and sunniest February spring is bursting into life. There\u2019s nature and landscape all through his work, and such a sense of space and emotion. I sometimes find it so overwhelmingly intense that I\u2019m not robust enough to listen to it. Right now, I\u2019m in a park, surrounded by new white sloe blossom, listening to Eden and trying not to let anyone see the faces I\u2019m pulling. Ryley Walker Mark Hollis wrote the playbook for so much of the music that I hold close to my heart. His music has the widest vision and somehow so much isolation: this sort of far-out, Technicolor world with a broken spirit that always gets back up. When I toured with the world\u2019s best storyteller, Danny Thompson [who played on The Colour of Spring and Spirit of Eden], I would ask him about Mark, expecting larger-than-life tales. All Danny said about him was that he was a \u201cmarvellous soul, loved his morning tea\u201d. Turning young record-heads on to Talk Talk and hearing reports back about their brain being shifted is such a thrill. I live for those conversations that begin with: \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t heard Laughing Stock?\u201d A massive loss, to say the least. Rachel Goswell, Slowdive My earliest memory of Talk Talk was hearing Life\u2019s What You Make It on the radio and instantly falling in love. It has one of the best hooks I\u2019ve ever heard and stands up for me as one of the best songs ever written. It always brings me joy when I hear it. But it wasn\u2019t until 1994 that I discovered Talk Talk properly. When we started the very difficult process of recording our third album, Pygmalion, Neil [Halstead] was absorbed in Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. Naturally, this led to me listening to those records, and their influence can be heard throughout Pygmalion. With music, it is often the voice that my ears tend to absorb most. Mark\u2019s voice has such fragile beauty and warmth. Eden floors me every time I hear it \u2013 lyrically it\u2019s so beautiful, and the space and depth of the songs are simply wonderful. In my earlier years, I would have spent my time listening to these songs with headphones on and no doubt had a joint in hand. I still go back to these records time and time again \u2013 sans drugs \u2013 and let them wrap around me like a familiar friend. These records stir a myriad of emotions and give me comfort and peace. I am so sad to hear of Mark\u2019s passing. He was a genius. Julia Biel I was introduced to the masterpiece that is Spirit of Eden as a student. I had it on repeat for months. It still illuminates the darkest of times for me and gives comfort where all else fails. Every sound is considered and meaningful and unashamedly emotional and raw. It showed me how powerful music could be, and awoke in me the urge to make music myself. Mark Hollis broke the mould gloriously and left us his truth in music \u2013 the honesty of it will forever be a tonic in my world. Richard Reed Parry, Arcade Fire If there were ever records that defy description, it\u2019s Spirit of Eden, Laughing Stock, and Mark\u2019s solo record. I don\u2019t know of any other albums as confidently soft-spoken and utterly without precedent \u2013 where the sound of the room seems to be as important as any instrument, where the quality of an improvised single note, captured on tape the first time it\u2019s played, is far more important than any amount of rehearsing or catchy pop melody. This trinity of modern chamber, jazz, post-rock masterpieces are some of the most finely crafted albums ever made, with no discernible limits to their scope beyond their own gorgeous sense of self-restraint. I feel so thankful that any band could incorporate such vast amounts of space and silence into their albums: they really created a precedent for artful quietude. And then Mark went and set the quiet bar even higher with his solo album, a gloriously delicate and naturalistic piece of work that I struggle to find words for. I realise as I write that it\u2019s entirely unnecessary, and in fact all I want to say is, thank you for this music and the exquisite silences and spaces within it. They touched me and influenced and inspired me more than I will ever be able to quantify. Jack Barnett, These New Puritans Mark stretched the boundaries of what could be called popular music. He wrote some of the best pop songs ever written, and made some of the best albums ever recorded. In a backslapping musical world of insipid dilettantes, Mark and his music stand for absolute conviction, absolute meaning and the absolute refusal to compromise your vision. We\u2019ve recorded a fair amount with Phill Brown, who engineered the later Talk Talk albums, and he told us so many inspiring and hilarious stories \u2013 a treasure trove of ways to disorient the received wisdom about how to make music \u2013 from which it sounds like Mark was a wonderful human being, too. Felix White, the Maccabees My fleeting impression of Talk Talk was that they were a slightly cheesy synth 80s band that sounded a bit like Duran Duran. That was kind of true. But Mark\u2019s subsequently substantial impact on my life came as an introduction to the band\u2019s later work. After our first two records, my band were making an album that sounded like nothing we\u2019d done before, and to our record label, worryingly unpalatable. We were looking for historical reassurance that we might be able to continue while not exploding our lives in one gesture. Our manager told me to listen first to Colour of Spring, then Spirit of Eden. If Colour of Spring was a small lightning bulb, Spirit of Eden turned my head inside-out. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t live without it. I couldn\u2019t believe I had lived and made music for so long without it. Once you fall in love with an album, it\u2019s a delicate job to convince someone else to come to the same conclusion. You can be so drunk with your own connection to it that it can be extremely off-putting. There was a danger of that with me and Spirit of Eden. We\u2019d come home from parties and I\u2019d make everyone stop whatever they were doing and lie on the floor to listen to it in its entirety. If anyone moved, I\u2019d bolt upright to shush them. The thing was, it worked. After I had played his solo record [on repeat] as well, I watched the Live at Montreux video from 1986. The genius was in that 80s synth-pop band with mullets and vests and bongos. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more charming than Mark at the start of Talk Talk\u2019s Such a Shame video mouthing to the camera: \u201cHow you doing, you alriggghht?!\u201d before the song starts. As serious as his music would become, it felt like he was telling you: \u201cYeah, being in a band is really stupid, but it\u2019s really fun.\u201d That was just as powerful, really. Richard King, author The Talk Talk song New Grass appears on Laughing Stock, the final record credited to the group, and shares its title with an album by Albert Ayler. Laughing Stock was released on Verve, a company that had, in part, appealed to Mark and his remaining bandmates due to the label\u2019s association with jazz. From the group\u2019s inception, Hollis had experimented with song length and structure, but the final trilogy of studio recordings \u2013 The Colour of Spring, Laughing Stock and Mark Hollis \u2013 confirmed that these experiments were borne of an intensity and fearlessness that was equivalent to those of the jazz recordings he held in esteem. The very British, indeed very English emotional space he created in these three albums proved highly influential: the stadium ennui of Radiohead and Coldplay owes a substantial debt to Spirit of Eden\u2019s I Believe in You; the Talk Talk soundworld of diffuse instruments and seemingly random microphone placements first became a signature of post-rock, then familiar as a contemporary production technique. Despite his innovations, he frequently sounded frustrated at having reached the limit of both the studio and his own ability. As a counterpoint, he regularly included passages of silence in his compositions. Today, these moments have an added poignancy. They prefigure his retreat from music and now, his death. He leaves a body of work entirely unique in its musical and emotional range: the revelatory sound of a private, British spirituality. Peter Brewis, Field Music We didn\u2019t really know about Talk Talk or Mark Hollis until after he\u2019d stopped releasing music. But through the bands we loved in at the turn of the millennium, we started to find out about the profound influence those last four albums had had on musicians searching for something new, and something of their own. Mark Hollis was an essential part of that long line of music makers \u2013 Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Robert Wyatt, Can \u2013 who seemed to thrive on that search and in the process blurred the boundaries between pop, rock, jazz and classical. To us, his experiment seemed to be one of dynamics and form rather than timbre or technology \u2013 seeing what new things can be done with traditional instruments \u2013 and not in a flashy way, but quietly to the point of secrecy. And maybe it is that which still demands our attention. It was brave and that was hugely important to us. Steven Wilson It\u2019s hard to think of any pop musician to whom the word \u201cintegrity\u201d would apply more than it does Mark. Perhaps Kate Bush. I still think of Spirit of Eden as the most admirable fuck-you to commerciality and the pop mainstream ever made \u2013 and, of course, it\u2019s a much better record than the previous holder of that award, Metal Machine Music. And I loved Mark for it. And on Laughing Stock, the minute-long, one-note noise guitar solo in the otherwise transcendently beautiful After the Flood is one of my favourite Mark moments, showcasing the musical prankster in him. His records still stand for me as the most beautiful pop music ever made, albums where every musical gesture seems somehow sacred. Listening to them changes you for ever. Shara Worden, My Brightest Diamond The day I met drummer Earl Harvin for the first time, we rehearsed some songs and then he made pasta and played me records. It was the first of many listening parties in which we aligned our musical values. Earl played Mark Hollis\u2019 solo record that night and I was shocked by the silence and musical space in the arrangements. The recording quality was rich and warm. We sat listening without talking. That first listening session has defined the last 20 years of our musical relationship as My Brightest Diamond. Mark\u2019s voice, his aesthetic, his care for detail and his songs have been core for us: deeply resonant music to which we continually return. Max Richter Mark Hollis\u2019s death robs us of a visionary talent. When we heard the news, the film mix I\u2019m working on ground to a halt, and we played Spirit of Eden instead. It\u2019s one of a tiny handful of records that I\u2019ve played regularly for decades. The first time I heard it, I felt like I\u2019d found a secret universe, one that contained something I\u2019d been been missing without my being aware of it, and that seemed to promise a way of making sense of the world. I read somewhere that a person\u2019s true legacy is what they leave behind in the hearts of others. By that measure, Mark Hollis left us a very beautiful legacy indeed.",

      "bodyText": "Facebook has said it remains committed to ensuring that the contractors who moderate its sites are treated fairly and with respect by their employers, after a report revealed the traumatic experiences of many of the low-paid workers who keep violence, hate speech and sexual imagery off its platforms. The vast majority of the more than 15,000 people who work as Facebook moderators are employed by third-party contractors, and their working conditions are often far from the stereotype of a perk-filled Silicon Valley job. According to a report in the Verge, Facebook moderators at one contractor are paid $15 an hour and work in conditions more like a call centre than the frontline of a $500bn company. They get short, rigorously enforced breaks, leading to long queues in tiny bathrooms; oppressive oversight of workrate and accuracy leaves workers feeling under pressure to spend no more than 30 seconds on each item and to moderate hundreds every day without getting more than one in 20 wrong; and they are barred for security reasons for carrying any phones, pieces of paper or even gum wrappers into the office, it is claimed. Moderators also told the Verge they were developing \u201cPTSD-like symptoms\u201d owing to the nature of some of the work, which can involve watching graphic violent or sexual content in order to make a decision about the correct reason for removing it. Some said they coped by sharing dark jokes about suicide and getting high in breaks, and some had been caught having sex in the stairwells. One said the enforced secrecy forged closer ties: \u201cIf you\u2019re not allowed to talk to your friends or family about your job, that\u2019s going to create some distance. You might feel closer to these people.

      "bodyText": "Britain has rightly been criticised by the international court for its appalling treatment of former inhabitants of the Chagos archipelago almost 50 years ago (Britain ordered to return Chagos Islands to Mauritius, 26 February). But the court displays little knowledge of the situation today. All but Diego Garcia and just one of the larger islands (30 out of 50) are infested with rats and uninhabitable. Billions would be required to restore them to a condition able to support significant populations. A poor country like Mauritius could never afford even a fraction of the cost. The ecological danger to the planet is that Mauritius would flog off Chagos\u2019s fishing rights to Japanese and other commercial operators, as it did with its own rights. The current 200-mile exclusion zone provides a unique ocean laboratory where all manner of marine life thrives and can be studied. Much has been destroyed by man everywhere else. Whatever the outcome, it must be retained, maintained and protected. Jonathan Hunt London \u2022 China was furious when the judgment of the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague ruled in July 2016 against its claims to huge areas of the South China Sea where on various uninhabited reefs, shoals and rocks it had already set up military infrastructure. Its ambitions are highly controversial, but it hasn\u2019t turfed anyone from their home. The sensitivity of the region didn\u2019t, however, deter the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, from vowing to send the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the area in his speech on \u201cdefence in Global Britain\u201d earlier this month. Between 1967 and 1973 the UK expelled the Chagos islanders from their Indian Ocean home so that the largest island could be used as a strategic military base. Now that the international court of justice has ruled that the UK should end its wrongful administration, one wonders whether China will feel it should deploy its carrier Liaoning in the region in order to \u201cuse its global capabilities to strengthen its global presence\u201d, to borrow Williamson\u2019s phrase.

Meanwhile, the continued cloud of uncertainty would act as a drag on the economy for a longer period.</p> <p>Ahead of next month\u2019s vote on extending article 50, companies face the prospect of a potential double cliff-edge to plan around.

Companies across Britain now face the growing likelihood that the Brexit process could be delayed beyond the end of March, after Theresa May told parliament that MPs would get a vote on Thursday 14 March on extending the article 50 process \u2013 if the Commons has not passed a deal by then, and if MPs vote to reject no-deal. While that would postpone damage to the economy from crashing out on 29 March, it would not remove the risk of no-deal Brexit at a later date. Meanwhile, the continued cloud of uncertainty would act as a drag on the economy for a longer period. Ahead of next month\u2019s vote on extending article 50, companies face the prospect of a potential double cliff-edge to plan around. It also comes after the government has in recent months issued repeated warnings telling firms to prepare for a no-deal Brexit next month. A spokeswoman for financial firms in the City warned that an extension to article 50 could leave firms in limbo. Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s plan but also warned that it must not be \u201ca bridge to nowhere\u201d. McGuinness said a deal was needed \u201cto enable City firms to plan for the future\u201d. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said it was a \u201cpositive step\u201d that MPs would now have the chance to avoid a no-deal exit. But he added: \u201cRather than ending the uncertainty, the PM has instead created a potential double cliff-edge that businesses will need to plan for.\u201d Businesses have spent the past two years preparing for a potential cliff-edge Brexit on 29 March, ramping up their planning in recent months as parliament has become increasingly gridlocked over the issue. Some observers said it was too late for companies to alter their plans. BMW has set out plans to shut its Mini plant for a month at the end of March to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. Many businesses have raised their stockpiling efforts in recent months in anticipation of the March Brexit date, while others are relocating activities elsewhere within the EU or otherwise changing their plans. Although buying more political manoeuvring time and avoiding immediate harm to the economy, dragging out the article 50 process could have the perverse impact of weighing on economic growth. The British economy has come close to stalling over recent months, with analysts blaming the looming deadline. James Smith, an economist at the City bank ING, said: \u201cA shorter extension might have short-term political and practical advantages, but it would likely be more damaging for the economy. \u201cA longer extension, while potentially more politically awkward for the UK government, could see growth recover a touch in the near-term as the imminent no-deal threat recedes.\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said avoiding no-deal Brexit at the end of March was essential, but added: \u201cTo avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate.\u201d May told MPs that any extension was likely to be short and \u201calmost certainly \u2026 a one-off\u201d, potentially for only as long as until the end of June, so as to avoid Britain having to take part in European elections in summer.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The pound has surged after Theresa May finally conceded that MPs should be given a vote on whether to extend Article 50, rather than crash out of the EU without a deal in a month\u2019s time. Sterling has jumped by around 1% against the euro to a 21-month high, around \u20ac1.164, and to a five-month high against the US dollar at $1.324. City traders are calculating that a disorderly Brexit is less likely, while there\u2019s still a chance that May\u2019s deal is eventually approved by MPs (although there wasn\u2019t much support for it in parliament today). Business leaders, though, fear that they could faces another cliff edge this summer - if MPs only approve a short extension. The Bank of England is getting ready for market volatility, by launching new weekly liquidity auctions. They will help banks and building societies get their hands on sterling, in the event of a squeeze after a no-deal Brexit. BoE governor Mark Carney warned that growth would suffer if Britain crashes out without a transition deal, adding that the country doesn\u2019t have enough warehouses to handle stock-piling demands. In an prize-example of non-preparedness, Britain has discovered that it doesn\u2019t even have enough suitable pallets to trade with the EU, if it leaves without a deal. In Washington, Jerome Powell has emphasised that the US Federal Reserve will be patient when considering future interest rate moves. Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action on Brexit: Goodnight! GW Jay Powell has tried to sidestep a question about political interference. Asked if anybody at the White House had communicated with him \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d about interest rates, Powell would only say that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to discuss private conversations with any other government officials. Obviously the Federal Reserve is meant to be independent, and free from meddling. However, that ship sailed once Donald Trump started blasting the Fed\u2019s politics on Twitter. Sterling\u2019s surge has dragged down stock prices of UK multinationals who have large overseas earnings, such as British American Tobacco (down 2%). This has helped the FTSE 100 to underperform other European markets. The blue-chip index has closed down 32 points, while the German DAC gained 0.3% and France\u2019s CAC also closed higher. Back in Washington, Jerome Powell has poured some cold water on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). This is the idea that a government which controls its own currency can always fund its spending plans, regardless of deficit levels, and isn\u2019t reliant on borrowing in the markets. It\u2019s becoming a hot topic, as US politicians push policies such as the New Green Deal. Powell tells the Senate banking committee that he hasn\u2019t seen a detailed explanation of how MMT would work in practice, but that the idea that deficits don\u2019t matter is wrong. Here\u2019s Guy Foster, Brewin Dolphin\u2019s Head of Research, on today\u2019s Brexit developments: \u201cTheresa May must feel more like a seamstress than a prime minister given how much time she spends trying to knit together opposing camps within her party. By offering a short extension she has effectively weakened the means by which Parliament could demand a long extension. There will be no majority for a no deal Brexit whereas an extension should pass.\u201d Back in the markets, sterling is banging out new highs against other major currencies. The pound has now hit \u20ac1.166 against the euro, up 1% or 1.3 eurocents today. That\u2019s a fresh 21-month high against the single currency. Sterling is also rampant against the US dollar, up more than one and a half cents to $1.326. That\u2019s the highest since September 2018. This comes after several prominent MPs welcomed Theresa May\u2019s pledge for a vote to extend Article 50 next month, if her deal doesn\u2019t pass. It appears that the Cooper-Letwin amendment, to formally rule out a No-Deal Brexit, might not be voted on tomorrow after all, as it\u2019s no longer needed. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains: Jay Powell is now giving Senators a lesson on the US labor market, and the risk that people earn less in a new job than they\u2019d get on welfare: Jay Powell has warned the Senate that it would be a very serious mistake not to raise the USA debt ceiling. The Fed chair says it would be a \u201cvery big deal\u201d if America was unable to repay its bills, causing serious negative impact to the economy. Jay Powell is now taking questions from members of the Senate banking committee in Washington. On the economic outlook, he says the Fed wants to use its tools to sustain the current expansion. On energy, he says America\u2019s shale industry is a \u201creal positive\u201d. Because shale producers pump more oil when prices rise, it acts as a \u201cshock-absorber\u201d to prevent inflation getting out of control as in the 1970. On trade, Powell warns that \u201cuncertainty is the enemy of business.\u201d The Fed has been hearing for months that the uncertainty over America\u2019s trade links (due to the dispute with China) has had some impact on confidence. And on US financial stability, he says America\u2019s banks are strong - with no bank failures in 2018. Jay Powell has also taken the opportunity to tell Congress that America has too much economic inequality, and too much debt too. He\u2019s challenging Senators to do more to help their citizens, saying: Productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies. Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges. And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy. Fed chair Jerome Powell also cites Brexit as a key source of uncertainty that could threaten financial markets. He tells the Senate banking committee that the mood in the world economy has darkened: Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is starting to give his bi-annual testimony to the US Senate. And the top line is that Powell is reiterating that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t rush to raise US interest rates. Echoing the message from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, a month ago, Powell says: In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes. Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve. Powell also says that the US jobs market remains \u2018strong\u2019, with low-skilled workers getting the highest wage growth recently. Brexit has already cast a cloud over UK investors, who are now the gloomiest in Europe, according to new research from UBS Global Wealth Management. UBS has found that City investors are much more anxious than those in rival financial centres like Frankfurt or Paris, even though the eurozone economy has weakened in recent quarters. Nick Tucker, Head of UK Domestic at UBS Wealth Management, explains: \u201cAs we get closer to the UK\u2019s official departure from the EU at the end of March, this survey shows that political turbulence is dragging on investor sentiment in the UK compared to the rest of the region. UK investors seem to have dramatically lowered expectations for 2019 in almost every sense, from expected financial returns to their outlook for the economy.\u201d \u201cFrom our conversations with clients up and down the country, we know that investors are anxious. Here are the main findings from the report: The domestic political environment is the top concern for over half (55%) of UK investors, compared to 43% among EMEA investors Less than one third of UK investors (28%) are now optimistic in their outlook for the European economy over next 12 months, compared to over half of EMEA investors (53%) A quarter of business owners are pessimistic about the outlook for their business in 2019, compared to 12% of EMEA investors Investors advised to maintain exposure to sterling and UK assets at benchmark levels Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects that today\u2019s offer is just another attempt by the PM to get her deal over the line: The boss of Vauxhall\u2019s parent company, PSA, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to \u2018unpopular\u2019 decisions, such as job cuts and factory closures. Carlos Tavares warned this morning: \u201cWe can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will.\u201d Tavares also warned that a disorderly Brexit would disrupt supply chains at Vauxhall, which employs hundreds of people in Luton, and at Ellesmere Port in the North West. Here\u2019s Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General: \u201cMoves to avert no deal in March are essential. There are now proposals from Parliament and Government. But they are just one step. To avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate. Compromise is the only way.\u201d Claire Walker, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), has warned business leaders to keep preparing for all Brexit possibilities: \u201cThe overriding priority is still to assure businesses and communities that an unwanted \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario will not happen by default on March 29th. \u201cBusinesses still need to ensure they are preparing for all possible scenarios and government and its agencies must provide clear, precise and accurate information for all eventualities.\u201d Edwin Morgan, interim Director General of the Institute of Directors, has welcomed Theresa May\u2019s commitment to let MPs vote on extending Article 50. Morgan also warned that most UK firms simply aren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit (not least if they need a pallet to ship goods to Europe!). \u201cThe Prime Minister is right to put her cards on the table for what happens if she fails to get approval for a withdrawal deal by 12 March. Parliament must feel and accept the weight of responsibility that is on their shoulders. The message from our members is clear, nearly 80% would choose to avoid a no-deal outcome. Too much information about that scenario is still missing \u2013 including from our own Government \u2013 for firms to be ready in a few short weeks. \u201cSeeing the impasse continue may not be comfortable for businesses, but a disorderly exit could bring unbearable disruption for firms in sectors from farming to finance, manufacturing to business services, across the UK. It is a long time since we have been in a world of easy choices, and while an extension is not an end in itself, it may become a necessity to achieve an orderly exit.\u201d Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has put his finger on the problem with May\u2019s announcement -- a short A50 extension creates the risk of crashing out in June, rather than March. The pound wobbled during Theresa May\u2019s statement, as the PM made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to see Brexit delayed - even though she\u2019s finally accepted that it could be pushed beyond 29th March. But it\u2019s still clinging onto its 21-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.162, and a four-month high against the US dollar at $1.32. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says May has pushed UK\u2019s fate onto the cliff edge: She has said \u2018chose between my deal or delay the Brexit\u2019. This political circus has become a real joke. Investors do not need uncertainty and there was a lot of optimism in the market because investors were thinking that no deal scenario is off the table, but now, it seems like it is still on the table. And as Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam points out, UK businesses won\u2019t relish the prospect of more uncertainty. Theresa May is giving a Brexit statement to the House of Commons right now. And the Big News is that parliament will hold up to THREE votes on Brexit in two week\u2019s time. May outlines her plan: The government will hold a second meaningful vote on the PM\u2019s Withdrawal Deal by 12 March at the latest. If the government doesn\u2019t win a meaningful vote, it will table a motion on 13 March to ask whether the House supports leaving the EU on 29th March without a deal. If MPs reject leaving without a deal, the government will hold a vote on a \u201cshort, limited\u201d extension to Article 50 on March 14th. But the PM also warns that she doesn\u2019t want to see Article 50 extended, saying a short extension would create an even sharper cliff edge this summer. And a long extension would mean taking part in the next elections for the European Parliament in May (hardly what Leave voters wanted). Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: With Mark Carney\u2019s hearing now over, Royal Bank of Canada have spotted that the probability of Brexit happening on time has fallen to just 14% (as implied by odds on Betfair, anyway). Instead, an exit in April-June now looks most likely, followed by no Brexit at all. RBC\u2019s Adam Cole adds that a 2nd referendum looks more likely, but still isn\u2019t at all certain, writing: There is little doubt that Labour support for a second referendum is a necessary condition for such a referendum happening, but it is far from sufficient. That the implied probability of second referendum happening has also risen (second chart; now around 33%) is not surprising, but again there are limits to how far this can run. In particular, it seems highly unlikely that an amendment that backed a second referendum would make it through the Commons, given that there is little support on the government benches and many Labour MPs in Brexit-voting constituencies are also opposed. Q: If the pound fell after a no-deal Brexit, wouldn\u2019t that boost growth? Mark Carney stamps, firmly, on the notion that crashing out of the EU would be good for the economy. The role of a flexible exchange rate is to act as a shock-absorber. A no-deal, no transition Brexit would be a shock, it would be a negative shock. He cites BoE forecasts that a smooth transition to WTO trading terms would lead to the pound plunging by between 8.5% and 10%, and a 2.5% drop in GDP compared to last November\u2019s forecasts. So the weaker currency is \u201can offset, but it is swamped, overwhelmed by the loss of trade access,\u201d the governor explains. Asked about consumer spending, Mark Carney replies that consumers are making fewer big-ticket purchases such as houses and cars, but overall consumption growth has held up well. He also says the Bank isn\u2019t picking up any material sign that households are stockpiling ahead of Brexit (some families have been stocking up on pharmaceuticals products, food, and pet supplies). Q: Consumer confidence and spending, especially in Leave areas, has been consistently more positive than economist forecasts. Does that suggest economists are too pessimistic about Brexit, or has the impact of Brexit simply not hit people yet? Governor Carney says we don\u2019t know what form Brexit will take, and how long it will take to get there, so you can\u2019t make that judgement yet. Heads-up: Just fixed a typo in that 11.17am post -- Mark Carney predicted that the Bank\u2019s GROWTH forecasts will be lower after a no-deal Brexit. Q: Why are some businesses much more worried about Brexit than others? MPC member Dr Gertjan Vlieghe explains that the effects are very unevenly distributed across the economy. A specialist manufacturer which buys basic raw materials, such as chemicals or steel, and turns it into a high-value product won\u2019t be particularly affected by Brexit. But Brexit is an \u201cexistential\u201d issue to a company that is part of a major automotive supply chain, Vleighe adds. Q: Are there enough warehouses to handle the stock-piling necessary for a no-deal Brexit? No there are not, Mark Carney replies, saying that one of the issues facing UK firms is a shortage of warehouse space. There\u2019s a limit to warehousing capacity, and also how much you can stockpile to keep factories running, he adds, citing the just-in-time \u201clean supply chains\u201d used by the car industry and aerospace manufacturers. Q: So we\u2019re looking at chaos? Carney declines to use that particular word, saying only that it would be an economic shock. Mark Carney then warns MPs that growth will suffer if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The Treasury Committee is now grilling governor Mark Carney over the prospect of Brexit delay. Carney warns that simply kicking the can down the road isn\u2019t as good for the economy as reaching a deal, saying: There\u2019s a big difference between an extension of Article 50, even a long extension, and an agreement with a transition to a known end stage. Wherever we\u2019re headed, it would serve the economy well to have a transition period to that new world, so that people knew soon where they\u2019re headed, businesses could reorganise their affairs and get ready for this new world, and government could finish its tasks. Carney also points out that Brexit uncertainty will linger well beyond Britain\u2019s day of departure (as Westminster will need to negotiate a future relationship with Brussels, and strike new trade deals with the rest of the world). Back in parliament, Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about a recent speech calling Brexit an \u2018acid test\u2019 for the new world order. Q: How can Brexit could be used to enhance Britain\u2019s openness, competitiveness and productivity, and rebalance the economy? \u201cFantastic\u201d, mutters Carney, when faced with this poser. But the governor makes some good points - about the important of having flexibility to set your own rules on financial stability, rather than simply being a rule taker. But Carney then takes a much wider view, telling the Treasury Committee that there needs to be a \u201creinvestment of economic gains, so that everyone moves up\u201d. He cites the rise in fintech, saying: How do you provide a framework for new financial technology, not just to benefit the City, but also to help small and medium enterprises in Dover, Deal, Dulwich or... Dunfermline. Don\u2019t forget Doncaster, Darlington, and Dorchester, the MPs chant back. Carney\u2019s bigger point is that globalisation is creating problems, so politicians needs to redistribute the gains made in recent decades. He sites the US-China trade war, saying: The tensions in globalisation are actually starting to affect the global outlook. They are bigger, they\u2019re structural, they require a more deliberate response, and it has to balance some element of redistribution and reinvestment of the gains of globalisation. As well as getting the balance between democratic accountability and standards that are high enough - whether for financial stability, product safety, or environmental standards - that we have confidence that we can trade freely. Carney adds that he doesn\u2019t expect a global recession. But the biggest risk that could trigger such a downturn is around globalisation. My personal view is that the challenges around trade globally have structural drivers. The solution isn\u2019t a textbook solution that \u2018free trade is good\u2019. DOUBLE BOOM! Sterling has just hit a four-month high against the US dollar, touching $1.323 for the first time since mid-October. BOOM! The pound has just hit a 21-month high against the euro, as speculation of a Brexit delay sweeps through the City. Sterling is trading at \u20ac1.162 for the first time since May 2017, up almost one eurocent or 0.8% this morning. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the the pound is soaring on hopes of a soft Brexit, or a second referendum. Erlam explains that a hard Brexit looks less likely, if Theresa May agrees to take no-deal off the table at today\u2019s cabinet meeting, The pound is tearing higher on Tuesday as we await another vote in Parliament tomorrow \u2013 albeit not on May\u2019s deal, again. The decision comes as the opposition Labour Party threw its support behind a second referendum if it couldn\u2019t get its own Brexit deal over the line and Theresa May opened the door to an extension, having failed to secure amendments with the EU in time for tomorrow\u2019s vote. These are all bullish scenarios for the pound, despite remaining the unlikely options, not only for what they put on the table but also for who they put pressure on. The ERG \u2013 a group of hardline Brexiteers \u2013 many of whom favour a harder Brexit and some no-deal, will not be pleased with the recent developments with another referendum jeopardising the whole process and an extension threatening it. That may force them to reluctantly support May\u2019s deal, when push comes to shove. Sterling has also risen further against the US dollar, over $1.32 for the first time in a month. Our Politics Live blog is covering all the action from Westminster: Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan brings up another important issue - diversity at the Bank of England. She reminds Mark Carney that he told the Bank\u2019s Court that there was a particular problem with retaining ethnic minority staff, who are underrepresented at every level of the central bank. Morgna also cites a report in the Times last week that BAME staff were more critical of the Bank\u2019s culture -- citing inappropriate language and behaviour, and problems in progressing within the Bank. She says BAME employees perceived a lack of transparency in hiring and firing, and were critical of the Bank\u2019s narrow recruitment base. This is not good. Carney replies that the Bank management take the issue of diversity seriously, and have made considerable progress. In the last five years (since Carney arrived), the proportion of BAME staff at the BoE has risen from 13% to 19%, and from 2% to 5% of senior management. Last year, BAME recruits made up 39% of new hires, Carney adds, citing blind recruitment, inclusive management policies, and pooled hiring decisions. But, he also concedes that the experience for BAME colleagues is \u201cnotably different, notably worse, than for other colleagues\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied with the progress made. It\u2019s not just about numbers. Governor Mark Carney adds that the Bank will provide \u2018all the stimulus it can\u2019 if Britain leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. Interest rates could either rise or fall in that scenario, he adds, pointing out that a no-deal Brexit will probably be inflationary (as the pound would surely plunge, pushing up import costs). Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to raise, or lower, interest rates after a no-deal Brexit, asks Nicky Morgan MP. It\u2019s clear that the Bank\u2019s top policymakers are split on this issue. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe argues that borrowing costs won\u2019t go up. He tells the Treasury committee that the shock to consumer confidence will be so severe that the Bank will either leave policy unchanged, or cut rates. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden isn\u2019t convinced, though. He fears a supply-shock if Britain crashes out of the EU, with port disruption making imports scarcer. That would drive up inflation, as businesses and consumers scrapped for goods. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee now. And he\u2019s started with some news -- the Bank is preparing to pump more liquidity into the UK financial system if needed. With Brexit tensions mounting, the Bank will now hold liquidity auctions every week, rather than monthly, from the start of March until the end of April. Carney tells the committee that this is a prudent and precautionary move. It will allow around 100 banks and building societies to get extra cash in sterling, in return for handing the BoE eligible collateral (a range of financial securities). The Bank of England stands ready to provide liquidity in all major currencies. This would be valuable if the financial system seized up after a disorderly Brexit. Carney insists that the Bank isn\u2019t seeing any liquidity stresses in the market, and that the move is part of \u201cnormal contingency planning\u201d. Carney is appearing along with deputy governor Dave Ramsden and monetary policy committee members Jan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. We\u2019ll watch out for any major developments. Just in: The richest households in the UK saw their income grow last year, while the poorest families got poorer. That\u2019s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has published new income distribution data this morning. It shows that the average income of the poorest fifth of the population contracted by 1.6%, mainly driven by fall in the average value of cash benefits. The average income of the richest fifth, on the other hand, increased by 4.7% due largely to increases in wages. The ONS adds: Over the slightly longer term, it is the average income of the poorest fifth that has risen the most, up 11.6% since 2008, whilst the income of the richest fifth has risen 4.9% over the same period. That\u2019s all well and good... however, a 11.6% increase on a tiny household budget is rather smaller than a 4.9% boost to a City bankers\u2019 wallet. The pound is holding onto its earlier gains, still trading at a one-month high against the euro (at \u20ac1.158) and the US dollar ($1.316). Michael Brown, senior analyst at currency exchange firm Caxton FX, says the prospect of a Brexit extension is supporting sterling: The pound\u2019s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, with reports this morning that the Prime Minister is set to discuss the matter with Cabinet before laying a motion in the Commons this afternoon. Though a delay is simply pushing back the exit date, and doesn\u2019t solve anything itself, markets are taking solace in the fact that such a move would delay a \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 no-deal scenario. Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near-term, though political headwinds remain including the opposition Labour Party calling for a 2nd Brexit referendum In a worrying example of Brexit non-planning, Britain doesn\u2019t have the right sort of pallets to keep trading with the EU if it leaves without a deal. According to Business Insider, the UK government is due to hold emergency talks with industry leaders today after discovering this hitch. The problem is that the EU insists that all pallets entering the bloc from third-countries are heat-treated, to prevent any nasty pests or microbes getting in. That\u2019s not a requirement today (on the grounds that EU countries have similar biological life). So there\u2019s going to be an unseemly scramble for any scarce certified pallets soon, unless Brexit is delayed or Theresa May\u2019s deal is voted through. BI\u2019s Adam Payne says this has come as a nasty shock to the government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has arranged for a conference call with various figures to take place on Tuesday to discuss the alarming pallet shortage, with just 31 days until Brexit day on March 29. \u201cIt is the tiny, procedural, mundane-seeming stuff that will absolutely trip people up,\u201d one industry figure briefed by Theresa May\u2019s government told BI, adding that the country was \u201cnot even remotely ready\u201d for no-deal. There\u2019s really no excuse for DEFRA not spotting the pallet issue earlier. Last October, Universal Pallets warned that this issue would cause delays for exporters, as it takes time to heat-treat pallets and get them stamped. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is urging the government to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Marshall warns that many UK companies - and the government itself - simply aren\u2019t ready for a disorderly exit. \u201cAt this pivotal moment, the government must take decisive steps to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit would cause to business and the economy in just a month\u2019s time. \u201cIt is time to be honest. Government and its agencies are not prepared for a \u2018no deal\u2019 exit on 29th March. Neither are many businesses. \u201cThe overriding priority must be to assure businesses, employees, investors and communities that an unwanted \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario will not be allowed to happen by default on March 29th.\u201d Two weeks ago, the Bank of England reported that HALF UK companies hasn\u2019t drawn up contingency plans for no-deal.... The CBI\u2019s chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned MPs that they need to use any Brexit delay wisely: Bullish traders are piling into the pound this morning, lured by the prospect of a Brexit delay, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Sterling has rallied on movements in the political space that have encouraged the bulls. First, Labour is now backing a second referendum - one u-turn. If anything, though, this just hints at the party worrying about an exodus to The Independent Group. Secondly, and more importantly, there appears to be building pressure on the prime minister to take no deal off the table - another u-turn. If no deal is abandoned, it would likely entail a delay to Brexit, and whilst assuaging concerns about crashing out without a deal in place, it would not remove all the uncertainty. A key cabinet meeting today will reveal all \u2013 we hope. Ouch. UK engineering services group Babcock has warned the City that Brexit will cost it millions of pounds, every year. That\u2019s on top of a \u00a310m bill for restructuring its European aerial business, which provides emergency medical and firefighting services. This will allow it to meet EU rules on ownership, and flying rights, once Britain has left the EU. In a statement to shareholders, the aerospace and defence company says: The UK exiting the EU has resulted in additional costs as we restructure our aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements. There is a one-off tax cost of around \u00a310 million this year and we estimate that additional ongoing costs related to the operation of the new structures will be around \u00a310 million per year. Babcock\u2019s Emergency Medical Services provides air ambulance operators in Europe, and also Australia, and can provide its own doctors and nurses in a emergency. It also operates an Aerial Firefighting division -- increasingly in demand, as climate change leads to more wildfires. Shares in the company, which also refits ships and submarines and decommissions nuclear power stations, have fallen over 3% following today\u2019s news. Roland Rudd, who chairs the People\u2019s Vote campaign, believes a second Brexit referendum is looking more likely. The new Independent Group are also backing the plan: But... some Labour MPs representing constituencies who voted Leave in June 2016 wouldn\u2019t support another referendum, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh tweeted last night: The Financial Times also expects MPs to be offered the chance to delay Brexit, saying: If MPs reject a revised deal in a vote set to take place before March 12, Mrs May will then offer a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or take a \u201cshort extension\u201d of the Article 50 exit process. A Brexit delay now looks that \u201cmost likely path forward\u201d, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada. He told City clients this morning: The PM will open the way for a \u201cshort\u201d Brexit delay at a cabinet meeting this morning, according to reports, and outline the terms in her statement to the Commons this afternoon, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s debate. If the meaningful vote by (likely on) March 12 fails, MPs would be given a second vote on leaving with no deal or delaying Brexit which would almost certainly result in delay and this now appears the most likely path forward. We note, however, that proxy markets were yesterday attaching only a 20% probability to Brexit happening \u201con time.\u201d The pound has jumped to its highest level in four weeks this morning, amid speculation that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union could be delayed. Sterling has rallied half a eurocent against the euro to \u20ac1.158, its highest level since 25th January. That\u2019s nearly a 10-month high. The pound is also strengthening against the US dollar, up half a cent to $1.315, for the first time since the end of January. Last night, The Sun newspaper reported that Theresa May will today propose to Cabinet that she formally rules out a No Deal Brexit on March 29, opening the door to a delay. That could delay Brexit by weeks, or even months, if parliament fails to back her Withdrawal Agreement in the next few weeks. More here: Theresa May to propose to Cabinet today that she formally rules out No-Deal Brexit This would be a dizzying u-turn by the PM, who has long argued that Britain is leaving on the 29th March, come what may. But several cabinet ministers have been piling heavy pressure on May to categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit. Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark are all demanding that May rules out the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of next month. May insisted yesterday that a delay wouldn\u2019t resolve anything, but the PM risks seeing the issue taken out of her hands. Tomorrow, MPs could pass a cross-party amendment laid by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. News that the opposition Labour Party have also shifted their position, and could back a public vote on Brexit has also caught the City\u2019s attention -- as it potentially increases the changes that Britain doesn\u2019t leave at all. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reported last night: Jeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party\u2019s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. The decision to give the party\u2019s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two top central bankers will be in the spotlight today, facing questions about monetary policy and the state of the economy. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due before the Treasury Committee at 10am GMT, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and external policymakers Gertjan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. They\u2019ll be quizzed about the Bank\u2019s latest Inflation Report, which slashed UK growth forecasts and warned a no-deal Brexit could cause a recession. MPs may also ask the Bank about the prospects of interest rate rises over the next couple of years, and the impact of the recent global slowdown on the UK. A few hours later, Carney\u2019s US counterpart will also be facing lawmakers at the Senate. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s bi-annual testimony will be extremely closely watched by investors, for any clues on whether the Fed has ended its rate-hiking cycle. He\u2019ll also be asked about plans to trim the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, unwinding its massive stimulus programme, and the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war on the US economy. Markets have risen strongly since the Fed\u2019s last meeting, at the end of January, when it was surprisingly dovish about monetary policy plans; Powell\u2019s comments today could easily move the dollar and US Treasury bond prices. The markets will also be chewing through new US housing data, and consumer confidence report. Plus, UK housebuilder Persimmon is updating the market - reporting that pre-tax profts have jumped to nearly \u00a31.1bn - up from \u00a3970m last year. This is just days after it emerged Persimmon (under fire for paying bosses huge bonuses) could be banned from the government\u2019s Help to Buy subsidy scheme. The agenda 10am GMT: Treasury committee hearing with the Bank of England 1.30pm GMT: US housing starts and permits data for December 2pm GMT: US Case-Shiller index of US house prices in December 3pm GMT: Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Panel 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence index",

      "body": "<p>In the run-up to the 2011 World Cup, the All Blacks held a series of \u201cWhat if?\u201d meetings. \u201cWe talked about worst-case scenarios,\u201d Jerome Kaino remembered, \u201cand Kieran Read said: \u2018The worst would be if Dan Carter and Richie McCaw get injured.\u2019\u201d The head coach, Graham Henry, didn\u2019t really think that would happen \u2013 \u201csurely not possible\u201d he told himself \u2013 but he wanted to plan for it anyway. After New Zealand were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/08/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200714\" title=\"\">knocked out by France in 2007</a>, Henry had spent a lot of time thinking about what went wrong. He decided his team had been caught short when everything took a turn for the worse. So he became a doomsday prepper.</p> <p>In their 2007 quarter-final in Cardiff, the All Blacks were thrown by the referee, yes, who hardly gave a decision their way, but by some critical injuries, too. Carter went off after 56 minutes, his replacement, Nick Evans, after 71. Henry felt that, without either of their two first\u2011choice fly-halves, his team had become like \u201ca possum in the headlights\u201d. So for 2011, Henry\u2019s philosophy was to expect the unexpected. He wanted his coaches and players to feel ready for anything. \u201cSay McCaw breaks his leg in the first minute of the final, what happens then?\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow do you handle that?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/26/wales-world-cup-hopes-warren-gatland-rugby-union\">Wales can be big in Japan but Six Nations form no guarantee of success | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end, McCaw didn\u2019t break his leg but his foot, and he played on anyway. Carter, who tore a tendon in his thigh while he was practising his kicking, wasn\u2019t so lucky. When he dropped out of the tournament, Henry moved Carter\u2019s understudy Colin Slade into the first team and brought his first reserve Aaron Cruden into the squad. Then, when Slade tore a muscle in his groin playing against Argentina, Henry promoted Cruden into the first team and called up Stephen Donald. And when Cruden twisted his knee half an hour into the final, Donald came on and eventually won the game, 8-7 against France.</p> <p>Henry doesn\u2019t claim he had all this exactly mapped out but all that contingency planning meant they were in the best position to cope with this Job\u2019s lot of bad luck. Henry was criticised for the way he had rotated his squad in 2009 and 2010 but the policy meant that by the end of 2011 he had four fly-halves who all had experience playing Test rugby. Donald already had 23 caps. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t had that All Black experience, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what he did,\u201d Henry said later. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it easy but thank God we had a strategy for it.\u201d</p> <p>Seven months out from the World Cup, it feels as if Eddie Jones is still so busy working out through the best-case scenario that he hasn\u2019t had time to worry about the worst yet. Jones has built an England squad who are capable of beating anyone, so long as they have their key players fit, as they did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">against Ireland in Dublin</a> at the beginning of the month. But then you get to those \u201cWhat ifs?\u201d. It\u2019s pretty easy to work out what the worst of these are. What if Owen Farrell suffers a concussion and Billy Vunipola breaks an arm?

Who knows what difference Vunipola\u2019s Stakhanovite tackle count and Itoje\u2019s we-go-again leadership would have made to a game that was balanced on a razor\u2019s edge for 78 minutes? The odd part was that Jones was so reluctant to use some of the other players he did have available, such as George Ford and Dan Robson, who were left on the bench. It was as if, already without one Vunipola and Itoje, Jones was determined he had to keep Farrell and Ben Youngs on the pitch just so England had a critical mass of those key players.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/25/george-ford-owen-farrell-wales-england\">Bringing on George Ford could have helped England unlock the Wales defence | Nick Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course all teams are hostage to these twists of fate and fortune. But England, perhaps because they\u2019re only recently out of the slump they suffered last year, seem especially dependent on a small group of favoured players. Compare Jones\u2019s approach with, say, the way Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt has brought through Joey Carbery and Kieron Marmion as cover for his two key players, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton, or how Warren Gatland has balanced his Wales selection so he has a choice of Gareth Anscombe and Dan Biggar at fly-half, or Taulupe Faletau and Ross Moriarty at No 8.</p> <p>Jones surely knows all this. Like every international coach, he will have his depth chart, marking the pecking order of players in each position. But take the list at fly\u2011half. There\u2019s Farrell, and then Ford, who seems to be lucky to get off the bench, and beyond him, perhaps, Danny Cipriani, who has been frozen out since last summer. Or at scrum-half, where, after Youngs, Danny Care has been dropped from the squad and Robson can\u2019t seem to get a game.</p> <p>Few would deny that Jones has a first XV who are strong enough to win the World Cup in Japan. But unless they get very lucky, they will have to prove they can do it without them, too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the run-up to the 2011 World Cup, the All Blacks held a series of \u201cWhat if?\u201d meetings. \u201cWe talked about worst-case scenarios,\u201d Jerome Kaino remembered, \u201cand Kieran Read said: \u2018The worst would be if Dan Carter and Richie McCaw get injured.\u2019\u201d The head coach, Graham Henry, didn\u2019t really think that would happen \u2013 \u201csurely not possible\u201d he told himself \u2013 but he wanted to plan for it anyway. After New Zealand were knocked out by France in 2007, Henry had spent a lot of time thinking about what went wrong. He decided his team had been caught short when everything took a turn for the worse. So he became a doomsday prepper. In their 2007 quarter-final in Cardiff, the All Blacks were thrown by the referee, yes, who hardly gave a decision their way, but by some critical injuries, too. Carter went off after 56 minutes, his replacement, Nick Evans, after 71. Henry felt that, without either of their two first\u2011choice fly-halves, his team had become like \u201ca possum in the headlights\u201d. So for 2011, Henry\u2019s philosophy was to expect the unexpected. He wanted his coaches and players to feel ready for anything. \u201cSay McCaw breaks his leg in the first minute of the final, what happens then?\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow do you handle that?\u201d In the end, McCaw didn\u2019t break his leg but his foot, and he played on anyway. Carter, who tore a tendon in his thigh while he was practising his kicking, wasn\u2019t so lucky. When he dropped out of the tournament, Henry moved Carter\u2019s understudy Colin Slade into the first team and brought his first reserve Aaron Cruden into the squad. Then, when Slade tore a muscle in his groin playing against Argentina, Henry promoted Cruden into the first team and called up Stephen Donald. And when Cruden twisted his knee half an hour into the final, Donald came on and eventually won the game, 8-7 against France. Henry doesn\u2019t claim he had all this exactly mapped out but all that contingency planning meant they were in the best position to cope with this Job\u2019s lot of bad luck. Henry was criticised for the way he had rotated his squad in 2009 and 2010 but the policy meant that by the end of 2011 he had four fly-halves who all had experience playing Test rugby. Donald already had 23 caps. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t had that All Black experience, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what he did,\u201d Henry said later. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it easy but thank God we had a strategy for it.\u201d Seven months out from the World Cup, it feels as if Eddie Jones is still so busy working out through the best-case scenario that he hasn\u2019t had time to worry about the worst yet. Jones has built an England squad who are capable of beating anyone, so long as they have their key players fit, as they did against Ireland in Dublin at the beginning of the month. But then you get to those \u201cWhat ifs?\u201d. It\u2019s pretty easy to work out what the worst of these are. What if Owen Farrell suffers a concussion and Billy Vunipola breaks an arm? What if Mako Vunipola twists an ankle and Kyle Sinckler gets sent off? What is hard is figuring exactly what England will do if either, some, or all these things come true, which they likely will, given the casualty rate of your average World Cup campaign is something like that of a small Victorian war, and the fact England are now playing a style of rugby that requires a lunatic commitment to imposing themselves physically on the opposition. Because the gulf between England with and England without that band of their players is beginning to look like the difference between their winning the World Cup and being knocked out in the semi-finals. They were without two of them, Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, when they lost to Wales on Saturday. Who knows what difference Vunipola\u2019s Stakhanovite tackle count and Itoje\u2019s we-go-again leadership would have made to a game that was balanced on a razor\u2019s edge for 78 minutes? The odd part was that Jones was so reluctant to use some of the other players he did have available, such as George Ford and Dan Robson, who were left on the bench. It was as if, already without one Vunipola and Itoje, Jones was determined he had to keep Farrell and Ben Youngs on the pitch just so England had a critical mass of those key players. Of course all teams are hostage to these twists of fate and fortune. But England, perhaps because they\u2019re only recently out of the slump they suffered last year, seem especially dependent on a small group of favoured players. Compare Jones\u2019s approach with, say, the way Ireland\u2019s Joe Schmidt has brought through Joey Carbery and Kieron Marmion as cover for his two key players, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton, or how Warren Gatland has balanced his Wales selection so he has a choice of Gareth Anscombe and Dan Biggar at fly-half, or Taulupe Faletau and Ross Moriarty at No 8. Jones surely knows all this. Like every international coach, he will have his depth chart, marking the pecking order of players in each position. But take the list at fly\u2011half. There\u2019s Farrell, and then Ford, who seems to be lucky to get off the bench, and beyond him, perhaps, Danny Cipriani, who has been frozen out since last summer. Or at scrum-half, where, after Youngs, Danny Care has been dropped from the squad and Robson can\u2019t seem to get a game. Few would deny that Jones has a first XV who are strong enough to win the World Cup in Japan. But unless they get very lucky, they will have to prove they can do it without them, too.",

      "bodyText": "The intricate orchestration and classical impulses of 1988\u2019s Spirit of Eden and 1991\u2019s Laughing Stock cemented Talk Talk as musical visionaries. But the driving force behind these albums showed flashes of iconoclastic brilliance even on the group\u2019s most accessible, commercially successful early works. At first, Mark Hollis and his Talk Talk bandmates \u2013 bassist Paul Webb, drummer Lee Harris and keyboardist Simon Brenner \u2013 employed subtle subversion. On Talk Talk\u2019s 1982 full-length debut, the sophisti-pop totem The Party\u2019s Over, the band assumed the role of new wave tastemakers indebted to Japan and Roxy Music, courtesy of moody bass lines, whimsical keyboards, and compact arrangements. Yet Hollis\u2019s lyrics, which contained allusions to religious imagery, as well as ruminations on betrayal, social upheaval and identity, hinted at far darker and more substantial matters. The stormy, wise title track expressed agony about the negative consequences of ageing and time\u2019s unstoppable march, while the song Talk Talk crisply admonished an unfaithful partner. Hollis\u2019s early band, the Reaction, had already released a gloriously bratty punk version of the latter under the title Talk Talk Talk Talk on the 1977 Beggars Banquet compilation Streets. But their 1982 take on the song adds nuance and depth, swapping out raucous guitars in favour of anxious keyboards, which temper the bitterness of the lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m not that blind to see that you\u2019ve been cheating on me.\u201d For good measure, Talk Talk also features a bridge driven by glassy, mellifluous piano and teeth-chattering drums: conveying uncertainty and anguish, both elements amplify the song\u2019s turbulent emotions. Despite obvious major differences \u2013 Talk Talk had no guitarist circa The Party\u2019s Over \u2013 the band was often compared to Duran Duran, much to Hollis\u2019s frustration. \u201cPeople who say that obviously haven\u2019t listened to us properly,\u201d he told Smash Hits in 1982. \u201cDuran Duran\u2019s overall sound is just bass drum.\u201d (After news of Hollis\u2019s death broke, Simon Le Bon called him \u201cone of music\u2019s great innovators\u201d in a Facebook statement.)

Like a barren arctic island basking in my daily hour of sunlight, I proudly embraced an aesthetic of Scandinavian noir-chic, telling anyone within earshot that the drab palette and multiple timber-veneer Arkelstorp side tables were the trappings of a new and more mature me, a me that was as comfortable owning six oversized beige floor lamps and playing at underwear origami as I was being alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/12/marie-kondo-calls-it-clutter-to-me-they-are-mementos\">Marie Kondo calls it clutter; to me they are mementoes | Rebecca Nicholson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A brutalist of the inner world, Kondo imagines a life made better for being purposeful in its scantness \u2013 a message that does not bode well for the abode of one married to their clutter, but I latch on to her philosophy hook, line and sinker.

Minimalism feels like a scam until you\u2019re in on it, and isn\u2019t that what scams are all about now?</p> <p>But for all the physical detritus in our orbit, what exists on our computers is vaster and more vague; a digital footprint compressed deep.

      "bodyText": "Leaving a long-term relationship, you find yourself standing on the precipice of a life yet unlived; all of a sudden the accumulated trinkets and tchotchkes of your life together exist only to mock you in your unspoken grief. There\u2019s no better time to get into getting rid of stuff. After she emptied our house of all that she wanted, I emptied it a second time, of everything that we had grown to want together. I embraced the spartan wisdom of Marie Kondo\u2019s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up \u2013 the self-help manual de rigueur for people who want to want less. Like a barren arctic island basking in my daily hour of sunlight, I proudly embraced an aesthetic of Scandinavian noir-chic, telling anyone within earshot that the drab palette and multiple timber-veneer Arkelstorp side tables were the trappings of a new and more mature me, a me that was as comfortable owning six oversized beige floor lamps and playing at underwear origami as I was being alone. A brutalist of the inner world, Kondo imagines a life made better for being purposeful in its scantness \u2013 a message that does not bode well for the abode of one married to their clutter, but I latch on to her philosophy hook, line and sinker. I fold each of my socks, throw away projects that sit half finished, and appraise the emotional bond I share with my cutlery. I begin to feel like maybe it\u2019s actually working. Minimalism feels like a scam until you\u2019re in on it, and isn\u2019t that what scams are all about now? But for all the physical detritus in our orbit, what exists on our computers is vaster and more vague; a digital footprint compressed deep. There isn\u2019t a guidebook for emotional digital minimalism. No one tells you how to hold a file in your hand, to embrace a 100KB photograph, to evaluate whether a 10-year text-message history \u201csparks joy\u201d. It\u2019s been estimated that the trillions of electrons that make up the entire internet weigh about 50 grams, around half the weight of a pack of cards. But what about the emotional weight of keeping terabytes of photographs you took of someone while you loved them? What was the feeling of deleting them? More than anything, I felt the need to find out. We all curate ourselves on the internet, whether you\u2019re an aspiring influencer, KonMari-ing your Twitter followers, or demanding the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. But we are increasingly sold the unassailable notion that behind the scenes no such maintenance is required. The cloud is infinite, a fluffy Sunday-school afterlife for our digital debris. Google promises me more space than I could once even fathom, Dropbox will allocate me huge tracts of land on their digital acreage, and Apple pinky-swears that every blurry photo of a dog, cloud or my pink, bared arse will remain safe forever, as long as I cough up to keep their labyrinthine server compound spinning. I begin a pilgrimage. Every photo ever taken, every file saved \u2013 my digital history up for appraisal. Years of work and pleasure have become a formless sweater, taking months to unravel, each day finding myself tugging ever tighter in the cold.

But even in less extreme examples, the pattern remains: the owners fail upwards and everyone else is left to clean up the mess. \u2022 Tom Hawking is a freelance writer based in Melbourne",

      "bodyText": "Australians with a modicum of curiosity might well ask what\u2019s been going on. Cardinal George Pell, an Australian who is one of the most senior people in the hierarchy of the Catholic church, was found guilty in December and no one till now has been allowed to know the details of the charges against him, the trial proceedings, the identity of the complainants, or his conviction. It left a pretty big gap in the community\u2019s knowledge of a serious event in the affairs of the nation. The county court in Melbourne ordered that any Pell-related criminal information be kept under wraps pending the outcome of a planned second trial on a number of separate charges. The notion was to protect prospective jurors at a second trial from having their thoughts contaminated and their views prejudiced by what happened at the first. Now that we know there will be no second trial, the suppression order remaining in place against reporting the verdict on the first trial looks, to my mind and in this age of the ubiquitous internet, rather nonsensical. Indeed, suppression and non-publication orders from the courts increasingly take on a ludicrous quality, where locally based mainstream publishers and broadcasters with significant assets lie down and abide by judicial edicts, while those with one finger on a social media app blissfully ignore them. One law for big publishers and no law for everyone else. It\u2019s as though we are in Fantasia, where a large proportion of the population know something that they are not supposed to know. Such was the case with Pell\u2019s conviction. Some of the big media outlets in this country gave us a whiff that there was something in the public interest going on that could not be reported, with headlines like \u201cCensored\u201d, \u201cSecret scandal\u201d and so on. Meanwhile, it became evident that the internet does not stop at the sovereign borders of the nation. Online publishers beyond the writ of the county court of Victoria were doing their level best to pump out the story. Among the notable reports were those by the Washington Post, the Daily Beast (which was published and then geo-blocked) and a US Jesuit news site. The grapevine effect was up and running \u2013 so much for the holy writ of suppression orders. Following the publication of those teasing headlines \u2013 after Pell\u2019s conviction on the choirboy charges \u2013 there was a tense session in the county court in which the chief judge, Peter Kidd, and the director of public prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, expressed their concern that the suppression order may have been breached \u2013 even without Pell being identified directly. Since then the office of the Victorian DPP has notified media organisations, along with some of their senior editorial employees, that she is \u201cconsidering charges\u201d for sub-judice contempt and scandalising the court.

Again, the contempt case against the media seems like a fantastical disconnect with events as they transpired. Ultimately, the second trial was not prejudiced because it didn\u2019t take place and that was not due to any prejudicial reporting. The state of Victoria has a bit of a love affair with suppression orders, issuing them at more than twice the rate of New South Wales, which is a bigger jurisdiction with larger courts, more cases and more judges. The statistics on this have been carefully collected by Gina McWilliams, senior legal counsel at News Corp in Sydney. One ready explanation is that there is an ingrained knee-jerk response to applications for suppression or no-publication orders among Victoria\u2019s judiciary, extending to saving people from \u201cembarrassment\u201d, or on grounds of poor health, or because it might make the job of the police simpler.

      "body": "<p>Families have paid tribute to victims of the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings, in the first day of evidence at the inquest into the atrocity.</p> <p>Twenty-one people were killed and more than 200 injured when bombs were detonated in two Birmingham city centre pubs \u2013 the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town \u2013 on the evening of Thursday 21 November nearly 45 years ago.</p> <p>The inquest into the deaths was initially opened in November 1974, but was adjourned to allow for a criminal investigation. In 1975, six men \u2013 who became known as the Birmingham Six \u2013 were convicted for the bombings, but were acquitted 16 years later, in 1991.</p> <p>Paul Rowlands, the son of John Rowlands, 46 \u2013 who was one of a group of six friends who died together \u2013 told the inquest the Mulberry Bush had been his dad\u2019s favourite pub. \u201cMy only consolation is that on the night of his death he died with his friends, as they stood around the bar,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI know that he loved me and that he was always there to protect me,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do miss him and wish only that he had lived long enough to have seen his grandchildren and his great grandchildren grow up.\u201d</p> <p>Fresh inquests into the deaths were ordered in 2016 but were delayed by disputes over whether the hearings should examine who might be responsible for the bombings.</p> <p>In January 2018, the high court overturned a ruling by the coroner Sir Peter Thornton that alleged perpetrators would not fall within the framework of the inquest. Thornton appealed against that decision the following July and the court of appeal ruled in his favour in September.</p> <p>The inquest, at the Birmingham civil justice centre, is expected to last up to six weeks. The jury will hear \u201cpen portraits\u201d about the victims, read by their family, friends and lawyers, on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, jurors will be taken to view the sites where the targeted pubs used to be.</p> <p>Speaking on Monday, Thornton said that as well as establishing how each of the victims died, the inquest would also hear evidence about IRA warnings before the bombings and the response of the emergency services on the night.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the telephone warning which was made to the local paper, you will hear evidence about other possible forewarnings,\u201d said Thornton. \u201cBy forewarning, I mean some evidence in advance of the bombings that something bad was going to happen in Birmingham which may have been notified to the police.\u201d</p> <p>He said that attributing blame for perpetrating the bombings was a job for \u201cthe police and prosecution through the criminal courts\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the jury heard tributes to 15 of the victims. Danielle Fairweather-Tipping, the cousin of Neil \u201cTommy\u201d Marsh, at 16 the youngest of the victims, told the inquest he would have been 62 this November.</p> <p>\u201cHe would have most likely lived a life close to his family and he probably would have got married and had children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mother would have had the joy of being part of his life, the joy of caring for grandchildren she never had.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Thrupp, son of Trevor Thrupp, 33, said that after his father\u2019s death his sister thought she saw him wherever she went, hoping that perhaps he had not died and had just forgotten where he lived. \u201cI gave my sisters away for their wedding, which was a privilege my dad should have enjoyed,\u201d said Thrupp.</p> <p>Michelle Sealey and Paul Bridgewater, the daughter and son of Paul Davies \u2013 who died aged 17 \u2013 told the inquest their father had been known for being handsome and charming. Bridgewater, who was not yet born when his father died, said: \u201cI sometimes wonder what it would have been like to know him. Perhaps we would have gone to [Aston] Villa matches together as father and son.\u201d</p> <p>Lynn Bennett, 18, and Stephen Whalley, 21, both died at the Tavern in the Town while on a blind date, after meeting through a lonely hearts column in NME magazine.</p> <p>Bennett\u2019s sister Claire Luckman told the inquest her sister and father had been season ticket holders at Birmingham City football club and had always attended matches together. Her father never stepped foot inside the club\u2019s stadium again after his daughter\u2019s death.</p> <p>In a statement from Whalley\u2019s mother, who was too elderly and frail to attend the inquest, she said she and her husband had been overjoyed when Stephen was born because she had previously lost two children at birth.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst I would love the world to know about my son Steven and the lovely man he was, it is just too difficult and painful for me to recall any memories I have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is too traumatic to remember.\u201d</p>",

The inquest into the deaths was initially opened in November 1974, but was adjourned to allow for a criminal investigation. In 1975, six men \u2013 who became known as the Birmingham Six \u2013 were convicted for the bombings, but were acquitted 16 years later, in 1991. Paul Rowlands, the son of John Rowlands, 46 \u2013 who was one of a group of six friends who died together \u2013 told the inquest the Mulberry Bush had been his dad\u2019s favourite pub. \u201cMy only consolation is that on the night of his death he died with his friends, as they stood around the bar,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that he loved me and that he was always there to protect me,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do miss him and wish only that he had lived long enough to have seen his grandchildren and his great grandchildren grow up.\u201d Fresh inquests into the deaths were ordered in 2016 but were delayed by disputes over whether the hearings should examine who might be responsible for the bombings. In January 2018, the high court overturned a ruling by the coroner Sir Peter Thornton that alleged perpetrators would not fall within the framework of the inquest. Thornton appealed against that decision the following July and the court of appeal ruled in his favour in September. The inquest, at the Birmingham civil justice centre, is expected to last up to six weeks. The jury will hear \u201cpen portraits\u201d about the victims, read by their family, friends and lawyers, on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, jurors will be taken to view the sites where the targeted pubs used to be. Speaking on Monday, Thornton said that as well as establishing how each of the victims died, the inquest would also hear evidence about IRA warnings before the bombings and the response of the emergency services on the night. \u201cIn addition to the telephone warning which was made to the local paper, you will hear evidence about other possible forewarnings,\u201d said Thornton. \u201cBy forewarning, I mean some evidence in advance of the bombings that something bad was going to happen in Birmingham which may have been notified to the police.\u201d He said that attributing blame for perpetrating the bombings was a job for \u201cthe police and prosecution through the criminal courts\u201d. On Tuesday, the jury heard tributes to 15 of the victims. Danielle Fairweather-Tipping, the cousin of Neil \u201cTommy\u201d Marsh, at 16 the youngest of the victims, told the inquest he would have been 62 this November. \u201cHe would have most likely lived a life close to his family and he probably would have got married and had children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mother would have had the joy of being part of his life, the joy of caring for grandchildren she never had.\u201d Paul Thrupp, son of Trevor Thrupp, 33, said that after his father\u2019s death his sister thought she saw him wherever she went, hoping that perhaps he had not died and had just forgotten where he lived. \u201cI gave my sisters away for their wedding, which was a privilege my dad should have enjoyed,\u201d said Thrupp. Michelle Sealey and Paul Bridgewater, the daughter and son of Paul Davies \u2013 who died aged 17 \u2013 told the inquest their father had been known for being handsome and charming. Bridgewater, who was not yet born when his father died, said: \u201cI sometimes wonder what it would have been like to know him. Perhaps we would have gone to [Aston] Villa matches together as father and son.\u201d Lynn Bennett, 18, and Stephen Whalley, 21, both died at the Tavern in the Town while on a blind date, after meeting through a lonely hearts column in NME magazine. Bennett\u2019s sister Claire Luckman told the inquest her sister and father had been season ticket holders at Birmingham City football club and had always attended matches together. Her father never stepped foot inside the club\u2019s stadium again after his daughter\u2019s death. In a statement from Whalley\u2019s mother, who was too elderly and frail to attend the inquest, she said she and her husband had been overjoyed when Stephen was born because she had previously lost two children at birth. \u201cWhilst I would love the world to know about my son Steven and the lovely man he was, it is just too difficult and painful for me to recall any memories I have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is too traumatic to remember.\u201d",

The number of donors in Wales climbed from 61 in 2016-17 to 74 the following year, and was already up to 72 by three-quarters of the way through 2018-19, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. Spain is held up as the biggest example of what an opt-out system can do, with 46.9 donors per million people as opposed to 24.4 per million in England. But Spain has invested heavily and, as Sue, says: \u201cDo we have the infrastructure, retrieval teams, surgeons, specialist nurses and ICU beds that would be needed?\u201d Not yet, perhaps. So there are reasons to be cautious \u2013 about the way patients are treated and whether we still see donation as a gift \u2013 and there is one huge caveat: the NHS needs the money to cope with this. But the news today means change is coming and there is reason to celebrate, because that change will save lives. \u2022 Cole Moreton is the author of The Boy Who Gave His Heart Away",

We can live in cities that marshal public space and resources for the common good. To do so, we\u2019ll have to band together. We\u2019ll have to resist forfeiting the public trust for the private gain of a few.

Andy Burnham asked the government for \u00a3116m to implement Greater Manchester\u2019s plan, which includes a clean air zone designed to drastically reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide by 2024. Poor air quality contributes to the equivalent of 1,200 deaths a year in Greater Manchester, where 152 stretches of road will soon breach legal limits for concentrations of NO2 unless action is taken. About 285,000 private cars licensed in Greater Manchester already breach air pollution limits, as do 2,000 buses, 9,000 minicabs, 2,000 taxis and 11,000 HGVs, according to research from the Greater Manchester combined authority. From 2021, buses and HGVs made before 2013 will have to pay \u00a3100 a day to drive on any road in Greater Manchester apart from motorways. Older taxis and private hire vehicles will pay \u00a37.50 each, and from 2023, vans and minibuses will also be charged \u00a37.50. But cars will be exempt after the GMCA decided levying a charge against private drivers would disproportionately affect poorer people who could not afford to upgrade their vehicles. Alex Ganotis, the leader of Stockport council and lead for clean air, said: \u201cIncluding private vehicles would have hit, disproportionately, our poorer communities.\u201d He added that private vehicles are idle for \u201cmore than 90% of the time, so we are also looking at intensity of use, not just volumes of vehicles\u201d. Ganotis said including private hire vehicles would necessitate a national scrappage scheme to help people trade in their old vehicles \u2013 something the government has ruled out. Pete Abel from Manchester Friends of the Earth said: \u201cNot including private vehicles in the clean air zone is a cop-out.

The EU is ready to add more legal weight to previous guarantees that the backstop is a last-resort option. A letter from EU leaders, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, released in January, could be turned into \u201ca joint interpretative statement\u201d \u2013 a document with greater legal heft that would be published in the EU rulebook, the Official Journal.</p>",

EU sources stress the EU has no fixed position on how long the Brexit extension should last. \u201cWe would pay a lot of attention to the business continuity argument,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cWe have a number of important decisions this year and we cannot allow the mess of Brexit to pollute the decisions of the union.\u201d Brussels is sceptical that a divided Commons would find in three months the consensus that has eluded MPs for more than two and half years. \u201cIf people cannot agree now, why would it be possible in three months?\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThat being said, I don\u2019t see that [EU27] heads of state and government would say no [to a three-month extension]. Probably they will say \u2018let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s give them a last chance.\u2019\u201d During a three-month extension period the EU would accelerate the no-deal planning, the source added. European sources believe the last possible moment to clinch a Brexit deal, or an extension, will fall on 21/22 March, when EU leaders, including the prime minister, gather for a scheduled spring summit. \u201cThe absolute deadline is the European council,\u201d said another senior EU source, casting doubt on an 11th-hour agreement in the immediate days before 29 March, when the UK leaves the EU, with or without a deal. Intense discussion on delaying Brexit came as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, arrived in Brussels on Tuesday for talks with the team of the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. \u201cThey held detailed technical discussions as part of the process ... to agree a deal that would have the support of the UK parliament and the EU,\u201d a UK spokesperson said. Cox was meeting EU officials in an attempt to pin down further assurances that would persuade MPs to back the Brexit deal they rejected by a historic majority last month. Work is being pursued in three areas. First, the two sides are exploring changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The new version is expected to feature more details on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection, as May attempts to win over Labour MPs. But the government continues to rule out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan of a full customs union with the EU. The second strand of work is focused on agreeing a process to agree \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that could replace the contested Irish backstop. The backstop, a fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is part of the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which the EU has said is not open for renegotiation. The EU has, however, promised to explore with the UK \u201calternative arrangements\u201d such as technology and efficient customs procedures that could render the backstop unnecessary. Tory Eurosceptic backbenchers hoping for a speedy agreement on those alternative arrangements are likely to be disappointed. Instead, negotiators hope to agree on a detailed timetable on the process for finding those alternative arrangements for the next 21 months. The third area of work also seeks to quell MPs\u2019 fears about the UK being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the backstop. The EU is ready to add more legal weight to previous guarantees that the backstop is a last-resort option. A letter from EU leaders, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, released in January, could be turned into \u201ca joint interpretative statement\u201d \u2013 a document with greater legal heft that would be published in the EU rulebook, the Official Journal.",

Global Radio has announced that it will replace the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes. The changes, which will be brought in during the course of this year, are likely to result in presenters and producers across the country finding they are being replaced by big names based far away from the communities they serve. The number of regional drivetime shows on Capital, Smooth and Heart will also be substantially reduced and all locally produced evening and weekend programmes will be axed. Local journalists, engineers and marketing staff are expected to be affected by job cuts. Global will close 10 of its 24 dedicated radio studios \u2013 in Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon \u2013 in a blow to the media industry outside the capital. The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said the job losses were a \u201ctravesty\u201d and \u201cparticularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure\u201d. \u201cReplacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country.

      "body": "<p>Did you <em>see</em> Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\u2019s intimate Oscars duet? The award for most crazy in love IRL definitely belongs to them, OMG. That\u2019s what people are saying, anyway. Many tweeted that they are waiting for Cooper to leave his long-term partner, the Russian model Irina Shayk, so his romance with Gaga\u2019s character in A Star Is Born can become real. When did we lose all desire to distinguish between art and life? Why do we want to own celebrities\u2019 souls, imprisoned in hashtags and gifs and gossip, regardless of the human fallout?</p> <p>Even other celebrities, that wise and reserved tribe who should know better, are speculating wildly. Mel B told Piers Morgan that Lady Gaga may have broken the \u201cwomen\u2019s code\u201d. The comedian David Spade posted a picture of the duet on Instagram, with the Wildean caption: \u201cIs there any chance these 2 aren\u2019t fucking?\u201d When Cooper\u2019s ex-wife Jennifer Esposito wrote \u201cHa\u201d underneath the post, it led to a Krakatoa of speculation. One celeb channel frothed up the incident by claiming Esposito was \u201cweighing in\u201d on the gossip. Since when is \u201cHa\u201d weighing in? I \u201cHa\u201d when I go to press a lift button at the same time as someone else, or push a pull door.</p> <p>Are Cooper and Gaga in love? Well, <em>duh</em>. Look at their chemistry on stage, gazing at each other while singing for each other for minutes on end, for hours, for geological epochs. They are so in love, they don\u2019t care that Jamie Foxx is right there, or that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2019/feb/25/oscars-red-carpet-2019-in-pictures-from-glenn-close-to-regina-king\">Billy Porter is wearing the best dress ever designed</a>, or that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/olivia-colman-wins-best-actress-oscar-for-the-favourite\">Sophie from Peep Show has won an Oscar</a>, which, as has been pointed out, is the most Mark Corrigan thing that has ever happened. That starry scene doesn\u2019t exist for them. The world doesn\u2019t exist for them. They are so in love, it\u2019s unreal!</p> <p>Of course it is unreal. That is not normal behaviour: it\u2019s acting. They are actors, acting at a ceremony that showcases the best acting. Embodying transformative moments, on cue and repeatedly, is what acting is all about. It requires a strong connection between performers, which Cooper and Gaga clearly have, but technical discipline too: an awareness of cameras and sightlines, continuity, timing. The ability to be at once lost in a moment, and totally in control. It is a quality often defined by its absence. That\u2019s why it is easier for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/rami-malek-wins-best-actor-oscar-for-bohemian-rhapsody\">Rami Malek to (not undeservedly) win an Oscar</a> \u2013 because the yardstick of mimicry is an easier one for people to get their heads around.</p> <p>So B-Cups and the Baroness of Gaga are comfortable looking at each other. Vulnerable, able to share their deepest selves. That doesn\u2019t mean they are desp 2 bone 4 real. The pair have spoken often about their friendship while promoting their film. They have spoken of their shared Italian-American background, the way they eat spaghetti on the porch. She helped him grow confidence in his musicianship; he did the same for her acting. Their relationship is a perfect exchange, which is what gave A Star Is Born its magic. In sharing these stories in interviews, both performers know the power of the narrative and its grip on us. Cooper and Gaga, sitting in a tree! S.E.L.L.I.N.G.</p> <p>Which doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fake. They respect each other and work well together. Maybe they do want to rut on their pile of awards and money; I don\u2019t know. But we should recognise that #friendshipgoals and #creativegoals are just as important as #couplegoals. It\u2019s just that the gossip isn\u2019t as compelling. If Cooper and the mother of his children were to split, I doubt it would be because of Gaga. She\u2019s a Lady, after all. It would be because of the rest of us, pointing and posting and whispering: \u201cAre they doing it yet?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Did you see Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\u2019s intimate Oscars duet? The award for most crazy in love IRL definitely belongs to them, OMG. That\u2019s what people are saying, anyway. Many tweeted that they are waiting for Cooper to leave his long-term partner, the Russian model Irina Shayk, so his romance with Gaga\u2019s character in A Star Is Born can become real. When did we lose all desire to distinguish between art and life? Why do we want to own celebrities\u2019 souls, imprisoned in hashtags and gifs and gossip, regardless of the human fallout? Even other celebrities, that wise and reserved tribe who should know better, are speculating wildly. Mel B told Piers Morgan that Lady Gaga may have broken the \u201cwomen\u2019s code\u201d. The comedian David Spade posted a picture of the duet on Instagram, with the Wildean caption: \u201cIs there any chance these 2 aren\u2019t fucking?\u201d When Cooper\u2019s ex-wife Jennifer Esposito wrote \u201cHa\u201d underneath the post, it led to a Krakatoa of speculation. One celeb channel frothed up the incident by claiming Esposito was \u201cweighing in\u201d on the gossip. Since when is \u201cHa\u201d weighing in? I \u201cHa\u201d when I go to press a lift button at the same time as someone else, or push a pull door. Are Cooper and Gaga in love? Well, duh. Look at their chemistry on stage, gazing at each other while singing for each other for minutes on end, for hours, for geological epochs. They are so in love, they don\u2019t care that Jamie Foxx is right there, or that Billy Porter is wearing the best dress ever designed, or that Sophie from Peep Show has won an Oscar, which, as has been pointed out, is the most Mark Corrigan thing that has ever happened. That starry scene doesn\u2019t exist for them. The world doesn\u2019t exist for them. They are so in love, it\u2019s unreal! Of course it is unreal. That is not normal behaviour: it\u2019s acting. They are actors, acting at a ceremony that showcases the best acting. Embodying transformative moments, on cue and repeatedly, is what acting is all about. It requires a strong connection between performers, which Cooper and Gaga clearly have, but technical discipline too: an awareness of cameras and sightlines, continuity, timing. The ability to be at once lost in a moment, and totally in control. It is a quality often defined by its absence. That\u2019s why it is easier for Rami Malek to (not undeservedly) win an Oscar \u2013 because the yardstick of mimicry is an easier one for people to get their heads around. So B-Cups and the Baroness of Gaga are comfortable looking at each other. Vulnerable, able to share their deepest selves. That doesn\u2019t mean they are desp 2 bone 4 real. The pair have spoken often about their friendship while promoting their film. They have spoken of their shared Italian-American background, the way they eat spaghetti on the porch. She helped him grow confidence in his musicianship; he did the same for her acting. Their relationship is a perfect exchange, which is what gave A Star Is Born its magic. In sharing these stories in interviews, both performers know the power of the narrative and its grip on us. Cooper and Gaga, sitting in a tree! S.E.L.L.I.N.G. Which doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fake. They respect each other and work well together. Maybe they do want to rut on their pile of awards and money; I don\u2019t know. But we should recognise that #friendshipgoals and #creativegoals are just as important as #couplegoals. It\u2019s just that the gossip isn\u2019t as compelling. If Cooper and the mother of his children were to split, I doubt it would be because of Gaga. She\u2019s a Lady, after all. It would be because of the rest of us, pointing and posting and whispering: \u201cAre they doing it yet?\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>MISTER RODGERS\u2019 NEW NEIGHBORHOOD</strong></h2> <p>The way some folk go on, you\u2019d think managing the Queen\u2019s Celtic was as simple as turning up, clocking in, tootling a verse or two of The Fields of Athenry on a tin whistle, throwing your boots up and lighting a cigar, then waiting for the silverware to answer the call and roll into the trophy room, three at a time. But tell that to John Barnes. Or Tony Mowbray. Or Jo Venglos, Lou Macari or Liam Brady. It\u2019s not quite as easy as Brendan Rodgers has been making it look. He\u2019s won all seven domestic trophies on offer since taking over at Parkhead in 2016, becoming the first man in history to win two consecutive trebles. He\u2019s well on the way to an almost inconceivable third, which makes his decision to immediately naff off back down south the very minute the first Premier League club came calling \u2013 the chair in his office still spinning, sheets of paper gently gliding back down on to the desk \u2013 seem rather surprising. Shocking, even. Oh Brenny! How could you!

They got shot of the previous bloke simply because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/24/claude-puel-leicester-city-out-of-sync\">nobody much liked him</a>. They\u2019re in no danger of going down, merely underachieving big-time. The team is packed with plenty of young talent, the sort Rodgers likes to work with. They\u2019re capable of big results, having already beaten Manchester City and Chelsea this season. And they won\u2019t be playing in Europe next year, which will come as blessed relief to a man who presided over the biggest continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 7-0 shellacking at Barcelona), the biggest continental home defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 5-0 skelping by PSG) and the most preposterous continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 1-0 humiliation by the famous Lincoln Red Imps of Winston Churchill Avenue, Gibraltar). Oh Brenny! Probably for the best that you\u2019ll have a bit of time and space to work this side of things out.</p> <p>Where this leaves the Queen\u2019s Celtic is open to interpretation. Former boss Neil Lennon is set to take over until the end of the season, interim bosses being all the rage these days, shades o\u2019Ole. Whether he\u2019ll keep the job afterwards is less clear. Never mind closing out the treble Treble: first let\u2019s see if he can emerge bother-free from this week\u2019s trips to Tynecastle (where, on his last visit, a back-and-forth with the crowd concluded with a coin pinging off the top of his noggin) and Easter Road (the venue he\u2019s just been cashiered from without ceremony). By contrast, Brendan\u2019s first week down south is unlikely to be as combustible \u2026 unless he makes like the last manager Leicester poached from the Old Firm, that is. In 1978, Jock Wallace arrived from Ibrox and set about constructing some large artificial sand dunes, up which he\u2019d send his distressed players at great speed and with great relish. The Fiver would pay real cash money to see Leicester\u2019s current squad react to a fitness regime like that. \u201cCome back Claude,\u201d Harry, Jamie and Wes would cry. \u201cWe hardly knew ye!\u201d</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot clockwatch business on all the night\u2019s Premier League, Football League and fitba action</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cIn our last two away matches, we have now had two perfectly good goals ruled offside which have proven to be the wrong decision. Following a review of [Tom] Pope\u2019s disallowed goal against Cambridge for offside, it has been proven that Pope was in fact onside.

      "bodyText": "MISTER RODGERS\u2019 NEW NEIGHBORHOOD The way some folk go on, you\u2019d think managing the Queen\u2019s Celtic was as simple as turning up, clocking in, tootling a verse or two of The Fields of Athenry on a tin whistle, throwing your boots up and lighting a cigar, then waiting for the silverware to answer the call and roll into the trophy room, three at a time. But tell that to John Barnes. Or Tony Mowbray. Or Jo Venglos, Lou Macari or Liam Brady. It\u2019s not quite as easy as Brendan Rodgers has been making it look. He\u2019s won all seven domestic trophies on offer since taking over at Parkhead in 2016, becoming the first man in history to win two consecutive trebles. He\u2019s well on the way to an almost inconceivable third, which makes his decision to immediately naff off back down south the very minute the first Premier League club came calling \u2013 the chair in his office still spinning, sheets of paper gently gliding back down on to the desk \u2013 seem rather surprising. Shocking, even. Oh Brenny! How could you! And you \u201cliving the dream\u201d and all! Yet maybe there\u2019s method in the apparent madness. The club Rodgers is set to take over, Leicester City, aren\u2019t in the sort of mess new managers usually find upon their arrival. They got shot of the previous bloke simply because nobody much liked him. They\u2019re in no danger of going down, merely underachieving big-time. The team is packed with plenty of young talent, the sort Rodgers likes to work with. They\u2019re capable of big results, having already beaten Manchester City and Chelsea this season. And they won\u2019t be playing in Europe next year, which will come as blessed relief to a man who presided over the biggest continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 7-0 shellacking at Barcelona), the biggest continental home defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 5-0 skelping by PSG) and the most preposterous continental defeat in Queen\u2019s Celtic history (a 1-0 humiliation by the famous Lincoln Red Imps of Winston Churchill Avenue, Gibraltar). Oh Brenny! Probably for the best that you\u2019ll have a bit of time and space to work this side of things out. Where this leaves the Queen\u2019s Celtic is open to interpretation. Former boss Neil Lennon is set to take over until the end of the season, interim bosses being all the rage these days, shades o\u2019Ole. Whether he\u2019ll keep the job afterwards is less clear. Never mind closing out the treble Treble: first let\u2019s see if he can emerge bother-free from this week\u2019s trips to Tynecastle (where, on his last visit, a back-and-forth with the crowd concluded with a coin pinging off the top of his noggin) and Easter Road (the venue he\u2019s just been cashiered from without ceremony). By contrast, Brendan\u2019s first week down south is unlikely to be as combustible \u2026 unless he makes like the last manager Leicester poached from the Old Firm, that is. In 1978, Jock Wallace arrived from Ibrox and set about constructing some large artificial sand dunes, up which he\u2019d send his distressed players at great speed and with great relish. The Fiver would pay real cash money to see Leicester\u2019s current squad react to a fitness regime like that. \u201cCome back Claude,\u201d Harry, Jamie and Wes would cry. \u201cWe hardly knew ye!\u201d LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot clockwatch business on all the night\u2019s Premier League, Football League and fitba action. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIn our last two away matches, we have now had two perfectly good goals ruled offside which have proven to be the wrong decision. Following a review of [Tom] Pope\u2019s disallowed goal against Cambridge for offside, it has been proven that Pope was in fact onside. This has added to the long list of big decisions that have gone against the Vale this campaign. So far this season, Port Vale have had confirmed from Moas (the Match Official Administration System) that several key decisions have gone against the club during matches.

Kepa Arrizabalaga has been fined one week\u2019s wages \u2013 around \u00a3190,000 \u2013 for his antics during Sunday\u2019s Coca-Cola Cup final and has apologised for his \u201cbig mistake\u201d but Maurizio Sarri has refused to say whether the goalkeeper will start against Tottenham. With Manchester United in the grip of a knack crisis, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r wants Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Romelu Lukaku to step up. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for them to play to their potential!\u201d he cheered unconvincingly. Mauricio Pochettino has accepted his FA charge for getting all up in Mike Dean\u2019s grille after Spurs\u2019 defeat at Burnley. \u201cI cannot behave in that way,\u201d he sobbed. Roberto Firmino could be fit for Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby. And the Gothenburg derby between IFK and Gais, which was abandoned on Monday after fans set off hundreds of fireworks at the Gamla Ullevi, will not now be played behind closed doors on Tuesday after Gais refused to turn up. \u201cGais believes that there are no sporting conditions for the match to be carried out fairly and therefore chooses not to come into play,\u201d said the club. STILL WANT MORE?

In a significant first concession that Brexit could take place after 29 March, following months of insistence the deadline could not be shifted, May sought to appease restive Conservative backbenchers, but prompted concern from pro-Brexit MPs. In a sign of the continued uncertainty, the cross-party backers of a plan to be debated by MPs on Wednesday intended to prevent no deal said they would still table the amendment, pending further assurances from ministers. Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister was yet again trying to run down the clock to pressure parliament into backing her deal, calling this \u201cgrotesquely reckless\u201d. Making a statement to the Commons after her talks with EU leaders in Egypt, May reiterated her pledge to give MPs a meaningful vote on a revised Brexit deal by 12 March. If this did not happen or if it was voted down, then by 13 March MPs would be able to vote on a motion that would seek their \u201cexplicit consent\u201d for a no-deal departure, the prime minister said. If MPs voted against this, then on 14 March a motion would be put to the Commons offering the option of a \u201cshort, limited extension to article 50\u201d beyond 29 March, which would need the approval of the EU. The concession on the departure date follows intense pressure from remain-minded Conservatives, with a number of ministers having pledged to resign if necessary to avert the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The resignations would have allowed them to support an amendment to the latest government Brexit motion seeking to stop no deal, led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Conservative MP Nick Boles. After a meeting between backers of the plan, Boles tweeted that the amendment would still be tabled, but that MPs would \u201cseek confirmation of her commitments from ministers\u201d. But another Tory MP who backed the plan, Oliver Letwin, tweeted that there was now \u201cno need\u201d for the proposal. Responding to questions after her statement, the prime minister repeatedly refused to answer questions on whether she and the government would support or oppose no deal or an extension to article 50 if the votes were held. May\u2019s spokesman also declined to be drawn, saying the prime minister\u2019s focus was \u201cto get a deal over the line in a way that the House of Commons can support it\u201d. He told reporters: \u201cQuestions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day.\u201d Asked what length of extension the government would recommend if her deal failed and MPs rejected no deal, the spokesman pointed to the prime minister\u2019s words, saying it would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d, and declined to say what the government would do if MPs amended the motion to demand a longer period. Pressed on whether May was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said: \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t give parliament a vote if she wasn\u2019t willing to abide by it.\u201d The concession angered Brexit-minded Conservative MPs from the European Research Group. Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky that if a delay was seen as a way to stop Brexit completely, this \u201cwould be the most grievous error that politicians could commit\u201d. Theresa Villers told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on 29 March.\u201d May stressed her own continued aversion to this option, saying the \u201cabsolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March\u201d. Nonetheless, her concession brought expressions of relief from business groups, with the British Chambers of Commerce calling it \u201ca small step towards the clarity and precision that businesses need to chart their future direction\u201d. May sought to keep Conservative backbenchers on side by saying the UK and EU would devote time to alternative arrangements to avoid the Irish border backstop, a plan devised by several Tory MPs. Corbyn said Labour would still back the Cooper amendment, so as to \u201cto rule out that reckless cliff-edge Brexit\u201d. He also talked up a planned Labour amendment seeking the party\u2019s version of Brexit, including membership of a customs union. In a change to policy, on Monday it was announced that if this plan was not adopted, Labour would back a second Brexit referendum.

But those days are gone.</p> <p>In the last Congress, Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican representative from Miami and co-founder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, introduced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/republican-carlos-curbelo-pitches-carbon-tax-climate-change\">carbon tax</a> proposal. But his colleagues in the House of Representatives, beholden to Koch Industries and Americans for Tax Reform, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/republican-carlos-curbelo-pitches-carbon-tax-climate-change\">pre-empted</a> the marker bill with a resolution repudiating a carbon tax as \u201cdetrimental to the United States economy\u201d.

The resolution was sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/cosponsors\">68 representatives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22green+new+deal+markey%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=3\">11 senators</a>, including all seven Democratic presidential contenders in Congress: Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>Many, including the editorial boards of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/green-new-deal-climate-democrats.html\">the New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-a-green-new-deal-heres-a-better-one/2019/02/24/2d7e491c-36d2-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.7b4c46af2b1a\">Washington Post</a>, criticized the resolution for including flashy non-emissions policies like Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee. Writing in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/green-new-deal-economic-principles/582943/\">the Atlantic</a>, Robinson Meyer caricatured the 14-page document as \u201ca binder of climate policies duct-taped to an Easter basket of socialist goodies\u201d. But the reasoning behind including a broad slate of programs in the proposal is sound: leverage the federal government to spur public and private investments and meet climate targets, create millions of green jobs while modernizing infrastructure and leveling the playing field so that everyone \u2013 particularly communities of color, women and working families \u2013 can participate in a new economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>From this view, the resolution \u2013 which, judging by the many co-sponsors, has become canon for the rising progressive wing of the Democratic party \u2013 is a bold but strategic opening statement and bargaining position in a renewed climate debate. (Full disclosure: in my role at <a href=\"http://350.org/\">350.org</a>, I consulted with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff on the resolution.)</p> <p>The polling shows the public is increasingly concerned about climate change and supportive of a Green New Deal. A recent <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Climate-Change-American-Mind-December-2018.pdf\">survey</a> conducted by the Yale program on climate change communication showed that 73% of Americans believe climate change is happening \u2013 up 10 points since March 2015 \u2013 while almost as many (69%) are worried about it. Remarkably, Yale researchers also found that <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/the-green-new-deal-has-strong-bipartisan-support/\">81%</a> of registered voters support a Green New Deal to create jobs and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. The same poll also found, however, that 82% of respondents hadn\u2019t heard a thing about the Green New Deal. As the issue has entered the mainstream and politicized, understanding remains spotty and support may be wavering. A more recent Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000169-07bc-dd5d-a5eb-5fbc53550001\">questionnaire</a> showed a plurality of voters support the proposal, but with a large fraction \u2013 nearly a third \u2013 still in the dark. This must change.</p> <p>Commentators have rightly <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/\">pointed out</a> that, to pass the Green New Deal, Democrats will need to win a governing trifecta in 2020 and reach a 60-vote Senate supermajority (improbable) or a 50-vote majority with a repeal of the filibuster (feasible). But the constituencies that really need to be educated, mobilized and organized are not politicians \u2013 they\u2019re everyday people beyond the Beltway who could benefit from a Green New Deal.</p> <p>And this is where the real political fight \u2013 on the nightly news, in the press, at the debate podiums, on social media and, most of all, out in local communities \u2013 must be waged.</p> <p>This spring, youth leaders from the Sunrise Movement are launching a Green New Deal <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-tour_us_5c326a4fe4b0d75a9831d845\">tour</a>, making stops in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Michigan. Sunrise, perhaps more than any other group, has been a guiding voice of moral clarity and leadership in this emergent climate moment. Ahead of a Senate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/694060405/mcconnell-plans-to-bring-green-new-deal-to-senate-vote\">vote</a> called by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the group is coordinating direct actions in the offices of noncommittal Democrats and Republican senators.</p> <p>On Friday, an exchange between Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and school children affiliated with Sunrise, went <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/dianne-feinstein-sunrise-movement-green-new-deal\">viral</a>, when the senator refused to support the resolution because she believed it to be too expensive and politically unachievable. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-hard-lessons-of-dianne-feinsteins-encounter-with-the-young-green-new-deal-activists-video\">30 years</a>,\u201d the senator scolded the kids. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we are the ones who are going to be impacted,\u201d one of the activists, a young girl, responded.</p> <p>And on Monday, hundreds of Sunrise activists occupied the majority leader\u2019s Capitol Hill office, chanting \u201cwhich side are you on?\u201d and bearing a banner that read \u201cMitch, look us in the eyes.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/25/trump-washington-live-politics-latest-news-updates\">Forty-two</a> were arrested during the protest.</p> <p>The spirit, tenor and terms of the climate debate have changed.</p> <p>And where momentum and zeitgeist shift are not enough, proponents of more Rooseveltian approaches to climate action must engage groups historically on the margins of environmental policy, like Indigenous nations, communities of color, immigrants, faith groups and labor unions. The data shows, for example, that Latinx communities are <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-latino-mind-may-2017/\">more concerned</a> about global warming than other voters by a 22-point margin and are more likely to believe it should be a high priority for lawmakers.</p> <p>As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, there may yet be unforeseen opportunities for Green New Dealers to make inroads beyond urban and coastal Democratic enclaves \u2013 perhaps even in Republican strongholds like the south and battlegrounds like the midwest andsun belt. There, the Green New Deal\u2019s populist appeals to economic and social policy may help build a broader base of support.</p> <p>It is too early to predict how this will play out. But, after years of bipartisan stagnation, free market dogma and denialist stalemate, the Green New Deal has breathed much needed oxygen back into the climate debate.</p> <ul> <li><p>Julian Brave NoiseCat is as a policy analyst at 350.org and a freelance writer</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "For years, American democracy has been gripped by a conspiracy to undermine and deny the scientific truth of climate change. Fossil fuel corporations like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries have waged a decades-long campaign to mislead the public about the environmental costs of their business activities and co-opt the rightwing governing party. This week, senior White House officials told the Washington Post that the administration is forming a climate panel headed by William Happer, a physicist who once compared critical assessments of CO2 emissions to the \u201cdemonization of the poor Jews under Hitler\u201d. A blathering majority of Republican apparatchiks and Fox &amp; Friends talking heads \u2013including the president \u2013 continue to insist global warming is a hoax. And for years, cable news networks have provided a platform for these tinfoil hat people, giving airtime to oil-friendly propagandists who reduced the climate debate to a simple binary of belief and denial. Until recently, Democratic leaders failed to lead, viewing climate as a low priority for voters and positioning themselves as true believers rather than an enlightened party with a real plan to take on a planetary calamity that will be measured in geological time. There was once a day before the Tea Party, Twitter and Trump, when Republicans like President George HW Bush promised to fight the greenhouse effect with the \u201cWhite House effect\u201d and, not so long ago, the late senator John McCain advocated for free market approaches to climate action, like cap and trade. But those days are gone. In the last Congress, Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican representative from Miami and co-founder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, introduced a carbon tax proposal. But his colleagues in the House of Representatives, beholden to Koch Industries and Americans for Tax Reform, pre-empted the marker bill with a resolution repudiating a carbon tax as \u201cdetrimental to the United States economy\u201d. In November, Curbelo lost his seat to the blue wave, along with 22 Republican representatives in his climate caucus. Today, a surprising number of beltway economists, lobbyists and even a former Fed Reserve chair still hold fast to the dream of bipartisan climate legislation. But there are few right-leaning partisans still wandering the halls of Congress who are willing to do their cross-aisle bidding. Meanwhile, the Republican party draws its strongest base of support from the south \u2013 ironically, the region most heavily affected by a changing climate. Denial is ascendant and bipartisanship is dead, but the conservative party has painted itself into a corner that, in the long term, will be economically, ecologically and politically untenable. Democrats have an unprecedented opportunity to own the issue and lead. Enter the Green New Deal, the first Democratic policy built for the post-Recession age of climate crisis, polarization and wonky leftism. This month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a resolution outlining the vision, goals and projects of a Green New Deal. The resolution was sponsored by 68 representatives and 11 senators, including all seven Democratic presidential contenders in Congress: Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Many, including the editorial boards of the New York Times and Washington Post, criticized the resolution for including flashy non-emissions policies like Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee. Writing in the Atlantic, Robinson Meyer caricatured the 14-page document as \u201ca binder of climate policies duct-taped to an Easter basket of socialist goodies\u201d. But the reasoning behind including a broad slate of programs in the proposal is sound: leverage the federal government to spur public and private investments and meet climate targets, create millions of green jobs while modernizing infrastructure and leveling the playing field so that everyone \u2013 particularly communities of color, women and working families \u2013 can participate in a new economy. From this view, the resolution \u2013 which, judging by the many co-sponsors, has become canon for the rising progressive wing of the Democratic party \u2013 is a bold but strategic opening statement and bargaining position in a renewed climate debate. (Full disclosure: in my role at 350.org, I consulted with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff on the resolution.) The polling shows the public is increasingly concerned about climate change and supportive of a Green New Deal. A recent survey conducted by the Yale program on climate change communication showed that 73% of Americans believe climate change is happening \u2013 up 10 points since March 2015 \u2013 while almost as many (69%) are worried about it. Remarkably, Yale researchers also found that 81% of registered voters support a Green New Deal to create jobs and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. The same poll also found, however, that 82% of respondents hadn\u2019t heard a thing about the Green New Deal. As the issue has entered the mainstream and politicized, understanding remains spotty and support may be wavering. A more recent Politico questionnaire showed a plurality of voters support the proposal, but with a large fraction \u2013 nearly a third \u2013 still in the dark. This must change. Commentators have rightly pointed out that, to pass the Green New Deal, Democrats will need to win a governing trifecta in 2020 and reach a 60-vote Senate supermajority (improbable) or a 50-vote majority with a repeal of the filibuster (feasible). But the constituencies that really need to be educated, mobilized and organized are not politicians \u2013 they\u2019re everyday people beyond the Beltway who could benefit from a Green New Deal. And this is where the real political fight \u2013 on the nightly news, in the press, at the debate podiums, on social media and, most of all, out in local communities \u2013 must be waged. This spring, youth leaders from the Sunrise Movement are launching a Green New Deal tour, making stops in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Michigan. Sunrise, perhaps more than any other group, has been a guiding voice of moral clarity and leadership in this emergent climate moment. Ahead of a Senate vote called by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the group is coordinating direct actions in the offices of noncommittal Democrats and Republican senators. On Friday, an exchange between Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and school children affiliated with Sunrise, went viral, when the senator refused to support the resolution because she believed it to be too expensive and politically unachievable. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years,\u201d the senator scolded the kids. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we are the ones who are going to be impacted,\u201d one of the activists, a young girl, responded. And on Monday, hundreds of Sunrise activists occupied the majority leader\u2019s Capitol Hill office, chanting \u201cwhich side are you on?\u201d and bearing a banner that read \u201cMitch, look us in the eyes.\u201d Forty-two were arrested during the protest. The spirit, tenor and terms of the climate debate have changed. And where momentum and zeitgeist shift are not enough, proponents of more Rooseveltian approaches to climate action must engage groups historically on the margins of environmental policy, like Indigenous nations, communities of color, immigrants, faith groups and labor unions. The data shows, for example, that Latinx communities are more concerned about global warming than other voters by a 22-point margin and are more likely to believe it should be a high priority for lawmakers. As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, there may yet be unforeseen opportunities for Green New Dealers to make inroads beyond urban and coastal Democratic enclaves \u2013 perhaps even in Republican strongholds like the south and battlegrounds like the midwest andsun belt. There, the Green New Deal\u2019s populist appeals to economic and social policy may help build a broader base of support. It is too early to predict how this will play out. But, after years of bipartisan stagnation, free market dogma and denialist stalemate, the Green New Deal has breathed much needed oxygen back into the climate debate.

It\u2019s a voice you can believe, a voice that catches and breaks when it strives too hard, rising sharply before falling away at the edges of each line. It is a voice that sometimes seems, in a very English way, to surprise itself with the intensity of its passions \u2013 as on Renee, or the surging chorus of Living in Another World. At its lower register \u2013 on Westward Bound, or Chameleon Day \u2013 it is the murmur of a confessional. It\u2019s a voice with an ingrained ache, which speaks of restrained passion and inner struggle, ordinary earthly torment and longed-for transcendence.

The band\u2019s name, and the title and lyrics of its first hit, were after all a repudiation of the efficacy of language. It might well be Hollis\u2019s great theme. Listen to him burbling at the end of April 5th, happily lost in a wordless reverie. On one of their biggest hits, Living in Another World, \u201cSpeech gets harder / There\u2019s no sense in writing.\u201d \u201cShould have said so much, makes it harder,\u201d he sings on Watershed. Communication as complication and confusion; knowledge as distraction. Back in the mid-80s, there were tales of Hollis taping together the fingers of a keyboard player to force him to play with greater simplicity.</p> <p>Although he sang his often opaque words with unsettling intensity, definitive interpretation frequently lies just out of reach. There are recurring refrains, often concerning personal and universal transformation. Though Hollis professed that he was not a strong devotee of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-blake\">William Blake</a>, you can hear that visionary mysticism rise up in songs such as New Grass and Inheritance. Nature appears as both balm and tormentor, rainbow and flood. There are intimations of biblical apocalypse, evocations of a prelapsarian Eden, throwbacks to established folk tropes, opiate songs, laments for youth and war. As he progressed, Hollis seemed increasingly to be eyeing up some great prize, heralding the imminent arrival of a new world. \u201cSomeday, Christendom will come,\u201d he sings on New Grass. The final song on his last album is called A New Jerusalem. Perhaps he found it. You hope so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca/0_397_3969_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Hollis performing in Dortmund, in 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Hollis performing in Dortmund, in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often you intuited these things, rather than decoded them. His voice was a powerful conduit to other realms. The lyrics for the last three Talk Talk albums are written on the inner sleeve, reproduced in a facsimile of Hollis\u2019s own handwriting, but they sit uncomfortably on the page: terse, disjointed thoughts and phrases. It\u2019s awkward poetry. It is not until you hear the way he sings \u201ctake my freedom, for giving me a sacred love\u201d on Wealth \u2013 a devastating slow-dissolve into spiritual surrender \u2013 that the overwhelming catharsis floods through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/feb/28/talk-talk-mark-hollis\">How Talk Talk spoke to today's artists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It made sense that by the time of his final work, <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15957-laughing-stock-mark-hollis/\">his 1998 solo album</a>, Hollis\u2019s voice had become simply one of several acoustic instruments, his singing a quiver in the grain, a tonal blip, a north London blues incantation. The words had become almost wholly subservient to the mood, and often impossible to discern \u2013 which seemed at least half the point. His creative journey involved a gradual sloughing off of established notions of clarity, meaning, sound. His last album has almost nothing to do with any strand of popular music; it seems to exist in its own world.</p> <p>When I spoke a few years ago to an executive at EMI, a man who worked with Hollis on compiling the 2013 Talk Talk compilation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/13/talk-talk-mark-hollis\">Natural Order</a>, he recalled that Hollis put almost as much thought into the gaps between the tracks as the songs themselves. \u201cFor Mark,\u201d he said, \u201cas much as anything, it was about how it flowed.\u201d You sensed that Hollis had reached a place where the only meaningful statement that remained was stillness. Silence was his final song. For 20 years he sang it beautifully. I\u2019m so sad that it has ended.</p>",

It is a voice that sometimes seems, in a very English way, to surprise itself with the intensity of its passions \u2013 as on Renee, or the surging chorus of Living in Another World. At its lower register \u2013 on Westward Bound, or Chameleon Day \u2013 it is the murmur of a confessional. It\u2019s a voice with an ingrained ache, which speaks of restrained passion and inner struggle, ordinary earthly torment and longed-for transcendence. It carries, always, the promise of compassion. Hollis\u2019s voice seems to be forever reaching for a place beyond literal meaning. The band\u2019s name, and the title and lyrics of its first hit, were after all a repudiation of the efficacy of language. It might well be Hollis\u2019s great theme. Listen to him burbling at the end of April 5th, happily lost in a wordless reverie. On one of their biggest hits, Living in Another World, \u201cSpeech gets harder / There\u2019s no sense in writing.\u201d \u201cShould have said so much, makes it harder,\u201d he sings on Watershed. Communication as complication and confusion; knowledge as distraction. Back in the mid-80s, there were tales of Hollis taping together the fingers of a keyboard player to force him to play with greater simplicity. Although he sang his often opaque words with unsettling intensity, definitive interpretation frequently lies just out of reach. There are recurring refrains, often concerning personal and universal transformation. Though Hollis professed that he was not a strong devotee of William Blake, you can hear that visionary mysticism rise up in songs such as New Grass and Inheritance. Nature appears as both balm and tormentor, rainbow and flood. There are intimations of biblical apocalypse, evocations of a prelapsarian Eden, throwbacks to established folk tropes, opiate songs, laments for youth and war. As he progressed, Hollis seemed increasingly to be eyeing up some great prize, heralding the imminent arrival of a new world. \u201cSomeday, Christendom will come,\u201d he sings on New Grass. The final song on his last album is called A New Jerusalem. Perhaps he found it. You hope so. Often you intuited these things, rather than decoded them. His voice was a powerful conduit to other realms. The lyrics for the last three Talk Talk albums are written on the inner sleeve, reproduced in a facsimile of Hollis\u2019s own handwriting, but they sit uncomfortably on the page: terse, disjointed thoughts and phrases. It\u2019s awkward poetry. It is not until you hear the way he sings \u201ctake my freedom, for giving me a sacred love\u201d on Wealth \u2013 a devastating slow-dissolve into spiritual surrender \u2013 that the overwhelming catharsis floods through. It made sense that by the time of his final work, his 1998 solo album, Hollis\u2019s voice had become simply one of several acoustic instruments, his singing a quiver in the grain, a tonal blip, a north London blues incantation. The words had become almost wholly subservient to the mood, and often impossible to discern \u2013 which seemed at least half the point. His creative journey involved a gradual sloughing off of established notions of clarity, meaning, sound. His last album has almost nothing to do with any strand of popular music; it seems to exist in its own world. When I spoke a few years ago to an executive at EMI, a man who worked with Hollis on compiling the 2013 Talk Talk compilation Natural Order, he recalled that Hollis put almost as much thought into the gaps between the tracks as the songs themselves. \u201cFor Mark,\u201d he said, \u201cas much as anything, it was about how it flowed.\u201d You sensed that Hollis had reached a place where the only meaningful statement that remained was stillness. Silence was his final song. For 20 years he sang it beautifully. I\u2019m so sad that it has ended.",

On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/25/robert-kraft-arrest-warrant-nfl-new-england-patriots-prostitution-allegations\">police issued an arrest warrant</a> for Kraft for two separate misdemeanor charges.

In addition, police claim to have video evidence of one of those encounters. Kraft faces two charges of soliciting prostitution. If he is convicted, he faces up to one year in jail, a $5,000 penalty and 100 hours of education and community service.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/25/robert-kraft-arrest-warrant-nfl-new-england-patriots-prostitution-allegations\">Robert Kraft: documents say Patriots owner solicited sex on day of AFC title game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/us/robert-kraft-what-we-know/index.html\">Kraft\u2019s spokesperson issued</a> the following statement: \u201cWe categorically deny that Mr Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\u201d</p> <h2>How big of a deal is this?</h2> <p>It could be quite a big deal. Since Kraft purchased the Patriots in 1994, saving them from a potential relocation, the team has turned into the NFL\u2019s most successful franchise. Under head coach Bill Belichick, who was hired during Kraft\u2019s tenure, the team has won six Super Bowls, including the most recent. Because of this, Kraft has become one of the most high-profile and influential owners in the league. When the NFL ended its lockout in 2011, many within the league <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/boston/nfl/columns/story?columnist=reiss_mike&amp;id=6801788\">recognized Kraft\u2019s efforts</a> during the negotiation process. </p> <p>Now, if this were just the matter of a rich man engaging the services of a sex worker, the incident would possibly rank as more embarrassing for the league than anything else. However, officials allege that the Orchids of Asia Day Spa is <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/24/robert-kraft-case-spotlights-sex-trafficking-prostitution-realities/2963517002/\">involved with sex trafficking</a>. If that ends up being the case, and it needs to be emphasized that we currently only have law enforcement\u2019s side of events, it would be the story of one the most powerful people in the NFL being complicit, whether knowingly or not, with what amounts to modern-day slavery. That\u2019s a big deal and the league would have to treat it as one.</p> <h2>How has the NFL responded so far?</h2> <p>After the news broke, the league released a statement <a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/patriots/2019/02/nfl-releases-statement-on-robert-krafts-prostitution-charges.html\">simply saying</a>, \u201cThe NFL is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.\u201d</p> <h2>Could the NFL eventually punish Kraft?</h2> <p>That\u2019s the question going forward. The league has received a huge amount of criticism for its disciplinary policy with, for example, cases of domestic violence being <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/\">less severely punished than drug offenses</a>. If there\u2019s clear evidence that Kraft is guilty, the NFL will need to punish him or risk opening themselves up to legitimate charges of treating owners more leniently than players. It should also be pointed out that the league can issue punishments even if Kraft is not found guilty in court. </p> <p>Goodell himself has said everyone in the NFL needs to be treated the same. When Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of a controlled substance in 2014, the NFL gave him a six-game suspension and a $500,000 penalty. When he announced the decision, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/robert-kraft-s-arrest-chance-roger-goodell-show-nfl-serious-ncna974961\">Goodell said</a>, \u201cI have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players.\u201d </p> <h2>Hasn\u2019t the league punished the Patriots before?</h2> <p>Yes. In 2007, the league fined the team $250,000 and took away their first-round draft pick after an investigation revealed that Belichick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jan/08/the-window-for-the-patriots-to-counter-the-spygate-narrative-narrows\">illegally taped</a> opponents\u2019 signs. In addition, Belichick was also fined $500,000. In 2015, the team was fined $1m and lost two draft picks, including another first rounder, after quarterback Tom Brady was caught using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/15/tom-brady-drops-appeal-deflategate-suspension\">improperly deflated footballs</a>. Brady was also suspended four games, a punishment he eventually served after a lengthy court battle. Since this latest scandal doesn\u2019t directly involve the team \u2013 the allegations involve Kraft\u2019s private life \u2013 the Patriots are unlikely to be punished. the most likely punishment for Kraft would be a suspension and a hefty fine, although that won\u2019t hurt a man worth billions too much. Although, again, attempting to predict what Goodell and company will do when it comes to issuing punishments is extremely tricky.</p> <h2>Could Kraft eventually lose the team?</h2> <p>In an article for the New York Daily News, Jane McManus makes a convincing argument that, should Kraft be found guilty, he should be banned from the league. McManus points out that Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson was essentially <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article190405549.html\">forced out of the league</a> after sexual harassment allegations and she argues that this case would justify a similar result. \u201cGoodell and any owners who don\u2019t want to be tainted by these alleged actions need to investigate and send a message,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/ny-sports-robert-kraft-prostitution-allegations-nfl-banned-20190222-story.html\">she writes</a>, \u201cyou can\u2019t appeal to women if owners exploit them without consequences, whether that is on the field, as employees or even in their private lives.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/02/22/robert-kraft-prostitution-charges-sex-trafficking-investigation-nfl-patriots-owner?utm_campaign=sinow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;xid=socialflow_twitter_si&amp;utm_medium=social\">Sports Illustrated\u2019s legal expert Michael McCann</a>, that is highly unlikely, as it would require the votes of 23 of 31 eligible owners. McCann does allow for the possibility that the Kraft could be persuaded to hand over control of his team in order to save face. Kraft\u2019s son Jonathan, who already plays a large role in the organization, would be the obvious successor.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the bigger picture here?</h2> <p>The case, it needs to be emphasized, is far <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/02/22/robert-kraft-charged-soliticating-prostitution-human-trafficking\">bigger than football</a>. Kraft is just one of hundreds who have been charged with soliciting prostitution as part of this investigation. There is a legitimate sports story here involving how the NFL will treat the matter, especially considering past failures when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/07/the-nfls-problem-with-violence-against-women-a-story-of-profit-and-apathy\">employees mistreating women</a>. It should not, however, overshadow the fact that the larger story appears to involve women who have been exploited and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/here-s-what-could-be-next-women-working-florida-massage-n974936\">forced to work under terrible conditions</a>. They are the real victims here, and, in comparison, the trials and tribulations of an NFL team are inconsequential.</p>",

The league has received a huge amount of criticism for its disciplinary policy with, for example, cases of domestic violence being less severely punished than drug offenses. If there\u2019s clear evidence that Kraft is guilty, the NFL will need to punish him or risk opening themselves up to legitimate charges of treating owners more leniently than players. It should also be pointed out that the league can issue punishments even if Kraft is not found guilty in court. Goodell himself has said everyone in the NFL needs to be treated the same. When Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of a controlled substance in 2014, the NFL gave him a six-game suspension and a $500,000 penalty. When he announced the decision, Goodell said, \u201cI have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players.\u201d Hasn\u2019t the league punished the Patriots before? Yes. In 2007, the league fined the team $250,000 and took away their first-round draft pick after an investigation revealed that Belichick illegally taped opponents\u2019 signs. In addition, Belichick was also fined $500,000. In 2015, the team was fined $1m and lost two draft picks, including another first rounder, after quarterback Tom Brady was caught using improperly deflated footballs. Brady was also suspended four games, a punishment he eventually served after a lengthy court battle. Since this latest scandal doesn\u2019t directly involve the team \u2013 the allegations involve Kraft\u2019s private life \u2013 the Patriots are unlikely to be punished. the most likely punishment for Kraft would be a suspension and a hefty fine, although that won\u2019t hurt a man worth billions too much. Although, again, attempting to predict what Goodell and company will do when it comes to issuing punishments is extremely tricky. Could Kraft eventually lose the team? In an article for the New York Daily News, Jane McManus makes a convincing argument that, should Kraft be found guilty, he should be banned from the league. McManus points out that Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson was essentially forced out of the league after sexual harassment allegations and she argues that this case would justify a similar result. \u201cGoodell and any owners who don\u2019t want to be tainted by these alleged actions need to investigate and send a message,\u201d she writes, \u201cyou can\u2019t appeal to women if owners exploit them without consequences, whether that is on the field, as employees or even in their private lives.\u201d According to Sports Illustrated\u2019s legal expert Michael McCann, that is highly unlikely, as it would require the votes of 23 of 31 eligible owners. McCann does allow for the possibility that the Kraft could be persuaded to hand over control of his team in order to save face. Kraft\u2019s son Jonathan, who already plays a large role in the organization, would be the obvious successor. What\u2019s the bigger picture here? The case, it needs to be emphasized, is far bigger than football. Kraft is just one of hundreds who have been charged with soliciting prostitution as part of this investigation. There is a legitimate sports story here involving how the NFL will treat the matter, especially considering past failures when it comes to employees mistreating women. It should not, however, overshadow the fact that the larger story appears to involve women who have been exploited and forced to work under terrible conditions. They are the real victims here, and, in comparison, the trials and tribulations of an NFL team are inconsequential.",

For the first time, many Italians could afford a car. But the country\u2019s roads \u2013 many of them narrow, meandering up mountains and twisting through city centres \u2013 needed modernising. Morandi Bridge was the centrepiece of a brand-new network of highways connecting Milan and Turin in the north to the tourist hotspots of the Ligurian Riviera, bypassing a congested Genoa and ultimately completing the coastline highway that runs from southern France to Tuscany.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d02c88937d9616a4cb40eeb85a698d99361bd7b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d02c88937d9616a4cb40eeb85a698d99361bd7b/0_467_6299_3781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riccardo Morandi demonstrates a model of Morandi Bridge to the then Italian president, Giuseppe Saragat, during the bridge\u2019s inauguration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riccardo Morandi demonstrates a model of Morandi Bridge to the then Italian president, Giuseppe Saragat, during the bridge\u2019s inauguration.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Named after Riccardo Morandi, the engineer who designed it, the new bridge was a multi-span, cable-stayed bridge similar to the Brooklyn Bridge: regular towers, from which a series of exposed steel cables stretched to the bridge\u2019s deck.</p> \n<p>But, although similar in shape, Morandi Bridge was very different in other ways. The deck was entirely made of reinforced concrete, and it had only four cables per tower, instead of the usual dozens. Crucially, the cables were covered in pre-stressed concrete \u2013 a type of treated concrete invented by the French engineer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eugene-Freyssinet\">Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet</a>. Unlike normal reinforced concrete, which is generally best suited to resisting compression, the new pre-stressed concrete was specifically designed to resist traction.</p> \n<p>As a result, Morandi Bridge was stronger and lighter, with minimal use of steel, than any other bridge of its era \u2013 and boasted a clean, distinct design that quickly became a symbol of Italian engineering, tangible proof of the country\u2019s technical abilities.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe bridge\u2019s concrete structure won\u2019t need any maintenance,\u201d boasted an article in La Stampa newspaper ahead of the bridge\u2019s opening. \u201cNeither will its stayed cables, which are protected from atmospheric agents by their concrete vest.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d017e0594d6da9fb8f4b3e11b63c31a83d6a11ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d017e0594d6da9fb8f4b3e11b63c31a83d6a11ae/2168_453_9550_5731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morandi Bridge under construction in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morandi Bridge under construction in 1965.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Morandi himself became one of the most respected engineers in the nation \u2013 going on to use the same technique elsewhere, including at Rome\u2019s airport and a bridge over Libya\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&amp;pb=!1s0x137f66a1578171bb:0x62ecd4a7f2fe7088!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%25C3%25BCcke_%25C3%25BCber_das_Wadi_al-Kuf!5sWadi+el+Kuf+bridge+-+Google+Search&amp;imagekey=!1e1!2shttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Wadi_el_Kuf_Bridge_1970%2527s.jpg/300px-Wadi_el_Kuf_Bridge_1970%2527s.jpg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwidneXmnundAhXRwVkKHVYWCcwQoiowF3oECAoQCQ\">Wadi el Kuf</a> that was the highest single-span bridge in the world \u2013 and helped Italy earn the reputation as the nation that could bend concrete. He died in 1989.</p> \n<p>The material was perfectly suited to postwar Italy. The country couldn\u2019t afford the amount of steel necessary to build something like the Brooklyn Bridge: steel was in short supply because of international sanctions that had been placed against the fascist government, and Italy lacked the resources to produce steel domestically. It was, however, rich in the clays and river sediments necessary for concrete production. Led by Morandi, the country\u2019s engineers learned how to achieve the same results with concrete that they would with steel.</p> \n<p>The legacy? Thousands of concrete viaducts, tunnels and bridges that together form a vast engineering triumph.</p> \n<p>Today, the country is still one of the top cement producers and is home to the eighth largest cement company in the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cMorandi, for us engineers, is still a reference and considered to be a precursor,\u201d says Marco di Prisco, a professor of construction science at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and researcher on the life expectancy of concrete buildings.</p> \n<p>But being an innovator, Di Prisco notes, often comes at a cost.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you create something new, you take some risks.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the 1960s little was known about the interaction of materials, or the effects of pollution and climate on corrosion. Traffic volumes were very different, and concepts such as the durability or lifespan of a building were not commonly discussed. \u201cBack then, you didn\u2019t really think in terms of durability,\u201d Di Prisco says. \u201cWhereas today we focus much more on how to extend a building\u2019s life.

      "bodyText": "On 14 August last year, the city of Genoa in northwest Italy woke to a strong summer storm. By 11.30am, the rain was so heavy that visibility had fallen dramatically. Videos captured by security cameras show vehicles slowing down as they crossed Morandi Bridge, which grew progressively more enveloped in a grey mist. A few minutes later, a 200-metre section of the bridge collapsed, including one of its three supporting towers. The tragedy killed 43 people and left 600 homeless. It also dealt a hammer blow to Italy\u2019s once-proud engineering history \u2013 and the country\u2019s confidence in its mastery of a key construction technology: concrete. A little more than a kilometre long, crossing the Polcevera valley, a river, a railway depot, a densely populated area and several large factories at an average height of 45 metres above the ground, Morandi was one of the longest concrete bridges in the world when it opened in September 1967. The 1960s were Italy\u2019s boom years. For the first time, many Italians could afford a car. But the country\u2019s roads \u2013 many of them narrow, meandering up mountains and twisting through city centres \u2013 needed modernising. Morandi Bridge was the centrepiece of a brand-new network of highways connecting Milan and Turin in the north to the tourist hotspots of the Ligurian Riviera, bypassing a congested Genoa and ultimately completing the coastline highway that runs from southern France to Tuscany. Named after Riccardo Morandi, the engineer who designed it, the new bridge was a multi-span, cable-stayed bridge similar to the Brooklyn Bridge: regular towers, from which a series of exposed steel cables stretched to the bridge\u2019s deck. But, although similar in shape, Morandi Bridge was very different in other ways. The deck was entirely made of reinforced concrete, and it had only four cables per tower, instead of the usual dozens. Crucially, the cables were covered in pre-stressed concrete \u2013 a type of treated concrete invented by the French engineer Eug\u00e8ne Freyssinet. Unlike normal reinforced concrete, which is generally best suited to resisting compression, the new pre-stressed concrete was specifically designed to resist traction. As a result, Morandi Bridge was stronger and lighter, with minimal use of steel, than any other bridge of its era \u2013 and boasted a clean, distinct design that quickly became a symbol of Italian engineering, tangible proof of the country\u2019s technical abilities. \u201cThe bridge\u2019s concrete structure won\u2019t need any maintenance,\u201d boasted an article in La Stampa newspaper ahead of the bridge\u2019s opening. \u201cNeither will its stayed cables, which are protected from atmospheric agents by their concrete vest.\u201d Morandi himself became one of the most respected engineers in the nation \u2013 going on to use the same technique elsewhere, including at Rome\u2019s airport and a bridge over Libya\u2019s Wadi el Kuf that was the highest single-span bridge in the world \u2013 and helped Italy earn the reputation as the nation that could bend concrete. He died in 1989. The material was perfectly suited to postwar Italy. The country couldn\u2019t afford the amount of steel necessary to build something like the Brooklyn Bridge: steel was in short supply because of international sanctions that had been placed against the fascist government, and Italy lacked the resources to produce steel domestically. It was, however, rich in the clays and river sediments necessary for concrete production. Led by Morandi, the country\u2019s engineers learned how to achieve the same results with concrete that they would with steel. The legacy? Thousands of concrete viaducts, tunnels and bridges that together form a vast engineering triumph. Today, the country is still one of the top cement producers and is home to the eighth largest cement company in the world. \u201cMorandi, for us engineers, is still a reference and considered to be a precursor,\u201d says Marco di Prisco, a professor of construction science at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and researcher on the life expectancy of concrete buildings. But being an innovator, Di Prisco notes, often comes at a cost. \u201cEvery time you create something new, you take some risks.\u201d In the 1960s little was known about the interaction of materials, or the effects of pollution and climate on corrosion. Traffic volumes were very different, and concepts such as the durability or lifespan of a building were not commonly discussed. \u201cBack then, you didn\u2019t really think in terms of durability,\u201d Di Prisco says. \u201cWhereas today we focus much more on how to extend a building\u2019s life. We even come up with a maintenance guide to keep structures in good conditions.\u201d Why exactly the bridge collapsed last August is yet to be understood. A team of experts working with the investigators issued a report this month stating that the bridge samples analysed showed evidence of corrosion and some construction errors, but they steered clear from attributing a cause to the collapse. \u201cA bridge is like a car,\u201d says Luigi Gambarotta, professor of structural mechanics at the University of Genoa. \u201cYou can\u2019t overload it, and to keep it working you need to change the broken parts.\u201d That was difficult in the case of Morandi Bridge: the cables were difficult to inspect, and it was unclear how they were coping with increased traffic loads. \u201cWhen I visited the bridge in the early 1990s for a documentary on Morandi\u2019s work, I was [surprised] to see fissures and corrosion just 20 years after its completion,\u201d says Giuseppe Imbesi, an architect who worked with Morandi on a bridge proposal for the Strait of Messina. Morandi himself was surprised to see the structure age faster than he had anticipated. In 1979 he issued a report detailing a number of interventions to protect the structure against pollution from nearby factories and the salty sea air. Little, however, was done, and by 1992 the trademark concrete cables were heavily corroded. The company that managed the bridge, Autostrade per l\u2019Italia \u2013 then owned by the state \u2013 decided to add extra new cables around the corroded ones, rather than replace them.

      "body": "<p>When the actor Emma Thompson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/20/emma-thompson-quits-film-after-john-lasseter-joins-production\">left the forthcoming animated film Luck last month while it was still in production</a>, it was done without public fanfare, and was only confirmed when film-industry publications such as Variety magazine picked up on it. Now Thompson has put herself firmly above the MeToo parapet with the publication publishing her incendiary letter of resignation addressed to the film\u2019s backers, Skydance Media, one of Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious studios.</p> <p>It was known that Thompson was unhappy with the arrival in January of former head of Pixar John Lasseter as the new head of Skydance Animation. But the letter goes into extraordinary detail about her disquiet over the appointment of a studio executive whose downfall had been one of the key landmarks of the Me Too and Times Up campaigns.</p> <p>The move was immediately hailed by activists. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melsil/status/1100433486115209221\">Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of the website Women and Hollywood tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is more than an open letter \u2014 Thompson has issued a rallying cry.

On the purchase of Pixar by Disney in 2006, Lasseter was appointed chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, after which he supervised such films as Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.</p> <p>However, in the wake of accusations of sexual misconduct that rocked the film industry in 2017, when the New York Times and New Yorker first published its allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Lasseter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/21/john-lasseter-taking-leave-from-pixar-citing-missteps-and-unwanted-hugs\">took a six-month leave of absence</a> after confessing to unspecified \u201cmissteps\u201d. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/09/pixars-john-lasseter-steps-down-from-disney-in-wake-of-metoo\">permanent departure from Disney was announced in June 2018</a>.</p> <p>In her letter, Thompson raises questions about the ethical implications of working with Lasseter. Her implication is that Lasseter\u2019s admitting to \u201cinappropriate hugging\u201d and \u201cother missteps\u201d was insufficient, and that it would be reasonable for women who now work with him to question whether he would act appropriately because he realised the error of his ways or because it was politic to do so.</p> <p>Thompson concludes by expressing regret about quitting the production, but determining the alternative would be irresponsible for someone in her position.</p> <p>\u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d</p> <p>When Skydance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/09/pixar-john-lasseter-skydancce-animation-times-up\">announced it had hired Lasseter there was an immediate backlash</a> against the company, which is owned by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison and brother of Megan Ellison, who is also a high profile film producer. The Time\u2019s Up campaign said in a statement that the appointment \u201cendorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence\u201d, while the decision was defended by Ellison in a memo, saying: \u201cWe are certain that John has learned valuable lessons and is ready to prove his capabilities as a leader and a colleague.\u201d</p> <p>Skydance also took the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/john-lasseter-skydance-animation-female-employees-1203107626/\">extraordinary step of organising a \u201ctown hall\u201d</a> in January, where employees were able to question Lasseter over his record. In her letter, Thompson addressed this point, writing: \u201cMuch has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?\u201d</p> <p>In the past Thompson has been a vocal supporter of MeToo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/25/emma-thompson-dieting-screwed-up-my-metabolism-i-regret-ever-going-on-one-\">telling the Guardian in 2018</a> that \u201c#MeToo has been a wonderful moment of clarity\u201d. \u201cWhen I was a young woman, older men in the industry would constantly try it on. I was always able to say no, and they took that for an answer. What younger women have to encounter terrifies me.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted Skydance, which declined to comment.</p> <p>The full text of Thompson\u2019s letter is below.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>As you know, I have pulled out of the production of Luck \u2013 to be directed by the very wonderful Alessandro Carloni. It feels very odd to me that you and your company would consider hiring someone with Mr Lasseter\u2019s pattern of misconduct given the present climate in which people with the kind of power that you have can reasonably be expected to step up to the plate.</em></p> <p><em>I realise that the situation \u2013 involving as it does many human beings \u2013 is complicated. However these are the questions I would like to ask:</em></p> <p><em>\u2022If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he\u2019s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave \u201cprofessionally\u201d?</em></p> <p><em>\u2022If a man has made women at his companies feel undervalued and disrespected for decades, why should the women at his new company think that any respect he shows them is anything other than an act that he\u2019s required to perform by his coach, his therapist and his employment agreement? The message seems to be, \u201cI am learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u2022Much has been said about giving <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/film/johnlasseter\">John Lasseter</a> a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?</em></p> <p><em>\u2022If John Lasseter started his own company, then every employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give him a second chance. But any Skydance employees who don\u2019t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or lose their jobs. Shouldn\u2019t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the employees don\u2019t want to give him a second chance?</em></p> <p><em>\u2022Skydance has revealed that no women received settlements from Pixar or Disney as a result of being harassed by John Lasseter. But given all the abuse that\u2019s been heaped on women who have come forward to make accusations against powerful men, do we really think that no settlements means that there was no harassment or no hostile work environment? Are we supposed to feel comforted that women who feel that their careers were derailed by working for Lasseter DIDN\u2019T receive money?</em></p> <p><em>I hope these queries make the level of my discomfort understandable. I regret having to step away because I love Alessandro so much and think he is an incredibly creative director. But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising.</em></p> <p><em>I am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year. But I am also aware that if people who have spoken out </em><em>\u2013 like me </em><em>\u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.</em></p> <p><em>Yours most sincerely,</em></p> <p><em>Emma Thompson</em></p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "When the actor Emma Thompson left the forthcoming animated film Luck last month while it was still in production, it was done without public fanfare, and was only confirmed when film-industry publications such as Variety magazine picked up on it. Now Thompson has put herself firmly above the MeToo parapet with the publication publishing her incendiary letter of resignation addressed to the film\u2019s backers, Skydance Media, one of Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious studios. It was known that Thompson was unhappy with the arrival in January of former head of Pixar John Lasseter as the new head of Skydance Animation. But the letter goes into extraordinary detail about her disquiet over the appointment of a studio executive whose downfall had been one of the key landmarks of the Me Too and Times Up campaigns. The move was immediately hailed by activists. Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of the website Women and Hollywood tweeted: \u201cThis is more than an open letter \u2014 Thompson has issued a rallying cry. We hope others with power and privilege will join Thompson in speaking out about abuses of power and those who enable that toxic behavior.\u201d Lasseter had made his name by directing cutting-edge animated films for Pixar in the 1990s and 2000s, including Toy Story and Toy Story 2, A Bug\u2019s Life and Cars and Cars 2. On the purchase of Pixar by Disney in 2006, Lasseter was appointed chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, after which he supervised such films as Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3. However, in the wake of accusations of sexual misconduct that rocked the film industry in 2017, when the New York Times and New Yorker first published its allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Lasseter took a six-month leave of absence after confessing to unspecified \u201cmissteps\u201d. His permanent departure from Disney was announced in June 2018. In her letter, Thompson raises questions about the ethical implications of working with Lasseter. Her implication is that Lasseter\u2019s admitting to \u201cinappropriate hugging\u201d and \u201cother missteps\u201d was insufficient, and that it would be reasonable for women who now work with him to question whether he would act appropriately because he realised the error of his ways or because it was politic to do so. Thompson concludes by expressing regret about quitting the production, but determining the alternative would be irresponsible for someone in her position. \u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d When Skydance announced it had hired Lasseter there was an immediate backlash against the company, which is owned by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison and brother of Megan Ellison, who is also a high profile film producer. The Time\u2019s Up campaign said in a statement that the appointment \u201cendorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence\u201d, while the decision was defended by Ellison in a memo, saying: \u201cWe are certain that John has learned valuable lessons and is ready to prove his capabilities as a leader and a colleague.\u201d Skydance also took the extraordinary step of organising a \u201ctown hall\u201d in January, where employees were able to question Lasseter over his record. In her letter, Thompson addressed this point, writing: \u201cMuch has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?\u201d In the past Thompson has been a vocal supporter of MeToo, telling the Guardian in 2018 that \u201c#MeToo has been a wonderful moment of clarity\u201d. \u201cWhen I was a young woman, older men in the industry would constantly try it on. I was always able to say no, and they took that for an answer. What younger women have to encounter terrifies me.\u201d The Guardian has contacted Skydance, which declined to comment. The full text of Thompson\u2019s letter is below. As you know, I have pulled out of the production of Luck \u2013 to be directed by the very wonderful Alessandro Carloni. It feels very odd to me that you and your company would consider hiring someone with Mr Lasseter\u2019s pattern of misconduct given the present climate in which people with the kind of power that you have can reasonably be expected to step up to the plate. I realise that the situation \u2013 involving as it does many human beings \u2013 is complicated. However these are the questions I would like to ask: \u2022If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he\u2019s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave \u201cprofessionally\u201d? \u2022If a man has made women at his companies feel undervalued and disrespected for decades, why should the women at his new company think that any respect he shows them is anything other than an act that he\u2019s required to perform by his coach, his therapist and his employment agreement? The message seems to be, \u201cI am learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d \u2022Much has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance\u201d. But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance? \u2022If John Lasseter started his own company, then every employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give him a second chance. But any Skydance employees who don\u2019t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or lose their jobs. Shouldn\u2019t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the employees don\u2019t want to give him a second chance? \u2022Skydance has revealed that no women received settlements from Pixar or Disney as a result of being harassed by John Lasseter. But given all the abuse that\u2019s been heaped on women who have come forward to make accusations against powerful men, do we really think that no settlements means that there was no harassment or no hostile work environment? Are we supposed to feel comforted that women who feel that their careers were derailed by working for Lasseter DIDN\u2019T receive money? I hope these queries make the level of my discomfort understandable. I regret having to step away because I love Alessandro so much and think he is an incredibly creative director. But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising. I am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year. But I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2013 like me \u2013 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation. Yours most sincerely, Emma Thompson",

Hundreds of facilities workers at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Ministry of Justice, who earn as little as \u00a37.83 an hour, joined cleaners from the University of London on Tuesday in a day-long strike and day of action against outsourcing, which they say exposes them to insecurity and discrimination. Cleaners, security, catering staff and others represented by the PCS union are demanding the living wage, equal terms and conditions and an end to outsourcing. Cleaners and security officers from the MoJ, organised by the grassroots United Voices of the World (UVW) union, are demanding the living wage, and cleaners from the University of London, whose activism together under the banner of the Independent Workers of Great Britain union (IWGB) has already won them better pay and conditions, are demanding equal terms and conditions with directly employed staff. The strike is timed to coincide with a ruling on a landmark case on collective bargaining that could empower the UK\u2019s 3.3 million outsourced workers to negotiate directly with their de-facto employers \u2013 the companies buying the outsourced services \u2013 as well as their direct employers. Outsourced London security guards, organised by the IWGB, are seeking a judicial review of a decision by the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) not to hear an application for trade union recognition for the purposes of collective bargaining with the University of London. If the application is successful it would introduce the concept of a joint employer to UK law. This concept has existed in the United States for decades. That could have implications for workers at BEIS, who are taking their second day of strike action this year over low pay. They have been told by their employers, the outsourcing firms Aramark and Engie, that the department has insisted they be paid no more than the average for the private sector in London, which works out to \u00a38.49. Their union, the PCS, said a new company lined up to take over the security contract at BEIS had confirmed that the pay rate was set by the department and could not be altered in line with the London living wage. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said his workers had been betrayed by a government department \u201cmore interested in keeping costs down than paying staff who do vital work a proper London living wage\u201d. One of the catering workers from BEIS who joined the march said ministers should be ashamed at their offer to solve the dispute. \u201cThey should consider and think about the staff, not just the benefits and services they get,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are workers getting peanuts when [Aramark] are getting the whole cake?\u201d Marching, dancing, drumming and singing along to music from a portable soundsystem, despite having no permit from police, the protesters walked through central London, taking in the Royal Courts of Justice, Parliament Square, the BEIS headquarters on Victoria Street and the MoJ on Petty France. Speaking in front of a statue of Winston Churchill opposite the Houses of Parliament, Margarita Cunalata, an IWGB representative who works at University of London but is employed by Cordant, called for her and colleagues to be brought in-house. \u201cWe need to stop this discrimination between those who count and those who don\u2019t count,\u201d she said through an interpreter. \u201cWe have the right to earn money, and to the profits that are taken from us. We have the right to a better life.\u201d Strikers also heard from Susana Benavides, a member of UVW who last week won \u00a375,000 compensation from Topshop after an employment tribunal ruled she had been targeted for union organising. She said: \u201cWe are here to show the people in parliament that we are human beings and we are not going to go until we get dignity and respect at work.\u201d",

If selected by the Commons Speaker for a vote on Wednesday, there would be a \u201ccomfortable victory\u201d on a \u201cvery uncontroversial issue\u201d, said the Conservative MP Alberto Costa, who tabled the amendment. It seeks to ringfence the rights of all British nationals settled in the EU and those of EU citizens in the UK, regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. \u201cThis is not about the single market or the customs union, this is about the rights of innocent people, most of whom did not have a say in the referendum, including British nationals in the EU,\u201d said Costa. It has been backed by the Eurosceptics Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Edward Leigh, Steve Baker and Sir Graham Brady, but also by staunch pro-EU backbenchers including Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve. Corbyn confirmed he would be backing the amendment minutes after May moved to head off the rebellion in a statement to the Commons committing to votes on a no-deal Brexit or a delay. May urged the remaining 27 EU member states to match the \u201cguarantee\u201d the UK had made to EU citizens. \u201cThe EU does not have the legal authority to do a separate deal on the EU citizens\u2019 rights without a mandate \u2026 If it\u2019s not within that withdrawal agreement then it is a matter for individual states, and we have already taken that up with individual states,\u201d she said. Costa said May was hiding behind process, adding: \u201cIf she says the [European] commission can\u2019t do it, what she needs to do is go to all the EU leaders and get them to tell the commission to take it off the table. \u201cShe promised to protect citizens\u2019 rights more than two years ago and has failed to do so.

They have one factor in common. The war of 1965, the Kargil conflict of 1999, and lesser, recurring clashes have settled nothing. Kashmir remains divided, disputed and prone to violence, the scene of a low-level insurgency and a constant source of friction <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/kashmir-on-edge-after-local-government-falls-amid-militant-clashes\">exploited by extremists</a> on both sides.</p> <p>Modi clearly felt he had to do something after the Valentine\u2019s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. Public opinion, and his political rivals, demanded he act. Tuesday\u2019s \u201csurgical strikes\u201d were the less risky option, compared with a lengthier cross-border ground operation to which Pakistan would perforce have responded militarily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/kashmir-zip/giv-3902EwkqUCZXtulw/\" data-alt=\"Map of Kashmir\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/kashmir-zip/giv-3902EwkqUCZXtulw/\">Map of Kashmir</a> <figcaption>Areas of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan, India and China</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overheated tempers could have had the opposite effect, as in the past, pushing Modi into more drastic action \u2013 and this remains a possibility. Yet what looks, at present, like an Indian decision to limit reprisals was helped by Khan\u2019s calm, non-escalatory handling of the post-attack fallout so far. He maintained this ostensibly reasonable approach on Tuesday, reserving the right to respond \u201cappropriately\u201d in self-defence.</p> <p>Could it be Pakistan\u2019s leaders are finally learning their history lessons? Pakistan cannot defeat more powerful, wealthier India. When it tries, it loses. Nuclear is not a sane option. But the country is successfully strengthening its diplomatic and political defences.</p> <p>Pakistan has a powerful friend and investor in China and plays a key role in Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/chinas-belt-and-road-plan-in-pakistan-takes-a-military-turn/articleshow/67173327.cms\">Belt and Road project</a> \u2013 which has a growing military dimension. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/20/asia/saudi-pakistan-golden-gun-scli-intl/index.html\">A recent visitor to Islamabad</a> was Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and another wealthy backer.</p> <p>Thanks, meanwhile, to Donald Trump, Pakistan finds itself increasingly free of Washington\u2019s stifling embrace. Complaining, like India, about Pakistani links to extremist groups, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-05/trump-s-slashing-of-pakistan-aid-is-justified-but-futile\">Trump slashed US security aid last year</a>. This and the expected US withdrawal from Afghanistan is welcomed by many Pakistanis as the end of strategic vassalage.</p> <p>So when India <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/india-says-will-ensure-complete-diplomatic-isolation-of-pakistan-after-worst-attack\">vowed to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d Pakistan diplomatically </a>after the 14 February attack, and threatened international ignominy, it promised more than it could deliver.</p> <p>That could only exacerbate Indian frustrations. And \u201ccool hand\u201d Khan could overplay his cards by appearing to indulge far-right religious groups, as in last year\u2019s election campaign. Promising an inquiry into terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed\u2019s culpability for 14 February, if India first provides evidence, while urging Modi to \u201c<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/give-peace-a-chance-imran-to-pm-modi/articleshow/68142692.cms\">give peace a chance</a>\u201d, is unlikely to be enough.</p> <p>At a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi indicated he would continue to use terrorism as a stick to beat Pakistan. \u201cThere is consensus in the entire world against terrorism ...

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s limited airstrikes across the \u201cline of control\u201d in Kashmir, and Pakistan\u2019s warning that it is preparing for \u201call eventualities\u201d, appear to be more political posturing than a prelude to all-out war. At least, that is what the international community hopes as the nuclear-armed neighbours square off once again. Rationally speaking, neither country\u2019s prime minister can afford another full-scale conflict \u2013 Pakistan\u2019s Imran Khan because he is still getting started after winning power for the first time last July, India\u2019s Narendra Modi because he is seeking a second chance in national polls this spring. Two of the three major India-Pakistan conflicts since partition in 1947 have been waged over Kashmir. They have one factor in common. The war of 1965, the Kargil conflict of 1999, and lesser, recurring clashes have settled nothing. Kashmir remains divided, disputed and prone to violence, the scene of a low-level insurgency and a constant source of friction exploited by extremists on both sides. Modi clearly felt he had to do something after the Valentine\u2019s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. Public opinion, and his political rivals, demanded he act. Tuesday\u2019s \u201csurgical strikes\u201d were the less risky option, compared with a lengthier cross-border ground operation to which Pakistan would perforce have responded militarily. Overheated tempers could have had the opposite effect, as in the past, pushing Modi into more drastic action \u2013 and this remains a possibility. Yet what looks, at present, like an Indian decision to limit reprisals was helped by Khan\u2019s calm, non-escalatory handling of the post-attack fallout so far. He maintained this ostensibly reasonable approach on Tuesday, reserving the right to respond \u201cappropriately\u201d in self-defence. Could it be Pakistan\u2019s leaders are finally learning their history lessons? Pakistan cannot defeat more powerful, wealthier India. When it tries, it loses. Nuclear is not a sane option. But the country is successfully strengthening its diplomatic and political defences. Pakistan has a powerful friend and investor in China and plays a key role in Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road project \u2013 which has a growing military dimension. A recent visitor to Islamabad was Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and another wealthy backer. Thanks, meanwhile, to Donald Trump, Pakistan finds itself increasingly free of Washington\u2019s stifling embrace. Complaining, like India, about Pakistani links to extremist groups, Trump slashed US security aid last year. This and the expected US withdrawal from Afghanistan is welcomed by many Pakistanis as the end of strategic vassalage. So when India vowed to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d Pakistan diplomatically after the 14 February attack, and threatened international ignominy, it promised more than it could deliver. That could only exacerbate Indian frustrations. And \u201ccool hand\u201d Khan could overplay his cards by appearing to indulge far-right religious groups, as in last year\u2019s election campaign. Promising an inquiry into terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed\u2019s culpability for 14 February, if India first provides evidence, while urging Modi to \u201cgive peace a chance\u201d, is unlikely to be enough. At a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi indicated he would continue to use terrorism as a stick to beat Pakistan. \u201cThere is consensus in the entire world against terrorism ... The scores will be settled this time, settled for good,\u201d he warned. Speaking in Churu after the airstrikes, Modi boasted India was not afraid of escalation. Other ministers were more triumphalist still, celebrating an \u201cact of extreme valour\u201d and promising to hit back \u201charder and stronger\u201d if Pakistan retaliated. This sort of jingoism may make electoral sense to Modi\u2019s people. But if they, too, study recent history, they will realise the political route is the only escape from India\u2019s recurring Kashmir nightmare, security specialist Happymon Jacob suggested. \u201cAggressive tactics [have] turned south Kashmir\u2019s popular opinion against India,\u201d Jacob wrote in The Hindu. \u201cIndia finds itself in a bind in Kashmir, and it will take a great deal of political sophistication, back-channel reaching out, and comprehensive political vision to get Kashmir back on track.\u201d",

The pair, who went on a 21-month crime spree robbing banks, gas stations and restaurants at the height of the US\u2019s Great Depression, were shot and killed in a police ambush in Louisiana in 1934. Barrow was 24, and Parker, who had teamed up with Barrow on his release from prison years earlier, was 23.

      "bodyText": "Banks will gain access to additional Bank of England funds from next month to prevent a financial shock should the UK quit the European Union without a deal. While it remained unclear whether the UK would leave on 29 March or if parliament would vote to delay Brexit, the central bank said it would allow financial institutions to access cash on a weekly basis rather than the usual monthly system. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, played down the significance of the move, saying it was part of \u201cnormal contingency planning\u201d. He added: \u201cIn the run up to the referendum we moved to weekly sterling auctions and held it for several months after the referendum. There is no signal in it, except that it is part of normal contingency planning.\u201d About 100 banks and building societies would be eligible to access up to \u00a3300bn of cash for six months in return for high-grade mortgages and other financial assets, Carney said. \u201cWe are not seeing any liquidity stresses in the market,\u201d he said, adding that commercial banks seeking central bank funds in recent auctions were only paying a couple of basis points, or fractions of a per cent, above the 0.75% bank rate. However, the announcement emphasised that Threadneedle Street was concerned about a no-deal Brexit and the potential for a credit crunch to bring the banking system to its knees as it did during the 2008 financial crash. In recent months Carney has pushed European and US regulators to agree contingency arrangements to cope with a no-deal Brexit to make sure financial markets were able to continue trading without interruption. On Monday, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed that firms working in the US and the UK would continue to meet the requirements required to operate in both countries, even if the UK exited the EU without a deal. City analysts said the move would protect London from losing trillions of pounds of complex financial derivatives business after Brexit. Carney said the UK\u2019s banking sector holds around \u00a31tn in cash or similarly liquid assets, four times the level ahead of the 2008 crash. But he emphasised his concern at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, saying: \u201cIf we come back in May and there\u2019s no deal I guarantee you we will come back with a lower GDP forecast.\u201d He warned that delaying the UK\u2019s exit was not as good for the economy as reaching a deal.

Earlier this month Carney questioned the path of globalisation, which he argued was dividing nations and causing enough political stress to hamper global growth. He said Brexit was an acid test of whether it was possible to reshape globalisation in a way that offered the benefits of trade while allaying public fears about the erosion of democracy.",

      "body": "<p>It is day eight of the existence of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/the-independent-group\"> </a>Independent Group, which is currently polling at 18% (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectionMapsUK/status/1100158795894980610\">according to YouGov</a>). The group has said it will hold off calling byelections for now, and is not at this stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/independent-group-criticised-for-not-registering-as-political-party\">registered as a political party</a>, but in its early days it is, of course, keen to raise its profile. This has led to a number of beautiful photo opportunities, press conferences and broadcast appearances. Let\u2019s take a look, shall we?</p> <p>A photo of the group\u2019s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna. As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people, it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/donald-trump-fast-food-whoppers-president-college-football\">food-based photo opportunity</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/1100121204093009921\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIndGroup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TheIndGroup</a> meal out before votes tonight at Nando\u2019s! <a href=\"https://t.co/Qxdrk75Mx6\">pic.twitter.com/Qxdrk75Mx6</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/1100121204093009921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The first observation here is that Umunna\u2019s sentence structure is off. \u201cTheIndGroup meal out before votes tonight at Nando\u2019s!\u201d reads as though the vote is taking place <em>at</em> Nando\u2019s, and the gang have just gone out for a quick bite beforehand. I am assuming this was not the case.</p> <p>Huge props go to Heidi Allen, who is absolutely not waiting for this photo opportunity to be over to dig in. And to Angela Smith, who is reaching for her glass of wine like someone who knows this snap is going on Twitter whether she likes it or not, and better not be tagged. Mike Gapes looks thrilled, because Mike Gapes never not looks thrilled (more on this later).</p> <p>But let us turn to Anna Soubry.

She appears to have ordered a <em>salad. At Nando\u2019s</em>. (Although she is already stealth-reaching for a chip.)</p> <p>But more egregiously, she has bottled still water.

      "bodyText": "It is day eight of the existence of the Independent Group, which is currently polling at 18% (according to YouGov). The group has said it will hold off calling byelections for now, and is not at this stage registered as a political party, but in its early days it is, of course, keen to raise its profile. This has led to a number of beautiful photo opportunities, press conferences and broadcast appearances. Let\u2019s take a look, shall we? A photo of the group\u2019s first outing was tweeted last night by Chuka Umunna. As so often with politicians trying to appeal to the people, it was a food-based photo opportunity: The first observation here is that Umunna\u2019s sentence structure is off. \u201cTheIndGroup meal out before votes tonight at Nando\u2019s!\u201d reads as though the vote is taking place at Nando\u2019s, and the gang have just gone out for a quick bite beforehand. I am assuming this was not the case. Huge props go to Heidi Allen, who is absolutely not waiting for this photo opportunity to be over to dig in. And to Angela Smith, who is reaching for her glass of wine like someone who knows this snap is going on Twitter whether she likes it or not, and better not be tagged. Mike Gapes looks thrilled, because Mike Gapes never not looks thrilled (more on this later). But let us turn to Anna Soubry. Now, I\u2019m never going to forgive Soubry for her record on welfare votes \u2013 it just isn\u2019t happening \u2013 but her interventions on Brexit have been admirable indeed. She\u2019s also dealt superbly with the bunch of knuckleheads, inspired by gilet jaunes, who see themselves as brave guards of a long-ago empire, but actually just look like marshals at a cross-country race in the local park: Soubry has done a great job of ignoring them, and also of wearing a Russian style ushanka with a Ars\u00e8ne Wenger-esque long padded jacket and the most baller boots politics has ever seen. Aside from maybe in junta-run countries. To wit: But back at Nando\u2019s, Soubry has let the side down. She appears to have ordered a salad. At Nando\u2019s. (Although she is already stealth-reaching for a chip.) But more egregiously, she has bottled still water. Nobody but a sociopath orders bottled still water at a restaurant that isn\u2019t in a country where the water is dodgy. The Nando\u2019s trip was not the first key picture of the gang together. The original launch shots were pretty dull, aside from Ann Coffey who came dressed for success in an orange suit like the early morning sun. A new dawn has broken, has it not? When \u201cthe three amigos\u201d \u2013 as Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Allen refer to themselves \u2013 and Labour\u2019s Smith joined the group, we were treated to some excellent pics with a girls night out vibe. Everyone out to All Bar One, then to the chippy where Allen as a northerner gets ripped for ordering chips and gravy, and then back to Soubs\u2019 and a last bottle of Jacobs Creek and a singalong to Independent Women by Destiny\u2019s Child: Then there was the main sublime photoshoot so far. I\u2019m afraid the most widely shared picture was the one below, and once I envisioned the group as Borrowers people in an empty baked beans tin, I couldn\u2019t see anything else: There were plenty more snaps from this shoot to enjoy, with Soubry featuring heavily. Including this one of her about to drop a freestyle verse with support from her hype women: And this one, which is very \u201call-girls school group of friends at a wedding\u201d, with Soubry about to catch the bouquet: Here we have Gavin Shuker looking like an absolute PLAYER. Don\u2019t hate him cos you ain\u2019t him: Then we have Soubry (again) leading a tour on Pugin\u2019s gothic architecture, which the rest saw on Groupon, pointing out some intricate roof detail: But it was the Tiggers\u2019 first foray on to the green benches of the Commons that was most enjoyable. The shot had the look of a school assembly scene: Chris Leslie is the boy who is forcibly separated from his mate and then catches his eye minutes later. Luciana Berger has spotted her crush from biology. Soubry is LOLing at her mate who is getting told off by the teacher for talking \u2013 despite the fact Soubry was also talking. Coffey looks like she\u2019s just been told the upcoming exams are the most important of her life, and she has done zero revision. Smith, meanwhile, is all of us, WhatsApping plans to meet at break. Umunna already seems jostling for future leadership of the Independent Group (it has said it will elect one at the end of the year) but the main Tigger is Mike Gapes, because he is permanently energised, smiling and beaming. He has the demeanour of a guy who wins millions on the lottery, but tells his local paper he will continue his job as a gardener, because that is what brings him true happiness. Look at him: ALWAYS happy: MIKE GAPES, NEVER NOT LOVING LIFE: Finally, there was this exquisite moment last night on Newsnight, in which Labour and Corbyn loyalist Barry Gardiner placed a hand on Umunna\u2019s wrist and \u2013 how best to put this? \u2013 it was met with \u2026 revulsion? Disgust? The type of repugnance when one takes a swig of sour milk? (As an extra bonus, there is Emily Maitlis wildly pointing a pencil at the two, and, at this point, which of us is above threatening all of our politicians with an HB?) There\u2019ll be many more press appearances, social media content and pics to come from the Independent Group. And possibly more MPs joining them, depending what happens on Wednesday\u2019s day of Brexit amendment votes. But for now, it\u2019s bye from me and bye from Mike Gapes!",

      "body": "<p>Theresa May has promised MPs the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit and, if they do so, a chance to extend the UK\u2019s date of departure from the EU, in a series of votes set for mid-March. But how will the votes play out?</p> <h2>12 March - MPs vote again on May\u2019s deal</h2> <p>The prime minister has said she will bring her deal back to the House of Commons by 12 March with new assurances from the European Union about the temporary nature of the Irish border backstop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/brexitflow-zip/giv-3902Eth68097jrS5/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/brexitflow-zip/giv-3902Eth68097jrS5/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>May said the government was seeking \u201clegal changes that are required to guarantee that the Northern Ireland backstop cannot endure indefinitely\u201d. These could be attached to the withdrawal agreement and included in new assurances in the political declaration on the future relationship, which is not legally binding.</p> <p>The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is to visit Brussels this week to continue negotiations.</p> <p>It is still possible that Eurosceptic MPs could vote down May\u2019s deal unless she reopens the text of the withdrawal agreement to remove the backstop entirely and replace it with alternative arrangements, something the EU has said it will not agree to.</p> <p>It is also unclear whether the prime minister\u2019s supply and confidence partners, the Democratic Unionist party, are prepared to back the changes May is seeking. If she fails to win the backing of both groups, it is likely her deal will be voted down again.</p> <h2>13 March - MPs vote on whether to leave without a deal</h2> <p>May said on Tuesday that if the government had not won a meaningful vote by 12 March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/mps-offered-vote-on-no-deal-brexit-and-possible-delay\">it would table a motion for a vote the following day</a>, asking MPs if they support leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.</p> <p>\u201cThe United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this house for that outcome,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>It is unclear how the government would whip on such a motion, though dozens of cabinet ministers and ministers would be likely to resign and rebel if they were whipped to support a no-deal Brexit. If the government whips against the motion or gives a free vote, only be a small number of MPs are likely to vote in favour of no deal.</p> <p>May has also committed to tabling another neutral motion on the future of the negotiations, which MPs will be able to amend, similar to the one being tabled this week.</p> <h2>14 March \u2013 MPs vote on whether to extend article 50</h2> <p>If MPs reject a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will give them a vote on 14 March on whether the government should \u201cseek a short, limited extension to article 50\u201d which could then be negotiated with the EU. Should MPs vote for the extension, the government would legislate to change the exit date.</p> <p>May said her pledge to hold these votes would fit the timescale laid out in Yvette Cooper\u2019s private member\u2019s bill aimed at preventing no deal. Some ministers had threatened to resign in order to back the Labour MP\u2019s bill.</p> <p>The prime minister said she did not want article 50 to be extended: \u201cOur absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.\u201d</p> <p>She also expressed concerns that an extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections and that a short extension \u201cwould almost certainly have to be a one-off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we had not taken part in the European parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff edge in a few months\u2019 time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Again, it is unclear how the prime minister would whip on that motion. If she whipped her cabinet and ministers in favour of extension, it would be likely to prompt resignations.</p> <p>It is likely, however, that the motion extending article 50 would pass, given it would be certain to have substantial support from both the Conservatives and the opposition.</p> <h2>What happens if none of the votes pass?</h2> <p>Parliament would be in deadlock, though it is possible MPs would bring forward their own options \u2013 for a second referendum or revoking article 50 \u2013 in order to avoid the default option, which is to leave the EU with no deal on March 29.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has promised MPs the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit and, if they do so, a chance to extend the UK\u2019s date of departure from the EU, in a series of votes set for mid-March. But how will the votes play out? 12 March - MPs vote again on May\u2019s deal The prime minister has said she will bring her deal back to the House of Commons by 12 March with new assurances from the European Union about the temporary nature of the Irish border backstop. May said the government was seeking \u201clegal changes that are required to guarantee that the Northern Ireland backstop cannot endure indefinitely\u201d. These could be attached to the withdrawal agreement and included in new assurances in the political declaration on the future relationship, which is not legally binding. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is to visit Brussels this week to continue negotiations. It is still possible that Eurosceptic MPs could vote down May\u2019s deal unless she reopens the text of the withdrawal agreement to remove the backstop entirely and replace it with alternative arrangements, something the EU has said it will not agree to. It is also unclear whether the prime minister\u2019s supply and confidence partners, the Democratic Unionist party, are prepared to back the changes May is seeking. If she fails to win the backing of both groups, it is likely her deal will be voted down again. 13 March - MPs vote on whether to leave without a deal May said on Tuesday that if the government had not won a meaningful vote by 12 March it would table a motion for a vote the following day, asking MPs if they support leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March. \u201cThe United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this house for that outcome,\u201d the prime minister said. It is unclear how the government would whip on such a motion, though dozens of cabinet ministers and ministers would be likely to resign and rebel if they were whipped to support a no-deal Brexit. If the government whips against the motion or gives a free vote, only be a small number of MPs are likely to vote in favour of no deal. May has also committed to tabling another neutral motion on the future of the negotiations, which MPs will be able to amend, similar to the one being tabled this week. 14 March \u2013 MPs vote on whether to extend article 50 If MPs reject a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will give them a vote on 14 March on whether the government should \u201cseek a short, limited extension to article 50\u201d which could then be negotiated with the EU. Should MPs vote for the extension, the government would legislate to change the exit date. May said her pledge to hold these votes would fit the timescale laid out in Yvette Cooper\u2019s private member\u2019s bill aimed at preventing no deal. Some ministers had threatened to resign in order to back the Labour MP\u2019s bill. The prime minister said she did not want article 50 to be extended: \u201cOur absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.\u201d She also expressed concerns that an extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections and that a short extension \u201cwould almost certainly have to be a one-off.\u201d \u201cIf we had not taken part in the European parliament elections, it would be extremely difficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper cliff edge in a few months\u2019 time,\u201d she said. Again, it is unclear how the prime minister would whip on that motion. If she whipped her cabinet and ministers in favour of extension, it would be likely to prompt resignations. It is likely, however, that the motion extending article 50 would pass, given it would be certain to have substantial support from both the Conservatives and the opposition. What happens if none of the votes pass? Parliament would be in deadlock, though it is possible MPs would bring forward their own options \u2013 for a second referendum or revoking article 50 \u2013 in order to avoid the default option, which is to leave the EU with no deal on March 29.",

      "bodyText": "We stood as Sedgy came into our new form room, September 1952. This was Dr S E J Best, headmaster, Doncaster Grammar School. He said that now we were in the lower sixth we should read a quality newspaper. I looked over the five supplied and decided that the Manchester Guardian was the most interesting, and have read it, or its successors, ever since. I had developed an early interest in science and about age nine pestered my father to get me a chemistry set for Christmas. That changed my life. I read most of the science books in our town library and performed experiments, many of which would probably now be illegal. I attended what was then King\u2019s College, Newcastle upon Tyne, to take chemistry but left with degrees in botany. Emigrating to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1963 I subscribed to the Guardian Weekly. Now retired to Victoria, British Columbia, for its mild climate, I breed novel plant hybrids, volunteer at Abkhazi Garden, a local gem, and, with my wife Linda attend some of the rich offerings of opera, theatre, music and the visual arts that are available.",

      "bodyText": "Uber has survived a high court challenge to its licence to operate in London, after judges rejected claims of bias brought by a group of black cab drivers. In a crowdfunded legal bid, drivers had argued that Uber\u2019s 15-month permit was decided by a magistrate with conflicts of interest, making her ruling \u201ctainted by actual or apparent bias\u201d. The United Cabbies group (UCG), representing black cab drivers in the capital, hoped to overturn the licence granted on appeal by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot on a \u201cprobationary\u201d basis last June. Transport for London (TfL) had refused to renew Uber\u2019s licence when it expired in September 2017, citing safety concerns. Arbuthnot since said she would not hear any further cases involving Uber after reports emerged alleging financial connections between the firm and her husband, Lord Arbuthnot. At a hearing in London earlier this month, UCG lawyers argued that the judge should have checked for any potential conflicts of interest. However, their case was dismissed by the lord chief justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Supperstone on Tuesday. Burnett said in his ruling: \u201cHaving ascertained all the circumstances bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased, we consider that those circumstances would not lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased in this case.\u201d He said that the \u201ctenuous connections unearthed\u201d by UCG fell \u201cwell short of evidence that would begin to give a fair-minded observer even pause for thought\u201d. Uber has put in an application for costs, which could see drivers having to find another \u00a3150-200k on top of their own legal costs, including \u00a348k costs for TfL. The action was brought after a crowdfunding campaign among black cab drivers. The London Taxi Drivers Association, an interested party, will also be liable for 10-20% of the costs. Uber\u2019s licence renewal had originally been rejected by TfL over concerns such as a failure to report allegations of assaults on passengers to police, how it conducted background checks on drivers, and how the app had been modified in the US to thwart regulators. But after pledges to reform from chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, and the implementation of safeguards such as a 24-hour phone helpline, Uber did enough to convince Arbuthnot that the firm had changed sufficiently to give it a short licence, with stringent conditions \u2013 although she remained critical of the firm in her ruling.

It has led me to think about how much could be learned from the world-class concerts by London\u2019s leading symphony orchestra that I have attended, the beauty of which comes from the harmony of various sounds and the coordination between the players. If the China-UK relationship were compared to a symphony, its success would depend on close coordination between the two countries and a firm resistance to interruptions and noises.</p> <p>In this symphony, China and the UK rely on mutual respect and trust to keep us in tune, and keep out the noise of enmity and confrontation.</p> <p>This year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of a China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires. The past 65 years have not been all plain sailing: when there was mutual respect and equality, the bilateral relationship leapt forward. Otherwise, the relationship has had to battle against strong headwinds, or even back-pedal. In an age when hot and cold wars should be long gone, resurrecting the cold war and gunboat diplomacy from the grave, as this politician did, was anachronistic and risks disrupting the progress of China-UK relations.</p> <p>Both countries must resist this disruption and keep the larger picture in mind. To do that, they need to view each other\u2019s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, still less a threat. In particular, we should respect each other\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, core interests and major concerns; we should build mutual trust, expand strategic consensus and handle differences properly so as to ensure that the China-UK relationship develops in the right direction.</p> <p>In the symphony of these relations, mutual benefit, not the pursuit of a zero-sum game, creates consonance. China-UK cooperation has never been deeper and more extensive, and the interests of the two countries have never been more intertwined. This is not only reflected by the \u00a311bn contracts signed during prime minister Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/02/theresa-may-china-visit-little-silence-critics-home\" title=\"\">visit to China</a> early last year and the first China International Import Expo. It is also reinforced by the fact that China is the fastest-growing market for UK exports and UK\u2019s second largest trading partner outside the EU.</p> <p>Last year, our bilateral trade totalled more than $80bn and UK exports to China increased by 6.9%, much higher than its GDP growth rate. Chinese investment in the UK tops $20bn now and maintains a robust growth momentum, with Chinese companies having invested more over the past five years than the previous 30 years.</p> <p>The bond between the Chinese and British people has never been closer. With the opening of seven new direct flight routes between London and Chinese cities last year, the total number of flights linking the two countries increased to 168 a week, facilitating 1.5m mutual visits every year.</p> <p>Going forward, deeper reform and further opening up in China will create more opportunities for China-UK cooperation, including the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the second China International Import Expo to be held in China this year. An open, innovative and inclusive UK is an internationally recognised brand name, and I hope that it will continue to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies, including Huawei. This will win more respect, trust and cheers for a global Britain.</p> <p>The symphony of China-UK relations should also play a rising crescendo of mutual learning and cooperation, and reject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow-mindedness. Both China and the UK support multilateralism, free trade and rule-based international trade system. Both are permanent members of the UN security council and are countries with global influence. We have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and build an open world economy. We should deliver our consensus on addressing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cybersecurity and wildlife protection, and promoting reform of the global governance system. We should enhance exchanges and mutual learning between different civilisations with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind. I hope and believe that an independent, rationally minded and down-to-earth UK will work with China in the spirit of win-win cooperation to create a better future for our two countries and the rest of the world.</p> <p>Amid profound changes of a kind the world has not seen in a century, a sound, stable, mutually reinforcing and mutually beneficial China-UK relationship is not only in the interests of the two countries and their people, but also a contribution to world peace and development. China and the UK have the strategic vision, political wisdom and creative spirit to seize opportunities, resist disruptions and create a China-UK golden era: a symphony both beautiful and harmonious. </p> <p>\u2022 Liu Xiaoming is China\u2019s ambassador to the UK</p>",

It is also reinforced by the fact that China is the fastest-growing market for UK exports and UK\u2019s second largest trading partner outside the EU. Last year, our bilateral trade totalled more than $80bn and UK exports to China increased by 6.9%, much higher than its GDP growth rate. Chinese investment in the UK tops $20bn now and maintains a robust growth momentum, with Chinese companies having invested more over the past five years than the previous 30 years. The bond between the Chinese and British people has never been closer. With the opening of seven new direct flight routes between London and Chinese cities last year, the total number of flights linking the two countries increased to 168 a week, facilitating 1.5m mutual visits every year. Going forward, deeper reform and further opening up in China will create more opportunities for China-UK cooperation, including the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the second China International Import Expo to be held in China this year. An open, innovative and inclusive UK is an internationally recognised brand name, and I hope that it will continue to provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies, including Huawei. This will win more respect, trust and cheers for a global Britain. The symphony of China-UK relations should also play a rising crescendo of mutual learning and cooperation, and reject the chaotic disruption of rigidity and narrow-mindedness. Both China and the UK support multilateralism, free trade and rule-based international trade system. Both are permanent members of the UN security council and are countries with global influence. We have a responsibility to oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and build an open world economy. We should deliver our consensus on addressing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, cybersecurity and wildlife protection, and promoting reform of the global governance system. We should enhance exchanges and mutual learning between different civilisations with a view to building a community with a shared future for mankind. I hope and believe that an independent, rationally minded and down-to-earth UK will work with China in the spirit of win-win cooperation to create a better future for our two countries and the rest of the world. Amid profound changes of a kind the world has not seen in a century, a sound, stable, mutually reinforcing and mutually beneficial China-UK relationship is not only in the interests of the two countries and their people, but also a contribution to world peace and development. China and the UK have the strategic vision, political wisdom and creative spirit to seize opportunities, resist disruptions and create a China-UK golden era: a symphony both beautiful and harmonious. \u2022 Liu Xiaoming is China\u2019s ambassador to the UK",

I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/25/mark-hollis-lead-singer-of-talk-talk-dies-at-age-64-reports-say\">Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, dies at age 64, reports say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a \u201chit\u201d anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today\u2019s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio and/or MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283065\">Leon Depope</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018I still cry <em>every time</em> I listen to Laughing Stock\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/13/talk-talk-mark-hollis\">disappeared from public life in 1998</a>, and I certainly never met him, but I\u2019m heartbroken.</p> <p>He said (and I\u2019m very much paraphrasing here) that he\u2019d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that\u2019s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry <em>every time</em> I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.</p> <p>Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he\u2019s not around any more. So effortly blessed. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126284701\">Andrew Samoyed</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018A vibration of the human spirit\u2019</h2> <p>If there\u2019s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.</p> <p>What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there\u2019s no such regrets here.</p> <p>Farewell Mark, you\u2019ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126282409\">jesusjuice89</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy\u2019</h2> <p>We\u2019ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk\u2019s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.</p> <p>Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283220\">Anhaga</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018The most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to\u2019</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/25/talk-talk-10-of-the-best\">Talk Talk \u2013 10 of the best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126285852\">thegreatdargini</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018I always had this feeling he\u2019d just emerge again one day\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m struggling on this one; so unexpected. I always had this feeling he\u2019d just emerge again one day, drop an album \u2013 no fuss, no build-up \u2026 and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.</p> <p>Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I\u2019ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126284166\">Mitch44</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time\u2019</h2> <p>I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I\u2019d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with \u2013 perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis\u2019s wonderful solo album.</p> <p>Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They\u2019re good, but they\u2019re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it\u2019s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he\u2019d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126284041\">BiggusGeeus1973</a></strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/25/mark-hollis-lead-singer-of-talk-talk-dies-at-age-64-reports-say#comments\">Read more tributes and add yours</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I was staggered at their ambition and scope\u2019 Spirit of Eden is simply brilliant and one of the top ten albums of all time for me. I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius. Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a \u201chit\u201d anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today\u2019s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio and/or MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon Depope \u2018I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock\u2019 It\u2019s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I\u2019m heartbroken. He said (and I\u2019m very much paraphrasing here) that he\u2019d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that\u2019s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days. Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he\u2019s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew Samoyed \u2018A vibration of the human spirit\u2019 If there\u2019s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre. What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there\u2019s no such regrets here. Farewell Mark, you\u2019ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89 \u2018Will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy\u2019 We\u2019ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk\u2019s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius. Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. Anhaga \u2018The most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to\u2019 To this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdargini \u2018I always had this feeling he\u2019d just emerge again one day\u2019 I\u2019m struggling on this one; so unexpected. I always had this feeling he\u2019d just emerge again one day, drop an album \u2013 no fuss, no build-up \u2026 and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved. Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I\u2019ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44 \u2018Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time\u2019 I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I\u2019d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with \u2013 perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis\u2019s wonderful solo album. Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They\u2019re good, but they\u2019re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it\u2019s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he\u2019d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

If the pallets are prevented from transiting between the UK and the 27-country bloc, the millions of tonnes of goods they carry will not be able to be transported which could potentially lead to food shortages. More than 3m pallets move between the UK and EU every month. The UK government has told distributors that all timber packaging, including pallets, destined for the EU countries after a no-deal Brexit must be heat-treated or fumigated to comply with International Standards For Phytosanitary (Regarding Plants) Measures 15 (ISPM 15). At present pallets moving between EU member states, including the UK, are exempt from the ISPM 15 standard. Industry experts said fewer than a third of the pallets used for EU-UK trade comply with the standard. \u201cIn the event of no deal, all WPM [wood packaging material] moving between the UK and the EU must meet ISPM15 international standards by undergoing heat treatment and marking,\u201d Defra said in an official notice last week. \u201cAll WPM may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.\u201d The notice sparked concern among distributors and hauliers who asked for a meeting with officials. Business Insider first reported details of the meeting due to be held on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Defra said: \u201cWe have been meeting weekly with representatives from the food and drink industry for many months to help prepare for all scenarios as we leave the EU. \u201cAs part of those meetings we have discussed a range of issues relating to the import and export of our goods, including pallets. We have already committed to retaining our current pallet import approaches post-exit, and we hope the EU will confirm that it will reciprocate our commitment.\u201d Chris Hillaby, the managing director of Shaw Pallets, a Huddersfield-based pallet producer, said the issue was \u201cone of those really nasty things that Brexit has thrown up\u201d. \u201cA global initiative commenced over 15 years ago within the forestry and timber packaging market has been focused on stopping an invasion of plant pests that can prove very damaging to our indigenous timber stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cAround five years earlier, it had become apparent in the US that plant pests could be transported in lower-grade softwoods, which were used in some items of timber packaging where the insects, such as the Asian long-horned beetle, could sometimes be found under sections of bark on the timber. \u201cTo prevent such trends the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreed that all timber packaging should be heat treated at source to a core temperature of 56C and sustained for at least 30 minutes as this had been scientifically proven way to eradicate such threats \u2013 the treatment standard being called ISPM15.\u201d The EU is exempt from the WTO rules. But Hillaby said: \u201cShould the UK not secure an acceptable Brexit deal, the country will of course revert to WTO rules for export and import, which will call for timber packaging to be heat treated for all cross-border shipments. While Defra has at the current time indicated that it will not implement rigorous checks on imported goods from the EU, there has been little in the way of a similarly pragmatic response from the EU itself.\u201d Hillaby said the vast majority of consumer goods delivered to supermarkets are transported on rented pallets and \u201cvirtually none of these pallets are presently heat treated/ISPM15 compliant \u2013 so if there is an increase in cross-border checks as a result of Brexit some of these shipments could easily be adversely affected.\u201d",

The assaults occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne.</p> \n  <p>There were two trials. The first, last August, ended in a hung jury. The second, which began in November and lasted four and a half weeks, resulted in a guilty verdict after three and a half days of deliberation by the jury.</p> \n  <p>Although the verdict was delivered back in December, the case has been the subject of a strict suppression order until now. Pell\u2019s lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction. </p> \n  <p>After the suppression was lifted on Tuesday morning in Australia, the remaining survivor, who cannot be named, said he had experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/george-pells-victim-releases-statement-respect-my-privacy\">\u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d since the attack</a>. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cLike many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust.

Here is what happened.</p> \n  <p>First, the Department of Public Prosecutions said it would discontinue its prosecution of the second trial, known as the Ballarat or swimmers trial, and that therefore the suppression order, which was in place to ensure that the second trial was not prejudiced, could be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Robert Richter QC, lawyer for Pell, applied for the suppression order to be extended on the grounds that he had filed appeal documents on 21 February. The grounds of the appeal, he said, posed a real possibility that the conviction would be overturned and the trial would have to be reheard. If the suppression order lifted before a possible retrial, he said, there would be an \u201cirrevocable and incurable injustice\u201d, or at the very least an irrevocable appearance of injustice.</p> \n  <p> Kidd said he was required by law to consider that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty was \u201cgood\u201d and could not consider extending a suppression order on a supposition that a retrial might be called at some point in the future. He said he had no grounds to extend the order, and there was a strong public interest in the media being able to cover the sentencing hearing.</p> \n  <p>At any event, he said, a retrial where the outcome of the original trial is public knowledge was not an unusual occurrence. It would put Pell on a level playing field with most convicted people in the country.</p> \n  <p>But Kidd said he was prepared to give Richter time to go across Lonsdale Street to the court of appeal and apply for a suppression order in that court. He originally proposed giving the defence until 4pm on Monday to make that application, but was persuaded by the prosecution and a lawyer representing media agencies that that was too long. He then proposed giving the defence until 4pm on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Kidd said that regardless of the likelihood of the appeal succeeding, which he would not comment on, the defence was entitled to the opportunity to make an application to the other court. He said that opportunity had to be given before the county court suppression order was lifted, adding that \u201cif ever there was a case where the milk is spilled, it is this case\u201d.</p> \n  <p>While Kidd went into his chambers to write his orders, Richter\u2019s team changed their mind and withdrew their opposition to the suppression orders being lifted.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T01:02:16.167Z\">at 1.02am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c748b5ae4b00307e95aa6d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-26T00:44:22.935Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Pell will face jail when he\u2019s sentenced, now likely to be next week. </p> \n  <p><strong>David Marr</strong>: What a country that can do this: the first in the world to hold a national inquiry into this scandal and the first to send a cardinal to prison.

      "bodyText": "Our Rome correspondent, Angela Giuffrida, has filed this report on events today at the Vatican. We will now close today\u2019s coverage. Thank you for reading. The front pages of tomorrow\u2019s papers in Australia are beginning to come in. Kol v\u2019Oz, an organisation set up to prevent child sexual abuse in the Jewish community, has issued a statement welcoming Pell\u2019s conviction, which it said represented \u201ca great day for justice\u201d. Manny Waks, its chief executive, said: I welcome today\u2019s public announcement advising of Cardinal George Pell\u2019s conviction of child sexual abuse offences. The conviction sends a powerful message: absolutely no one is above the law. The courage displayed by Pell\u2019s victim in pursuing this matter must be acknowledged. Holding your abuser to account is always a challenge \u2013 in this case even more so, due to Pell\u2019s prominence. Hopefully, this incredible and positive development will assist us in our ongoing work in addressing the issue of child sexual abuse in our communities \u2013 whether in the Catholic Church, the Jewish community, clubs, within the family and elsewhere. It is important that those impacted by the scourge of child sexual abuse take care of themselves, as times like these are often triggering for many survivors. It is a great day for justice. Peter Tranter, the acting vice-chancellor of the University of Notre Dame in Australia, has written to its students to convey that he understands the announcement of the verdict in Pell\u2019s trial will be \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d to people whose lives have been impacted by sexual abuse. However, he restated that Pell has continued to plead his innocence. Dear All, You are no doubt aware of the announcement of the verdict handed down by the jury in Cardinal Pell\u2019s trial. I understand that this will be deeply distressing to all within our community and beyond, including those whose lives have been impacted by sexual abuse, and those who know Cardinal Pell. As has also been reported, Cardinal Pell has maintained his innocence and has lodged an appeal against his conviction \u2013 as is his right under Australian law. Given that these matters are currently the subject of judicial process, the university will not be providing any comment. He also provided links to the university\u2019s support services. An interesting point here from Joshua McElwee, the National Catholic Reporter\u2019s Vatican correspondent. Pell was charged with multiple sexual offences by police in June 2017 when he was the third-ranking official at the Vatican. CNN\u2019s Delia Gallagher says the Vatican\u2019s statement was \u201cas suspected\u201d and mirrors the position taken by the Catholic church in Australia, which the archbishop of Brisbane delivered earlier. Here is the statement from the interim Holy See spokesman in full, courtesy of our correspondent in Italy: The Holy See is united with what was declared by the president of the Australian Episcopal Conference in taking note of the sentence in the first instance against Cardinal George Pell. It is painful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia. As already stated on other occasions, we reiterate the utmost respect for the Australian judicial authorities. In this respect, we now await the outcome of the appeal process, recalling that Cardinal Pell has reiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree. While waiting for the final judgment, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the Church is a safe house for everyone, especially for children and the most vulnerable. To guarantee the course of justice, the Holy Father confirmed the precautionary measures already in place for Cardinal George Pell since he was sent back to Australia [for the trial]. Until the definitive verdict, Cardinal Pell is forbidden, as a precautionary measure, from continuing in his ministry and from having contact with minors in any form. We have not heard directly from Pope Francis today, however, his message for this year\u2019s Lent has just been posted on the Vatican\u2019s website. To recap, Pell\u2019s sentencing is not until next week, and he may be taken into custody at his plea hearing on Wednesday. His lawyers have said he will appeal against the verdict. We will bring you reaction from the Vatican\u2019s statement. In a statement, the Vatican said the Pope has confirmed Cardinal Pell has been forbidden from contact with minors as part of \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d until his appeals have concluded, adding that he must also abstain from public ministry. This includes a ban on him saying Mass in public and, \u201cas is the rule, contact in any way or form with minors\u201d. The Vatican spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti, said the news of the conviction was \u201cpainful\u201d and the Vatican was aware that his conviction for child abuse has shocked many people around the world. However, no other measures will be taken against Pell until his appeal proceedings are exhausted, with the spokesman adding that he has \u201creiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself\u201d until the last level of justice. Gisotti did not take questions after reading the statement to reporters. Here\u2019s the latest from Vatican correspondents. There\u2019s movement at the Vatican, where the interim Holy See spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti, has provided a brief statement in Italian following the George Pell verdict. He said an English translation would be released shortly. You can watch it back below. Prof Constant Mews from the Centre for Religious Studies at Monash University gave this interview to the BBC Breakfast show earlier this morning, explaining George Pell\u2019s role within the Catholic church and providing an insight into what might happen next. The really important thing was that Pope Francis implemented a remarkable series of reforms when he became Pope, and one of them was to create a council of cardinals \u2013 an executive, a group of nine \u2013 and within that you had George Pell; he was asked to be the first person in charge of the economy, in other words the financial side, and there are others, but it\u2019s a hugely important thing. In December, just a couple of months ago, he was asked to resign from that, and that was perhaps without large fuss, but it was because he was facing a trial and now the reasons for that have become public. The interviewer Charlie Stayt then asked if Cardinal Pell will be defrocked. Citing a recent precedent in the case of Cardinal McCarrick, Mews said: That is the most extreme of the sanctions. I think what is going to happen, there will be certainly a legal review and obviously a final decision on laicisation (defrocking) would be very radical. But I think at the moment there will certainly be a strong call for him to stand aside both as archbishop and as cardinal. Questioned on whether such a process goes to the heart of the problems, Stayt asked why someone would not be defrocked when they have been found guilty of abusing two choir boys within a cathedral? The simple phrase that a lawyer would use is that of due process, there is a whole legal review process to which he will certainly claim. But I think there will be very strong pressure, even from the Australian bishops, to distance themselves from a figure who has been tarred, whatever the truth of the accusations, and a jury did find him guilty, [but] he may claim it was a gerrymandered trial. I won\u2019t want to enter into that argument. The really important issue is that we have now reached a point of no return and, from the side of the Vatican, they have to be seen to distance themselves, certainly from the appearance of any wrongdoing. This has just become an emblem of a much larger problem, which just has to be addressed. The Associated Press in Melbourne has filed this report that features evidence heard by the jury that unanimously found George Pell guilty of child sexual abuse. Cardinal George Pell once blamed his wooden public persona on the self-discipline required to contain \u2018a formidable temper\u2019. That anger bubbled through the former Vatican finance minister\u2019s composure as he was interviewed by Australian police in a conference room at the Hilton airport hotel in Rome on 19 October 2016. DS Chris Reed for the first time detailed to Pell allegations that he had orally raped two choirboys in Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral while he was archbishop of Australia\u2019s second-largest city 20 years earlier. Pell appeared incredulous, distressed and outraged. He grimaced and waved his arms over his head, crossed them tightly across his chest and muttered to himself as the detectives detailed the accusations that one of the alleged victims levelled against him a year earlier. A controversial compensation scheme established for victims of clerical sexual abuse by the disgraced cardinal George Pell should be \u201ctorn down\u201d, says the mother of two girls abused by a Catholic priest. Chrissie Foster told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program that Pell had \u201cno sympathy\u201d for her when she told him about the abuse suffered by her daughter Emma, who had eating disorders and self-harmed as an adult. She later became addicted to drugs and overdosed on medication and died at the age of 26. When we went to see him about the abuse of Emma\u2026 Cardinal Pell, archbishop then, had absolutely no sympathy or understanding or anything. He just was angry and jumping down our throats, telling us to prove it in court. Now I look at it under this verdict that he\u2019s received, and I think oh my goodness, he had a vested interest in shutting us up because he himself was a paedophile as well. Everything Pell has installed or implemented on this issue, everything he has said on this issue, needs to be torn down. The priesthood has harboured criminals like this and that was OK with them. The priesthood must stand condemned for what they have done to children. The City of Sydney councillor Jess Scully tells the ABC that she does not believe the Catholic church is taking responsibility for the sins committed by its clergymen. I was raised Catholic and I\u2019m lapsed. Before you could have reconciliation and forgiveness, you had to recognise you committed a sin. You had to seek atonement and take responsibility. I don\u2019t see that happening at any level in the Catholic church. For a lot of people Pope Francis seemed like a breath of fresh air. Yet his final comments at the Vatican summit were not a mea culpa. They were pointing the finger at all the other institutions that were also guilty of harbouring abuse. What we see from the Catholic and Anglican churches is rank hypocrisy. One rule for us and another for you. We\u2019ll decide who you have sex with and we\u2019ll make rules about that but we\u2019ll continue to do appalling things and hide them under the cloak of our faith. Here is our religious correspondent Harriet Sherwood\u2019s report on the global sexual abuse scandal facing the Vatican, as we await a statement from the Roman Catholic church. We reported earlier that columnist Andrew Bolt published an opinion piece in the Herald Sun claiming Pell has been \u201cfalsely convicted\u201d. Bolt has been criticised, with many questioning his agenda. Nine News is at the Vatican. The abuse survivor Phil Seviano told the channel that it is \u201creally hard to remain faithful\u201d. We are expecting a statement from the Vatican shortly. This is the package Nine News broadcast earlier on Pell\u2019s \u201cremarkable fall from grace\u201d. Here\u2019s more from the David Marr interview. [Pell] made his career from taking the high ground on sex. I wouldn\u2019t actually call it a high ground. The most absolute doctrinaire advocate of Catholic teaching on sex. Pell was awful about women and homosexuals, contrary to contraception and an eloquent and persistent spruiker for the virtues of clerical celibacy. He made his career from that plus his magical ability to get money out of governments. He has been convicted and it is just and it has taken time and it is a great commendation of the Australian judicial system but it is still an awful business, that a man can climb so far and fall so far. Also on the ABC\u2019s The Drum, the writer Sisonke Msimang has called on the Vatican to stop \u201cprotecting criminals\u201d. The Vatican needs to reveal the 6,000 files they are sitting on and talk openly about what they have done and to stop protecting those who have fallen by the wayside, they\u2019re protecting criminals. There has been this upsurge around the world of survivors and victims speaking openly about concrete measures they need. We are still met with a lot of very strong rhetoric, which is matched by very little action, I think that speaks volumes. The collision of male power and secrecy, and the way it manifests in the Catholic church, is why we see an out-of-touchness and also why we see this disaster that keeps of unfolding and their complete incapacity to address it. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot has highlighted how Pell used his position to promote \u201cclimate science denial\u201d. The ABC\u2019s 7.30 has posted an exchange between Pell and journalist Leigh Sales from a press conference in 2012. Asked why a fellow priest who had admitted to having abused boys remained within the church for years after, Pell said: \u201cNow I was not present at that interview, this is the subject of an investigation...\u201d This is Mattha Busby taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. For anyone just waking up in the UK, here is the Guardian\u2019s David Marr\u2019s video explainer on George Pell\u2019s rise and fall. Speaking to ABC\u2019s The Drum earlier today, he discussed celibacy in the church. If it wasn\u2019t for celibacy, there would be more priests and it wouldn\u2019t be so hard to fire the ones who are found to have criminal tendencies. We must not forget, out of all this discussion, the Catholic church hasn\u2019t got any priests anymore. Celibacy is a lie. Priests and brothers have sex. They have always had sex and they will continue to have sex, whatever the rules of celibacy say. The celibate church is marvellously able to hide the failings of their own priests. Cardinal George Pell, once the third most powerful man in the Vatican and Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys in Melbourne in the mid 1990s. Pell was found guilty of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 and guilty of four charges of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The assaults occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne. The guilty verdict was handed down in December, but was not able to be reported until today, due to a strict suppression order. There was a suppression order because there was due to be a second separate trial against Pell, and there were fears the first trial might prejudice the outcome of the second. That second trial was dropped due to insufficient evidence, causing the judge to lift the suppression order. Pell\u2019s lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction. After the suppression was lifted on Tuesday morning in Australia, the remaining survivor, who cannot be named, said he had experienced \u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d since the attack. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he is \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d at Pell\u2019s crimes and while he respects the fact that the case is under appeal \u201cit is the victims and their families I am thinking of today\u201d. The Vatican is expected to issue a statement within the next couple of hours. A petition has been launched calling on the Council for the Order of Australia to remove the honours bestowed upon George Pell. The petition calls for the council to: terminate Cardinal George Pell\u2019s appointment as a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2005; and cancel his award of a Centenary Medal in 2001 The Order of Australia is Australia\u2019s honours system and is the primary way Australia recognises outstanding community members. The Order has four levels, the highest of which is the one bestowed on Pell: a Companion of the Order of Australia. We have not received a comment from the Vatican yet \u2013 that is expected in the next hour or so. But Pope Francis has been talking about the issue of child sex abuse a great deal during the last week at his summit in Rome. The Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood has this assessment of what today\u2019s revelations will mean for the pope and the Catholic church. Pope Francis must have hoped that last week\u2019s unprecedented summit in Rome of senior bishops and church figures from around the world would mark a turning point for his papacy on sexual abuse. The world would see that the Vatican was finally getting a grip on the issue that has caused such grave damage to the church for the past 20 years. Such hopes have been dealt a devastating blow by the news that Cardinal George Pell, until recently the third most senior figure at the Vatican, is facing a prison term for the sexual abuse of minors in the 1990s. The Australian\u2019s conviction on criminal charges will have powerful reverberations throughout the global church. It propels the toxic issue of the \u201cabominations\u201d of children \u2013 Francis\u2019s own word \u2013 directly into the heart of the papacy, where until December the disgraced cardinal had a seat as an influential member of C9, the inner circle of pontifical advisers. It is likely to herald further haemorrhaging from the pews of Roman Catholic churches by disillusioned and despairing parishioners in the west. And it sends a potent message to the church\u2019s elite that no one is too important or too powerful to escape justice; some will be quaking in fear under their cassocks as Pell is led away to prison. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has commented on the conviction: I can\u2019t comment on the specific case [because] it\u2019s under appeal. I feel for anyone who\u2019s ever been a victim of clerical assault and abuse \u2026 this must bring back a lot of very difficult memories \u2013 this is a very difficult time. It is very clear that a lot of institutional sexual abuse was swept under the carpet and too often priests, rather than being punished, were moved between parishes. My thoughts are with the victims of clerical sexual abuse. It should never have happened; it\u2019s a gross betrayal of trust. In a reminder of how prominent and how well-connected George Pell is in Australian society, here is evidence of yet another former Australian prime minister, this time John Howard, supporting Pell, in the face of serious allegations back in 2002. This press conference was held shortly after Pell stood aside while he was being investigated by the church over an accusation that he sexually abused a 12-year-old altar boy at a youth camp in 1961 while a seminarian. Pell denied the allegations. The verdict of the retired judge was that the claims were not proven but not dismissed. In the doorstop interview, Howard said: \u201cI believe completely George Pell\u2019s denial.\u201d He also dismissed calls for a royal commission into institutional sexual abuse of children, saying \u201cwe\u2019re not persuaded that that\u2019s going to achieve anything very positive\u201d. But the final response is the most striking. Journalist: What did you say to Dr Pell when you spoke to him this afternoon? You expressed your support for him? Prime minister: Well, I would hardly have rung him to do otherwise. The archbishop of Perth, Timothy Costelloe, has released a statement: Dear brothers and sisters in Christ, Like many other people, both Catholics and others, I am shocked and distressed at the announcement of the guilty verdict handed down by the jury in Cardinal Pell\u2019s trial. I am deeply conscious of the distress this will cause for many, and the sense of justice achieved it will bring to others. I am aware that Cardinal Pell continues to vehemently protest his innocence and has indicated his intention to appeal the verdict. He is fully entitled to do so under Australian law. Until all legal processes have been concluded it would be inappropriate and inflammatory for me to make any further public comments about this matter. Sexual abuse of children and young people is an abhorrent crime wherever, whenever and by whomever it is perpetrated. As I have done on many other occasions I would again strongly advise anyone who has allegations of child sexual abuse against any officials, clergy or otherwise, connected to the Catholic Church to report these matters to the police. The Catholic Western Australian Office of Professional Standards is able to assist anyone who seeks their assistance to do so. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has made a statement about Pell\u2019s conviction. He says he is \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d at Pell\u2019s crimes and while he respects the fact that the case is under appeal \u201cit is the victims and their families I am thinking of today\u201d. \u201cWhile due process continues, our justice system has affirmed no Australian is above the law. As a country, we must continue to do everything possible to stamp out child abuse in all of its forms, wherever it takes place.\u201d How has Pell responded to child sexual abuse in the church? Pell has attracted criticism since the 1990s for the way he has responded to allegations of child sexual abuse while he was working in Australian Catholic institutions. In 2014 he said the church was no more responsible for child abuse carried out by church figures than a trucking company would be if it employed a truck driver who picked up a female hitchhiker and raped her. At Australia\u2019s child sexual abuse royal commission, he described offending by his one-time friend, the priest Gerald Ridsdale, as a \u201csad story\u201d that \u201cwasn\u2019t of much interest to me\u201d. Ridsdale has been found guilty of offending against more than 60 children. Pell was not named as an alleged perpetrator at the royal commission. When he was called to give evidence it was only in relation to his knowledge of others\u2019 conduct, and the question of whether he was present when church leaders decided to move offending priests between parishes. When the global wave of abuse allegations reached Pell in June 2017, some of the country\u2019s most powerful people stood by him, including former conservative prime minister Tony Abbott, himself a devout Catholic, who told a newspaper \u201cthe George Pell I have known is a very fine man indeed\u201d. Pell\u2019s successor as archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, also told media at the time that \u201cthe George Pell I know is a man of integrity in his dealings with others, a man of faith and high ideals, a thoroughly decent man\u201d. Abbott and Fisher did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters after the verdict was made public. This is Kate Lyons taking over from my colleague Michael McGowan. People have been resurfacing tweets about George Pell that have not aged well. Among them is this tweet from Rupert Murdoch, who was, at least at one time, a vocal supporter of Pell. With the UK and Europe waking up, it feels like an opportune time to go over what has happened here today. Cardinal George Pell, once the third most powerful man in the Vatican and Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys in Melbourne in the mid 1990s. Pell was found guilty of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 and guilty of four charges of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The assaults occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne. There were two trials. The first, last August, ended in a hung jury. The second, which began in November and lasted four and a half weeks, resulted in a guilty verdict after three and a half days of deliberation by the jury. Although the verdict was delivered back in December, the case has been the subject of a strict suppression order until now. Pell\u2019s lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction. After the suppression was lifted on Tuesday morning in Australia, the remaining survivor, who cannot be named, said he had experienced \u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d since the attack. \u201cLike many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust. I would like to thank my family near and far for their support of me, and of each other.\u201d The Vatican is expected to issue a statement within the next couple of hours. We\u2019re coming up to 7am in the Vatican, and expect a statement from them in about two hours. In the meantime, our Rome correspondent Angela Giuffrida spoke to Alberto Melloni, a church historian and professor at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia about the significance of the Pell decision for the church more broadly. He had this to say: The Holy See took its position on the Pell case when it sent him back to Australia for the trial. It doesn\u2019t surprise me [that it had ended with a conviction] \u2026 The church recognised the civil jurisdiction of the case and it\u2019s a good example of what the church can do. With civil justice there are no questions asked about whether a sentence is severe enough, whereas in the ecclesiastical tribunal system there are. It\u2019s good for the church to come out of this illusion that the ecclesiastical justice system is better than the civil system. The point is that the Pell case shows that when you trust civil judgement you do the best, but when you try to [judge a case] in the ecclesiastical system it is always too little too late. The Pell case is very instructive for the Catholic church because at least it gives the sense there is no cover-up and no attempts to escape from justice \u2013 that is very much needed for the dignity of the victim and the Catholic church. In case you missed it, the victim at the centre of Cardinal Pell\u2019s conviction released a statement after the suppression order was lifted this morning. Required listening. Trust me. Seems Andrew Bolt couldn\u2019t wait until tonight. He\u2019s published an opinion piece in the Herald Sun claiming Pell has been \u201cfalsely convicted\u201d. He says his opinion is based on \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d and \u201con how many times Pell has been accused of crimes and sins he clearly did not do\u201d. \u201cBut at last some of the truckload of mud thrown at him has stuck. It adds up to this: Pell, Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, has been made to pay for the sins of his church and a media campaign of vilification,\u201d Bolt writes. \u201cHe is a scapegoat, not a child abuser. In my opinion.\u201d The jury disagreed, clearly. Bolt has long been a supporter of Pell, penning a number of columns in his defence over the years. However, after the cardinal\u2019s evidence about his knowledge of another paedophile priest before the royal commission into child abuse in 2016, Bolt wrote Pell was either \u201clying\u201d or \u201ccuriously indifferent\u201d to abuse around him. He later retracted the criticism. The lifting of the suppression order means investigative journalist Louise Milligan\u2019s 2017 Walkley award-winning book, Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell, can again be sold. The book had to be withheld from sale until the suppression orders were lifted. Milligan\u2019s notes were originally subpoenaed by Pell\u2019s lawyers as part of his defence in the case. \u201cI was motivated to write this book because I wanted people to know what I have known about George Pell,\u201d she said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe have been waiting for the justice system to run its course. Nothing can undo what has been done but some justice has prevailed.\u201d Some detail on the process behind stripping someone of the Order of Australia. Another blow. Senators Derryn Hinch and Sarah Hanson-Young are calling for the cardinal to be stripped of his Companion of the Order of Australia. There\u2019s precedent for that, as Hinch notes. In 2015 Rolf Harris was stripped of the honour after he was convicted of several counts of indecently assaulting underage girls. Hinch said it\u2019s \u201cgood news that Pell will do jail time\u201d, calling him a \u201chypocrite\u201d, but said he was disappointed the second case against the cardinal would no longer go ahead. \u201cThe sheer effrontery that he could abuse choir boys in a place of worship as the new archbishop of Melbourne,\u201d he said. \u201cPell must now be stripped of his Companion of the Order of Australia a la Rolf Harris.\u201d That relative quiet is interesting, when you consider members of the government have, in the past, been rather complimentary of Pell. \u201cCardinal Pell is one of the greatest churchmen that Australia has seen,\u201d Tony Abbott said in 2004. The minister for families and social services, Paul Fletcher, has released this statement. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s the first we\u2019ve heard from the Morrison government today. The news that someone of George Pell\u2019s seniority within the Catholic Church has been convicted of these crimes is deeply disturbing. My first thoughts, however, are with the survivors who showed genuine courage to come forward. Nothing will ever make things right for those victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, however, the National Redress Scheme is intended to go some way towards acknowledging their suffering and providing support moving forward. We are focussed on continuing to deliver the National Redress Scheme and progressing claims as quickly and sensitively as possible. As I mentioned earlier, our reporter Melissa Davey was in both of the Pell trials from the beginning. This is her (excellent, gripping) account from inside the courtroom. The father of one of the boys whom Pell was convicted of sexually assaulting says he will sue the cardinal or the Catholic church following the death of his son. Pell\u2019s conviction was for the sexual assault of two 13-year-old boys in 1996 and 1997. The court heard evidence from one of the victims during the trial but the second, who never told his parents about the abuse, died in 2014 of a heroin overdose when he was 30. On Tuesday, Lisa Flynn, the head of specialist personal injury at Shine Lawyers, said the firm was representing the boy\u2019s father. \u201cShine Lawyers represent a client whose son suffered such extreme depression that he overdosed on drugs to numb his severe PTSD as a result of his pain,\u201d she said. \u201cHis father will allege that Pell has blood on his hands. This conviction is a reminder to survivors of abuse to feel empowered to tell their stories. Justice has prevailed and the nation is finally listening and addressing your pain.\u201d George Pell\u2019s old school will remove his name from a building named in his honour, and strike a line through his name on its honour board. St Patrick\u2019s College, Ballarat, where Pell attended from 1949 to 1959, said on Tuesday that in the wake of the cardinal\u2019s conviction, it would also revoke his status as an \u201cinducted legend of the school\u201d. The school\u2019s headmaster, John Crowley, said he \u201cacknowledged Cardinal Pell may appeal the verdict, but as it currently stands, the college must respond to the jury\u2019s findings\u201d. \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict demonstrates that Cardinal Pell\u2019s behaviours have not met the standards we expect of those we honour as role models for the young men we educate,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe college aims at every opportunity to fulfil our mission of raising fine boys to the status of great men. The college also remains ever mindful of the victims and survivors who require our ongoing care, solidarity and support.\u201d The building that was formerly known as the Pell Wing, will be renamed the Waterford Wing. Crowley said the college reserved the right to revisit the decision if Pell\u2019s appeal of the conviction was successful. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, was asked about the Pell verdict at a press conference earlier. This is what he said: Every Australian, every single Australian is subject to the rule of law \u2013 whether you\u2019re a cardinal, or a politician, or a leader of business. Every single Australian is subject to the rule of law. And this will be a difficult day for victims of sex abuse, not just in the Catholic church but in any institution. But I\u2019m sure victims of sexual abuse will want to see the justice system working without fear or favour, without fear or favour. Any Australian no matter how famous or prominent is subject to law and that is what we\u2019re seeing played out today. The chief executive of Catholic Social Services Australia, Frank Brennan, another Pell supporter who sat through the trial, has written in Jesuit publication Eureka Street that he was \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cdevastated\u201d by the guilty verdict. My only conclusion is that the jury must have disregarded many of the criticisms so tellingly made by [Pell\u2019s lawyer Robert] Richter of the complainant\u2019s evidence and that, despite the complainant being confused about all manner of things, the jury must nevertheless have thought \u2013 as the recent royal commission discussed \u2013 that children who are sexually violated do not always remember details of time, place, dress and posture. Although the complainant got all sorts of facts wrong, the jury must have believed that Pell did something dreadful to him. The jurors must have judged the complainant to be honest and reliable even though many of the details he gave were improbable if not impossible. Conservative commentator Andrew Bolt, one of Pell\u2019s staunchest defenders, clearly hasn\u2019t changed his mind about the cardinal in the wake of his guilty verdict. Speaking of Mark Coleridge, the Brisbane archbishop delivered a homily in Rome on Sunday at the end of a Vatican summit on the protection of minors, in which he said the Australian church had been \u201cweak\u201d in providing pastoral care for survivors of clerical sexual abuse: We will not go unpunished. In abuse and its concealment, the powerful [of the church] show themselves not men of heaven but men of Earth. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Coleridge added: It\u2019s very clear now ... that anyone in the Catholic church in any part of the world who thinks that he or she can get away with sexual abuse of the young and vulnerable, has absolutely nowhere to go. It\u2019s been two and a half hours since the news of Pell\u2019s conviction was made public. I could be mistaken, but I think this may be the first Australian federal politician to say anything about it. We have a statement now too from Mark Coleridge, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference. He says Pell\u2019s conviction has \u201cshocked\u201d people around the world: The news of Cardinal George Pell\u2019s conviction on historical child sexual abuse charges has shocked many across Australia and around the world, including the Catholic Bishops of Australia. The Bishops agree that everyone should be equal under the law, and we respect the Australian legal system. The same legal system that delivered the verdict will consider the appeal that the Cardinal\u2019s legal team has lodged. Our hope, at all times, is that through this process, justice will be served. In the meantime, we pray for all those who have been abused and their loved ones, and we commit ourselves anew to doing everything possible to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all, especially the young and the vulnerable. The archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, has released a statement, saying he is \u201csurprised and shaken\u201d by Pell\u2019s conviction: As is now publicly known, Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty of historical sexual crimes relating to two young people at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Melbourne. This follows two trials, the first of which could not reach a verdict. While acknowledging the judgement of the jury, I join many people who have been surprised and shaken by the outcome of this second trial. I fully respect the ongoing judicial process, noting that Cardinal Pell continues to protest his innocence. An appeal against the verdict has been lodged. It is important we now await the outcome of this appeal, respectful of the ongoing legal proceedings. All other charges relating to Cardinal Pell, except those subject of the appeal, have been discontinued. My thoughts and prayers are with all victims who have been abused by clergy, religious and lay people in the Archdiocese of Melbourne at this challenging time, and I renew my personal commitment to do all I can to ensure victims of such abuse in Melbourne receive justice and healing. At this time, I also acknowledge all in the Catholic Church who are walking with survivors and communities harmed by the scourge of abuse, and who are committed to building a culture of safety for our children and vulnerable people. At this time, may I assure you that I keep all involved in my prayer. David Marr on George Pell. The president of child abuse advocacy group the Blue Knot Foundation, Dr Cathy Kezelman AM, has released a statement, calling Pell\u2019s case \u201caccountability much delayed\u201d: As a result, many survivors harmed within the church and some additional survivors harmed by or under the responsibility of Cardinal Pell were denied their rights to witness this justice process. This news comes just after the Vatican Summit has ended. The themes were accountability, responsibility and transparency. Many survivors were left underwhelmed by this summit, with a sense of more talk and defensiveness with nothing concrete achieved. For too long, hermetically sealed systems of power, such as within the Catholic Church have called the shots, protecting the Church and themselves. They have taken no responsibility and ducked accountability. They have failed to produce records, even destroying them, or obfuscating them with half or non-truths. There has been zero transparency. Is this really a time of change within the Church? A change in leadership, hierarchy and culture? It needs to be a time for zero tolerance to abuse, not zero transparency. Cardinal Pell, like everyone, deserved a fair trial. He received it and was found guilty. Survivors also deserve a fair playing field. The crimes perpetrated against them have already violated them. To date, within the Catholic Church, it has been anything but fair, just, humane or moral. Quite a bit to keep up with this morning. If you\u2019re playing catch-up, Melissa Davey has prepared this explainer about who George Pell is and what he\u2019s been found guilty of. A grumpy Jon Faine complained on ABC Melbourne radio earlier that he hasn\u2019t been able to speak to author and journalist Louise Milligan about the Pell verdict today. Faine said the ABC had decided to quarantine the star reporter from appearances on other ABC shows today because she has been limited to an appearance on 730 tonight. Milligan has also made a special inside story on the case for Four Corners on Monday. Outside court this morning, a victim of child sexual abuse by another member of the Catholic church told the media it was \u201ca miracle\u201d Pell had been convicted. \u201cPell should be excommunicated,\u201d the man, who identified himself only as Michael, said. \u201cI want to see Pell in jail. I want to see the Catholics actually properly compensate their victims, not use all their lawyers to delay everything that they do.\u201d Michael said he was abused 40 years ago in Victoria and urged his fellow Catholics to \u201cvote with your feet\u201d and \u201cwalk out of the church\u201d. He said he hoped Pell would never be released. \u201cPell should never be released because the responsibility that he has to every Catholic in Victoria is enormous. If Pell would have been a leader like he was supposed to be ... we would not have had any of these problems.\u201d Quite stark. Pell was originally due to be sentenced on Wednesday, but we now understand that won\u2019t happen until next week. However, he may be taken into custody at a plea hearing on Wednesday. Pell has released a statement through his solicitor, Paul Galbally: Cardinal George Pell has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so. An appeal has been lodged against his conviction and he will await the outcome of the appeal process. Although originally the Cardinal faced allegations from a number of complainants, all charges except for those the subject of the appeal have now been either withdrawn, discharged or discontinued. He will not be commenting in the meantime. Australian media outlets have been unable to report that the country\u2019s most senior Catholic had been convicted of child sexual abuse until now because of a suppression order on the case. But, as this story from Amanda Meade explains, dozens of journalists have been threatened with a charge of contempt of court \u2013 and could face possible jail terms. The chief justice, Peter Kidd, lifted the suppression order just before 11am this morning, after about an hour of argument and two quick breaks. Here is what happened. First, the Department of Public Prosecutions said it would discontinue its prosecution of the second trial, known as the Ballarat or swimmers trial, and that therefore the suppression order, which was in place to ensure that the second trial was not prejudiced, could be lifted. Robert Richter QC, lawyer for Pell, applied for the suppression order to be extended on the grounds that he had filed appeal documents on 21 February. The grounds of the appeal, he said, posed a real possibility that the conviction would be overturned and the trial would have to be reheard. If the suppression order lifted before a possible retrial, he said, there would be an \u201cirrevocable and incurable injustice\u201d, or at the very least an irrevocable appearance of injustice. Kidd said he was required by law to consider that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty was \u201cgood\u201d and could not consider extending a suppression order on a supposition that a retrial might be called at some point in the future. He said he had no grounds to extend the order, and there was a strong public interest in the media being able to cover the sentencing hearing. At any event, he said, a retrial where the outcome of the original trial is public knowledge was not an unusual occurrence. It would put Pell on a level playing field with most convicted people in the country. But Kidd said he was prepared to give Richter time to go across Lonsdale Street to the court of appeal and apply for a suppression order in that court. He originally proposed giving the defence until 4pm on Monday to make that application, but was persuaded by the prosecution and a lawyer representing media agencies that that was too long. He then proposed giving the defence until 4pm on Thursday. Kidd said that regardless of the likelihood of the appeal succeeding, which he would not comment on, the defence was entitled to the opportunity to make an application to the other court. He said that opportunity had to be given before the county court suppression order was lifted, adding that \u201cif ever there was a case where the milk is spilled, it is this case\u201d. While Kidd went into his chambers to write his orders, Richter\u2019s team changed their mind and withdrew their opposition to the suppression orders being lifted. Pell will face jail when he\u2019s sentenced, now likely to be next week. David Marr: What a country that can do this: the first in the world to hold a national inquiry into this scandal and the first to send a cardinal to prison. He\u2019s going in. His barrister, Robert Richter, told the court this morning: \u201cWe accept a custodial sentence is inevitable.\u201d Pell\u2019s barrister, Robert Richter QC, filed an appeal against the conviction on 21 February. That could take some time to play out, but the appeal is based on the following grounds: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable, in contrary to the evidence before them It was not right that the defence were not allowed to present jurors with a digital animation they intended to screen during their closing address The way the jury was constituted was unfair Pell was found guilty of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys in 1996 and 1997. One of the victims has since died. The other, a man now in his 30s who cannot be named, has released this statement today: Thank you for your interest in this case. Like many survivors I have experienced shame, loneliness, depression and struggle. Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life. At some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust. I would like to thank my family near and far for their support of me, and of each other. I am witness in a case brought by the state of Victoria. I have put my trust in the police and the criminal justice system. The process has been stressful and it is not over yet. I need space and time to cope with the ongoing criminal process. I understand this is a big news story but please don\u2019t reveal my identity. I ask that the media respect my privacy. I don\u2019t want to give any interviews. Please don\u2019t come to my home. I want to protect my young family and my parents. I don\u2019t want them swept into the spotlight. I am not a spokesperson about child sexual abuse. There are many other survivors and advocates who bravely fill this role. I am just a regular guy working to support and protect my family as best I can. Thank you for your support and understanding. George Pell has just left the courtroom. People shouted at him as he made his way through the police escort. The scene outside the county court in Melbourne this morning, before the suppression order on Pell\u2019s conviction was lifted. David Marr was there. He tells me Pell entered the court looking \u201cchipper\u201d but \u201cleft blank\u201d. \u201cHe had to go out with the press,\u201d Marr tells me. Our reporter Melissa Davey was in the court throughout both Pell trials. The first, which ran for five weeks, ended in a hung jury and led to a retrial. The second, which lasted four and a half weeks, resulted in a guilty verdict after three and a half days of deliberation by the jury. Here is her report. Cardinal George Pell, once the third most powerful man in the Vatican in Rome and Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old boys in Melbourne in the mid 1990s. Pell was found guilty of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 and guilty of four charges of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The assaults occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne. The jurors delivered their verdict on 11 December after three and a half days of deliberating at Melbourne\u2019s county court and following a four-and-a-half-week trial which began on 7 November. A previous trial on the charges, which began in August, resulted in a hung jury and the retrial. Neither trial has been able to be reported until now owing to strict suppression orders imposed by the court and lifted today. Stay with us as we cover the reaction to the verdict and the likely next steps.",

      "bodyText": "Tommy Robinson, the far-right founder of the English Defence League, has been permanently banned from Facebook and Instagram for repeatedly breaking policies on hate speech, Facebook said. The company said Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, broke rules that ban public calls for violence against people based on protected characteristics; rules that ban supporting or appearing with organised hate groups; and policies that prevent people from using the site to bully others. The decision to ban Robinson from the social media sites could threaten his ability to reach large audiences. He is already banned from Twitter and the decision to cut him off from Instagram and Facebook will leave him reliant on YouTube as the only major online platform to provide him with a presence. In a blogpost, Facebook said: \u201cWhen ideas and opinions cross the line and amount to hate speech that may create an environment of intimidation and exclusion for certain groups in society \u2013 in some cases with potentially dangerous offline implications \u2013 we take action. Tommy Robinson\u2019s Facebook page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims.

That warning had been issued for breaches that included a post calling on people to terrorise and behead those who follow the Qur\u2019an; a post calling on people to \u201cmake war\u201d on Muslims; and multiple videos showing people being bullied. Following that warning, Robinson did break Facebook\u2019s policies again, it says, through: Organising and participating in events with recognised hate figures or groups, such as Proud Boys and Gavin McInnes Public praise or support for these hate figures and groups Public remarks that include hate speech targeted at a specific group in society Public calls for violence against people based on race, ethnicity or national origin. Robinson\u2019s official Facebook page and Instagram profile will be deleted and any future presence on the site will be preemptively barred. It will place Robinson in the same category as other banned personalities such as McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, and the Infowars founder, Alex Jones, meaning that others who allow him access to the site through their own pages or profiles could face disciplinary action themselves.

Now, aged 30, he is able to talk openly about his childhood experience. To help others he has written a book, The Year I Didn\u2019t Eat, which chronicles 12 months in the life of fictional 14-year-old Max as he struggles with anorexia. \u201cIn the book I draw out a separate character who is the eating disorder \u2026 a bad cop version of you is a good way of summarising it [an eating disorder], a severe voice.

Figures obtained by the Guardian from NHS Digital show year-on-year rises in hospital visits in England, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before \u2013 the biggest spike in eight years. Experts have said the surge in numbers is down to the failure of NHS services to tackle anorexia and bulimia at an earlier stage, before people become so unwell that they need to be admitted to hospital. There has also been a notable rise in men experiencing the condition. The number of adult men being admitted to hospital with an eating disorder has risen by 70% over the past six years \u2013 the same rate of increase as among women.

Indeed, quite dishonestly these articles refrain from informing their readers that there was no opposition [by media] to the suppression order being made in Victoria.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is just breathtaking.\u201d</p> \n<p>He kept the suppression in place, saying the story had not spread so widely or with enough detail for it to be completely ineffective.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Do not look to me for hints. I won\u2019t give you any</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Peter Kidd, judge</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a decision which in the end proved correct \u2013 the story did not disseminate much further after the initial publications outside of Australia. And it was a decision that reflected Kidd\u2019s handling of the trial as a whole. Considered, diligent and fair.</p> \n<p>Indeed, during those many weeks in court, if either party crossed a line in their examination of witnesses they copped a swift rebuke. Both the prosecution and the defence seemed to respect Kidd greatly.</p> \n<p>Kidd repeatedly told the jury he would give no hints as to the verdict they should return, and that they were not to make Pell a scapegoat for the church\u2019s failings. Pell was at a significant disadvantage, he told them, owing to the decades that had passed and the fact he could not gather evidence from witnesses when their memories were more sound.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou alone are the judges in this case,\u201d he told the jurors. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to decide this case. That is your role. The verdict you return has nothing to do with me. You are not bound by any comments I make about the facts. Do not look to me for hints. I won\u2019t give you any.\u201d</p> \n<p>He urged jurors to go home each night and clear their heads, he wished them restful weekends, and he acknowledged the gravity of the task they had randomly been assigned.</p> \n<p>When a juror fell asleep while he was speaking, he said he would \u201ctry not to to take it personally\u201d \u2013 then sent jurors away for the evening to ensure they only heard evidence while totally focused.</p> \n<h2>Contrasting styles</h2> \n<p>In the aftermath of the verdict, Richter, one of the most well-known and expensive defence barristers in Melbourne, will be asking himself what went wrong. It was, by all accounts, his case to lose.</p> \n<p>The answer may be in part that his courtroom style \u2013 at times confrontational and theatrical \u2013 is more palatable to jurors hearing cases involving criminal underworld figures than those considering harrowing crimes of child sexual abuse. His closing address was unwieldy. It lasted two days and referenced US television shows, Darth Vader and the Queen. There was even a PowerPoint presentation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/rise-fall-george-pell-timeline\">The rise and fall of George Pell \u2013 timeline</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Richter closed by warning the jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake.\u2019\u201d It may have appeared condescending.</p> \n<p>By contrast the crown prosecutor Mark Gibson\u2019s closing address took about one day, and was delivered with no theatrics. At times, it was almost dry. He took the jurors to direct quotes given by witnesses throughout the trial. He walked them step-by-step through what the victim said had happened. He told jurors they should find the victim was believable, an honest historian, describing as best he could horrific events that happened to him as a 13-year-old through the eyes of a man now in his 30s.</p> \n<p>The combination of a compelling witness and Gibson\u2019s measured approach made the offences seem not \u201cimprobable\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d as Richter claimed, but real and painful.</p> \n<p>There will be an appeal, Pell and his lawyers have confirmed. And, in the meantime, media company executives and journalists may be brought to the court to explain why they breached the suppression order. The pope will eventually need to respond to the verdict.</p> \n<p>The months of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted. But the story is far from over.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For nearly three months a small group of journalists watched as the most powerful Catholic official to be charged with child sexual abuse faced justice in a Melbourne courtroom. Until now we have been unable to publish a word of what we heard and saw. Cardinal George Pell, a confidant to the pope and the financial manager of the Vatican, had been on trial for child sexual abuse \u2013 not once, but twice. But a suppression order meant that the thousands of words recorded by the media \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 through first a mistrial and then a retrial had to remain carefully protected in notepads and on personal computers. Nothing could be published. The court had ruled that the interests of justice were paramount. Pell was due to face yet another trial involving more allegations \u2013 this time accused of molesting boys in a swimming pool. And, without a suppression order, news of the preceding trials would have received saturation coverage \u2013 potentially biasing a future jury. So when the extraordinary guilty verdict came in December 2018, it too, for a time, was suppressed. But with that \u201cswimmers trial\u201d now dropped owing to a lack of admissible evidence we can now reveal how justice unfolded, the day-to-day detail of the case and how the media\u2019s behaviour and the allegations of a \u201ccover-up\u201d affected those at the centre of it all. \u2018The burden is much greater\u2019 Pell\u2019s first trial began in August 2018. Known as the \u201ccathedral trial\u201d in legal and journalistic circles, it lasted for five weeks. After a week of deliberations the jurors could not reach an unanimous verdict, or even a majority verdict of 11 to one. Their distress was clear. Five of them were in tears. The chief judge of Victoria\u2019s county court, Peter Kidd \u2013 always thorough and often no-nonsense \u2013 reassured them. \u201cIn some cases, the burden is much greater than others,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the moment you were empanelled over a month ago the burden was going to be greater than most.\u201d But he also left them with a warning: \u201cWhatever took place in that jury room must stay there.\u201d And it did. A new jury needed to be selected for the retrial, which began in November. As with the first trial, journalists watched via videolink from a courtroom on the third floor as 250 would-be jurors crowded into a room on the lower level of the county court. The unusually large group was called because there were fears that so many people would have biases towards or against the Catholic church that finding non-prejudiced jurors would be difficult. As they took their seats, Kidd told them they faced selection for the \u201cdirector of public prosecutions versus Pell\u201d trial. There was an audible shift in the room as he clarified: \u201cThat is, Cardinal George Pell.\u201d While only 12 jurors can decide a verdict, 14 were chosen in case any dropped out owing to illness or for other reasons, with two to be balloted off come the deliberations. Pell had the right to challenge up to three jurors as their numbers were pulled out of a ballot box and their occupations read out. He challenged none. Nine men and five women were sworn in, among them a church pastor, a mathematician, a chef and a schoolteacher. Journalists braced themselves for five more weeks of the same witnesses, questioning and arguments they had heard before. Notes meticulously gathered during the first trial were now almost useless. They attended knowing there was a very real possibility the jury could be hung once again. Seeing Pell in court each day quickly became mundane. Each morning the cardinal would be dropped off by a black car. He always wore the same thing: black trousers, a black shirt and, sometimes, a beige jacket. Police would usher him inside and he would be expedited through security, receiving a pat-down rather than a scan because of his pacemaker. A Catholic church official, Katrina Lee, was usually by his side as he made his way up to level four of the building. There they would lock themselves away in a tiny meeting room outside courtroom 4.3 until proceedings began. Pell made his way between the dock and this cramped meeting room every day, moving slowly with the assistance of a cane because of an injured knee. The meeting room held a standard white office table, a few chairs and a bin. A single internal window gave a view to the floors below. In the dock he was accompanied by a police officer who sat to his left, and in court breaks he would be joined in the meeting room by Lee and members of the defence team. They would bring him lunch: deliveries from Uber Eats, pickle sandwiches, sausage rolls and milkshakes. They would sometimes laugh and joke. For a time, journalists would gather in the equally crowded meeting room adjoining Pell\u2019s \u2013 until security realised the walls were thin and conversation about topics such as lunch orders could be overheard. The next-door room was locked after that, and Pell\u2019s was guarded by security. Journalists instead charged their laptops and discussed the case in a separate meeting room a few metres away. By the second trial there were only about eight reporters left who attended every day, with stretched newsrooms unable to dedicate resources to the entirety of another five-week trial. People who were connected enough to know the trial was taking place filed in and out of the courtroom throughout: the Jesuit priest Frank Brennan, the former deputy prime minister and ambassador to the Vatican Tim Fischer, and barristers and judges from surrounding courts. They stopped by, still in their robes and wigs, to observe one of the most notable cases in memory unfold. The prominent child abuse campaigner Chrissie Foster, who fought the Catholic church for justice for two of her daughters who were raped by a priest, also attended regularly. Other church supporters and priests came in and out, too, sometimes approaching the dock to shake Pell\u2019s hand and wish him well. A priest was kicked out by security for being disruptive, making noises in agreement with Pell\u2019s defence team, and frequently forgetting to turn off his phone. Some other abuse survivors and their advocates would plant themselves among the journalists, seeing them as allies, with at least one whispering their thoughts while witnesses were cross-examined. It put journalists in an awkward position \u2013 we were there not to take sides but to record an important trial unfolding. And it was this unlikely collective of people who paced the corridor and filled the meeting rooms outside the courtroom after the second jury retired to deliberate. Pell and his team shut themselves away in the tiny room. Staying nearby was essential because, once a verdict was reached, events would move fast, and reporters risked not being alerted in time. So they waited and watched for movement, for the lawyers to emerge and re-enter the court. After three and a half days, word came that the jurors were done. A couple of dozen people filed into the courtroom. After months, a clear outcome appeared to have been reached. On the surface, Pell\u2019s legal team looked relaxed as they took their seats at the bar table.

Richter\u2019s confident demeanour evaporated. His voice barely rose above a whisper as he discussed bail requirements and a sentencing date with the judge. Many in the room joined in the counsel\u2019s disbelief. Doubts of a conviction were partly driven by the outcome of the first trial. And only the jurors and legal teams had seen the victim\u2019s evidence, which was critical to the prosecution\u2019s case. The public, including media, were barred from witnessing his testimony, as is common in sexual abuse trials, to spare survivors from additional trauma and to protect their identities.

The news \u2013 which would usually erupt on to websites and across airwaves throughout the world within seconds \u2013 needed to stay within newsrooms for the time being. Too sensational to contain But despite a strict suppression order \u2013 in place because of the \u201cswimmers trial\u201d Pell was facing, and the need to ensure that future jurors would not be biased \u2013 the verdict proved too sensational to contain. While the journalists who were the courtroom day in, day out did not themselves write anything, the court alerted the wider media to the suppressed decision \u2013 as is common after a trial because of the public interest. Reporters from international news organisations published articles despite the suppression order being in place; these necessarily lacked detail because their authors were unlikely to have been in court. Soon tweets and opinion pieces were also being published by media outlets who attempted to be cryptic, and which lamented the overuse of suppression orders in Australian courts. Some of those news organisations have since been issued with contempt-of-court notices and journalists face possible jail time. Some readers saw the international reports and the tweets, and the local vague coverage, and threatened to stop supporting Australian news organisations which had not covered the story, accusing them of failing to work in the public interest. Judge\u2019s fury In a hearing held on 13 December, two days after the verdict, a lawyer representing several Australian media companies argued before Kidd that the suppression should be lifted now that the verdict was somewhat out. Kidd, usually so measured and cerebral, could not contain his fury. \u201cThe way I see it at the moment is that some of this publicity was designed to put improper pressure upon me,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cAnd, indeed, it is positively misleading \u2026 My [suppression] order was never appealed. Indeed, quite dishonestly these articles refrain from informing their readers that there was no opposition [by media] to the suppression order being made in Victoria. \u201cIt is just breathtaking.\u201d He kept the suppression in place, saying the story had not spread so widely or with enough detail for it to be completely ineffective. It was a decision which in the end proved correct \u2013 the story did not disseminate much further after the initial publications outside of Australia. And it was a decision that reflected Kidd\u2019s handling of the trial as a whole. Considered, diligent and fair. Indeed, during those many weeks in court, if either party crossed a line in their examination of witnesses they copped a swift rebuke. Both the prosecution and the defence seemed to respect Kidd greatly. Kidd repeatedly told the jury he would give no hints as to the verdict they should return, and that they were not to make Pell a scapegoat for the church\u2019s failings. Pell was at a significant disadvantage, he told them, owing to the decades that had passed and the fact he could not gather evidence from witnesses when their memories were more sound. \u201cYou alone are the judges in this case,\u201d he told the jurors. \u201cIt is not my responsibility to decide this case. That is your role. The verdict you return has nothing to do with me. You are not bound by any comments I make about the facts. Do not look to me for hints. I won\u2019t give you any.\u201d He urged jurors to go home each night and clear their heads, he wished them restful weekends, and he acknowledged the gravity of the task they had randomly been assigned. When a juror fell asleep while he was speaking, he said he would \u201ctry not to to take it personally\u201d \u2013 then sent jurors away for the evening to ensure they only heard evidence while totally focused. Contrasting styles In the aftermath of the verdict, Richter, one of the most well-known and expensive defence barristers in Melbourne, will be asking himself what went wrong. It was, by all accounts, his case to lose. The answer may be in part that his courtroom style \u2013 at times confrontational and theatrical \u2013 is more palatable to jurors hearing cases involving criminal underworld figures than those considering harrowing crimes of child sexual abuse. His closing address was unwieldy. It lasted two days and referenced US television shows, Darth Vader and the Queen. There was even a PowerPoint presentation. Richter closed by warning the jurors that if they convicted Pell: \u201cYou can\u2019t can\u2019t come back and say, \u2018Oops, I\u2019m sorry, I made a mistake.\u2019\u201d It may have appeared condescending. By contrast the crown prosecutor Mark Gibson\u2019s closing address took about one day, and was delivered with no theatrics. At times, it was almost dry. He took the jurors to direct quotes given by witnesses throughout the trial. He walked them step-by-step through what the victim said had happened. He told jurors they should find the victim was believable, an honest historian, describing as best he could horrific events that happened to him as a 13-year-old through the eyes of a man now in his 30s. The combination of a compelling witness and Gibson\u2019s measured approach made the offences seem not \u201cimprobable\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d as Richter claimed, but real and painful. There will be an appeal, Pell and his lawyers have confirmed. And, in the meantime, media company executives and journalists may be brought to the court to explain why they breached the suppression order. The pope will eventually need to respond to the verdict. The months of silence and pressure on those in the trial has lifted. But the story is far from over.",

At the time, it was widely held in pop magazines that the London quartet were here to challenge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/duranduran\">Duran Duran</a>\u2019s stranglehold over teenage affections. In fairness, they gave it their best shot. They posed for pin-up friendly photographs in the post-new romantic clobber of the day: crisp white clothes, shirts and ties, a look that bore a debt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/roxymusic\">Roxy Music</a> in latter-day sophisticated mode.</p> <p>They bedecked their songs with synthesisers and the modish sound of fretless bass: their drummer played one of those octagonal Simmons electronic kits, de rigueur on Top of the Pops at the time. Their 1982 debut album The Party\u2019s Over was glossy and derivative, nothing to frighten the horses, although the lyrics of the title track suggested a certain jarring intensity: \u201cTake this punishment away Lord \u2026 too much hope I\u2019ve seen as virtue.\u201d Its follow-up, It\u2019s My Life, was a bigger hit \u2013 a Top 10 smash on the continent, its title track a US chart breakthrough \u2013 but something about it suggested that the kind of scream-inducing fame Talk Talk were apparently being groomed for wasn\u2019t going to sit right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c901823cb6e9d7eb3cede2303ede1de09f5d92e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c901823cb6e9d7eb3cede2303ede1de09f5d92e3/0_0_4302_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A look that bore a debt to Roxy Music\u2019 ...

Beneath the production lustre, the music on Such a Shame and Does Caroline Know? rather implied it was made by people with a love of progressive rock, not something you admitted to in a hurry in the pages of Number One magazine: Talk Talk supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/genesis\">Genesis</a> when the latter reunited with Peter Gabriel for a one-off gig.</p> <p>And then there was the saga of the video for It\u2019s My Life itself. The first version consisted of wildlife footage intercut with shots of Mark Hollis glowering at the camera, mouth clamped shut. When their record label protested, Talk Talk made a second version, miming theatrically and lip-syncing deliberately out of time, as if mocking the whole business.

As it turned out, Mark Hollis wasn\u2019t just a grumpy refusenik who didn\u2019t like miming in videos and name-dropped Miles Davis and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in interviews. He was an artist with a completely singular and uncompromising musical vision that would eventually spawn an entire musical sub-genre. He would spend the next six years following his own route with painstaking exactitude, in the process changing Talk Talk\u2019s music so completely that, by the time they split up in 1991, they were utterly unrecognisable as the band who\u2019d once appeared on Top of the Pops singing their hit single Today to an audience wearing deely-boppers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before you play two notes, learn how to play one note.

When a reporter from Smash Hits attended the ensuing tour, they reported back in horror that Hollis had distractedly wandered on stage and started playing wearing no shoes, only a pair of socks.

Its six songs were frequently profoundly moving, never more so than on the astonishing I Believe In You, a song inspired by Hollis\u2019s elder brother\u2019s long descent into heroin addiction. Once the manager of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weQ4oNk7Pqc\">Eddie and the Hot Rods</a>, Ed Hollis would die before the album was released.

      "bodyText": "If you were paying very close attention to the music that Talk Talk released in the early 80s, you might have realised that they were not a band cut out to do what was expected of them. At the time, it was widely held in pop magazines that the London quartet were here to challenge to Duran Duran\u2019s stranglehold over teenage affections. In fairness, they gave it their best shot. They posed for pin-up friendly photographs in the post-new romantic clobber of the day: crisp white clothes, shirts and ties, a look that bore a debt to Roxy Music in latter-day sophisticated mode. They bedecked their songs with synthesisers and the modish sound of fretless bass: their drummer played one of those octagonal Simmons electronic kits, de rigueur on Top of the Pops at the time. Their 1982 debut album The Party\u2019s Over was glossy and derivative, nothing to frighten the horses, although the lyrics of the title track suggested a certain jarring intensity: \u201cTake this punishment away Lord \u2026 too much hope I\u2019ve seen as virtue.\u201d Its follow-up, It\u2019s My Life, was a bigger hit \u2013 a Top 10 smash on the continent, its title track a US chart breakthrough \u2013 but something about it suggested that the kind of scream-inducing fame Talk Talk were apparently being groomed for wasn\u2019t going to sit right. Frontman Mark Hollis\u2019s voice was simultaneously too anguished and too vague; he clearly cared more about feeling than diction. Beneath the production lustre, the music on Such a Shame and Does Caroline Know? rather implied it was made by people with a love of progressive rock, not something you admitted to in a hurry in the pages of Number One magazine: Talk Talk supported Genesis when the latter reunited with Peter Gabriel for a one-off gig. And then there was the saga of the video for It\u2019s My Life itself. The first version consisted of wildlife footage intercut with shots of Mark Hollis glowering at the camera, mouth clamped shut. When their record label protested, Talk Talk made a second version, miming theatrically and lip-syncing deliberately out of time, as if mocking the whole business. You didn\u2019t win over MTV behaving like that. But if you might have worked out that Talk Talk were ill-suited to mainstream pop success, no one could have predicted what was about to happen. As it turned out, Mark Hollis wasn\u2019t just a grumpy refusenik who didn\u2019t like miming in videos and name-dropped Miles Davis and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in interviews. He was an artist with a completely singular and uncompromising musical vision that would eventually spawn an entire musical sub-genre. He would spend the next six years following his own route with painstaking exactitude, in the process changing Talk Talk\u2019s music so completely that, by the time they split up in 1991, they were utterly unrecognisable as the band who\u2019d once appeared on Top of the Pops singing their hit single Today to an audience wearing deely-boppers. The first sign of his shift in direction came with 1986\u2019s The Colour of Spring. \u201cThat whole synth side,\u201d Hollis had decreed, \u201cget it in the bin.\u201d The single Life\u2019s What You Make It was idiosyncratically funky and euphoric \u2013 you could see why it ended up a big record with Balearic DJs playing to ecstasy-blasted dancefloors \u2013 but elsewhere, The Colour of Spring drew on everything from jazz horns to children\u2019s choirs. There were epic orchestrations, but on Chameleon Day or the impossibly beautiful April 5th, there was also music that sounded sparse and abstract. Eventually, Hollis would become famous for the amount of music he recorded, then wiped, before declaring a song complete. (\u201cBefore you play two notes, learn how to play one note,\u201d he offered as explanation for this approach, \u201cand don\u2019t play one note unless you\u2019ve got a reason to play it.\u201d) A few years earlier, Talk Talk had sounded desperate to fit in with the musical zeitgeist: now they sounded completely out of step with current pop trends \u2013 it was the year of sophisticated pop-soul and big AOR ballads \u2013 and lost in their own world. When a reporter from Smash Hits attended the ensuing tour, they reported back in horror that Hollis had distractedly wandered on stage and started playing wearing no shoes, only a pair of socks. No one would ever suggest Talk Talk were cut from the same cloth as Duran Duran again. Chameleon Day suggested the direction Talk Talk would follow on 1988\u2019s Spirit of Eden, the album that sealed their reputation as one of the most extraordinary bands of their era, at least in retrospect. Incredibly, given its current standing, Spirit of Eden was coolly received on release. \u201cAimless,\u201d offered one critic. \u201cPretentious,\u201d suggested another. Or perhaps that wasn\u2019t so incredible. An album that took nine apparently agonising months to make and was, by all accounts, largely recorded in the dark \u2013 the only lighting in the studio coming from the kind of oil wheel popular with 60s psychedelic light shows \u2013 Spirit of Eden didn\u2019t so much play as gradually unfurl.

      "bodyText": "Income inequality across Britain increased over the course of 2018 as cuts to benefits damaged the finances of poorer households while the wealthiest in society got richer, official figures show. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average income of the poorest fifth of the population after inflation contracted by 1.6% in the last financial year ending in 2018, while the average income of the richest fifth rose by 4.7%. The Whitehall statistics body singled out the falling average value of cash benefits for the poorest households as the main driver behind the decline in their income, while a rise in earnings from employment lifted the income of the richest. It also said that median household disposable income growth had plateaued last year at \u00a328,400, ending four years of steady increases for the strength of household finances. The latest snapshot into the health of household finances across the country suggests that welfare cuts imposed by the government have exacerbated inequalities, at a time of mounting political and economic divisions. Separate analysis has previously shown the Brexit vote damaged average household incomes, after the sharp drop in the pound immediately after the referendum result drove higher inflation, outstripping wage rises. Theresa May has come under growing pressure to enact her promise to end austerity, after almost a decade of cuts to benefits and services. Household benefits for millions of families, including those in work, have been frozen over the last four years under a policy launched by the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2015. The policy, in place until 2020, means household benefit payments do not rise in line with inflation. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates the average lower-income family with children will be \u00a3200 worse off this year as a consequence. Despite the deterioration in household income last year, the ONS said the longer-term picture was more positive for poorer families. Since the 2008 financial crisis, it is the average income of the poorest fifth that has risen the most, up 11.6%, compared with the richest fifth, rising by 4.9% over the same period. The highest 1% of earners in the country have, however, managed to protect their share of total household disposable income over the past seven years, with the richest 1% of the population controlling 7.1% of total household disposable income. The ONS said income inequality had increased slightly last year when measured using the Gini coefficient \u2013 a sliding scale between 0 and 100 where higher values represent a greater degree of inequality \u2013 with the gauge ticking up from 31.4 to 32.5 last year in the UK. Despite the small increase last year, income inequality remains slightly lower than the levels reached 11 years ago, although is substantially higher than during the 1970s and 1980s before income inequality rapidly accelerated in Britain and several other major economies.

      "body": "<p>It is billed as a magic show about grief but The Trick has nothing up its sleeve. Eve Leigh\u2019s new play, about the struggles of old age and mourning, falls into the trap of emotionally manipulative music and sentimentality without so much as a cup-and-ball sleight of hand to misdirect us. The humour rarely lands and every line about loss is piled with emotion, so that its desire for us to be sad becomes overbearing.</p> <p>Elderly widow Mira (Lachele Carl) is comforted by the ghost of her husband, Jonah (David Verrey), who died seven months ago. Carl is too supple in both mind and movement for us to believe in her frailty, and her relationship with Verrey doesn\u2019t hold enough force to make her inability to move on feel credible.</p> <p>Everything about The Trick is <em>almost</em> interesting: the morphing structure, veering from variety act to scientific explainer; a session of brain-freezing ice-cream gorging; a recurring search for the trick behind a good life. Ani Nelson and Sharlene Whyte have fun as conniving plumbers trying to dupe Mira out of her money, but the story goes randomly off course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38043ed4b6dc7094edc438e4773511a82214c31c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38043ed4b6dc7094edc438e4773511a82214c31c/0_20_3692_2215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Verrey and Lachele Carl in The Trick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Too supple to believe in her frailty ...

      "bodyText": "It is billed as a magic show about grief but The Trick has nothing up its sleeve. Eve Leigh\u2019s new play, about the struggles of old age and mourning, falls into the trap of emotionally manipulative music and sentimentality without so much as a cup-and-ball sleight of hand to misdirect us. The humour rarely lands and every line about loss is piled with emotion, so that its desire for us to be sad becomes overbearing. Elderly widow Mira (Lachele Carl) is comforted by the ghost of her husband, Jonah (David Verrey), who died seven months ago. Carl is too supple in both mind and movement for us to believe in her frailty, and her relationship with Verrey doesn\u2019t hold enough force to make her inability to move on feel credible. Everything about The Trick is almost interesting: the morphing structure, veering from variety act to scientific explainer; a session of brain-freezing ice-cream gorging; a recurring search for the trick behind a good life. Ani Nelson and Sharlene Whyte have fun as conniving plumbers trying to dupe Mira out of her money, but the story goes randomly off course. In one shaky palm-reading scene, Nelson determines the future love, life and death of an audience member. It\u2019s an uncomfortable moment and could easily go wrong depending on the individual\u2019s health. Director Roy Alexander Weise tries to inject a jazz-hands pizazz into the bland gloom but tips into cliches: the blown leaves and almost-touching hands are eye-rollingly cringeworthy. The sweet ending may tug at some hearts, but frankly, these are easy topics to hurt us with, and it\u2019s not done with enough delicacy to really enchant. The Trick is at the Bush theatre, London, until 23 March.",

First, while the jobs numbers currently look positive, we have seen a number of negative announcements which will affect the employment outlook in the 2020s, most recently from Honda but also from many other international investors in the UK. Second, productivity shows little sign of recovering. Headline employment is up 1.4% on a year ago, but GDP has risen just 1.3%.

      "bodyText": "Brexit gridlock has dragged the UK economy close to stalling point as growing numbers of companies pause their spending plans, raising the risk of job losses in future, according to a Guardian analysis of developments over the past month. With less than 40 days for the government to take urgent evasive action to avert no-deal Brexit, the economy has become increasingly reliant on consumers carrying on spending as businesses slam on the brakes. The Guardian\u2019s monthly Brexit dashboard reveals several warning signals for Philip Hammond as he prepares to deliver next month\u2019s spring statement, the final major fiscal event before the UK formally leaves the EU. There are positives putting Britain on a stronger footing ahead of Brexit from the jobs market and growth in household spending. However, two former Bank of England policymakers warn that clouds are gathering for the future as the UK braces for a no-deal departure. While unemployment in the final months before Brexit is at the lowest level since the mid 1970s, more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the British car industry have been put at risk by the lack of clarity over future trading relationships and shifting trends in the worldwide automotive sector. Honda, the Japanese carmaker, announced plans to close its Swindon plant, while Jaguar Land Rover and Ford have also said they will axe thousands of jobs. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, warned: \u201cClosing plants hits jobs and wages.\u201d He said: \u201cWe need to focus on what is happening now as Brexit approaches, not what happened in those halcyon pre-Brexit days. Stand by for gale-force winds approaching.\u201d To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian is monitoring eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. In three cases, the result was worse than forecast. On the latest dashboard, consumer spending recovered sharply in January after one of the worst Christmas trading periods of the past decade. Inflation cooled to the lowest level in two years, helped by the biggest monthly fall in gas prices since the late 1980s coinciding with the introduction of the government\u2019s energy price cap. Philip Hammond received an early boost before the spring statement thanks to the biggest monthly surplus in the public finances since records began in 1993, coming as he faces pressure to end austerity. However, the chancellor also faces the risk that a no-deal Brexit could plunge the economy into recession and blow apart the public finances. Surveys of business activity closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signs from the economy show that growing numbers of companies have put big spending decisions on hold. Stockpiling has helped to prop up factory output, but growth in new orders has slumped, with firms blaming Brexit and the wider slowdown in the world economy. Amid the global slowdown and trade wars between the US and China, the UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the gap between exports and imports \u2013 has grown, despite the weakness in the pound since the Brexit vote, which should have made British goods more competitive on the world stage. Exporters sending goods to far-flung destinations are now doing so with the risk that their shipments are locked out of harbours around the world, following the failure of ministers to roll over several EU trade deals with a series of major trading partners, including Japan and South Korea. The economy grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, down from 0.6% in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter figures contained evidence of an even sharper slowdown, with the economy posting a decline of 0.4% in December amid signs that Brexit uncertainty is taking hold.

While January is usually a month when the public finances are in surplus, given seasonal differences in receipts, the surplus was \u00a35.5bn larger than a year ago.

Some surveys have, however, warned that consumers are putting bigger-ticket spending decisions on hold as Brexit looms. City economists have also warned that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s departure will be likely to keep a lid on sales over coming months. Better than forecast Record January budget surplus boosts Hammond Philip Hammond was handed a boost from the public finances ahead of next month\u2019s spring statement, receiving the biggest surplus for the government\u2019s coffers in January since records began in 1993. Government income from taxes outstripped public spending by \u00a314.9bn, after self-assessment income tax and capital gains tax receipts were stronger than expected. While January is usually a month when the public finances are in surplus, given seasonal differences in receipts, the surplus was \u00a35.5bn larger than a year ago. Although Hammond appears on track to hit his deficit reduction targets, economists warn a no-deal Brexit would blow apart the progress he has made. Worse than forecast Worst outlook for house prices since 2011 Brexit uncertainty and stretched levels of affordability are continuing to stifle the UK housing market, making estate agents the gloomiest they have been in a decade over property values. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that house price growth slowed to 2.5% in the year to December, dragged down by the London market where prices are falling. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\u2019 monthly house price balance \u2013 which measures the difference between the number of estate agents and property surveyors anticipating increases and those expecting decreases \u2013 dropped to -22% in January, the lowest level since March 2009. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 UK growth has fallen behind since the Brexit vote While the gloomiest of economic forecasts made ahead of the EU referendum in 2016 might not have come to pass, increasing evidence has emerged of the gradual damage the vote unleashed for the economy. This month, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, put the cost at \u00a340bn a year of lost GDP growth compared to a vote to remain two-and-a-half years ago. That\u2019s about \u00a3800m a week, he said, which is more than double what the leave campaign claimed could be saved on EU membership fees and instead spent on the NHS. Since the referendum, the UK\u2019s economic growth has slowed while the rest of the world has recorded one of its strongest periods for growth of the past decade \u2013 with a particular deterioration in business investment, as major companies put their spending decisions on hold amid the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future.",

      "bodyText": "The Colombian singer and philanthropist Shakira has been summoned to appear in a court near Barcelona over allegations that she avoided paying \u20ac14.5m (\u00a313m) in taxes, according to Spanish media reports. Prosecutors, who accused her of tax evasion in December last year, argue that the musician avoided taxes by claiming to live in the Bahamas when she was resident in Catalonia. Shakira changed residences in 2015 from the Bahamas to Spain, where she lives with her partner, the Barcelona footballer Gerard Piqu\u00e9, and their two sons. But prosecutors allege she was already living in the Catalan capital between 2012 and 2014, and should have paid tax in Spain on her worldwide income for those years. They argue she was resident in Spain for most of the year, only travelling abroad for short periods. On Monday evening, the Catalan newspaper El Peri\u00f3dico reported a judge in Esplugues de Llobregat had agreed to investigate the case and had summoned Shakira to appear in court on 12 June. A spokesman for the court declined to comment on the report. The tax authorities began investigating the singer in January last year. In 2017, Shakira appeared in the Paradise Papers, an investigation by the Guardian and other news organisations into the world of offshore finance. According to the papers, she was listed as a resident of the Bahamas despite living in Barcelona. Asked at the time about Shakira\u2019s listed residence in the Bahamas, her lawyer said the artist had lived in a variety of places \u201cthroughout her professional career and, in every case, has fully met the laws of all the jurisdictions where she has resided\u201d. El Peri\u00f3dico also reported that Shakira has already paid the Spanish tax authorities \u20ac14.5m to settle the debt. The Grammy award winner, who set up the Bare Foot foundation for underprivileged children in 1997, is the latest high-profile figure to face legal action over their tax affairs. Earlier this month, the former Manchester United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and agreed to pay \u20ac2.2m in fines after admitting tax fraud while he was the manager of Real Madrid. In January, Cristiano Ronaldo admitted committing tax fraud while playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an \u20ac18.8m fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence.",

And I\u2019m sure there were things I missed that will reveal themselves on additional viewing. This seems like a more subtle Alan. Obviously, in the realms of normal people, he\u2019s as subtle as Jeremy Clarkson. But, for Alan, he doesn\u2019t seem to be as outrageous or as out of his depth as before. Again, it\u2019s all relative. So we can still laugh at clunt/fluck etc. And I think it will be very interesting and funny seeing how odd he gets near the end. A solid four stars, methinks. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126284056\">retromoz</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018The script was too subtle to raise belly laughs\u2019</h2> <p>It had all the makings of a great return to form. The TV magazine format was well judged; Susannah Fielding was brilliant as the co-presenter and each \u2018story\u2019 was perfect satire material. But for me, the script was too subtle to raise belly laughs; more like embarrassed winces. The best bit was the exposure of Partridge\u2019s anxieties about status, money etc, by the hacktivist\u2019s revelations during the interview. The show\u2019s ending in the BBC lift didn\u2019t work. Perhaps the sharper and funnier W1A had raised my expectations of a BBC-based satire? <strong>Liz, 60, Leeds</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/25/this-time-with-alan-partridge-review-an-excruciating-white-knuckle-ride\">This Time With Alan Partridge review \u2013 an excruciating white-knuckle ride</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018It\u2019s unfair to expect the heights of \u201cvintage\u201d Partridge\u2019</h2> <p>As a Partridge fan of many, many years who can probably still quote far too much of the really obscure stuff, like when he was on the radio doing KMKYWAP (smelling salts anyone?) I really enjoyed it. Sure \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as good as \u2018vintage\u2019 Partridge \u2013 character high point for me, Jed Maxwell \u2013 but it\u2019s unfair to expect those heights every time. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283912\">jimstinks</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Too clean and realistic\u2019</h2> <p>The writing is too undisciplined, like they wanted to jam every idea they thought of in there, even getting sidekick Simon involved when it wasn\u2019t needed, instead of having a few well written jokes. The main problem is that old Partridge was surreal thanks to Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham, and the directing style matches the tone. The new stuff is too clean and realistic in its presentation, so when something unrealistic happens it just feels awkward and out of place. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283319\">Brained</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018It was a brilliant first programme. I look forward to more\u2019</h2> <p>The original Partridge fans are in their 40s and 50s now and, like most old people, they find change difficult (I\u2019m in that age bracket but I\u2019m not scared of change). There\u2019s people pulling the script apart, saying x or y wouldn\u2019t happen in a TV studio. WTF are these people on? Alan shot dead a guest in Knowing Me Knowing You and carried on broadcasting \u2013 it\u2019s never been about recreating a real-life scenario. It\u2019s comedy not a documentary.</p> <p>Then you have the people moaning about how Coogan is playing the character all wrong. His era has gone. He was briefly a big cheese with his own show, he was still deluded when he was at the hotel. He now realises he\u2019s well out of it but he has a chance. Of course he\u2019s not going to wear a big-shouldered green blazer and have his hair parted with glue like before. Times have also changed.</p> <p>It was a brilliant first programme and it was great it didn\u2019t copy any of the previous formats. Lynn had some brilliant lines and it\u2019s hilarious when her jealousy shows through. I look forward to more. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126285986\">barrycalms</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bb6fca686fc630c391ca3ab0a2774c71fe39c03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bb6fca686fc630c391ca3ab0a2774c71fe39c03/447_0_3053_1833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This Time With Alan Partridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One to skip next week? ... This Time With Alan Partridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Seymour/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Hollow and vacant\u2019</h2> <p>Not a five-star show. It fails to have the wonderful set pieces and guests that Knowing Me Knowing You had. The segments of presenter chat felt hollow and vacant. The dodgy technology errors like the failing Twitter feeds etc felt dated and tedious. I got the impression Steve Coogan thinks this is funnier than it is. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126282927\">tjhvaliants</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t laugh once, which is rather spectacular\u2019</h2> <p>I thought Knowing Me Knowing You was almost always hilarious. I\u2019m Alan Partridge is probably one of my favourite sitcoms of all time. But this was barely one star, at best.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t laugh once, which is rather spectacular. Not even a slight smile. There was no bite or edge to the comedy; there wasn\u2019t much comedy at all. The jokes were very safe. It seemed to steer away from all controversy and danger. Especially when you compare it to similar parody stuff like Brass Eye and Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe (and others), it just wasn\u2019t in the least bit funny.</p> <p>I\u2019m really not sure what it was going for. I\u2019d rather have simply watched The One Show (and I really don\u2019t like The One Show). Was the whole thing about how Steve Coogan is even more desperate for the pay cheque than Alan is? I wouldn\u2019t have thought so. Definitely one to skip next week. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283441\">pretentiouspenguin</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Thank God it\u2019s not Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys\u2019</h2> <p>I imagine this\u2019ll grow nicely, especially the likely ever more tense and resentful relationship he\u2019ll have with the co-presenter. It\u2019ll be interesting to see where they let Alan completely lose the plot (for he must), or where his ego runs amok prior to his fall. He\u2019ll no doubt get more desperate to cling on to his return. I can see an attempt to sabotage the original host\u2019s return being somehow revealed. Maybe not vintage Alan quite yet, but I think it sets it up nicely for a gradual ratcheting up towards his inevitable self-combustion. And thank God it\u2019s not Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys, of course. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126289844\">RicardoRed99</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018Good to have some genuine talent back at the BBC\u2019</h2> <p>One of the most remarkable things to witness is Steve Coogan\u2019s complete capture of Alan; how he inhabits every nervous tic, desperate look or awkward move. He\u2019s always been a very physical performer, as well as having exquisite comic timing and a real command of vocal delivery. The brief demonstration of how to go to the toilet on a train without using your hands was great. Right up there with his running up the hill in the Kate Bush medley, or working out how he can use two mini soaps in the shower. Good to have some genuine talent back at the BBC. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126284319\">dylan37</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018The opening 15 minutes were some of the weakest\u2019</h2> <p>Started a little bit slowly for me; but really found its feet after Tim Key\u2019s interactive screen struggle. No-hands hygiene and the hacktivist were solid, and hopefully it can build from that now it\u2019s all established. Not sure it warrants the five star review, mind. I\u2019ve very recently gone through the entire Partridge backlog and the opening 15 minutes were some of the weakest. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283275\">CaldersInBrum</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018I think it\u2019s over for Alan\u2019</h2> <p>It didn\u2019t work for me. He was just <em>too</em> out of step with current TV values. I don\u2019t see how he could have got past a rehearsal. It would have been more convincing if he could have learned just a little bit more of how to survive in 2019. He and Lynn seemed to have stepped out of a time machine without doing any research whatsoever. Hope it improves, but if not, I think it\u2019s over for Alan. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/126283734\">Quackersyard</a></strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/25/this-time-with-alan-partridge-review-an-excruciating-white-knuckle-ride\">Follow the discussion and add your contribution</a></p></li> </ul>",

The main problem is that old Partridge was surreal thanks to Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham, and the directing style matches the tone. The new stuff is too clean and realistic in its presentation, so when something unrealistic happens it just feels awkward and out of place. Brained \u2018It was a brilliant first programme. I look forward to more\u2019 The original Partridge fans are in their 40s and 50s now and, like most old people, they find change difficult (I\u2019m in that age bracket but I\u2019m not scared of change). There\u2019s people pulling the script apart, saying x or y wouldn\u2019t happen in a TV studio. WTF are these people on? Alan shot dead a guest in Knowing Me Knowing You and carried on broadcasting \u2013 it\u2019s never been about recreating a real-life scenario. It\u2019s comedy not a documentary. Then you have the people moaning about how Coogan is playing the character all wrong. His era has gone. He was briefly a big cheese with his own show, he was still deluded when he was at the hotel. He now realises he\u2019s well out of it but he has a chance. Of course he\u2019s not going to wear a big-shouldered green blazer and have his hair parted with glue like before. Times have also changed. It was a brilliant first programme and it was great it didn\u2019t copy any of the previous formats. Lynn had some brilliant lines and it\u2019s hilarious when her jealousy shows through. I look forward to more. barrycalms \u2018Hollow and vacant\u2019 Not a five-star show. It fails to have the wonderful set pieces and guests that Knowing Me Knowing You had. The segments of presenter chat felt hollow and vacant. The dodgy technology errors like the failing Twitter feeds etc felt dated and tedious. I got the impression Steve Coogan thinks this is funnier than it is. tjhvaliants \u2018I didn\u2019t laugh once, which is rather spectacular\u2019 I thought Knowing Me Knowing You was almost always hilarious. I\u2019m Alan Partridge is probably one of my favourite sitcoms of all time. But this was barely one star, at best. I didn\u2019t laugh once, which is rather spectacular. Not even a slight smile. There was no bite or edge to the comedy; there wasn\u2019t much comedy at all. The jokes were very safe. It seemed to steer away from all controversy and danger. Especially when you compare it to similar parody stuff like Brass Eye and Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe (and others), it just wasn\u2019t in the least bit funny. I\u2019m really not sure what it was going for. I\u2019d rather have simply watched The One Show (and I really don\u2019t like The One Show). Was the whole thing about how Steve Coogan is even more desperate for the pay cheque than Alan is? I wouldn\u2019t have thought so. Definitely one to skip next week. pretentiouspenguin \u2018Thank God it\u2019s not Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys\u2019 I imagine this\u2019ll grow nicely, especially the likely ever more tense and resentful relationship he\u2019ll have with the co-presenter. It\u2019ll be interesting to see where they let Alan completely lose the plot (for he must), or where his ego runs amok prior to his fall. He\u2019ll no doubt get more desperate to cling on to his return. I can see an attempt to sabotage the original host\u2019s return being somehow revealed. Maybe not vintage Alan quite yet, but I think it sets it up nicely for a gradual ratcheting up towards his inevitable self-combustion. And thank God it\u2019s not Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys, of course. RicardoRed99 \u2018Good to have some genuine talent back at the BBC\u2019 One of the most remarkable things to witness is Steve Coogan\u2019s complete capture of Alan; how he inhabits every nervous tic, desperate look or awkward move. He\u2019s always been a very physical performer, as well as having exquisite comic timing and a real command of vocal delivery. The brief demonstration of how to go to the toilet on a train without using your hands was great. Right up there with his running up the hill in the Kate Bush medley, or working out how he can use two mini soaps in the shower. Good to have some genuine talent back at the BBC. dylan37 \u2018The opening 15 minutes were some of the weakest\u2019 Started a little bit slowly for me; but really found its feet after Tim Key\u2019s interactive screen struggle. No-hands hygiene and the hacktivist were solid, and hopefully it can build from that now it\u2019s all established. Not sure it warrants the five star review, mind. I\u2019ve very recently gone through the entire Partridge backlog and the opening 15 minutes were some of the weakest. CaldersInBrum \u2018I think it\u2019s over for Alan\u2019 It didn\u2019t work for me. He was just too out of step with current TV values. I don\u2019t see how he could have got past a rehearsal. It would have been more convincing if he could have learned just a little bit more of how to survive in 2019. He and Lynn seemed to have stepped out of a time machine without doing any research whatsoever. Hope it improves, but if not, I think it\u2019s over for Alan.

      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit could result in failures of social care providers that may put vulnerable adults at risk and seriously affect councils and the NHS, according to a leaked civil service document. The official warnings are contained within a Department of Health and Social Care presentation passed to the Guardian that has been prepared for a meeting of its EU exit delivery board to be held on Tuesday. In a section marked \u201ckey risks\u201d, the document warns \u201cvulnerable adults\u201d could be \u201cplaced at risk due to the wider impacts of EU exit and/or when statutory adult services/social care services are not delivered\u201d. One of the specific risks cited in the official presentation is \u201cfood disruption\u201d, referring presumably to an inability to provide appropriate catering services in a no-deal scenario. Other key risks cited include: \u201cAdult social care provider failure.\u201d This could follow a sharp decline in profitability, workforce disruption because of uncertainty about the status of EU workers in the UK and/or \u201cdisruption to the supply of drugs\u201d. \u201cLocal authority failure.\u201d The document also warns failures of social care providers could in turn lead to \u201clocal authority failure\u201d because they would have to hand back contracts to councils, having a dramatic impact on their fees and costs. That could in turn lead to an inability on the part of councils \u201cto fulfil statutory duty to balance budgets\u201d, amounting to a warning that a collapse in the social care sector could have wide financial ramifications for local government. Impact on the NHS. The presentation says \u201cdisruption to adult social care is also likely to have knock-on effects on the NHS\u201d, including pressure on GP services, community healthcare and hospitals. There are more than 16,000 independent social care providers in the UK, with small and medium-sized providers accounting for 75% of the market. The presentation concludes: \u201cOur analysis of the adult social care provider sector is that it is already financially stretched and that cumulative impacts of a no-deal EU exit could lead to provider failures.\u201d Barbara Keeley, the shadow social care minister, said: \u201cThis is an extraordinary admission from the government that the catastrophic no-deal Brexit which this reckless prime minister is driving the country towards could endanger the lives of vulnerable people. \u201cThis irresponsible Tory government has bled the social care system dry over the last nine years through budget cuts, and this document shows that a calamitous no-deal Brexit could deliver a mortal blow to the system.\u201d In November the sector regulator, the Care Quality Commission, wrote to dozens of local authorities to warn them elderly people could be at risk if a large provider, Allied Healthcare, failed. In the end, Allied was acquired by Castle Rock Group. As a result, the Department of Health and Social Care held a contingency planning exercise on 19 February to test its response. Repeating the warnings, the document said that was because \u201cBrexit may cause multiple providers to fail simultaneously\u201d.

Vatican treasurer George Pell convicted on five charges George Pell, Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, was found guilty in December of five charges of child sexual abuse, in a verdict that was subject to a suppression order until this week and can now be reported. Pell was until recently the Vatican treasurer, the third most powerful cleric in Rome. His conviction for crimes committed during the 1990s, when he was archbishop of Melbourne, has thrown the church back into crisis just days after Pope Francis hosted a historic summit on clerical sexual abuse. The victims. One of the men abused by Pell pleaded for anonymity in a statement describing his \u201cshame, loneliness, depression and struggle\u201d. The father of another victim, who died of a heroin overdose, has said he will sue Pell and the church. Brutal and dogmatic. The Guardian\u2019s David Marr, author of a book about Pell and the clerical sexual abuse scandal, says the cardinal made his career by being tough on sex, while swerving longstanding allegations about his own conduct.

Of course it did. The transformation of every single actor who appeared in Vice was both amazing and total.

      "bodyText": "Sunday\u2019s Oscars had an awful lot going on. While some of the big events \u2013 such as Olivia Colman\u2019s speech, Green Book\u2019s contentious win and the Cooper/Gaga facerub \u2013 received the attention they deserved, a handful of smaller, bizarre moments got lost in the cracks. It is my opinion that these moments also deserve their time in the sun, which is why I am here to laud one such instance: the flaming multi-vehicular pileup that was Vice\u2019s Oscar win for best makeup and hairstyling. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say that Vice did not deserve to win an Oscar. Of course it did. The transformation of every single actor who appeared in Vice was both amazing and total. However, I cannot believe that anyone involved in the makeup and hairstyling on Vice realised this, because their acceptance speech was genuinely one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t prepared. It was as if they\u2019d been deliberately placed in an isolation chamber since birth and didn\u2019t even understand the concept of what an acceptance speech was. First, some context. The Oscars this year were surprisingly brisk, and nowhere was this more apparent than with the speeches. The speech that directly preceded Vice\u2019s \u2013 the best documentary win for Free Solo \u2013 was played off almost instantly. Perhaps this made Vice\u2019s hair and makeup team jumpy. Perhaps they were already jumpy. But, even if they were, it still doesn\u2019t fully explain what happened next. The winners \u2013 Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney \u2013 staggered on to the stage. Cannom immediately started thanking people, before he noticed his two female colleagues standing beside him. One of them, Biscoe, unfolded a sheet of A4 paper and held it landscape. Landscape, for crying out loud. Nobody writes landscape on a sheet of A4. The only people in history ever to use A4 landscape are kidnappers writing ransom notes, and even then I suspect it feels a bit weird for them. Biscoe pointed at part of the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d she told Cannom. \u201cRead that.\u201d Cannom non-committally stuttered a couple of words, before Biscoe barged in and just read it out herself. At this point, all bets were off. Dehaney \u2013 easily a foot shorter than her companions \u2013 kept trying to dive between them to say her piece, before chickening out and backing away. In the end, she had to crane in past Biscoe. Biscoe held out her sheet for Dehaney to read from, but in an act of pure spiteful rebellion, Dehaney revealed that she had brought her own acceptance speech, written on her own piece of paper. The three of them kept starting the same sentences at the same time, hitting an awkward bottleneck that more often than not had to resolve itself when Cannom backed out with a gracious \u201cGo ahead\u201d.

One of the principal donors to that field is Wall Street fund manager <a href=\"http://www.philanthropy.com/article/Billionaire-Stephen-Schwarzman/245651\">Stephen Schwarzman</a>, who at No 4 gave $350m to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for artificial intelligence studies.</p> <p>Still the focus of the latest list is likely to remain on Bezos, whose entry onto the charts comes after years of making no impression whatsoever.</p> <p>Bezos has previously said he intends to plough his entire fortune into his Texas-based space operation Blue Origin, explaining: \u201cWe have to go to space to save earth, and we kind of have to hurry.\u201d</p> <p>But with an impending divorce that could siphon off half of his fortune, the scale of that plan could be facing reductions.</p> <p>Bezos\u2019s $2bn gift may help to quell persistent grumblings about his slow philanthropic uptake. In 2017, Bezos responded and solicited ideas on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776\">Twitter</a> for long-term philanthropic causes, receiving over 49,000 comments.</p> <p>Bezos later said the responses, which trended to affordable housing, environmental protection and workers\u2019 rights, had been \u201cvery helpful and have already changed my thinking about how to approach this\u201d.</p> <p>Bezos\u2019 gift, which amounts to a 2% tax on his fortune, comes as Amazon corporate tax structure comes under increasing scrutiny. The company has been profitable only over the last two years and only - relative to revenue - to a marginal $11 billion last year, yet the company <strong><a href=\"https://itep.org/amazon-in-its-prime-doubles-profits-pays-0-in-federal-income-taxes/\">paid $0 in corporate income tax last year</a></strong>, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.</p> <p>Yet investors have been willing to pay for Amazon shares at an extreme multiple of earnings in the hope it will someday return higher earnings. That hope, and canny tax structuring, is the basis of Bezos\u2019 richest-man status and in part why his gift-giving \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 comes under persistent scrutiny.</p> <p>Bezos\u2019 charitable donation will also refocus attention on his personal tax status.<br><br>Last month historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/30/historian-berates-billionaires-at-davos-over-tax-avoidance\">Rutger Bregman made a speech</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos during which he accused wealthy participants at the meeting of avoiding higher taxes. Societies should not rely on the generosity of the rich, Bregman said, adding: \u201cPhilanthropy is not a substitute for democracy, or proper taxation, or a good welfare state.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man and one frequently tagged a cheapskate when it comes to giving away money, has emerged as a leading philanthropist. According to the latest Philanthropy 50 list, a ranking of America\u2019s top 50 donors compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Bezos actually made more charitable donations than anyone else in the US last year, including philanthropists with comparable fortunes such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates. Bezos, who holds Amazon stock valued at about $137bn, contributed a total of $2bn to good causes in 2018 through his Bezos Day One Fund, a philanthropic vehicle founded by his soon-to-be ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos. According to the foundation\u2019s website, the Bezos fund was established to support existing not-for-profits addressing homelessness and poverty, in addition to funding preschool education in low-income communities. While the Bezos gifts may still be far behind Gates\u2019 lifetime donations of about $45bn to global poverty alleviation and education, or Bloomberg\u2019s current $6bn in gifts, his surprise entry into the top 50 comes as overall giving among the group declined by half last year compared to 2017. According to the Chronicle\u2019s annual list the people who gave the most to charity contributed a total of more than $7.8bn last year, a steep drop from the $14.7bn a year earlier. In order of magnitude, the Bezos\u2019s $2bn came in easily ahead of Bloomberg, who gave $767m to the arts, education, the environment, health and other causes; and at No 3, Pierre and Pam Omidyar, whose fortune derives from eBay, who contributed $392m to not-for-profits that seek to promote democracy, citizen activism and other causes. The Omidyars handily beat out Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, who came in at No 7 with gifts totaling $213m to various causes. Other newcomers to the list include Craigslist founder Craig Newmark at No 11, who donated $144m, largely to not-for-profits that produce news and journalism. According to the publication, the 2018 list is notable for donations directed toward artificial intelligence or other tech advances. One of the principal donors to that field is Wall Street fund manager Stephen Schwarzman, who at No 4 gave $350m to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for artificial intelligence studies. Still the focus of the latest list is likely to remain on Bezos, whose entry onto the charts comes after years of making no impression whatsoever. Bezos has previously said he intends to plough his entire fortune into his Texas-based space operation Blue Origin, explaining: \u201cWe have to go to space to save earth, and we kind of have to hurry.\u201d But with an impending divorce that could siphon off half of his fortune, the scale of that plan could be facing reductions. Bezos\u2019s $2bn gift may help to quell persistent grumblings about his slow philanthropic uptake. In 2017, Bezos responded and solicited ideas on Twitter for long-term philanthropic causes, receiving over 49,000 comments. Bezos later said the responses, which trended to affordable housing, environmental protection and workers\u2019 rights, had been \u201cvery helpful and have already changed my thinking about how to approach this\u201d. Bezos\u2019 gift, which amounts to a 2% tax on his fortune, comes as Amazon corporate tax structure comes under increasing scrutiny. The company has been profitable only over the last two years and only - relative to revenue - to a marginal $11 billion last year, yet the company paid $0 in corporate income tax last year, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Yet investors have been willing to pay for Amazon shares at an extreme multiple of earnings in the hope it will someday return higher earnings. That hope, and canny tax structuring, is the basis of Bezos\u2019 richest-man status and in part why his gift-giving \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 comes under persistent scrutiny. Bezos\u2019 charitable donation will also refocus attention on his personal tax status. Last month historian Rutger Bregman made a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos during which he accused wealthy participants at the meeting of avoiding higher taxes. Societies should not rely on the generosity of the rich, Bregman said, adding: \u201cPhilanthropy is not a substitute for democracy, or proper taxation, or a good welfare state.\u201d",

Some money will also go to other faith-based, predominantly Christian, initiatives. In other words, money that was earmarked to help women stay healthy and make independent, informed choices about their own bodies will now be given to organizations that have a track record of <a href=\"https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cpc-report-2015.pdf\">lying to women</a> in order to constrain their choices.</p> <p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2018/06/26/supreme-court-gives-crisis-pregnancy-centers-license-lie/\">supreme court has already ruled</a> that crisis pregnancy centers are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-says-crisis-pregnancy-centers-do-not-have-to-tell-women-about-abortion-information/2018/06/26/d2b9f5c2-7943-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.a7a4f9fb4de1\">legally allowed to lie</a> to patients who come to them seeking medical care, a reality that is unlikely to change now that these groups are going to be entrusted with millions in additional federal funds. Money that was meant to help women will now be given to people who actively hurt and deceive them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2017/01/why-we-cannot-afford-undercut-title-x-national-family-planning-program\">The Guttmacher Institute</a> estimates that Title X funds prevented 822,000 unintended pregnancies in 2015 alone \u2013 which, according to their data, means that the program prevented about 278,000 abortions that year. This does not account for the illnesses and deaths that are prevented by the STD and cancer screenings that the program also pays for. You would think that anti-choice activists would be happy about this, claiming as they do that they are \u201cpro-life\u201d. But the push to remove Title X funding from Planned Parenthood has long been a loud and angry demand of the religious right. It is not the first time that the anti-choice movement\u2019s professed respect for \u201clife\u201d has been undermined by their actual choices and priorities. The anti-choice movement\u2019s actions only make sense if you understand them to be motivated not by a respect for \u201clife\u201d, but by a hatred of women.</p> <p>Women\u2019s rights groups are certain to challenge the new Title X rules in federal court. But if the fight is headed to the supreme court, it is likely that the Trump administration\u2019s move to inflict more suffering on women will be gleefully upheld by the misogynist conservative majority, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/10/kavanaugh-supreme-court-appointment-abortion-roe-v-wade-future\">multiply accused sexual assault perpetrator Brett Kavanaugh</a> and credibly accused sexual harasser Clarence Thomas.</p> <p>It bears emphasizing that it is unjust for women\u2019s freedoms to be determined overwhelmingly by people such as Trump, Kavanaugh, and Thomas, who have been open and frank about their personal capacities for sexist contempt. This state of affairs, in which women are asked to submit, again, to the authority of men who hate them, is an ongoing insult to women. It makes the notion of our equal protection under the law seem like a patronizing fiction.</p> <p>In 1975, the radical feminist Andrea Dworkin wrote: \u201cOur enemies \u2013 rapists and their defenders \u2013 not only go unpunished; they remain influential arbiters of morality; they have high and esteemed places in society; they are priests, lawyers, judges, lawmakers, politicians, doctors, artists, corporation executives, psychiatrists and teachers.\u201d They are also, at the moment, the president of the United States, and two associate justices of the US supreme court.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

In other words, money that was earmarked to help women stay healthy and make independent, informed choices about their own bodies will now be given to organizations that have a track record of lying to women in order to constrain their choices. In fact, the supreme court has already ruled that crisis pregnancy centers are legally allowed to lie to patients who come to them seeking medical care, a reality that is unlikely to change now that these groups are going to be entrusted with millions in additional federal funds. Money that was meant to help women will now be given to people who actively hurt and deceive them. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that Title X funds prevented 822,000 unintended pregnancies in 2015 alone \u2013 which, according to their data, means that the program prevented about 278,000 abortions that year. This does not account for the illnesses and deaths that are prevented by the STD and cancer screenings that the program also pays for. You would think that anti-choice activists would be happy about this, claiming as they do that they are \u201cpro-life\u201d. But the push to remove Title X funding from Planned Parenthood has long been a loud and angry demand of the religious right. It is not the first time that the anti-choice movement\u2019s professed respect for \u201clife\u201d has been undermined by their actual choices and priorities. The anti-choice movement\u2019s actions only make sense if you understand them to be motivated not by a respect for \u201clife\u201d, but by a hatred of women. Women\u2019s rights groups are certain to challenge the new Title X rules in federal court. But if the fight is headed to the supreme court, it is likely that the Trump administration\u2019s move to inflict more suffering on women will be gleefully upheld by the misogynist conservative majority, led by multiply accused sexual assault perpetrator Brett Kavanaugh and credibly accused sexual harasser Clarence Thomas. It bears emphasizing that it is unjust for women\u2019s freedoms to be determined overwhelmingly by people such as Trump, Kavanaugh, and Thomas, who have been open and frank about their personal capacities for sexist contempt. This state of affairs, in which women are asked to submit, again, to the authority of men who hate them, is an ongoing insult to women. It makes the notion of our equal protection under the law seem like a patronizing fiction. In 1975, the radical feminist Andrea Dworkin wrote: \u201cOur enemies \u2013 rapists and their defenders \u2013 not only go unpunished; they remain influential arbiters of morality; they have high and esteemed places in society; they are priests, lawyers, judges, lawmakers, politicians, doctors, artists, corporation executives, psychiatrists and teachers.\u201d They are also, at the moment, the president of the United States, and two associate justices of the US supreme court.

But Thistlecrack and Elegant Escape, on their given day, have a great chance in the race. To have three lovely staying chasers rated in the high 160s is everything you want. Five fences from the finish in the King George, you thought [Native River] was going to be pulled up, but then he stayed on really strongly and, if the race had been another couple of furlongs, he could have been right up with them at the finishing line. Elegant Escape is a younger horse and he is still improving with every start. His last run was his highest-rated performance. Thistlecrack ran well in the King George and got close to [the winner] Clan Des Obeaux. I think he has as much of a chance as anything else in the race. He is 11 years old, but he has been lightly raced in recent seasons.</p> \n<p><strong>Vision Des Flos</strong> (Champion Hurdle): He won the National Spirit Hurdle nicely at Fontwell [on Sunday]. He is a lovely horse and if he had not unseated his rider on his first chase start earlier this season, then I think we would have gone chasing for the rest of the year. We wouldn\u2019t be afraid to go for the Champion Hurdle with him [but] he is also entered in the Coral Cup, it\u2019s something we don\u2019t need to decide today.</p> \n<p><strong>Fox Norton</strong> (Champion Chase or Ryanair Chase): He\u2019s slipping under the radar a little bit. I thought he ran a lovely race at Ascot in the Ascot Chase. I think the Ryanair Chase is the plan at the moment.</p> \n<p><strong>West Approach &amp; Kilbricken Storm</strong> (Stayers\u2019 Hurdle): West Approach is a decent horse and has finished second to [Stayer\u2019s Hurdle favourite] Paisley Park the last twice. We will sit on the tail of Paisley Park this time around, if we could cover him up a bit then he would have a good chance. Kilbricken Storm is a bit of a forgotten horse. He was very good [working] with Elixir De Nutz, Master Debonair and Native River at Wincanton last week.

We could have another little away day, but we might leave him be as he looks very fit. His form stands up to anybody else\u2019s in the Supreme. </p> \n<p><strong>Lostintranslation</strong> (RSA Chase): He is just a lovely horse and he also has winning form round Cheltenham and the track will suit him. Whatever he does this year, I see him as a Gold Cup horse for next year.</p> \n<p><strong>Mister Malarky</strong> (RSA Chase or National Hunt Chase): He has been a revelation over fences and is rated 148 so he is good enough to run in any of the big novice chases at Cheltenham, including the RSA. </p> \n<p><strong>Master Debonair </strong>(Champion Bumper): He has won two of his three bumpers and did it well at Cheltenham last time. He has won on autumn ground at Cheltenham, but spring ground will be fine. He is not a big horse and has form in the bag \u2013 whether it is good enough is anyone\u2019s guess. Hopefully, we will aim for the Supreme with him next year, he\u2019s a good horse.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p><strong>Cuddles McGraw (2.30)</strong> has plenty to recommend him at around 7-2 in the novice handicap chase at Leicester. Fergal O\u2019Brien\u2019s chaser got off the mark over fences at the second attempt at Warwick last time and recorded a good time in the process.</p> \n<p><strong>All Is Good (3.30)</strong> travelled well for a long way when returning from a four-month break at Huntingdon last time before finishing less than four lengths behind the winner. He should show the benefit of that run when he lines up off the same mark, while <strong>It\u2019s All About Me (4.50)</strong> is another with an obvious chance on the card at Catterick Bridge.</p> \n<p>Martineo was back to his best at Wolverhampton last time out but whether he should be a 15-8 chance to follow up today is a different question and the veteran <strong>Lucky Lodge (6.00)</strong> looks overpriced at around 7-1 to register a seventh course success.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d20c3861-74d6-4706-b287-f1bfbe3412b3\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Leicester</b>&nbsp;<b>2.00</b> Northern Beau&nbsp;<b>2.30</b> Cuddles McGraw&nbsp;<b>3.00</b> The Last But One&nbsp;<b>3.30 </b>All Is Good&nbsp;<b>4.00</b> Midnight Mustang&nbsp;<b>4.30</b> Brave Jaq&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Ffos Las&nbsp;2.10</b> Urtheonethatiwant&nbsp;<b>2.40</b> Top And Drop&nbsp;<b>3.10</b> Baratineur&nbsp;<br><b>3.40</b> Khage&nbsp;<b>4.10</b> Gone Platinum&nbsp;<b>4.40 </b>King Roland&nbsp;<br><br><b>Catterick</b>&nbsp;<b>2.20</b> Trapper Peak&nbsp;<b>2.50</b> Dagian&nbsp;<b>3.20 </b>Louis' Vac Pouch&nbsp;<b>3.50</b> Shaman Du Berlais&nbsp;<b>4.20</b> Fifty Shades&nbsp;<b>4.50</b> It's All About Me (nb)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Wolverhampton</b>&nbsp;<b>5.00</b> Sharp Operator&nbsp;<b>5.30</b> Bay Of Naples&nbsp;<b>6.00</b> Lucky Lodge (nap)&nbsp;<b>6.30</b> Juanito Chico<b>&nbsp;7.00</b> Ulster&nbsp;<b>7.30</b> Vin D'Honneur&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

West Approach &amp; Kilbricken Storm (Stayers\u2019 Hurdle): West Approach is a decent horse and has finished second to [Stayer\u2019s Hurdle favourite] Paisley Park the last twice. We will sit on the tail of Paisley Park this time around, if we could cover him up a bit then he would have a good chance. Kilbricken Storm is a bit of a forgotten horse. He was very good [working] with Elixir De Nutz, Master Debonair and Native River at Wincanton last week. He finished right upsides them and was brilliant. Elixir Du Nutz (Supreme Novice Hurdle): He was absolutely brilliant in a gallop at Wincanton last week. We could have another little away day, but we might leave him be as he looks very fit. His form stands up to anybody else\u2019s in the Supreme. Lostintranslation (RSA Chase): He is just a lovely horse and he also has winning form round Cheltenham and the track will suit him. Whatever he does this year, I see him as a Gold Cup horse for next year. Mister Malarky (RSA Chase or National Hunt Chase): He has been a revelation over fences and is rated 148 so he is good enough to run in any of the big novice chases at Cheltenham, including the RSA. Master Debonair (Champion Bumper): He has won two of his three bumpers and did it well at Cheltenham last time. He has won on autumn ground at Cheltenham, but spring ground will be fine. He is not a big horse and has form in the bag \u2013 whether it is good enough is anyone\u2019s guess. Hopefully, we will aim for the Supreme with him next year, he\u2019s a good horse. Tuesday\u2019s best bets Cuddles McGraw (2.30) has plenty to recommend him at around 7-2 in the novice handicap chase at Leicester. Fergal O\u2019Brien\u2019s chaser got off the mark over fences at the second attempt at Warwick last time and recorded a good time in the process. All Is Good (3.30) travelled well for a long way when returning from a four-month break at Huntingdon last time before finishing less than four lengths behind the winner. He should show the benefit of that run when he lines up off the same mark, while It\u2019s All About Me (4.50) is another with an obvious chance on the card at Catterick Bridge. Martineo was back to his best at Wolverhampton last time out but whether he should be a 15-8 chance to follow up today is a different question and the veteran Lucky Lodge (6.00) looks overpriced at around 7-1 to register a seventh course success.",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has stated unequivocally that Labour will back a second EU referendum with remain on the ballot if Theresa May\u2019s deal gets through parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the shadow Brexit secretary also took a thinly veiled swipe at some in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office by urging the public to listen to elected MPs on the issue rather than advisers. The Labour leader finally threw his party\u2019s weight behind a second referendum on Monday night, but there remains doubt about the wording of the question that would be put to the public. Starmer insisted the party agreed on the gist of the wording. \u201cA public vote ought to be between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain \u2026 That deal should be subject to the lock of a public vote,\u201d he said. \u201cPrecisely what wording that is will obviously have to be decided by parliament, but that\u2019s the basic choice.\u201d On Monday, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Channel 4 News she and Corbyn would be campaigning to remain in the EU if there were a second vote. It was reported later that a source in Corbyn\u2019s office claimed Thornberry had \u201cmisspoke\u201d during the interview. She dismissed this as \u201cnonsense\u201d and was backed by Starmer on Tuesday. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who said what. What I do know is that you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.\u201d For the avoidance of doubt, Starmer added: \u201cI\u2019m telling you what was in the official briefing from my office and Jeremy\u2019s office to Labour MPs last night. So there is no question that it should be between a credible leave option and remain.\u201d Starmer said he would back remain in a second vote, but was more cautious than Thornberry about Corbyn\u2019s stance. \u201cI would vote for remain. Jeremy will obviously speak for himself, but he voted remain last time and he like me has attacked the prime minister\u2019s deal uphill and down dale,\u201d he said. Starmer said Labour could not guarantee backing a second referendum until the party had tried to win support for its own soft Brexit alternative to May\u2019s deal. \u201cWe will put that proposition up for a vote on a customs union and single market alignment this week. If it doesn\u2019t go through, we the Labour party will either put down ourselves or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to protect us against what will be a damaging Tory Brexit, or even worse, no deal,\u201d he said. The Labour MP John Mann warned Corbyn risked being ditched by voters over the party\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d shift to support a second referendum. \u201cVoters won\u2019t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn\u2019t end very well for him on tuition fees,\u201d he told Today. \u201cOur manifesto was unambiguous \u2013 we would accept the result of the referendum.

In Brazil, one of the biggest emerging economies, recycling is close to non-existent: less than 1% of Brazil\u2019s concrete waste is recycled, according to the Brazilian Association for the Recycling of Construction Waste (Abrecon).

It's payback time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In most developed countries, including much of western Europe, the majority of demolished concrete is put to some use \u2013 but mostly to make low-value products like filling for roads. This process is known as \u201cdowncycling\u201d. Many researchers and engineers are searching for ways to \u201cupcycle\u201d concrete waste instead, turning old building products into new, first-rate structures and avoiding the need for new or \u201cvirgin\u201d concrete.</p> \n<p>Recycled concrete can be just as high quality as virgin aggregates at a lower cost \u2013 but the barriers are numerous.</p> \n<h2>Zap it with lightning: how exactly do you recycle concrete?</h2> \n<p>First there is the technical challenge of separating concrete into its constituent parts. The chief hurdle is to get the aggregate away from other contaminants, including the \u201crebar\u201d \u2013 the bars of reinforced steel that almost all concrete now contains.</p> \n<p>One lab in Germany has developed a bizarre but very effective solution: <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/design/2012/10/recycling-innovation-day-blasting-concrete-lightning/3553/\">zap concrete with lightning</a> while it\u2019s immersed in water.</p> \n<p> Lightning only tends to travel through water and air.

      "bodyText": "At the Shenzhen dump, huge shards of dusty concrete lie in imposing piles. Once the very foundation of this Chinese city, these blocks now seem grotesque in their magnitude, and unsettling in their utter uselessness. Jumbled up with the other relics of modern construction \u2013 bricks, wood and steel \u2013 and dotted with plastic bags and bottles, it could take centuries, even millennia, for Shenzhen\u2019s discarded concrete to disintegrate back into sand. China produces more construction waste than any other country - around 2 billion tonnes per year (pdf), or around 4kg per person per day. Two million tonnes of this is concrete. In Shenzhen, which has grown from a town with 30,000 residents to a megacity with 11 million in just 35 years, a full 84% of that construction waste is unceremoniously dumped. It doesn\u2019t even all make its way to official landfills, which don\u2019t have the capacity to handle it, so almost half is disposed in unlicensed sites, or illegally tipped. As our world urbanises at a pace never before seen, with buildings rising and falling in as little as 30 years, the crumbled debris of our cities often ends up in landfill. Around 10bn tonnes (pdf) of concrete are manufactured each year: a staggering one cubic metre for every person on Earth. Over the next 40 years the world is expected to build 230 billion square metres in new construction, adding the equivalent of Paris to the planet every single week. Much of that new construction means knocking down old structures, and gradually engineers and policymakers are waking up to a question: what should we do with our concrete when we\u2019re finished with it? The problem is particularly thorny in the developing world, where there are often limited systems in place to join the dots between demolition and new building projects. In Brazil, one of the biggest emerging economies, recycling is close to non-existent: less than 1% of Brazil\u2019s concrete waste is recycled, according to the Brazilian Association for the Recycling of Construction Waste (Abrecon). About half of Brazilian municipalities send their demolition waste directly to landfills. Many just dump it illegally. \u201cIf [construction] rubbish isn\u2019t collected it has serious ramifications for the public\u2019s health,\u201d said Levi Torres, coordinator of Abrecon. \u201cMany have been taken to hospital because of diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis caused by untreated, dumped rubble.\u201d Landfill isn\u2019t the only problem. There is a glaring need for us to drastically limit the production of new concrete and cement, which generates huge amounts of CO2, by recycling components we already have. The extent to which we are recycling varies wildly between different countries in the world, from around 10% in China to 90% in Japan. In most developed countries, including much of western Europe, the majority of demolished concrete is put to some use \u2013 but mostly to make low-value products like filling for roads. This process is known as \u201cdowncycling\u201d. Many researchers and engineers are searching for ways to \u201cupcycle\u201d concrete waste instead, turning old building products into new, first-rate structures and avoiding the need for new or \u201cvirgin\u201d concrete. Recycled concrete can be just as high quality as virgin aggregates at a lower cost \u2013 but the barriers are numerous. Zap it with lightning: how exactly do you recycle concrete? First there is the technical challenge of separating concrete into its constituent parts. The chief hurdle is to get the aggregate away from other contaminants, including the \u201crebar\u201d \u2013 the bars of reinforced steel that almost all concrete now contains. One lab in Germany has developed a bizarre but very effective solution: zap concrete with lightning while it\u2019s immersed in water. Lightning only tends to travel through water and air. It doesn\u2019t like the density of solid objects. However, in 2012, researchers at the Concrete Technology Group in Holzkirchen, Germany, using a high voltage fragmentation system designed and manufactured by the Swiss company SelFrag (SelectiveFragmentation), found that extremely short durations of lightning, 500 nanoseconds, can shoot through water and directly into a solid mass. On striking concrete, the lightning actually travels between the different components \u2013 aggregate, cement, steel \u2013 and separates them. Other researchers have tried to be more holistic: demolishing with building in mind and building with demolition in mind. The key problem here is that, once poured, it\u2019s more or less impossible to know what\u2019s inside concrete. Unlike steel, which is stamped and can therefore be traced back to its factory of origin to determine the exact makeup of the alloy, concrete is a grey box. It has been proposed that each piece of concrete in a building have its own \u201cmaterial passport\u201d \u2013 so at the time of demolition, the passport can be used to find the concrete (or, indeed, other materials) a new home. \u201cOne of the biggest obstacles to a circular economy is that we\u2019re not building things for multiple life cycles,\u201d said Eva Gladek, founder and CEO of the NGO Metabolic. \u201cWe need to start designing buildings for disassembly.\u201d Metabolic has been working with municipalities to instigate \u201ccircular economies\u201d, by decreasing waste and promoting reuse.

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of 2018 Vero Boquete, Spain\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer who has won a Champions League and domestic titles in three countries, received \u201cthe biggest prize\u201d of her career. In her home city of Santiago de Compostela \u2013 in Galicia in the north-west of Spain and famous for being the climax of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route \u2013 the main stadium was renamed the Estadio Vero Boquete de San L\u00e1zaro. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to describe and explain what I feel because it\u2019s a historic emblematic stadium \u2013 it was a first division stadium,\u201d says Boquete, of the ground she spent almost every weekend at as a child. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest show of love from my city, from my people \u2013 they are my neighbours. But it\u2019s not about my name, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s name in a main stadium, in football; that is just fantastic.\u201d What is also remarkable is that where most are long retired before tributes of this magnitude are paid, the 31-year-old Boquete is still playing at the top level. The decorated Galician could legitimately be described as Spain\u2019s First Lady of football. Having spent a not wholly satisfying year in China with Beijing BG Phoenix, she is preparing for a return to arguably the world\u2019s best league, the NWSL, with Utah Royals. There she will be reunited with players such as Christen Press, Becca Moros, Amy Rodriguez and others she has lined up alongside during spells across Europe and the US which included time at Sweden\u2019s Tyres\u00f6 FF, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. By her moved to Asia it could have been considered that her career was on the wane but Utah Royals\u2019 manager, Laura Harvey, thought otherwise and the opportunity to work with the former Birmingham and Arsenal manager was a big pull. \u201cI lost the [play-off] final a few years ago, so there was something inside of me that made me want to come back and fight for the title again,\u201d Boquete says. \u201cAnother reason was Laura Harvey. I\u2019ve followed her career for many years and I was really interested in working with her. \u201cShe was really specific about why she wanted me there and what she expected from me. That, for a player, is really important.\u201d Boquete, far from feeling past her peak, believes she can get better. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every country I\u2019ve played in, I\u2019m a better player for playing in different leagues with different styles. Now, in the US, I just want to put everything together and take my game to another level. \u201cI want to keep going until my body says it\u2019s over. At the moment I feel great, I think I\u2019m in one of the best moments of my career in how I feel and also how I understand the game. That experience helps you a lot.\u201d She may be an idol in her region, and country but growing up playing football wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI started to play when I started to walk,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dad was a coach and my brother played so I just wanted to do the same. I was all the time with them, playing at home, in the street. \u201cThen, when I was five or six years old, I joined my first team.

Beating Scotland will set up a massive showdown with Ireland, among their prospective World Cup semi-final opponents in Yokohama in October. Collect a grand slam and, regardless of history, no one will be rushing to play them in Japan.</p> <p>It is in this tricky area of developing unflinching self-belief that Gatland is so good. No one would say the British and Irish Lions trained harder than any other side has ever done in New Zealand in 2017 but they still emerged with a drawn series with minimal pre-tour preparation. The knack of getting the right players \u2013 selection also matters hugely \u2013 into the right state of mind to go the extra mile for the people around them is the trademark of all good coaches, as is ensuring they peak in the games that really count.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3deae6d852e5358e019b0cfd5f1bb1ba9660ba69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deae6d852e5358e019b0cfd5f1bb1ba9660ba69/0_204_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales could meet Ireland in the World Cup semi-finals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales could meet Ireland in the World Cup semi-finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England, as Gatland has already observed, have not always found this straightforward. For an assortment of reasons \u2013 and even with the benefit of home advantage in 2015 \u2013 England have flattered to deceive in the past two, if not three, World Cups. They may have reached the final in 2007 but only after losing so heavily to South Africa in the pool stages some players had their bags packed on the morning of their quarter-final against Australia in Marseille in expectation of heading home.</p> <p>No one is saying England are scared of big occasions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">as Dublin demonstrated.</a> It is fair to say, though, that they have a tendency to start Six Nations tournaments better than they finish them. Of their last nine final-round championship games they have lost five. Some teams, most notably France at World Cups, improve the longer they spend together in camp. England, for some reason, have tended to do the opposite.</p> <p>It might just be Eddie Jones\u2019s biggest challenge over the next seven months: allowing his players sufficient time off to refresh their minds rather than squeezing them endlessly through the sausage machine. The moral of the story? Wales may be leading the battle for Six Nations supremacy but they have not yet won the war.</p> <h2>Scrum waste of time</h2> <p>Eddie Jones reckons rugby is growing more like American football in terms of the number and length of breaks in play. A degree of anticipation is a key part of the matchday experience but the day must be fast approaching when a limit is imposed on how much time scrums are allowed to soak up. There was a good example in Lyon\u2019s Top 14 fixture against Clermont when a scrum was awarded late in the game with Lyon narrowly leading. It took a painfully slow two minutes, after an inevitable reset, for the ball to emerge, by which stage there were only a few mundane seconds remaining. Stopping the clock until the ball is out \u2013 particularly towards the end of matches \u2013 would give spectators rather better value for money.</p> <h2>One to watch</h2> <p>Never mind the Six Nations, these are critical days in the Guinness Premiership relegation dogfight. Worcester\u2019s win over Leicester on Sunday has left Newcastle nine points adrift at the foot of the table; should the Falcons lose at home to the Warriors this Sunday and Bristol beat Gloucester at Ashton Gate the gap will extend into double figures. Newcastle may have finished fourth last season but their play-off semi-final against Exeter now feels a long time ago.</p>",

Collect a grand slam and, regardless of history, no one will be rushing to play them in Japan. It is in this tricky area of developing unflinching self-belief that Gatland is so good. No one would say the British and Irish Lions trained harder than any other side has ever done in New Zealand in 2017 but they still emerged with a drawn series with minimal pre-tour preparation. The knack of getting the right players \u2013 selection also matters hugely \u2013 into the right state of mind to go the extra mile for the people around them is the trademark of all good coaches, as is ensuring they peak in the games that really count. England, as Gatland has already observed, have not always found this straightforward. For an assortment of reasons \u2013 and even with the benefit of home advantage in 2015 \u2013 England have flattered to deceive in the past two, if not three, World Cups. They may have reached the final in 2007 but only after losing so heavily to South Africa in the pool stages some players had their bags packed on the morning of their quarter-final against Australia in Marseille in expectation of heading home. No one is saying England are scared of big occasions, as Dublin demonstrated. It is fair to say, though, that they have a tendency to start Six Nations tournaments better than they finish them. Of their last nine final-round championship games they have lost five. Some teams, most notably France at World Cups, improve the longer they spend together in camp. England, for some reason, have tended to do the opposite. It might just be Eddie Jones\u2019s biggest challenge over the next seven months: allowing his players sufficient time off to refresh their minds rather than squeezing them endlessly through the sausage machine. The moral of the story? Wales may be leading the battle for Six Nations supremacy but they have not yet won the war. Scrum waste of time Eddie Jones reckons rugby is growing more like American football in terms of the number and length of breaks in play. A degree of anticipation is a key part of the matchday experience but the day must be fast approaching when a limit is imposed on how much time scrums are allowed to soak up. There was a good example in Lyon\u2019s Top 14 fixture against Clermont when a scrum was awarded late in the game with Lyon narrowly leading. It took a painfully slow two minutes, after an inevitable reset, for the ball to emerge, by which stage there were only a few mundane seconds remaining. Stopping the clock until the ball is out \u2013 particularly towards the end of matches \u2013 would give spectators rather better value for money. One to watch Never mind the Six Nations, these are critical days in the Guinness Premiership relegation dogfight. Worcester\u2019s win over Leicester on Sunday has left Newcastle nine points adrift at the foot of the table; should the Falcons lose at home to the Warriors this Sunday and Bristol beat Gloucester at Ashton Gate the gap will extend into double figures. Newcastle may have finished fourth last season but their play-off semi-final against Exeter now feels a long time ago.",

When a GP sees a patient who could have gender dysphoria, they are referred to a GIC for diagnosis and to potentially begin the process of medical transitioning. While individuals should be seen within 18 weeks of referral, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42774750\">waiting lists for GICs</a> can be of more than two years, with little or no support provided in the interval. The result is a limbo, with one person describing the prospect of surgery as so distant, and communication so lacking, that the situation was \u201csoul-destroying\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has found that the impact of these delays is far reaching, creating tensions between doctors and patients that have led to an erosion of trust in the healthcare system among many trans people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/10/transgender-clinic-waiting-times-patient-numbers-soar-gender-identity-services\">Gender identity clinic services under strain as referral rates soar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A key issue is that delays in being seen at a GIC often puts a medical transition on hold \u2013 which is something trans men and women said jeopardises their physical and mental health.</p> <p>Currently GPs are given information on how to prescribe hormones and interpret the necessary blood tests by specialists at a GIC.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare---advice-based-on-gmc-guidance#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions\">The General Medical Council says</a> \u201cbridging\u201d hormone treatment can be prescribed by GPs before a patient attends a GIC, but only if the individual is suicidal or at risk of self-harming, and is already taking medication bought online or elsewhere. The GP must also take advice from a gender specialist and prescribe the lowest acceptable dose. However many GPs say they do not have the experience to prescribe hormones before a patient has been seen by a GIC, while getting the required advice from gender specialists to help with bridging hormones takes a long time as services are over capacity.</p> <p>Josie King\u2019s daughter, Rose, went to her doctor to talk about being transgender at 18 but was refused bridging treatment, despite King embarking on a letter-writing mission to try to change their minds.</p> <p>\u201cShe was losing her hair \u2013 a receding hairline \u2013 and you can imagine for somebody in her position, that was absolutely devastating. So she needed the testosterone blockers really as quickly as possible to halt that,\u201d said King, adding that Rose\u2019s mental health was fluctuating \u2013 something King believes hormone treatment could have helped stabilise.</p> <p>King said her daughter had to turn to sourcing hormones through an online service. However after a lengthy battle, their new GP surgery has agreed to take over prescribing the hormones and monitoring Rose\u2019s blood tests.</p> <p>Kamilla Kamaruddin, a GP who is herself a trans woman, said prescribing and monitoring such medications for trans patients is not simple.</p> <p>\u201cIt is how GPs work, not just about transgender [issues] but other things. If they are not happy to initiate prescribing, then they refer on to the hospitals,\u201d Kamaruddin said, adding that monitoring hormone levels in the blood can be tricky. \u201cThe GPs don\u2019t know what to do if the results are abnormal or too high,\u201d she said, adding GPs are not trained to provide the psychological support that patients also need.</p> <p>Another GP with trans patients, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \u201cIf I prescribe as a GP and something goes wrong, that\u2019s all on my shoulders and could be a career-ending decision for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it sounds drastic, and it\u2019s admittedly unlikely, but it\u2019s certainly possible to harm someone with hormone treatment if you\u2019re not experienced with the condition you\u2019re treating.\u201d</p> <p>But some GPs have felt confident prescribing hormones. One of these is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/11/transgender-nhs-doctor-prescribing-sex-hormones-children-uk\">Dr Helen Webberley</a>, who set up a website called GenderGP, through which trans people could access doctors and receive hormone prescriptions. \u201cWhat these patients need is very, very simple,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that while there are no UK guidelines for prescribing, the University of California San Francisco has produced a <a href=\"http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/pdf/Transgender-PGACG-6-17-16.pdf\">\u201cbeautiful\u201d set</a> that she used. However Webberley has become a controversial figure: she was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/03/gp-convicted-running-illegal-transgender-clinic-children/\">convicted in 2018</a> of operating the company Online GP Services Ltd without the necessary registration, receiving a bill for fines and costs totalling more than \u00a325,000, and she is under investigation by the General Medical Council.

      "bodyText": "Trans men and women are being left humiliated and desperate after seeking care from their GP, according to a Guardian investigation that has shed light on serious flaws in how the NHS treats transgender patients. Hundreds of transgender people responded to a request from the Guardian to describe their experience of navigating the NHS, with the most common complaints coming from patients who felt their GP did not understand gender dysphoria, were not adequately trained to deal with their needs, and erroneously referred patients to mental health services. Serious systemic issues across the NHS were also revealed, including the confusion and delay in being seen at a gender identity clinic. When a GP sees a patient who could have gender dysphoria, they are referred to a GIC for diagnosis and to potentially begin the process of medical transitioning. While individuals should be seen within 18 weeks of referral, waiting lists for GICs can be of more than two years, with little or no support provided in the interval. The result is a limbo, with one person describing the prospect of surgery as so distant, and communication so lacking, that the situation was \u201csoul-destroying\u201d. The Guardian has found that the impact of these delays is far reaching, creating tensions between doctors and patients that have led to an erosion of trust in the healthcare system among many trans people. A key issue is that delays in being seen at a GIC often puts a medical transition on hold \u2013 which is something trans men and women said jeopardises their physical and mental health. Currently GPs are given information on how to prescribe hormones and interpret the necessary blood tests by specialists at a GIC. The General Medical Council says \u201cbridging\u201d hormone treatment can be prescribed by GPs before a patient attends a GIC, but only if the individual is suicidal or at risk of self-harming, and is already taking medication bought online or elsewhere. The GP must also take advice from a gender specialist and prescribe the lowest acceptable dose. However many GPs say they do not have the experience to prescribe hormones before a patient has been seen by a GIC, while getting the required advice from gender specialists to help with bridging hormones takes a long time as services are over capacity. Josie King\u2019s daughter, Rose, went to her doctor to talk about being transgender at 18 but was refused bridging treatment, despite King embarking on a letter-writing mission to try to change their minds. \u201cShe was losing her hair \u2013 a receding hairline \u2013 and you can imagine for somebody in her position, that was absolutely devastating. So she needed the testosterone blockers really as quickly as possible to halt that,\u201d said King, adding that Rose\u2019s mental health was fluctuating \u2013 something King believes hormone treatment could have helped stabilise. King said her daughter had to turn to sourcing hormones through an online service. However after a lengthy battle, their new GP surgery has agreed to take over prescribing the hormones and monitoring Rose\u2019s blood tests. Kamilla Kamaruddin, a GP who is herself a trans woman, said prescribing and monitoring such medications for trans patients is not simple. \u201cIt is how GPs work, not just about transgender [issues] but other things. If they are not happy to initiate prescribing, then they refer on to the hospitals,\u201d Kamaruddin said, adding that monitoring hormone levels in the blood can be tricky. \u201cThe GPs don\u2019t know what to do if the results are abnormal or too high,\u201d she said, adding GPs are not trained to provide the psychological support that patients also need. Another GP with trans patients, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \u201cIf I prescribe as a GP and something goes wrong, that\u2019s all on my shoulders and could be a career-ending decision for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it sounds drastic, and it\u2019s admittedly unlikely, but it\u2019s certainly possible to harm someone with hormone treatment if you\u2019re not experienced with the condition you\u2019re treating.\u201d But some GPs have felt confident prescribing hormones. One of these is Dr Helen Webberley, who set up a website called GenderGP, through which trans people could access doctors and receive hormone prescriptions. \u201cWhat these patients need is very, very simple,\u201d she told the Guardian, adding that while there are no UK guidelines for prescribing, the University of California San Francisco has produced a \u201cbeautiful\u201d set that she used. However Webberley has become a controversial figure: she was convicted in 2018 of operating the company Online GP Services Ltd without the necessary registration, receiving a bill for fines and costs totalling more than \u00a325,000, and she is under investigation by the General Medical Council. But Webberley remains adamant that she and her husband, also a doctor, are in the right. \u201cThey haven\u2019t beaten me yet. They haven\u2019t beaten us yet,\u201d she said. Beyond bridging hormones, current guidance from the General Medical Council makes it clear that once a patient has a recommendation for a hormone prescription from a GIC, doctors should take over. However even with this in place doctors can be anxious to issue hormones if there is no \u201cshared care agreement\u201d \u2013 a formal plan which clearly sets out the responsibilities of the GIC and the GP, allows specialists to get involved if challenges emerge, and reduces costs to GP surgeries. Eric, 36, said setting up his hormone prescriptions with a new GP was invariably problematic. \u201cIt just seems to instil a sense of absolute blind panic in them and they insist that I am referred back to the gender identity clinic,\u201d he said, adding that one doctor said she was not going to prescribe his hormones without him returning to a GIC \u2013 which would have meant joining the waiting lists again. \u201cShe basically held my medication hostage, hormones I have been on since I was 21-22,\u201d he said, adding the doctor eventually relented when experts at the GIC confirmed he required hormones and that he did not need to be seen by them.

It\u2019s a homage to Ann Radcliffe, the 18th-century gothic novelist who wrote The Mysteries of Udolpho. Tanning\u2019s painting depicts a castle wall and a flying buttress. A ghost walks past the castle with fire for a head. Her disembodied hair seems to have rematerialised in an archway. Tanning was not the first surrealist to declare her love of gothic novels. In his Manifesto of Surrealism published in 1924, the movement\u2019s founder Andr\u00e9 Breton praises the \u201cunforgettable intensity\u201d of Matthew Lewis\u2019s 1796 novel The Monk. Yet there\u2019s a difference. Breton exhibited the ingrained prejudices of the male surrealists, men of their time, when he drooled that The Monk\u2019s heroine Mathilda is \u201cless a character than a continual temptation\u201d. Tanning, as if to deliberately overturn this surrealist cult of great male perverts of the past resurrects Radcliffe, whose novels closely identified with the feelings and perceptions of women.</p> <p>Tanning\u2019s art is full of haunted houses and sinister, inexplicable happenings that owe as much to gothic novels as they do to Breton or Ernst. In her 1943 painting <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tanning-eine-kleine-nachtmusik-t07346\">Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</a>, a door in a vast and echoing hotel is opening to reveal an unholy glow inside: the other rooms on the floor are grimly shut while two girls sleepwalk on the landing. One has hair flowing upward as if she\u2019s underwater. A giant sunflower has materialised. What horror lurks in the roomful of light? A premonition of the A-bomb? A furnace for corpses? It\u2019s 1943.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"076f3727435f841c254df9a5cfca380b60ebbf38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/076f3727435f841c254df9a5cfca380b60ebbf38/0_481_3752_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothea Tanning (1910 \u2013 2012) Verbe 1966-1970 Flannel, wool, tweed, cardboard, polyfill, forged steel, and wooden jigsaw puzzle pieces from Johannes Vermeer\u2019s \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Studio\u201d (ca.1665/66) 890 x 1160 mm Yale University Art Gallery, Janet and Simeon Braguin Fund\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothea Tanning\u2019s Verbe (1966-1970).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DACS, 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her 1950-2 painting <a href=\"https://www.dorotheatanning.org/life-and-work/view/71/\">The Guest Room</a>, a naked girl stands in an attitude of frozen alienation while a young woman lies in bed hugging a male doll. It\u2019s a very strange set-up, but what\u2019s most troubling is a short fat figure wearing cowboy boots and a blue head-covering that seems to conceal facial deformities or inhuman tubes under its folds.</p> <p>A bit David Lynch, right? But decades ahead of the surrealist film-maker. Tanning spent much of her life in France, but this exhibition reveals her as a great American artist. Her feel for gothic is reminiscent of the stories of her contemporary US writers Carson McCullers and Shirley Jackson. These are paintings of nightmares remembered in tantalising fragments.</p> <p>Then, in 1970, on that awful night in room 202 of the H\u00f4tel du Pavot, those nightmares crawl off the canvas into our own, three-dimensional world. Her monsters swarm the walls and bulge out of the upholstery. It made perfect sense for Tanning to make the leap from painting to this pioneering masterpiece of installation art. The staircases and doorways, cupboards and ruins that populate her early paintings find claustrophobia and unease in the structures that enclose us. That obsession with buildings haunts the entire gothic tradition, but for Tanning it is also an angry dissection of the \u201cnormal\u201d bourgeois house and the prisoners it contains. In her 1954 canvas <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dorothea-tanning/dorothea-tanning-family-portrait\">Family Portrait</a>, a doll-like blonde wife is literally dwarfed by the colossal man of the house in his mirrored glasses.</p> <p>If Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot doesn\u2019t upset you at first, keep looking. It\u2019s an insidiously atmospheric real-life space \u2013 a film set of the mind. And it\u2019s just one of the revolutionary artworks Tanning created at a time when surrealism was supposedly old hat. Her sewn-together fabric sculptures that culminate in her freaky hotel room are the greatest things she ever made. Reclining Nude, created in 1969-70, is a pink body that twists and truncates in inexplicable, upsetting ways. Embrace (1969) is a soft toy from hell. A brown furry gorilla-like form is \u201cembracing\u201d \u2013 or assaulting \u2013 another mutant female nude.</p> <p>Just to describe these sculptures is to recognise how contemporary they seem. There are clear connections between<a href=\"https://www.dorotheatanning.org/life-and-work/view/134/\"> Don Juan\u2019s Breakfast </a>(1972), in which pink flesh bubbles up out of a black beer stein, pressing at a buttoned seam, and the work of artists from Sarah Lucas to Cathy de Monchaux. Did I say Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot is the final masterpiece of surrealism? Revise that. It\u2019s the door between surrealism\u2019s bad dreams and ours.</p> <p>\u2022 Dorothea Tanning is at<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dorothea-tanning\"> Tate Modern</a>, London, from 27 February until 9 June. </p>",

A ghost walks past the castle with fire for a head. Her disembodied hair seems to have rematerialised in an archway. Tanning was not the first surrealist to declare her love of gothic novels. In his Manifesto of Surrealism published in 1924, the movement\u2019s founder Andr\u00e9 Breton praises the \u201cunforgettable intensity\u201d of Matthew Lewis\u2019s 1796 novel The Monk. Yet there\u2019s a difference. Breton exhibited the ingrained prejudices of the male surrealists, men of their time, when he drooled that The Monk\u2019s heroine Mathilda is \u201cless a character than a continual temptation\u201d. Tanning, as if to deliberately overturn this surrealist cult of great male perverts of the past resurrects Radcliffe, whose novels closely identified with the feelings and perceptions of women. Tanning\u2019s art is full of haunted houses and sinister, inexplicable happenings that owe as much to gothic novels as they do to Breton or Ernst. In her 1943 painting Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, a door in a vast and echoing hotel is opening to reveal an unholy glow inside: the other rooms on the floor are grimly shut while two girls sleepwalk on the landing. One has hair flowing upward as if she\u2019s underwater. A giant sunflower has materialised. What horror lurks in the roomful of light? A premonition of the A-bomb? A furnace for corpses? It\u2019s 1943. In her 1950-2 painting The Guest Room, a naked girl stands in an attitude of frozen alienation while a young woman lies in bed hugging a male doll. It\u2019s a very strange set-up, but what\u2019s most troubling is a short fat figure wearing cowboy boots and a blue head-covering that seems to conceal facial deformities or inhuman tubes under its folds. A bit David Lynch, right? But decades ahead of the surrealist film-maker. Tanning spent much of her life in France, but this exhibition reveals her as a great American artist. Her feel for gothic is reminiscent of the stories of her contemporary US writers Carson McCullers and Shirley Jackson. These are paintings of nightmares remembered in tantalising fragments. Then, in 1970, on that awful night in room 202 of the H\u00f4tel du Pavot, those nightmares crawl off the canvas into our own, three-dimensional world. Her monsters swarm the walls and bulge out of the upholstery. It made perfect sense for Tanning to make the leap from painting to this pioneering masterpiece of installation art. The staircases and doorways, cupboards and ruins that populate her early paintings find claustrophobia and unease in the structures that enclose us. That obsession with buildings haunts the entire gothic tradition, but for Tanning it is also an angry dissection of the \u201cnormal\u201d bourgeois house and the prisoners it contains. In her 1954 canvas Family Portrait, a doll-like blonde wife is literally dwarfed by the colossal man of the house in his mirrored glasses. If Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot doesn\u2019t upset you at first, keep looking. It\u2019s an insidiously atmospheric real-life space \u2013 a film set of the mind. And it\u2019s just one of the revolutionary artworks Tanning created at a time when surrealism was supposedly old hat. Her sewn-together fabric sculptures that culminate in her freaky hotel room are the greatest things she ever made. Reclining Nude, created in 1969-70, is a pink body that twists and truncates in inexplicable, upsetting ways. Embrace (1969) is a soft toy from hell. A brown furry gorilla-like form is \u201cembracing\u201d \u2013 or assaulting \u2013 another mutant female nude. Just to describe these sculptures is to recognise how contemporary they seem. There are clear connections between Don Juan\u2019s Breakfast (1972), in which pink flesh bubbles up out of a black beer stein, pressing at a buttoned seam, and the work of artists from Sarah Lucas to Cathy de Monchaux. Did I say Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot is the final masterpiece of surrealism? Revise that. It\u2019s the door between surrealism\u2019s bad dreams and ours. \u2022 Dorothea Tanning is at Tate Modern, London, from 27 February until 9 June.",

      "bodyText": "As of late, the old God is more old hat than Old Testament. The image of the serious-faced Caucasian man clad in a long, flowing white beard and an even longer white robe is pass\u00e9, as is the worshipful distance religious art tends to keep from him. The TV landscape of 2019 has allowed more room for an omnipotent deity than usual, all the while demystifying God as a person and idea. Sacrilegious? Maybe, but it has made for some fine entertainment (even if the creators might be consigning themselves to hell). Last week saw the premiere of Miracle Workers, a new sitcom from master of all things high-concept Simon Rich. The showrunner found success wedding sci-fi surrealism to romance with his previous series, Man Seeking Woman, and he mounted a quietly searing broadside against modernity with the New Yorker short story Sell Out, about a turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrant who finds himself transported to and summarily corrupted by present-day Brooklyn. Rich\u2019s cockeyed sentimental streak meets his ambient feelings of despair about the now in his latest series, a bleak workplace comedy set at Heaven, Inc, where God reigns not-quite-supreme. Daniel Radcliffe and Geraldine Viswanathan lead the show as a pair of low-level employees working in the Answered Prayers department, a gig that technically makes them angels without the halos, hand-sized harps or glamour. But the real scene-stealer is Steve Buscemi as the man upstairs, a coup of casting combined with expert characterization from a veteran actor. Buscemi\u2019s nasally voice and distinctive, unmistakable eyes lend themselves to a God who has been acting less than godly these days; he\u2019s more like a feckless CEO, all-powerful and yet utterly out of touch with what\u2019s happening in his company. God mostly spends his days drinking beer and watching television, \u201cdelegating\u201d tasks to underlings smarter and more hardworking than he is. Like so many horrible bosses before him, he makes absurd demands on a whim \u2013 after watching a smarmy standup routine from noisy atheist Bill Maher, God decides to explode the comedian\u2019s penis \u2013 and watches as his flunkies tie themselves into pretzels trying to make his tossed-off wishes reality.

We have got every reason to hope that things will progress more smoothly.\u201d</p> <p>In an article in the Daily Mail, writing with Harrington and Perry, James signalled the group\u2019s support for the Cooper/Letwin amendment.</p> <p>They wrote: \u201cIt is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees. We implore the government to take that step this week.</p> <p>\u201cBut if the prime minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks\u2019 time that we may regret forever.\u201d</p> <p>There is mounting speculation that up to 15 ministers could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.</p> <p>James told Today: \u201cFor quite a long time colleagues and I have been very concerned about the way in which this deal, which the prime minister is trying to get through, is continuously be frustrated \u2026 As D-day approaches we felt honour-bound to do something to help prevent such a catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cBy making this stand, hopefully that will encourage others to come in and support that deal and get it through. That\u2019s our primary goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf for any reason we can\u2019t persuade enough colleagues to get in behind that deal then it is so near to 29 March that the only option going forward is to extend article 50. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to see that happen but I think we feel that if the deal doesn\u2019t get through then that has to be the alternative; otherwise this country leaves without a deal which none of us wants and there\u2019s a parliamentary majority against that.\u201d</p> <p>And in a swipe at the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group, James added: \u201cFor us to leave with the biggest trade deal we have got in pursuit of other trade deals that might take 10 years to negotiate with far smaller countries is madness.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The digital minister, Margot James, has urged the prime minister to rule out the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of a no-deal Brexit, warning that she and other ministers are ready to resign if the prime minister refuses. James, together with fellow ministers Richard Harrington and Claire Perry, called on the government to extend article 50 to avoid leaving the EU with no agreement on 29 March. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: \u201cAll of us are agreed that we couldn\u2019t be part of a government that allowed the country to leave the European Union without a deal.\u201d Asked if this meant they were ready to quit, or be sacked, James said: \u201cIf it comes to that, yes.\u201d But James said she was hopeful Theresa May would offer concessions, including an extension to article 50, in a statement she was due to give to the parliament on Tuesday. In that statement, May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion before a vote on Wednesday on a cross-party amendment laid by the Conservative Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal Brext. The prime minister\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. James said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the whipping is going to be [or] what the prime minister is going to say in parliament today. We have got every reason to hope that things will progress more smoothly.\u201d In an article in the Daily Mail, writing with Harrington and Perry, James signalled the group\u2019s support for the Cooper/Letwin amendment. They wrote: \u201cIt is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees. We implore the government to take that step this week. \u201cBut if the prime minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks\u2019 time that we may regret forever.\u201d There is mounting speculation that up to 15 ministers could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point. James told Today: \u201cFor quite a long time colleagues and I have been very concerned about the way in which this deal, which the prime minister is trying to get through, is continuously be frustrated \u2026 As D-day approaches we felt honour-bound to do something to help prevent such a catastrophe.\u201d She added: \u201cBy making this stand, hopefully that will encourage others to come in and support that deal and get it through. That\u2019s our primary goal.\u201d \u201cIf for any reason we can\u2019t persuade enough colleagues to get in behind that deal then it is so near to 29 March that the only option going forward is to extend article 50. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to see that happen but I think we feel that if the deal doesn\u2019t get through then that has to be the alternative; otherwise this country leaves without a deal which none of us wants and there\u2019s a parliamentary majority against that.\u201d And in a swipe at the hardline pro-Brexit European Research Group, James added: \u201cFor us to leave with the biggest trade deal we have got in pursuit of other trade deals that might take 10 years to negotiate with far smaller countries is madness.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Tasmanian council has blocked a contentious private tourism development with helicopter access in the state\u2019s world heritage wilderness. The luxury camp proposal for remote Halls Island on Lake Malbena, in the Walls of Jerusalem national park, had been waved through by the Morrison government in August against the recommendation of expert advisory bodies. The Liberal state government, which has strongly backed the development, immediately flagged the likelihood of an appeal. Environmentalists said the decision was a win against the state\u2019s push for more commercial tourism in national parks and the vast Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covers about one-fifth of the island. The proposal by eco-tourism business Wild Drake would involve tourists being flown in and out of a permanent campsite constructed on the island. It would cater for up to six visitors at a time interested in bushwalking, kayaking and learning about the area\u2019s cultural history. At a public meeting on Tuesday, the Central Highlands council rejected the proposal six votes to three. Some councillors were critical of state and federal authorities for leaving the decision on a development in the world heritage area to local officials. Some said they believed it did not fit with Parks and Wildlife Service policies. The Wilderness Society acting campaign manager Tom Allen said it was a victory for people power, pointing to the 1,340 objections lodged against the proposal. \u201cLiterally thousands of Tasmanians have stepped up to protect world heritage wilderness from a profiteering government sponsoring exploitative practices,\u201d he said. The premier, Will Hodgman, said the councillors appeared not to have followed the planning scheme and had voted against the advice of their own planners. \u201cThe government understands there are strong grounds to appeal the decision,\u201d he said. Hodgman, who has declared the state \u201copen for business\u201d for development proposals on public land, said the camp had been subjected to rigorous commonwealth assessment. A federal environment department assistant secretary acting on behalf of the environment minister, Melissa Price, in August found the camp was not a threat to matters of national environmental significance and did not need federal approval. Three expert bodies advised against the development going ahead as proposed. The National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council, a state body, expressed concern about opening the world heritage area up to private commercial development with permanent structures and potentially frequent helicopter flights.

The fight over the camp comes against a backdrop of lawyers, academics and environmentalists pushing for the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to be strengthened or replaced. A Guardian Australia investigation last year found campaigners and political veterans believed it was now harder to win federal environmental protection than at any time since the 1980s. In December the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, promised to introduce a new Australian environment act and create a commonwealth environmental protection agency if elected, but is yet to release details.",

      "body": "<h2>James Rado, co-writer</h2> <p>I was in a play on Broadway that got such bad reviews it opened and closed on the same night. I had been cast opposite an actor called Gerry Ragni and told him about my dream of writing a musical. It was the mid-60s, a time when hippies were appearing in the East Village. They seemed like creatures from outer space, so open, loving and beautiful. They touched our hearts. The anti-Vietnam-war protests on the streets were dramatic and thrilling. Gerry and I thought we could write a show about all this.</p> <p>I\u2019d seen a painting at the Whitney Museum, of a comb holding a clump of hair that had been pulled out. It was just called Hair \u2013 and that gave us the title for our musical. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/19/galt-macdermot-obituary\">Galt MacDermot</a>, our composer, set everything to music, even the stage directions \u2013 unlike Herbie Hancock, who was asked to write music for one of our songs, and returned it with half the lyrics cut. </p> <p>Fate seemed to be at work with the show. Gerry was on a train one day when he met the producer Joseph Papp, who had a new venue in New York<strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Public_Theater\">the Public Theater</a>, and needed a show to open it. Two weeks later, we had the job. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We needed actors with long hair but there were none. So we'd find suitable people in the street and ask, 'Do you sing?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The show needed actors with long hair but there was no such thing at the time, so we would approach suitable people in the street, tap them on the shoulder and say: \u201cExcuse me, do you sing?\u201d The songs we\u2019d written really pushed the envelope and there was a mood of permissiveness among the actors, too. Once the show moved to Broadway, there was more and more drug use backstage. Whenever the fire marshal came round, the stage manager would get on the intercom and say: \u201cMarti Whitehead, please report to the stage manager\u2019s desk.\u201d Then everyone knew to throw their joints away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f59bc3602b692ad03ef8605b398d836dd16f37f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f59bc3602b692ad03ef8605b398d836dd16f37f2/0_0_5261_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Rado, left, and Gerome Ragni in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Rado, left, and Gerome Ragni in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Ellis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Public Theater wouldn\u2019t let us do the nude scene, but our Broadway director Tom O\u2019Horgan was all in favour. In fact, he changed it so that instead of just two people, the entire cast took their clothes off. I played Claude, the leader of the hippies, and Gerry played Berger, a free spirit \u2013 until we got fired from our own show. The play had opened a production in Los Angeles and we went over to visit, watching from the back of the theatre. We decided to take our clothes off during the interval and walk down the aisle naked.</p> <p>The producer heard about it and decided we were a liability. When we flew back to New York, we\u2019d been fired and there were armed guards on the door of the theatre keeping us out. So we wrote on a bedsheet \u201cWe want our baby back!\u201d and picketed the theatre. They let us back on stage eventually.</p> <p>After that, Gerry and I started fighting more and more. It had become too intense: we had to get away from each other. But we found our way back to each other as friends, even writing a second show called Sun, which has never been produced. Maybe someone will put it on before I die.</p> <h2>Shelley Plimpton, Crissy</h2> <p>It was a wonderful, exciting time. Everything was changing. I was working at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NightOwlCafeTributePage/\">the Night Owl Cafe</a> in the Village when Jim and Gerry came in looking for musicians. I had long hair and was innocent-looking, and they asked if I could sing, dance or act. I said: \u201cNo. Who are you?\u201d My friend talked me into auditioning so I sang <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends\">With a Little Help from My Friends</a>.

Galt was the grownup in the room. We became like a close-knit family \u2013 a tribe, as we called it. The nude scene didn\u2019t bother us: we weren\u2019t shy about our bodies. We were anti-war, of course, and went on the anti-Vietnam marches and to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Be-In\">be-ins</a> at the park.

A lot of the cast ate some, as well as the sound man and the lighting guy. It was kind of an interesting show after that. We all had to hang on to one another: \u201cWhere is the audience? What am I doing? Which way is up?\u201d</p> <p>Martha was born in 1970. When I began to show, they had me play the part of the pregnant girl, Jeanie. That was a lot of fun, but it became too dangerous because she has to go up a ladder. After Martha was born, she\u2019d be backstage with me. Many stage managers have held her while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKJNyr5XEs\">I sang Frank Mills</a>.</p> <p>A lot of the show is about masculinity and male friendship. Heather MacRae \u2013 who played Sheila, the woman caught in a love triangle with Claude and Berger \u2013 was magnificent. I remember sharing a dressing room with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore, too.

The show needed actors with long hair but there was no such thing at the time, so we would approach suitable people in the street, tap them on the shoulder and say: \u201cExcuse me, do you sing?\u201d The songs we\u2019d written really pushed the envelope and there was a mood of permissiveness among the actors, too. Once the show moved to Broadway, there was more and more drug use backstage. Whenever the fire marshal came round, the stage manager would get on the intercom and say: \u201cMarti Whitehead, please report to the stage manager\u2019s desk.\u201d Then everyone knew to throw their joints away. The Public Theater wouldn\u2019t let us do the nude scene, but our Broadway director Tom O\u2019Horgan was all in favour. In fact, he changed it so that instead of just two people, the entire cast took their clothes off. I played Claude, the leader of the hippies, and Gerry played Berger, a free spirit \u2013 until we got fired from our own show. The play had opened a production in Los Angeles and we went over to visit, watching from the back of the theatre. We decided to take our clothes off during the interval and walk down the aisle naked. The producer heard about it and decided we were a liability. When we flew back to New York, we\u2019d been fired and there were armed guards on the door of the theatre keeping us out. So we wrote on a bedsheet \u201cWe want our baby back!\u201d and picketed the theatre. They let us back on stage eventually. After that, Gerry and I started fighting more and more. It had become too intense: we had to get away from each other. But we found our way back to each other as friends, even writing a second show called Sun, which has never been produced. Maybe someone will put it on before I die. Shelley Plimpton, Crissy It was a wonderful, exciting time. Everything was changing. I was working at the Night Owl Cafe in the Village when Jim and Gerry came in looking for musicians. I had long hair and was innocent-looking, and they asked if I could sing, dance or act. I said: \u201cNo. Who are you?\u201d My friend talked me into auditioning so I sang With a Little Help from My Friends. They liked it, but they didn\u2019t have a role for me \u2013 so they wrote a song, Frank Mills, for me instead. Jim and Gerry were yin and yang: Gerry was outgoing and wacky, Jim quiet and thoughtful. Galt was the grownup in the room. We became like a close-knit family \u2013 a tribe, as we called it. The nude scene didn\u2019t bother us: we weren\u2019t shy about our bodies. We were anti-war, of course, and went on the anti-Vietnam marches and to be-ins at the park. But they said we hated the soldiers, which just wasn\u2019t true. One night Keith Carradine [father of Shelley\u2019s daughter Martha] made some pot brownies and brought them in. A lot of the cast ate some, as well as the sound man and the lighting guy. It was kind of an interesting show after that. We all had to hang on to one another: \u201cWhere is the audience? What am I doing? Which way is up?\u201d Martha was born in 1970. When I began to show, they had me play the part of the pregnant girl, Jeanie. That was a lot of fun, but it became too dangerous because she has to go up a ladder. After Martha was born, she\u2019d be backstage with me. Many stage managers have held her while I sang Frank Mills. A lot of the show is about masculinity and male friendship. Heather MacRae \u2013 who played Sheila, the woman caught in a love triangle with Claude and Berger \u2013 was magnificent. I remember sharing a dressing room with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore, too. They were getting their careers together while I was just having a good time. I never felt like acting was my calling. The 50th-anniversary production Hair the Musical tours the UK from 21 March. This article was amended on 15 March 2019 because an earlier version referred to Hair\u2019s director as Tim Horgan instead of Tom O\u2019Horgan.",

      "body": "<p>While there\u2019s widespread relief from many to be saying goodbye to yet another extended awards season, for others, it means something else: the start of the next. Festival slots are being negotiated, release dates are being discussed, campaigns are being plotted and, so inevitably, staggeringly, perhaps stupidly, early predictions are being made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/oscars-2019-saves-shocks-for-last-with-wins-for-green-book-and-olivia-colman\">Oscars save shocks for last with big wins for Green Book and Olivia Colman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So take these 10 potential contenders with a pinch of salt unless of course they turn out to be entirely accurate then instead, look back on them, and the Guardian at large, in stunned awe.</p> <h2>Tom Hanks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a02235a4957ffa29a615a7a9a92ca0f2325419f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a02235a4957ffa29a615a7a9a92ca0f2325419f/0_212_2292_1375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It has been 18 years since Hanks received his last Oscar nomination, after a decade of almost non-stop adoration from the Academy and before a string of perceived snubs for his work in Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Next year sees him campaigning for a comeback as children\u2019s television staple Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a drama that acts as a narrative sibling to last year\u2019s surprise hit documentary Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? While the sugary combination of actor and character might already be giving you toothache, the film\u2019s director Marielle Heller, who brought complex and often cruel characters to the screen in Diary of a Teenage Girl and Can You Ever Forgive Me?, suggests something far spikier.</p> <h2>Quentin Tarantino</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"455a4a56022a129ff44562d2fe8b3d1c202a259e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455a4a56022a129ff44562d2fe8b3d1c202a259e/0_82_2589_1553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quentin Tarantino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It speaks to Tarantino\u2019s standing with the Academy that The Hateful Eight was seen as a blip, despite winning one Oscar and being nominated for two others. Before the snowy Agatha Christie-esque exercise in self-indulgence, he\u2019d had a brief streak with Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained nabbing 13 nominations between them, and it\u2019s a safe bet his next film will see him back in the main races once again. As well as a soft spot for Tarantino, the Academy has an even softer one for films about films and his 60s-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reads like Academy catnip. As well as the LA setting, there\u2019s a stacked cast (including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino) and a storyline that brings in everyone from Steve McQueen to Sharon Tate.</p> <h2>Natalie Portman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dcea5491bdfafbb79f04f869cb6392b8530e1b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dcea5491bdfafbb79f04f869cb6392b8530e1b8/0_66_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ever since she was named best actress for Black Swan, Portman has taken the unconventional route of mostly avoiding obvious Oscar-bait roles. She\u2019s cropped up in the Thor franchise, slummed it in comedies like No Strings Attached and Your Highness, stared into space for Terrence Malick in Knight of Cups and Song to Song and hunted indefinable aggressors in Annihilation. Her one nomination since, for playing Jackie Kennedy, was in a strange, complicated and provocative drama that defied stuffy biopic formula, and last year she was put forward for Vox Lux, a similarly curious and unusual film. Her next project sounds like a surer thing for awards attention, playing a woman whose affair with a fellow astronaut sends her on a downward spiral. Although with Fargo and Legion\u2019s Noah Hawley in the director\u2019s chair, expect the unexpected.</p> <h2>Daniel Kaluuya</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eeef2975a7a515b0d05ec0015e279bf403983fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eeef2975a7a515b0d05ec0015e279bf403983fd/514_309_1529_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After his powerful performance in Get Out snagged him a best actor nomination (and, in my mind, should have led to him taking home the Oscar), Daniel Kaluuya followed it with a banner year as one of the SAG-winning Black Panther ensemble and arguably the MVP of Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows, his menacing turn deserving of even more awards attention. In 2020, he could have a strong chance with Queen &amp; Slim, the directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas, acclaimed director of many a music video as well as episodes of Insecure and Master of None. The prescient tale, written by Lena Waithe, sees a black couple\u2019s first date go wrong when they shoot a cop in self-defence before going on the run.</p> <h2>Gary Oldman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a0a8bc22f2c4a7f9ee23048a82a072ac35fc134\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0a8bc22f2c4a7f9ee23048a82a072ac35fc134/0_217_3696_2218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Gary Oldman\u2019s post-Oscar career has provided him with hours even darker than the one that got him there with critically loathed sci-fi thriller Tau and bland Gerard Butler actioner Hunter Killer to his name. In-between some of the schlockier films he has on the horizon, including haunted boat horror Mary and crime thriller Killers Anonymous, Oldman will play lawyer J\u00fcrgen Mossack in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s hotly anticipated Panama Papers drama The Laundromat. He\u2019s one of many cast members who could see himself in the race with Meryl Streep, David Schwimmer, Jeffrey Wright, Matthias Schoenaerts all starring alongside.</p> <h2>Annette Bening</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cf723bf7c4a0876bb7118f2a089bb1179e4c2f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf723bf7c4a0876bb7118f2a089bb1179e4c2f3/434_94_2073_1243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the few performances here that some critics, including myself, have already seen is Annette Bening\u2019s rich, detailed take on senator Dianne Feinstein in The Report, a compelling, angry retelling of the investigation into post 9/11 torture practices. It\u2019s commanding work that avoids mere mimicry and Bening exists on that surprising list of great actors who have never won an Oscar, despite four nominations, and given how the Academy has been turning bridesmaids into brides in recent years, from Leo to Glenn, a best supporting actress win could make sense. The film\u2019s talky, unemotional directness might turn some voters off but, aside from Scott Z Burns\u2019 info-packed script, she has the best chance of recognition.</p> <h2>Cynthia Erivo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd4362360fccbbc94fc344c10717ab225ce762f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd4362360fccbbc94fc344c10717ab225ce762f4/0_143_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Making small but impactful impressions last year in both Widows and Bad Times at El Royale, the Tony-winning actor and singer Cynthia Erivo is about to enjoy a much bigger year. She\u2019ll crop up in Doug Liman\u2019s big-budget YA adaptation Chaos Walking, 12 Years a Slave writer John Ridley\u2019s sci-fi adventure Needle in a Timestack and, most prominently, as abolitionist and activist Harriet Tubman in an awards-aiming biopic. Film-makers have tried to bring Tubman\u2019s story to the screen before, with a Viola Davis-starring project once mooted, but final responsibility was given to Kasi Lemmons, who impressed with her 1997 debut Eve\u2019s Bayou and next year, could become the first woman of colour to nab a nomination for best director.</p> <h2>James Gray</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"216bb6111da74d0fffb511f60542c73d8fdfeaa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/216bb6111da74d0fffb511f60542c73d8fdfeaa5/0_126_4589_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you were one of the precious few who saw James Gray\u2019s last film, the wonderful yet sorely underseen adventure The Lost City Of Z, you\u2019ll also be aware of how sorely under-nominated it was as well. The director started out in smaller, grittier crime fare but his bleak period drama The Immigrant, also sorely underseen, kicked off a new, more ambitious phase in his career. He\u2019s expanding his scope even further with Ad Astra, a pet project that\u2019s set to be one of 2019\u2019s most fascinating films, starring Brad Pitt as an engineer traveling through the solar system to find his lost father, played by Tommy Lee Jones.

      "bodyText": "While there\u2019s widespread relief from many to be saying goodbye to yet another extended awards season, for others, it means something else: the start of the next. Festival slots are being negotiated, release dates are being discussed, campaigns are being plotted and, so inevitably, staggeringly, perhaps stupidly, early predictions are being made. So take these 10 potential contenders with a pinch of salt unless of course they turn out to be entirely accurate then instead, look back on them, and the Guardian at large, in stunned awe. Tom Hanks It has been 18 years since Hanks received his last Oscar nomination, after a decade of almost non-stop adoration from the Academy and before a string of perceived snubs for his work in Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Next year sees him campaigning for a comeback as children\u2019s television staple Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a drama that acts as a narrative sibling to last year\u2019s surprise hit documentary Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? While the sugary combination of actor and character might already be giving you toothache, the film\u2019s director Marielle Heller, who brought complex and often cruel characters to the screen in Diary of a Teenage Girl and Can You Ever Forgive Me?, suggests something far spikier. Quentin Tarantino It speaks to Tarantino\u2019s standing with the Academy that The Hateful Eight was seen as a blip, despite winning one Oscar and being nominated for two others. Before the snowy Agatha Christie-esque exercise in self-indulgence, he\u2019d had a brief streak with Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained nabbing 13 nominations between them, and it\u2019s a safe bet his next film will see him back in the main races once again. As well as a soft spot for Tarantino, the Academy has an even softer one for films about films and his 60s-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reads like Academy catnip. As well as the LA setting, there\u2019s a stacked cast (including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino) and a storyline that brings in everyone from Steve McQueen to Sharon Tate. Natalie Portman Ever since she was named best actress for Black Swan, Portman has taken the unconventional route of mostly avoiding obvious Oscar-bait roles. She\u2019s cropped up in the Thor franchise, slummed it in comedies like No Strings Attached and Your Highness, stared into space for Terrence Malick in Knight of Cups and Song to Song and hunted indefinable aggressors in Annihilation. Her one nomination since, for playing Jackie Kennedy, was in a strange, complicated and provocative drama that defied stuffy biopic formula, and last year she was put forward for Vox Lux, a similarly curious and unusual film. Her next project sounds like a surer thing for awards attention, playing a woman whose affair with a fellow astronaut sends her on a downward spiral. Although with Fargo and Legion\u2019s Noah Hawley in the director\u2019s chair, expect the unexpected. Daniel Kaluuya After his powerful performance in Get Out snagged him a best actor nomination (and, in my mind, should have led to him taking home the Oscar), Daniel Kaluuya followed it with a banner year as one of the SAG-winning Black Panther ensemble and arguably the MVP of Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows, his menacing turn deserving of even more awards attention. In 2020, he could have a strong chance with Queen &amp; Slim, the directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas, acclaimed director of many a music video as well as episodes of Insecure and Master of None. The prescient tale, written by Lena Waithe, sees a black couple\u2019s first date go wrong when they shoot a cop in self-defence before going on the run. Gary Oldman Gary Oldman\u2019s post-Oscar career has provided him with hours even darker than the one that got him there with critically loathed sci-fi thriller Tau and bland Gerard Butler actioner Hunter Killer to his name. In-between some of the schlockier films he has on the horizon, including haunted boat horror Mary and crime thriller Killers Anonymous, Oldman will play lawyer J\u00fcrgen Mossack in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s hotly anticipated Panama Papers drama The Laundromat. He\u2019s one of many cast members who could see himself in the race with Meryl Streep, David Schwimmer, Jeffrey Wright, Matthias Schoenaerts all starring alongside. Annette Bening One of the few performances here that some critics, including myself, have already seen is Annette Bening\u2019s rich, detailed take on senator Dianne Feinstein in The Report, a compelling, angry retelling of the investigation into post 9/11 torture practices. It\u2019s commanding work that avoids mere mimicry and Bening exists on that surprising list of great actors who have never won an Oscar, despite four nominations, and given how the Academy has been turning bridesmaids into brides in recent years, from Leo to Glenn, a best supporting actress win could make sense. The film\u2019s talky, unemotional directness might turn some voters off but, aside from Scott Z Burns\u2019 info-packed script, she has the best chance of recognition. Cynthia Erivo Making small but impactful impressions last year in both Widows and Bad Times at El Royale, the Tony-winning actor and singer Cynthia Erivo is about to enjoy a much bigger year. She\u2019ll crop up in Doug Liman\u2019s big-budget YA adaptation Chaos Walking, 12 Years a Slave writer John Ridley\u2019s sci-fi adventure Needle in a Timestack and, most prominently, as abolitionist and activist Harriet Tubman in an awards-aiming biopic. Film-makers have tried to bring Tubman\u2019s story to the screen before, with a Viola Davis-starring project once mooted, but final responsibility was given to Kasi Lemmons, who impressed with her 1997 debut Eve\u2019s Bayou and next year, could become the first woman of colour to nab a nomination for best director. James Gray If you were one of the precious few who saw James Gray\u2019s last film, the wonderful yet sorely underseen adventure The Lost City Of Z, you\u2019ll also be aware of how sorely under-nominated it was as well. The director started out in smaller, grittier crime fare but his bleak period drama The Immigrant, also sorely underseen, kicked off a new, more ambitious phase in his career. He\u2019s expanding his scope even further with Ad Astra, a pet project that\u2019s set to be one of 2019\u2019s most fascinating films, starring Brad Pitt as an engineer traveling through the solar system to find his lost father, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Gray has compared the story to Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness while also claiming it will be \u201cthe most realistic depiction of space travel that\u2019s been put in a movie\u201d. Its May release date could also suggest a Cannes premiere. Charlize Theron Oscar winner Charlize Theron found herself on the outskirts of the most recent best actress race with her lived in portrayal of a mother under pressure in Tully, but next time she might fare better in the best supporting actress category with her latest transformative role.

She has since cropped up in Deadpool 2, High Flying Bird and, ermmm, Geostorm and this year, she will be in pretty much everything.

The conviction was made public on Tuesday, two months after the jury found Pell guilty on five charges of abusing two boys in Melbourne in 1996 and 1997. \u201cI respect the fact that this case is under appeal, but it is the victims and their families I am thinking of today, and all those who have suffered from sexual abuse by those they should have been able to trust, but couldn\u2019t,\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister said. \u201cTheir prolonged pain and suffering will not have ended today. While due process continues, our justice system has affirmed no Australian is above the law.\u201d The federal families minister, Paul Fletcher, earlier said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the conviction and applauded the \u201cgenuine courage\u201d of Pell\u2019s victims in coming forward. Fletcher oversees the redress scheme for survivors of child sexual abuse that was established in response to a recommendation by Australia\u2019s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. \u201cThe news that someone of George Pell\u2019s seniority within the Catholic church has been convicted of these crimes is deeply disturbing,\u201d the minister said. \u201cMy first thoughts, however, are with the survivors who showed genuine courage to come forward.\u201d The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on the specific case [because] it\u2019s under appeal \u2026 I feel for anyone who\u2019s ever been a victim of clerical assault and abuse \u2026 this must bring back a lot of very difficult memories \u2013 this is a very difficult time. \u201cIt is very clear that a lot of institutional sexual abuse was swept under the carpet and too often priests, rather than being punished, were moved between parishes \u2026 \u201cMy thoughts are with the victims of clerical sexual abuse. It should never have happened; it\u2019s a gross betrayal of trust.\u201d The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and the crossbench senator Derryn Hinch have called for Pell to be stripped of his standing as a companion of the Order of Australia, which is what happened to Rolf Harris after his child abuse conviction in 2015. Hinch called Pell a \u201cbloody hypocrite\u201d. Hanson-Young said on Twitter that organisations that covered up child sexual abuse \u201cshould have no right to tax-free status or public money\u201d. Pell\u2019s old school, St Patrick\u2019s College in Ballarat, announced it would strip his name from a building at the school, strike it off the honour board, and revoke his status as an \u201cinducted legend of the school\u201d. Richmond football club has removed him as a club vice-patron. The Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen told reporters in Townsville it would be a \u201cdifficult day for victims of sexual abuse\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure victims of sexual abuse will want to see the justice system working without fear or favour,\u201d he said. \u201cAny Australian, no matter how famous or prominent, is subject to law and that is what we\u2019re seeing played out today.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, a practising Catholic, said sexual abuse victims had been \u201cbetrayed, and so have good people of faith across Victoria\u201d. \u201cMy thoughts are with the victims \u2013 their pain is a tragedy, their bravery an inspiration,\u201d he said. The former prime minister Tony Abbott, a longstanding friend of Pell who defended the cardinal as a \u201cfine man\u201d in 2017 after he was charged with child sexual offences, including those for which he was later convicted, has yet to comment on the verdict. He previously described Pell as \u201cone of the greatest church officials that Australia has ever seen\u201d. Rupert Murdoch appeared to share that opinion in 2014, when he tweeted that Australia would miss the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Pell when he went to the Vatican. Another staunch defender, the News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, said Pell had been \u201cfalsely convicted\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s my opinion, based on the overwhelming evidence,\u201d Bolt wrote in the Herald Sun. \u201cAnd my opinion is also based in part on how many times Pell has been accused of crimes and sins he clearly did not do.\u201d Bolt previously called the prosecution a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d and did not attend the trial. He said he had \u201cmet Pell perhaps five times in my life and like him\u201d and that he was \u201cnot just incapable of such abuse, but so intelligent and cautious that he would never risk his brilliant career and good name on such a mad assault in such a public place\u201d.

Powell said none of the schools should be allowed to expand until they had improved those figures. \u201cGrammar schools do nothing for social mobility, they do the opposite \u2013 they entrench it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t see how the government can justify allowing schools to expand when they have such poor records in reflecting their communities.\u201d Jim Skinner, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said campaigners complaining there were too few poorer pupils in grammar schools were missing the point. He said official figures showed that while 12% of pupils who were not disadvantaged achieved a high level of attainment in reading, writing and maths, just 4% of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did so. \u201cWe are fully supportive of the long-term goal of getting as many disadvantaged children in grammar schools as there are in the areas where those schools are. The work grammar schools are doing will help to close that national gap, but you can\u2019t overnight have the same percentage of disadvantaged children in grammar schools as you have nationally,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the Department for Education said this was the first time grammar school expansion had been linked to a requirement to widen access. \u201cWe want schools to go further so that families who may not have previously thought about applying to a selective school consider it as an option. We have already seen innovative ideas from successful schools that are taking action such as setting up help desks in partner primary schools to assist parents registering children for the test, or holding information sessions in community libraries,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Record temperatures in complete contrast to the weather at this time last year have led to signs that spring has sprung much earlier than usual in the UK, and naturalists have expressed worry about what this means for the environment. We asked you to share the signs where you are, and received thoughtful contributions and photographs from around the UK. After a warm weekend for much of Britain, Anna Markwell, in East Sussex, said: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, but worryingly mild.\u201d Her sentiment was echoed in many of your stories; the flutter of butterflies and buzzing of bees is something to be savoured \u2013 but could their early appearance lead to environmental disaster? And could the need for an early antihistamine dose be the least of our problems in the coming years? Below are some of your stories and photographs. \u2018Climate change terrifies me\u2019 Patrick Green was one of many readers to share concern in his contribution (which included the image at the top of this piece, taken in north London\u2019s Clissold Park). \u201cThe scenes are very beautiful, and I\u2019m very pleased with the pictures I took on 22 February, but I know I\u2019m seeing them too early: climate change terrifies me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPoliticians are in a permanent state of denial and seem oblivious to what is staring them in the face. The weather on our shared planet is changing in dangerous and unpredictable ways and the future of humanity is at stake.\u201d \u2018I am perplexed by the apparent public indifference\u2019 Petr Skapa is also worried: \u201cThis wild plum tree grows alongside a public footpath where dog walkers, joggers, families with children and young couples are casually passing without even noticing it. \u201cI am perplexed by the apparent public indifference toward weather swings in the last 20 years. If the scientists are correct with their climate modelling, the swings are not only here to stay but are set to increase, causing havoc in living nature; forests, agriculture, everything will change, and not for the better. How this flowery demonstration of a trend toward a future laden with risks to water and food security doesn\u2019t alarm everyone passing by is beyond me.\u201d Butterflies in February? Several readers contacted us to say they had been surprised to see butterflies around already. It is unusual to see a red admiral so early, according to Butterfly Conservation, but Anne Davison saw this specimen on 22 February, resting on an Edgeworthia chrysantha bush in her garden near Stamford, Lincolnshire. \u2018Watching the way they react is fascinating \u2013 but I\u2019m concerned\u2019 Bees were also early visitors to gardens and parks near many of you. \u201cThey are around pollinating crocuses and there are a lot more flowers around in general,\u201d says Julie Prescott, echoing many fellow readers\u2019 surprise and concern for the creatures. \u201cIt\u2019s a big contrast to 21 February last year, which was very snowy here in Blyton, Lincolnshire.\u201d Gareth Todd Jones, who keeps honey bees in the Rhondda valley, south Wales, remembers nursing them through a cold early 2018 and is struck by the difference this year: \u201cWatching the way they are reacting to February temperatures that are really too high is fascinating. Honey bees are the ultimate evolvers, but I can\u2019t help but be concerned!\u201d \u2018Soft croaks on Sunday morning led me to the side of our garden pond\u2019 Andy Bell, in Burton upon Trent, sent this picture of frogspawn in his pond. Pools in Mark Palmer\u2019s allotment in Ulverston, Cumbria, have also filled with spawn over the last week. \u201cIt is earlier by around two weeks than normal, perhaps because we have not yet had any really heavy frosts \u2013 being on the northern side of Morecambe Bay probably helps with sheltered weather.\u201d Veronica Love, in Dumfries and Galloway, shared a similar story. \u201cSoft croaks on Sunday morning led me to the side of our garden pond where I watched two frogs mating \u2013 and a third trying and failing to muscle in. I expect frogspawn to appear soon, but it doesn\u2019t stay long as the goldfish feast on it.\u201d \u2018These normally flower in April!\u2019 Reports that the air is unusually perfumed this spring due to warm weather in 2018 are perhaps confirmed by Helen Garland, in Bristol. \u201cThese iris were inherited from my mother and my grandmother, and normally flower in April. They are a really old variety that have a scent, so it\u2019s strange to see them already.\u201d Helen Evans, a reader in Ruthin, north Wales, notes down the first time she sees certain flowers each year. \u201cI made a point of looking for violets on my walk on 23 February and did see a few growing next to a country lane. In 2016 the first violet was 12 March, 11 March in 2017 and 24 March last year.\u201d An early feast for some \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly warm,\u201d says Courtney Hopf, in east London, another reader to note record snowfalls this time in 2018. \u201cI know [parakeets] are essentially invasive pests, but seeing that flash of tropical green in London always gives me a little thrill. This parakeet and three others were busily nibbling this tree\u2019s blossoms for hours last Friday.\u201d \u2018Boatloads of the stuff\u2019 Foragers among you have been enjoying early crops. John Kelly said he\u2019d collected \u201cboatloads of mature wild garlic\u201d in Leeds over the last few days. Elizabeth, in Cardiff, said she\u2019d been harvesting garlic for around three weeks, much earlier than usual.

      "body": "<p>Where stilted huts once stood on the white sand, now there are just charred remains. \u201cThis is worse than after the tsunami,\u201d says Hook, a <a href=\"https://www.mokenislands.com/\">Moken sea nomad</a> surveying the damage fire has wreaked on his former village home in Au Bon Yai bay, Surin island.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2014/dec/09/indian-ocean-tsunami-10-years-after-the-wave\">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a> destroyed the previous Moken settlement here on Thailand\u2019s Andaman sea, Hook says people were able to recover some belongings. This time, when fire broke out on 3 February this year, nothing was left. Now the community fears for the future as the authorities begin to reconstruct the village in its original design, an unsafe housing model consisting of highly flammable structures, densely packed together. And it has reignited a row about the Moken\u2019s rights to their ancestral lands.</p> <p>The Moken, skilful freedivers, hunters and sea nomads, had always lived at sea, moving on to land only during the rainy season \u2013 until they were pushed ashore permanently some decades ago. The Surin community of Moken made their home on the islands many generations ago. The Moken came to the world\u2019s attention for their survival and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/10/indian-ocean-tsunami-moken-sea-nomads-thailand\">heroism during the 2004 tsunami </a>and now the village, located in a national park, attracts thousands of tourists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d485e0e5824fd805ddc3e86a45128c6c06cbb05f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d485e0e5824fd805ddc3e86a45128c6c06cbb05f/0_0_1200_901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Moken village destroyed by fire in February 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Moken village destroyed by fire in February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mokenislands.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was just after sunset on that Sunday earlier this month, the last of the tour groups had left. It had been hot for days and the huts, made from bamboo and palm leaves, were completely dried out. A strong north wind blew, as it does at this time of year. The fire, accidentally sparked in one family\u2019s hut, engulfed the structure quickly. The layout of the village \u2013 three rows of huts packed so closely together their roofs were almost touching \u2013 enabled the flames to spread with frightening speed, like a fire spirit dancing from roof to roof, the villagers said. The homes went up like tinder. The Moken fought hard, until it became too hot to continue. It took just 30 minutes for all 61 houses on the right side of the bay to be swallowed by flames.</p> <p>The timing of the fire was fortunate. Tourists had gone, and everyone was active \u2013 women washing, preparing dinner, children playing in the sand or with homemade boats in the water.</p> <p>While there was no loss of life, 273 people were left homeless, their belongings gone \u2013 everything from cooking pots to clothes, work materials and tools, life savings and generations-old family heirlooms. As the fire spread towards the edge of the village, Tad helped his wife Sabai, particularly vulnerable in her blindness, escape the flames, grabbing his drum and her betel nuts as they ran. All the Moken women and children were evacuated to a campsite on a neighbouring island within Surin\u2019s national park, but the following day, they returned to the village, preferring to sleep under the stars than canvas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/dec/moken/box/\" data-alt=\"Moken graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2014/dec/moken/box/\">Moken graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The park authorities and the Thai navy were on the scene fast. Government officials had provisions delivered from the mainland and committed financial assistance. Donations and aid arrived in the form of food, medical supplies, clothes. </p> <p>Daily life is challenging. There is one water hose for the whole village. A few coal stoves are distributed for cooking. But the Moken are well practised in sharing \u2013 their language has no word for \u201cwant\u201d, \u201ctake\u201d, \u201cmine\u201d. People sleep on the beach, in the school, and share the 15 huts that the villagers saved, thanks to a space separating them from the main cluster. </p> <p>The government has sent soldiers from Surathani to help reconstruct the village, before the rainy season comes at the end of March. Their time \u2013 and funding \u2013 is limited, and, in the rush to rebuild, all signs point to a quick reconstruction of the original confined layout \u2013 the same rows of small huts packed into the same tight space, built with the same flammable materials. </p> <p>But the Moken have now seen exactly how dangerous this layout is. \u201cWe have large tour groups here in the dry season,\u201d says Hook. \u201cWith the villagers and so many tourists in our small bay, we worry about this happening again, about people being injured or worse.\u201d</p> <p>Regardless, the soldiers have been digging holes, laying foundations and poles for 61 plots within the same perimeters. The size allocated for each home is impossibly small \u2013 just 3m by 6.5m. \u201cMy family houses six people,\u201d despairs Mi Nge. \u201cThere will be just 3m by 4m inside space for my family to sleep, store our belongings, and a kitchen.\u201d There has been consultation between provincial government, the national park and navy, but not, it appears, with the Moken. \u201cWe Moken men are well experienced in building our own houses,\u201d points out Hook. \u201cWhy is no one asking us, how and where we want to set up our own houses?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72dba838b8b6cd7454421bf8f7f6795f7d1bac1d/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=df514b1bafe34134cd8df53dc1ab6b11&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72dba838b8b6cd7454421bf8f7f6795f7d1bac1d/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=87377232c5be9554662ea5e101fb9e23&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143c3dc737971c491f363d2dd32087dd3e9686b2/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=4443de79aaad8f47383dc7b58f1a9928&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143c3dc737971c491f363d2dd32087dd3e9686b2/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=4ce279c6419e03640aa9d0d88498fa8f&amp;label_after=Now&amp;analytics_label=Moken village destroyed by fire &amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"Moken village images\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72dba838b8b6cd7454421bf8f7f6795f7d1bac1d/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=df514b1bafe34134cd8df53dc1ab6b11&desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72dba838b8b6cd7454421bf8f7f6795f7d1bac1d/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=87377232c5be9554662ea5e101fb9e23&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143c3dc737971c491f363d2dd32087dd3e9686b2/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=4443de79aaad8f47383dc7b58f1a9928&desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143c3dc737971c491f363d2dd32087dd3e9686b2/0_0_1076_730/master/1076.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=4ce279c6419e03640aa9d0d88498fa8f&label_after=Now&analytics_label=Moken village destroyed by fire &type=slider&\">Moken village images</a> </figure>  <p>Ngui, Hook\u2019s elder brother, is the head of the village. While he appreciates government assistance, he shares concern that the planned housing is unsuitable and unsafe. \u201cThey said they would show us the plan to see if it fits our needs,\u201d he says. \u201cNo has come around to ask us, yet they already started placing the poles of the houses.\u201d He is worried about future fire risks, and how his growing community will fit into this increasingly uninhabitable space.</p> <p>The Moken know better than anyone how to organise and structure their village, safely and sustainably, in harmony with the environment. \u201cIt would be great to rebuild the wood houses with thatch roofs, but more spread out and durably constructed,\u201d says Ngui. Ngui wants more space, and there is room to extend along the bay. But so far, the national park authorities refuse.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that we would expand any development beyond the current beach,\u201d said Putthapoj Khuphrasit, the head of Koh Surin national park, as he surveyed the bay on 8 February. \u201cWe have to balance the needs of the community with the management of the protected environment inside of the park.\u201d</p> <p>There is another option the park won\u2019t yet discuss \u2013 the use of a bay nearby. For generations, Moken lived between several bays on Koh Surin, including Au Bon Yai bay and Sai En bay (where they buried their ancestors) long before the park existed; these lands are, by rights, their ancestral home. The obvious solution would be to return both bays to the Moken to live in and manage. As General Surin Pikulthong, a member of the Committee for the Affairs of Indigenous Peoples, puts it: \u201cThey have been here longer than any of us \u2026 there is no law that gives the government power to dictate the lives of ethnic groups who predated the government that are living on their ancestral lands.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/10/indian-ocean-tsunami-moken-sea-nomads-thailand\">Tsunami, 10 years on: the sea nomads who survived the devastation | Susan Smillie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Moken have been here before. They are a resilient and resourceful people. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/2004-indian-ocean-tsunami-10-years-on\">2004 tsunami struck</a>, they survived thanks to intimate knowledge of the sea, passed down through generations. As people around the world stared in wonder at the receding water that came before that devastating wave, Moken elders read the danger and quickly evacuated everyone \u2013 their own people, and tourists \u2013 to higher ground. Then they rescued survivors at sea. More than 230,000 people were lost in the tsunami worldwide; the Moken, who were directly in the path of the wave, lost no one. The real trauma came in the reconstruction of their homes. The national park authorities\u2019 demands rode roughshod over Moken cultural traditions.</p> <p>Normally, the animist Moken erect their huts at the edge of the beach, stilted feet in the water, living in the space between land and sea, like their mythical kin, the turtle. When they were pushed to the smaller bay, the park insisted on the current formation of small huts in regimented lines, tightly packed together (lacking important social spaces), facing each other (considered an ill omen) set back from the sea, and near the jungle (where spirits are believed to reside).</p> <p>As well as cultural traditions, there was a pragmatism to the Moken\u2019s living arrangements, their huts spaced safely apart at the waters\u2019 edge, the lapping waves washing away small amounts of natural waste generated from each household.

      "bodyText": "Where stilted huts once stood on the white sand, now there are just charred remains. \u201cThis is worse than after the tsunami,\u201d says Hook, a Moken sea nomad surveying the damage fire has wreaked on his former village home in Au Bon Yai bay, Surin island. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami destroyed the previous Moken settlement here on Thailand\u2019s Andaman sea, Hook says people were able to recover some belongings. This time, when fire broke out on 3 February this year, nothing was left. Now the community fears for the future as the authorities begin to reconstruct the village in its original design, an unsafe housing model consisting of highly flammable structures, densely packed together. And it has reignited a row about the Moken\u2019s rights to their ancestral lands. The Moken, skilful freedivers, hunters and sea nomads, had always lived at sea, moving on to land only during the rainy season \u2013 until they were pushed ashore permanently some decades ago. The Surin community of Moken made their home on the islands many generations ago. The Moken came to the world\u2019s attention for their survival and heroism during the 2004 tsunami and now the village, located in a national park, attracts thousands of tourists. It was just after sunset on that Sunday earlier this month, the last of the tour groups had left. It had been hot for days and the huts, made from bamboo and palm leaves, were completely dried out. A strong north wind blew, as it does at this time of year. The fire, accidentally sparked in one family\u2019s hut, engulfed the structure quickly. The layout of the village \u2013 three rows of huts packed so closely together their roofs were almost touching \u2013 enabled the flames to spread with frightening speed, like a fire spirit dancing from roof to roof, the villagers said. The homes went up like tinder. The Moken fought hard, until it became too hot to continue. It took just 30 minutes for all 61 houses on the right side of the bay to be swallowed by flames. The timing of the fire was fortunate. Tourists had gone, and everyone was active \u2013 women washing, preparing dinner, children playing in the sand or with homemade boats in the water. While there was no loss of life, 273 people were left homeless, their belongings gone \u2013 everything from cooking pots to clothes, work materials and tools, life savings and generations-old family heirlooms. As the fire spread towards the edge of the village, Tad helped his wife Sabai, particularly vulnerable in her blindness, escape the flames, grabbing his drum and her betel nuts as they ran. All the Moken women and children were evacuated to a campsite on a neighbouring island within Surin\u2019s national park, but the following day, they returned to the village, preferring to sleep under the stars than canvas. The park authorities and the Thai navy were on the scene fast. Government officials had provisions delivered from the mainland and committed financial assistance. Donations and aid arrived in the form of food, medical supplies, clothes. Daily life is challenging. There is one water hose for the whole village. A few coal stoves are distributed for cooking. But the Moken are well practised in sharing \u2013 their language has no word for \u201cwant\u201d, \u201ctake\u201d, \u201cmine\u201d. People sleep on the beach, in the school, and share the 15 huts that the villagers saved, thanks to a space separating them from the main cluster. The government has sent soldiers from Surathani to help reconstruct the village, before the rainy season comes at the end of March. Their time \u2013 and funding \u2013 is limited, and, in the rush to rebuild, all signs point to a quick reconstruction of the original confined layout \u2013 the same rows of small huts packed into the same tight space, built with the same flammable materials. But the Moken have now seen exactly how dangerous this layout is. \u201cWe have large tour groups here in the dry season,\u201d says Hook. \u201cWith the villagers and so many tourists in our small bay, we worry about this happening again, about people being injured or worse.\u201d Regardless, the soldiers have been digging holes, laying foundations and poles for 61 plots within the same perimeters. The size allocated for each home is impossibly small \u2013 just 3m by 6.5m. \u201cMy family houses six people,\u201d despairs Mi Nge. \u201cThere will be just 3m by 4m inside space for my family to sleep, store our belongings, and a kitchen.\u201d There has been consultation between provincial government, the national park and navy, but not, it appears, with the Moken. \u201cWe Moken men are well experienced in building our own houses,\u201d points out Hook. \u201cWhy is no one asking us, how and where we want to set up our own houses?\u201d Ngui, Hook\u2019s elder brother, is the head of the village. While he appreciates government assistance, he shares concern that the planned housing is unsuitable and unsafe. \u201cThey said they would show us the plan to see if it fits our needs,\u201d he says. \u201cNo has come around to ask us, yet they already started placing the poles of the houses.\u201d He is worried about future fire risks, and how his growing community will fit into this increasingly uninhabitable space. The Moken know better than anyone how to organise and structure their village, safely and sustainably, in harmony with the environment. \u201cIt would be great to rebuild the wood houses with thatch roofs, but more spread out and durably constructed,\u201d says Ngui. Ngui wants more space, and there is room to extend along the bay. But so far, the national park authorities refuse. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that we would expand any development beyond the current beach,\u201d said Putthapoj Khuphrasit, the head of Koh Surin national park, as he surveyed the bay on 8 February. \u201cWe have to balance the needs of the community with the management of the protected environment inside of the park.\u201d There is another option the park won\u2019t yet discuss \u2013 the use of a bay nearby. For generations, Moken lived between several bays on Koh Surin, including Au Bon Yai bay and Sai En bay (where they buried their ancestors) long before the park existed; these lands are, by rights, their ancestral home. The obvious solution would be to return both bays to the Moken to live in and manage. As General Surin Pikulthong, a member of the Committee for the Affairs of Indigenous Peoples, puts it: \u201cThey have been here longer than any of us \u2026 there is no law that gives the government power to dictate the lives of ethnic groups who predated the government that are living on their ancestral lands.\u201d The Moken have been here before. They are a resilient and resourceful people. When the 2004 tsunami struck, they survived thanks to intimate knowledge of the sea, passed down through generations. As people around the world stared in wonder at the receding water that came before that devastating wave, Moken elders read the danger and quickly evacuated everyone \u2013 their own people, and tourists \u2013 to higher ground. Then they rescued survivors at sea. More than 230,000 people were lost in the tsunami worldwide; the Moken, who were directly in the path of the wave, lost no one. The real trauma came in the reconstruction of their homes. The national park authorities\u2019 demands rode roughshod over Moken cultural traditions. Normally, the animist Moken erect their huts at the edge of the beach, stilted feet in the water, living in the space between land and sea, like their mythical kin, the turtle. When they were pushed to the smaller bay, the park insisted on the current formation of small huts in regimented lines, tightly packed together (lacking important social spaces), facing each other (considered an ill omen) set back from the sea, and near the jungle (where spirits are believed to reside). As well as cultural traditions, there was a pragmatism to the Moken\u2019s living arrangements, their huts spaced safely apart at the waters\u2019 edge, the lapping waves washing away small amounts of natural waste generated from each household. The layout insisted upon by the park not only disregarded important cultural traditions, it created problems with hygiene, contributed to the spread of disease. And of course, it was a huge fire hazard. Talking to reporters on his recent visit to the decimated village, Putthapoj Khuphrasit dismissed concerns about safety, pointing \u2013 somewhat irrelevantly \u2013 to the fact that the park employs Moken people. \u201cWe provide them with breakfast and lunch,\u201d he offered, adding: \u201cThe village elders are able to stay at home and make souvenirs to sell to tourists. They have what they need.\u201d Narumon Arunothai, an anthropologist from Chulalongkorn University who has worked with the Moken for decades, disagrees. \u201cIn the minds of the community this space could be used to greatly reduce the congested current layout, and ensure sufficient fire break areas to prevent further accidents.\u201d She wants government agencies to work with the Moken. \u201cThis crisis presents an opportunity for the community to bring themselves together and develop the best way to live in a conservation area.\u201d The Surin Moken know and love their land better than anyone. They are highly motivated to look after it. \u201cI was born here, my mother and father died here,\u201d says Misia, an elder and the Moken\u2019s spiritual leader. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my children, my grandchildren, my nephews and nieces. I worry that we won\u2019t be happy. We\u2019ve had many people try to convince us to live on the mainland.

      "body": "<p>We asked readers to get in touch and tell us what GP care was like for trans men and women. While some told us of good relationships, many others raised serious concerns.</p> <h2><strong>Being </strong><strong>outed</strong><strong> by healthcare professionals</strong></h2> <p>Francis, a 23-year-old trans man, was outed to other medics by his GP. \u201cI needed a referral to a neurologist and I ended up having a brain scan \u2013 and the referral to the neurologist mentioned that I was trans,\u201d he says. \u201cI admit there are times when you might have to mention it otherwise it\u2019ll be confusing, but I don\u2019t think a brain scan is one of those times.\u201d</p> <p>Win Wyatt, an 18-year-old trans man, was told he needed to come out as trans to his parents before receiving any further help. Getting hold of prescriptions, he said, could be difficult: one situation at a pharmacy involved having to disclose he was trans in front of a queue of people.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the pill,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stood at the counter for an hour and a half because they were very confused as to why they were giving me this medication because obviously my biological gender marker or whatever was not marked on my prescription and my name was Winston Wyatt. And they were like, \u2018this is not for you\u2019 and I was like, \u2018it is, it is for me actually\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hostil</strong><strong>ity and a lack of education </strong><strong>on gender issues</strong></h2> <p>Ali Brumfitt, 45, who identifies as gender queer,went to the doctor to talk about difficulties relating to the menopause. But the GP insisted that Brumfitt explain whether they were \u201ca man or a woman now\u201d. \u201cI was like, \u2018well, I was assigned female at birth and I am not taking hormones \u2026 and I do have a womb\u2019,\u201d said Brumfitt.</p> <p>But that was not enough for the doctor. \u201c\u2018Look, I am just trying to get my head around it\u2019, is what he said to me. \u2018Are you a man or a woman? And were you born a man or a woman and what are you now?\u2019,\u201d Brumfitt recalls. \u201cHe just was really angry with me, he was very patronising. And I was in tears and shaking by this point.\u201d</p> <p>Jack Doyle, 26, a graduate student who acts as a healthcare advocate for trans people, said having to be an expert in their own healthcare puts a huge strain on trans men and women.</p> <p>\u201cIt essentially makes a really life-saving kind of care dependant on your ability to be resilient, and to be prepared to go through something that I think a lot of patients don\u2019t ever have to go through in terms of being vulnerable and being willing to have basic dignity and selfhood challenged,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd a lot of people can\u2019t do that, a lot of people just can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t go to the doctors any more, they stop going on care, they self-medicate, or they self-harm, or they they experience suicidal ideation and that is often where we as advocates actually have to step in and unfortunately not enough people know that advocacy is an option.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/26/trans-patients-in-england-face-soul-destroying-wait-for-treatment\">Trans patients in England face 'soul destroying' wait for treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Problems with referrals to </strong><strong>gender </strong><strong>identity </strong><strong>clinics (GICs)</strong></h2> <p>Charlie Knowles, a 19-year-old trans man, said he was left distraught after it emerged his referral to a gender identity clinic had been lost \u2013 something he only discovered after waiting almost two years for an appointment.</p> <p>\u201cI remember sitting on the bus on the way home and just crying because I knew I was then looking at another two-year waiting list,\u201d he said, adding that his life was now on hold. \u201cI was going to uni in September 2018 but I didn\u2019t end up going\u2026 I really badly wanted to have started at least some sort of hormone therapy or something before I made that big sort of change in my life. I wanted to go into uni as myself rather than, like, I look like a prepubescent teenage boy.\u201d</p> <p>Kimberley, a 31-year-old trans woman, was initially, and wrongly, sent to mental health services after talking to her GP in 2016. Six months later she was referred to a GIC \u2013 but has yet to have an appointment. She said the lack of contact after the initial acknowledgement left her feeling very alone. \u201cUnless you keep pushing you don\u2019t hear anything. I have received nothing from the clinics themselves since I was referred,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The idea of surgery was a distant thought, given that that was only considered by doctors after an individual had been seen at a GIC, and been on hormones for a certain time, Kimberley said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it is ever going to happen because it is just this constant thing of waiting, and because I have not heard anything, because nobody gets in contact, if I am having any problems I am here on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nobody who understands that can talk through it with me.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Smith, a 23-year-old trans man, also experienced problems with communication after his referral. \u201cI have just not heard anything at all from the gender identity clinic. I have not had a letter, I have not had any receipt of confirmation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prospect of a lengthy wait left him feeling down and drove him to seek private healthcare in the interim. \u201cI am going to a clinic in London and it was a big decision for me because it is a lot of my savings I am spending on these appointments but that is the only thing that has really given me some hope that things are going to get better in a relatively less-bad time frame,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>Access to healthcare, he added, was a key concern for trans men and women. \u201cI see a lot of articles that are \u2026 sensationalising things or trying to create some controversy over things like what toilets we use and things like that. But actually I think this is the biggest thing that affects transgender people\u2019s lives and this is what we struggle with, getting the healthcare we need. We just want to get on with our lives and just live normal lives really.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Feeling like trust in the doctor has been eroded</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI do feel nervous about going [to the GP], particularly anything where I am going to have to mention anything about gender and/or surgery, because I feel they then go off on a complete tangent,\u201d said Brumfitt. \u201cA bit like if you are obese, they just think everything that is wrong with you is because you are fat.\u201d</p> <p>Eric, a 36-year-old trans man, expressed similar concerns. \u201c I have never been a massive fan of going to the doctor for every little thing anyway, but I will avoid it probably longer than I should,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I should be going to see the GP at the moment for something completely unrelated to gender identity, hormones or anything else and I have been putting it off for quite some time,\u201d he said. The presence of gender dysphoria and contact with mental health professionals on his records meant such topics were invariably raised, regardless of why he was visiting the GP, he said.</p> <h2><strong>Problems with GP records</strong></h2> <p>Annabelle, 38, a trans woman, tried to find out what updating her gender marker to female on her records would mean for her medical care after her practice manager asked if she would like it to be changed.</p> <p>\u201cI was like I don\u2019t know actually because what are the implications for managing my health provision moving forwards?,\u201d she said, adding that, for example, in the case of an accident it would be important for doctors to know she would not be expected to be pregnant. The upshot was a phone call that lasted around two hours. \u201cI was trying to ask them what the medical implications were of them changing my gender marker on my notes and they were trying to do the politically correct thing of saying well it is what you want, it is not about what we want.\u201d</p> <p>In the end Annabelle had her gender marker updated. A week later she received a letter inviting her for cervical screening \u2013 despite not having such anatomy.</p> <h2><strong>Lack of information on health issues</strong></h2> <p>Some have complained about a lack of information on how health matters common to cis men and women might affect those who are gender queer or who transition to a different gender.</p> <p>\u201cIt is bad enough trying to find info on menopause but trying to find something on how it affects someone like me has been really, really difficult,\u201d said Brumfitt.</p> <h2><strong>Difficulties accessing \u2018bridging hormones\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kimberley was told by her GP that he would only take over prescribing hormone therapy if she was self-medicating. So that\u2019s what she did \u2013 but no help was given. \u201cI have had to do it all on my own, which of course is incredibly risky,\u201d she said, although she said the medication has been very beneficial to her.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, after disclosing the source of her hormones, Kimberley found the website was soon shut down. \u201cI went into withdrawal and within six weeks I had spent a night in hospital because I had tried to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a couple of additional factors, things that were going on outside of that process, but it was the testosterone coming back into my system that really made me paranoid and quite aggressive and I just couldn\u2019t cope. The main part of it was that I couldn\u2019t get what I needed.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

And were you born a man or a woman and what are you now?\u2019,\u201d Brumfitt recalls. \u201cHe just was really angry with me, he was very patronising. And I was in tears and shaking by this point.\u201d Jack Doyle, 26, a graduate student who acts as a healthcare advocate for trans people, said having to be an expert in their own healthcare puts a huge strain on trans men and women. \u201cIt essentially makes a really life-saving kind of care dependant on your ability to be resilient, and to be prepared to go through something that I think a lot of patients don\u2019t ever have to go through in terms of being vulnerable and being willing to have basic dignity and selfhood challenged,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of people can\u2019t do that, a lot of people just can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t go to the doctors any more, they stop going on care, they self-medicate, or they self-harm, or they they experience suicidal ideation and that is often where we as advocates actually have to step in and unfortunately not enough people know that advocacy is an option.\u201d Problems with referrals to gender identity clinics (GICs) Charlie Knowles, a 19-year-old trans man, said he was left distraught after it emerged his referral to a gender identity clinic had been lost \u2013 something he only discovered after waiting almost two years for an appointment. \u201cI remember sitting on the bus on the way home and just crying because I knew I was then looking at another two-year waiting list,\u201d he said, adding that his life was now on hold. \u201cI was going to uni in September 2018 but I didn\u2019t end up going\u2026 I really badly wanted to have started at least some sort of hormone therapy or something before I made that big sort of change in my life. I wanted to go into uni as myself rather than, like, I look like a prepubescent teenage boy.\u201d Kimberley, a 31-year-old trans woman, was initially, and wrongly, sent to mental health services after talking to her GP in 2016. Six months later she was referred to a GIC \u2013 but has yet to have an appointment. She said the lack of contact after the initial acknowledgement left her feeling very alone. \u201cUnless you keep pushing you don\u2019t hear anything. I have received nothing from the clinics themselves since I was referred,\u201d she said. The idea of surgery was a distant thought, given that that was only considered by doctors after an individual had been seen at a GIC, and been on hormones for a certain time, Kimberley said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it is ever going to happen because it is just this constant thing of waiting, and because I have not heard anything, because nobody gets in contact, if I am having any problems I am here on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nobody who understands that can talk through it with me.\u201d Edward Smith, a 23-year-old trans man, also experienced problems with communication after his referral. \u201cI have just not heard anything at all from the gender identity clinic. I have not had a letter, I have not had any receipt of confirmation,\u201d he said. The prospect of a lengthy wait left him feeling down and drove him to seek private healthcare in the interim. \u201cI am going to a clinic in London and it was a big decision for me because it is a lot of my savings I am spending on these appointments but that is the only thing that has really given me some hope that things are going to get better in a relatively less-bad time frame,\u201d Smith said. Access to healthcare, he added, was a key concern for trans men and women. \u201cI see a lot of articles that are \u2026 sensationalising things or trying to create some controversy over things like what toilets we use and things like that. But actually I think this is the biggest thing that affects transgender people\u2019s lives and this is what we struggle with, getting the healthcare we need. We just want to get on with our lives and just live normal lives really.\u201d Feeling like trust in the doctor has been eroded \u201cI do feel nervous about going [to the GP], particularly anything where I am going to have to mention anything about gender and/or surgery, because I feel they then go off on a complete tangent,\u201d said Brumfitt. \u201cA bit like if you are obese, they just think everything that is wrong with you is because you are fat.\u201d Eric, a 36-year-old trans man, expressed similar concerns. \u201c I have never been a massive fan of going to the doctor for every little thing anyway, but I will avoid it probably longer than I should,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I should be going to see the GP at the moment for something completely unrelated to gender identity, hormones or anything else and I have been putting it off for quite some time,\u201d he said. The presence of gender dysphoria and contact with mental health professionals on his records meant such topics were invariably raised, regardless of why he was visiting the GP, he said. Problems with GP records Annabelle, 38, a trans woman, tried to find out what updating her gender marker to female on her records would mean for her medical care after her practice manager asked if she would like it to be changed. \u201cI was like I don\u2019t know actually because what are the implications for managing my health provision moving forwards?,\u201d she said, adding that, for example, in the case of an accident it would be important for doctors to know she would not be expected to be pregnant. The upshot was a phone call that lasted around two hours. \u201cI was trying to ask them what the medical implications were of them changing my gender marker on my notes and they were trying to do the politically correct thing of saying well it is what you want, it is not about what we want.\u201d In the end Annabelle had her gender marker updated. A week later she received a letter inviting her for cervical screening \u2013 despite not having such anatomy. Lack of information on health issues Some have complained about a lack of information on how health matters common to cis men and women might affect those who are gender queer or who transition to a different gender. \u201cIt is bad enough trying to find info on menopause but trying to find something on how it affects someone like me has been really, really difficult,\u201d said Brumfitt. Difficulties accessing \u2018bridging hormones\u2019 Kimberley was told by her GP that he would only take over prescribing hormone therapy if she was self-medicating. So that\u2019s what she did \u2013 but no help was given. \u201cI have had to do it all on my own, which of course is incredibly risky,\u201d she said, although she said the medication has been very beneficial to her. What\u2019s more, after disclosing the source of her hormones, Kimberley found the website was soon shut down. \u201cI went into withdrawal and within six weeks I had spent a night in hospital because I had tried to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were a couple of additional factors, things that were going on outside of that process, but it was the testosterone coming back into my system that really made me paranoid and quite aggressive and I just couldn\u2019t cope. The main part of it was that I couldn\u2019t get what I needed.\u201d Some names have been changed",

The move by Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen underlines how the PM has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/22/has-may-finally-exhausted-her-colleagues-patience\">exhausted many of her MPs\u2019 patience</a>.</p> <p>On the good news front, analysts predicted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/23/uk-food-imports-from-eu-face-9bn-tariff-bill-under-no-deal-brexit\">UK food imports from the EU would face a \u00a39bn tariff bill</a> under a no-deal Brexit, with retailers warning of tariffs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/uk-and-ireland-retailers-warn-of-40-tariffs-on-food-in-no-deal-brexit\">up to 40% being imposed on key foodstuffs</a> if the UK crashes out without an agreement.</p> <h2>What next</h2> <p>The final Brexit countdown is now under way. Crucial to it is an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin. This would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.</p> <p>If the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes and Cox succeeds in coming up with some form of codicil making the non-permanent nature of the backstop solid enough to satisfy the Brexiters, the amended deal \u2013 with the alternative being a very long article 50 extension \u2013 could conceivably win Commons approval on 13 March.</p> <p>May would then, inevitably, have to ask for a brief extension, maybe two months, to get the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the full Brexit legislation \u2013 through parliament. The EU27 could sign off on the deal at their summit on 21/22 March. And Brexit might then (after a lot of ifs and buts) happen at the beginning of the summer.</p> <p>A lot, though, could still go wrong for May, including mass resignations from the government by members determined to ensure a no-deal Brexit is averted by voting for Cooper-Letwin.

Faced with yet more can-kicking, an increasingly exasperated EU27 \u2013 determined to avoid the uncertainty of repeated three-month extension requests \u2013 let it be known it might just prefer delaying Brexit until 2021 while the UK sorts itself out.

The government revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/hub-in-belgium-to-keep-nhs-supplied-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit\">it has created a logistics hub in Belgium</a> where vital medical supplies will be stockpiled to stop the NHS running out.</p> <p>Warren says she does not feel reassured by the government statements. \u201cI am very aware that my condition is very serious.

Such is the fine line between life and death caused by toxins, that those on dialysis in hospitals two or three times a week have to limit fluid intake including water, tea and coffee to just 500ml to 800ml a day.</p> <p>After years of dialysis in hospital, Warren now rinses her blood while she is sleeping five nights a week.</p> <p>A lorry delivers supplies to her home every month as all the devices or consumables in the dialysis process have to be changed each time to guard against infection.

      "bodyText": "A woman who has been on kidney dialysis for 21 years has told how she fears she could die in a no-deal Brexit because irresponsible politicians are playing with people\u2019s lives. She says she is so concerned that she is prepared to go on dialysis strike outside Downing Street to drive home the dangers facing her and other home dialysis patients. Madeleine Warren needs a daily supply of 15 consumables including syringes, blood lines and acid fluid to allow her to conduct home dialysis five nights a week, but the supply is threatened in a no-deal scenario as half of the items are made in the EU. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get my dialysis supplies, it would kill me,\u201d said Warren, a former executive at Goldman Sachs. \u201cIf there was serious disruption to certain supplies and you couldn\u2019t do dialysis, then within a week you could die.\u201d She spoke out as the government moved to try to reassure the public that medical supplies were secure in the event of crashing out of the EU. The government revealed it has created a logistics hub in Belgium where vital medical supplies will be stockpiled to stop the NHS running out. Warren says she does not feel reassured by the government statements. \u201cI am very aware that my condition is very serious. Things have happened before that have threatened my life and I am basically relying on a machine to keep me alive,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my mind I\u2019ve always thought if there was a war or an earthquake I could die, but I never thought it would be our government that would be creating that uncertainty over supplies. For this to be a political decision is beyond insane.\u201d Diagnosed with kidney failure when she was 13 after she was struck by an auto-immune condition, Warren explains that renal patients have to be vigilant about potassium and phosphates, minerals that for healthy are of little concern for healthy people. High levels of potassium can cause heart failure within a week. Such is the fine line between life and death caused by toxins, that those on dialysis in hospitals two or three times a week have to limit fluid intake including water, tea and coffee to just 500ml to 800ml a day. After years of dialysis in hospital, Warren now rinses her blood while she is sleeping five nights a week. A lorry delivers supplies to her home every month as all the devices or consumables in the dialysis process have to be changed each time to guard against infection. She fears any disruption in the EU supply chain to Britain could cost her dearly. \u201cStock management is critical. I treat running my machine like a second job,\u201d she says. Warren adds that she has had no reassurance that supplies will be secure either from the renal unit at the hospital or the government. \u201cI am not a scaremonger but I already have experience of what even the smallest disruption can cause. If one of the 15 items is missing I can\u2019t do the dialysis. My entire life depends on this machine working.\u201d Warren is speaking out because she feels the government does not know the danger that people like her feel in, otherwise it would have taken a no-deal Brexit off the table. \u201cPeople know about cancer, they know it is very serious, but they don\u2019t know that if you don\u2019t have kidneys you can die very rapidly.\u201d Warren says she is prepared to \u201cgo on strike\u201d outside Downing Street to make her point. \u201cThere are a group of people in power who have the power to do something about this and they are not doing it.\u201d Fiona Loud, the policy director of Kidney Care UK, said Monday\u2019s statement on medical supplies wasn\u2019t specific enough for people like Warren. \u201cWe need clarification from the government to help us understand how our exit from the EU will affect kidney patients.

      "bodyText": "If my canoe makes a noise when I smash sideways into the rock, I don\u2019t hear it. The rapids drown everything. For a moment the canoe is stationary, then it fills with water and tips me out. I try to swim to the bank but make no headway against the current. I remember that the Maoris say their ancestors dwell in the river and I wonder if I am about to become intimately acquainted with them. I have spent three days on the Whanganui River in New Zealand\u2019s North Island. The Whanganui is the country\u2019s longest navigable river, yet it is notable for more than that \u2013 because this is a river that is also a person. In 2017, the local Maoris gained a ruling to give the river the legal status of personhood. \u201cThe river has always been a living entity to us,\u201d Maori campaigner Gerrard Albert told me. He believes the river\u2019s status will protect it: \u201cEveryone has to be conscious that the river has the right to continue to be in a healthy state.\u201d In 2014, the Te Urewera wilderness area on its eastern side also assumed the rights of a legal person. And last year nearby Mount Taranaki gained the same status. The Maoris believe there are no boundaries between themselves and the natural world: it is a continuum. The river\u2019s representatives are now waiting for the results of a study into its wellbeing. There are concerns about pollution from agriculture and damage from hydroelectric power schemes. The representatives are also deciding how to allocate a NZ$30m (\u00a316m) fund for environmental initiatives. The Whanganui rises near Mount Tongariro. According to Maori legend the river was created after Mount Taranaki ran away to its present position on the east coast and left a gash behind. Afterwards Mount Tongariro healed the wound with water and the Whanganui was born. My guide, Hemi Gray, grew up in the mountains. He\u2019s a mountain of a man himself, with a monolithic torso and shoulders. We join the river at the way station of Whakahoro, where I\u2019ve slept in former sheep shearers\u2019 quarters at the Blue Duck Station. The pulsing melodies of bellbirds fill the air, and the view is of a valley packed with spiky cabbage trees, palms and giant tree ferns. Significantly, there are conifers, too. \u201cYou see conifers where there have been human settlements,\u201d says Hemi. The area was farmed up to the 1950s before nature reclaimed it. As we begin canoeing I can see the forest continuing down the gorge. The high walls to either side and the saturation of greenery create an enclosed world. It\u2019s intensely peaceful \u2013 often we go an hour or more without encountering another vessel \u2013 but there is always something to see. A pair of mallards chug past. I also see kereru, New Zealand\u2019s large native wood pigeons, calling to each other. A large circular lesion in the gorge wall, framed by ferns and creepers, is Tamatea\u2019s Cave, a sacred place named for an early Maori explorer. Soon after, a couple of wild goats trot along the bank and turn to stare at us. A day-and-a-half of paddling brings us to the Bridge to Nowhere, a monument to the failed hopes of settlers. The concrete bridge was finished in 1936, but within a few years most of the farms to either side had been abandoned. The bridge spans a deep cleft over a tributary of the Whanganui, and in the water far below I can see eels more than a metre long and thicker than my arm (though not Hemi\u2019s). That evening we stop at the Maori settlement of Tieke Kainga, where we\u2019re to sleep in the community\u2019s marae, or meeting house. After landing we take part in a powhiri, or greeting ritual, with its kaitiaki (guardian), Woody Firmin. Part of this means us singing a song \u2013 our Fr\u00e8re Jacques is incongruous, but well-received. Then it\u2019s on to the marae\u2019s version of a hangi, or pit oven, for a meal Firmin prepared by wrapping chicken, lamb and sweet potato in leaves and letting them cook over hot stones. The final day brings the rapids. Oblivious to Hemi\u2019s instructions, I paddle left instead of right and hit the rock. Fortunately he\u2019s at hand to haul me, gasping, on to the bank. Notwithstanding my involuntary baptism I can see why \u2013 even though it is not actually a walk \u2013 canoeing or kayaking the Whanganui is one of New Zealand\u2019s 10 Great Walks. Returning to the tumult of the world is hard, but it is consoling to recall Firmin\u2019s farewell: \u201cYou\u2019ll always be a part of the river now. And you\u2019ll be a part of us, too.\u201d \u2022 The trip was provided by Tourism New Zealand (tourismnewzealand.com) and Singapore Airlines (singaporeair.com).

Once praised by Pope Francis for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, the Australian cardinal\u2019s reputation is in ruins after a jury in Melbourne found him guilty of five charges \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/who-is-george-pell-and-what-has-he-been-convicted-of\">one of sexually penetrating a child under</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/cardinal-george-pell-vatican-treasurer-found-guilty-of-child-sexual-assault\">16 </a>and four of an indecent act with a child under 16. The charges date back to 1996 and 1997, months after Pell was inaugurated as the city\u2019s archbishop. The jury found that he walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday mass and then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. Pell then forced one of the boys\u2019 heads on to his penis, orally raping him. Once he had finished, Pell ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself.</p> \n<p>The verdict was delivered in December but was subject to a suppression order because of a possible second trial, over different allegations, now dropped. Dozens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/26/dozens-of-journalists-accused-of-breaking-pell-trial-suppression-order-face-possible-jail-terms\">journalists and news outlets</a> who alluded to the verdict at the time it was delivered face prosecutions and possible jail terms for contempt of court. It was the second time in the space of a few months that Pell had been tried for the crimes; in August he had faced a jury who were unable to reach a verdict.</p> \n<p>You can read the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/five-times-guilty-how-george-pells-child-abusing-past-caught-up-with-him-in-courtroom-43\">inside account of the two trials here</a>, by the Guardian\u2019s Melissa Davey, who sat through every day of evidence.

It follows a concerted push by Keir Starmer and Tom Watson, who fear any further delay may have led to more defections to the Independent Group. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs last night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum. You can read about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/what-does-labour-brexit-second-vote-referendum-commitment-mean\">implications for Labour of Corbyn\u2019s move here</a>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/tories-urge-theresa-may-not-to-delay-ruling-out-no-deal-brexit\">is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion</a> this morning, before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/24/theresa-may-brexit-vote-delay-what-does-it-all-mean\">vote on Wednesday</a> on a cross-party amendment laid by the Tory Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. The PM\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March.</p> \n<p>In other Brexit news, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/26/britons-face-five-hour-airport-queues-in-spain-with-no-deal-brexit\">Britons could face five-hour airport queues in Spain</a> in the event of no deal, with Alicante airport likely to be worst affected, according to Which?</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Kashmir crisis</strong> \u2013 India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/26/pakistan-india-jets-breached-ceasefire-line-kashmir-bomb\">has launched airstrikes</a> on what it calls \u201cterror camps\u201d across the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan said there was no damage or casualties in the first aerial bombing over the border since the two countries went to war in 1971. The operation comes amid the highest tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/indian-pm-modi-pakistan-pay-heavy-price-kashmir-bombing\">after a suicide attack on a convoy carrying 2,500 Indian security personnel killed at least 40 earlier this month.</a> India says its neighbour had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d in the attack.

In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Researchers who carried out the study, based on 20,000 British adults, suggests this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Women are also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday (4.6% and 3.4% more likely).</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Unwanted sexual behaviour </strong>\u2013 More than half of students at UK universities say they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/26/more-than-half-of-uk-students-say-they-have-faced-unwanted-sexual-behaviour\">victims of unwanted advances and assault</a>, but only a fraction reported the incidents. The behaviour ranged from explicit messages to rape, new research for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In shows. A survey of 5,649 students found many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence. The study, conducted in January, showed 53% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sleep like a baby? </strong>\u2013 Starting a family is a well-known sleep killer, but new research suggests the exhaustion might go on for six years. Researchers at the University of Warwick tracking the sleep of thousands of men and women found sleep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/26/parenthood-sleep-deprivation-after-birth-mothers-hit-hardest-research\">hits a low about three months after birth </a>\u2013 with the effect strongest in women. The team found the impact of the first child lingered for both parents. Even once the impact of subsequent children was taken into account, women were still relatively sleep deprived, both in terms of quality and quantity, four to six years after their first child\u2019s birth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"098dcce9e41da18957a330e7dc499a4f69966293\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/098dcce9e41da18957a330e7dc499a4f69966293/0_0_5123_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The study found mothers lost about 40 minutes of sleep a night in the year after the birth of a child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The study found mothers lost about 40 minutes of sleep a night in the year after the birth of a child.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More warm weather </strong>\u2013 The Met Office says today\u2019s temperatures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/26/uk-weather-tuesday-may-eclipse-mondays-record-temperatures\">could rival Monday\u2019s record-breaking highs</a>, where three places in the UK pushed the mercury over 20C. \u201cWe could well again see similar values,\u201d the Met\u2019s Luke Miall said. \u201cWhether it will be record-breaking again, we\u2019re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.\u201d The day is likely to start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20C.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Pell\u2019s bombshell conviction a blow for the pope This is Alison Rourke bringing you today\u2019s briefing. The conviction and likely imprisonment of Cardinal George Pell, the third most senior Catholic in the world and the Vatican\u2019s treasurer, will send shockwaves through the church\u2019s global congregation. Once praised by Pope Francis for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, the Australian cardinal\u2019s reputation is in ruins after a jury in Melbourne found him guilty of five charges \u2013 one of sexually penetrating a child under 16 and four of an indecent act with a child under 16. The charges date back to 1996 and 1997, months after Pell was inaugurated as the city\u2019s archbishop. The jury found that he walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday mass and then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. Pell then forced one of the boys\u2019 heads on to his penis, orally raping him. Once he had finished, Pell ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself. The verdict was delivered in December but was subject to a suppression order because of a possible second trial, over different allegations, now dropped. Dozens of journalists and news outlets who alluded to the verdict at the time it was delivered face prosecutions and possible jail terms for contempt of court. It was the second time in the space of a few months that Pell had been tried for the crimes; in August he had faced a jury who were unable to reach a verdict. You can read the inside account of the two trials here, by the Guardian\u2019s Melissa Davey, who sat through every day of evidence. You can read David Marr\u2019s account of how the \u201cbrutal and dogmatic\u201d Pell waged war on sex \u2013 even as he abused children. And you can read the Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood\u2019s take on the implications of Pell\u2019s conviction for the pope\u2019s push to rid the Catholic church of child abuse. * * * Corbyn\u2019s change\u2013 The Labour party leader has finally put his weight behind a second Brexit referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if the party fails to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. It follows a concerted push by Keir Starmer and Tom Watson, who fear any further delay may have led to more defections to the Independent Group. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs last night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum. You can read about the implications for Labour of Corbyn\u2019s move here. Meanwhile, Theresa May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion this morning, before a vote on Wednesday on a cross-party amendment laid by the Tory Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. The PM\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March. In other Brexit news, Britons could face five-hour airport queues in Spain in the event of no deal, with Alicante airport likely to be worst affected, according to Which? * * * Kashmir crisis \u2013 India has launched airstrikes on what it calls \u201cterror camps\u201d across the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan said there was no damage or casualties in the first aerial bombing over the border since the two countries went to war in 1971. The operation comes amid the highest tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in years, after a suicide attack on a convoy carrying 2,500 Indian security personnel killed at least 40 earlier this month. India says its neighbour had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d in the attack. Pakistan denies any involvement. * * * Depression \u2013 Women working more than 55 hours a week are more likely to suffer than those who work 35-40 hours, a study has found. In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Researchers who carried out the study, based on 20,000 British adults, suggests this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Women are also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday (4.6% and 3.4% more likely). * * * Unwanted sexual behaviour \u2013 More than half of students at UK universities say they are victims of unwanted advances and assault, but only a fraction reported the incidents. The behaviour ranged from explicit messages to rape, new research for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In shows. A survey of 5,649 students found many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence. The study, conducted in January, showed 53% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour. * * * Sleep like a baby? \u2013 Starting a family is a well-known sleep killer, but new research suggests the exhaustion might go on for six years. Researchers at the University of Warwick tracking the sleep of thousands of men and women found sleep hits a low about three months after birth \u2013 with the effect strongest in women. The team found the impact of the first child lingered for both parents. Even once the impact of subsequent children was taken into account, women were still relatively sleep deprived, both in terms of quality and quantity, four to six years after their first child\u2019s birth. * * * More warm weather \u2013 The Met Office says today\u2019s temperatures could rival Monday\u2019s record-breaking highs, where three places in the UK pushed the mercury over 20C. \u201cWe could well again see similar values,\u201d the Met\u2019s Luke Miall said. \u201cWhether it will be record-breaking again, we\u2019re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.\u201d The day is likely to start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20C. North-west Wales and London are most likely to feel the highest temperatures. Today in Focus podcast: The fit-for-work scandal After a picture of 64-year-old Stephen Smith\u2019s emaciated frame went viral, the Department for Work and Pensions apologised for passing him fit to work. It was the latest example of how reforms to disability benefits are hitting some of Britain\u2019s most disadvantaged people. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Butler explains how we got here. Plus: Polly Toynbee welcomes Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s move towards backing a new Brexit referendum. Lunchtime read: Five stars for This time with Alan Partridge Alan Partridge\u2019s return to TV is an excruciating white-knuckle ride, writes Lucy Mangan. After half an hour in his appalling company, you\u2019ll be limp from laughter, loathing, panic and despair. It\u2019s the character\u2019s first proper run-out since his 2013 feature film Alpha Papa, and is co-written and directed by twin brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who have become not just keepers of the flame but fuel and bellows for it too. This Time brings Alan back, in all his glory and his tragedy, at just the right time. He surely voted Leave but, as a man of no convictions or courage, must now want to remain. We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Sport Evidence supplied by Dario Gradi related to the Barry Bennell scandal can be revealed by the Guardian and includes an admission that he encouraged the culture at Crewe Alexandra for coaches to invite boys to stay overnight, or even take them on holidays abroad. David Luiz has delivered a public show of support for Maurizio Sarri and insisted Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s refusal to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final was not indicative of a lack of respect within the Chelsea squad for their beleaguered head coach. Jarrell \u201cBig Baby\u201d Miller has claimed, with no evidence, that the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua has used performance-enhancing drugs. England Women fell to a seven-wicket defeat against India in the second one-day international in Mumbai as the hosts secured victory in the series, while the men\u2019s third ODI against West Indies in Grenada was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Maro Itoje has not been deemed fit enough to take a full part in England\u2019s Six Nations training camp in Oxford this week and Charlie Ewels has been called up in place of the injured Courtney Lawes. The plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn. And the Guardian won two awards and was highly commended in four other categories at the Sports Journalists\u2019 Association awards; Donald McRae was named sports feature writer of the year while Daniel Taylor was named football writer of the year. Business Asian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing could clinch a trade deal. Meanwhile, sterling jumped to a near four-week high ($1.3149) in early Asian trading after Bloomberg reported Theresa May could allow her cabinet to discuss extending the Brexit deadline beyond 29 March at a meeting later today. The pound is buying $1.31 and \u20ac1.16. The papers Labour\u2019s announcement it would back a second Brexit referendum leads most front pages today, many of which went to print before the Cardinal Pell news. Most also carry pictures of a triumphant Olivia Colman.

      "body": "<p>The greatest rock climber in the world is climbing the greatest rock in the world. Alex Honnold is on El Capitan, free-soloing it \u2013 meaning no rope, no one else, just a man alone on a wall. He is at the crux, the most difficult section, known as the boulder problem, the main problem being that it is really, really hard. But he moves gracefully, balletically even: drive up off the left foot into the thumb press, roll two fingers over the thumb, switch feet, left foot out to a bad sloping foothold, switch thumbs, reach out left to a grainy rounded hold before launching into the karate kick \u2026 And that is where he slips and falls.</p> <p>Not 700 metres to his death, though, which is what would have happened if he was on the real El Cap, in Yosemite, California. He is actually in Vauxhall, south London, at a climbing centre where they have tried to recreate the hardest section of the route that Honnold really did climb, alone and without a rope. So this time he has fallen about two and a half metres on to a crash mat, nothing hurt except a little pride. \u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d he laughs. Hahaha.</p> <p>Alex Honnold, now 33, has been a legend in the sport for a while, with a rack of insane firsts and nobody-will-evers hanging from his harness (except he doesn\u2019t usually wear one of those). With a goofy grin and a bad haircut, he has been fighting a single-handed battle against gravity, and winning. When, on 3 June 2017, he free-soloed the freerider route on El Capitan, the New York Times described it as \u201cone of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever\u201d.</p> <p>Then the film about that climb \u2013 Free Solo \u2013 came out, and the world outside the climbing community sat up and took note. It is a brilliant, beautiful film \u2013 not just the story of an incredible physical performance (with some of the most buttock-clenchingly tense viewing you\u2019re ever likely to squirm through), but a very human story of a remarkable, beguiling character. Oh, and it\u2019s a love story, too. It has just won the Oscar for best documentary, after winning a Bafta earlier in the month.</p> <p>Honnold is in town to promote the film. You can\u2019t keep him away from climbing for long, though, even in the city, and this is where he comes when he is in London. It\u2019s not unlike the climbing wall where he started off in Sacramento, he says. There is a buzz about the place among the men and women who work here \u2013 imagine Lionel Messi dropping in to your amateur football club.</p> <p>They have recreated this section of the boulder problem in his honour. But it\u2019s not quite right: this hold needs to come in a bit, the thumb press presses the wrong way, there shouldn\u2019t be a foothold on the end of the karate kick \u2026 He is telling them where everything should be from memory. He knows every millimetre of this section of El Capitan, practised it 40 or 50 times with a rope before attempting it without. That \u2013 the meticulous practice and preparation \u2013 is the key to not falling. If the recreated boulder problem was exactly the same as the real boulder problem, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11c5ed9edd74e18c12aaaea154ce68c368f746b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11c5ed9edd74e18c12aaaea154ce68c368f746b4/0_0_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honnold at Vauxwall East Climbing Centre in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honnold at VauxWall East climbing centre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Honnold climbs because he loves it; he grew up doing it. \u201cI like the movement, I like swinging, it all feels kinda playful and fun.\u201d But why without a rope, when the stakes are so much higher? He has obviously been asked the question a thousand times before, but he still seems to think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I say that climbing is all about fun; free soloing is sort of the extreme. If you do something for fun all the time, every once in a while you want to have consequences.\u201d</p> <p>I speak to Jimmy Chin, who filmed a lot of Free Solo and co-directed it with his wife, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, after a screening of the documentary. A hugely accomplished climber himself, he says he wouldn\u2019t attempt to free-solo a single pitch of El Capitan, but he understands what drove Honnold. \u201cIf you had a superpower and you could fly, you would probably do it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cThe drive and ambition to do something that pushes you, that you love \u2013 it\u2019s hard to put that away and not use it.\u201d</p> <p>Chin is in no doubt about what it meant to free-solo El Capitan, which he compares to an Olympic gold medal gymnastics floor routine. \u201cBut the floor routine is four hours long. And every single move, every second, you have to be performing perfectly, knowing that if you make a single mistake you would die.\u201d</p> <p>Honnold knew he wasn\u2019t going to fall off El Capitan because of the practice and preparation. What about all the other people mentioned in the film who have died free-soloing \u2013 people he knew, such as Ueli Steck? \u201cHe died climbing a mountain at 7,000 metres in the snow wearing crampons \u2013 it\u2019s a completely different experience,\u201d Honnold says. Another climbing legend, John Bachar? He did die free-soloing, but \u201cwith extenuating circumstances. He\u2019d been in this car accident and had nerve damage. He died soloing on something quite easy.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Potter, a free-soloing pal of Honnold\u2019s who also features in the film, died while Base jumping: jumping off a cliff with a parachute. Honnold wouldn\u2019t do that, \u201cbecause everyone dies, honestly\u201d. He explains the difference in risk. With Base jumping, you die unless everything works perfectly \u2013 the parachute opens, you\u2019re facing the right way when it does etc. With free-soloing, you\u2019re OK unless something goes badly wrong.</p> <p>If any of this talk about death \u2013 of people he knew and potentially his own \u2013 comes across as unfeeling or callous, it doesn\u2019t seem like that at the time. He just has a matter-of-fact directness that is arresting, but also honest and refreshing. He is not an adrenaline junkie thrill-seeker: he climbs because he loves to climb, not because of the danger of death. A lot of work goes into minimising that danger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c968c951d223b69e165aa0c94a91874c9172c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c968c951d223b69e165aa0c94a91874c9172c73/0_122_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honnold solos the Nose on El Capitan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honnold solos the Nose on El Capitan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aurora Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He boulders as we talk, picking his way up, sometimes three metres above me, stretched out, a human bridge between a couple of smears on the wall, then back down at ground level again. I have a go and I can\u2019t even get on to the beginning of the boulder problem; the idea of 600 metres of air below me is ridiculous. I try something easier and Honnold offers advice and encouragement from below. I do a bit of outdoor climbing, but I get scared high up on exposed routes. Keep on doing it until the fear goes away, he tells me.</p> <p>Eventually, we sit down. It\u2019s freezing, so he puts on a jacket by a well-known outdoor clothing company. It pays him about what a well-paid dentist gets, he says in the film. Since then, it has become more \u201clike a really successful orthodontist\u201d, he admits. Anyway, he is no longer a dirtbagger living in a van, but has a house in Las Vegas. If Vegas seems an unlikely place for him, it has nothing to do with the city itself and everything to do with the fact it is surrounded by some of the best climbing in the country.</p> <p>He lives with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, a life coach who plays a big part in Free Solo. That is the love story bit, although it\u2019s not easy dating a guy who crawls out of bed before dawn to go and hang off cliffs. When he reached the top of El Capitan after three hours 56 minutes (to put it in perspective, it took a German team of professional climbers doing it with ropes four days), with the biggest grin of his life, he called McCandless. \u201cI love you,\u201d he just about managed to say, awkwardly, before ruining it by downgrading it to: \u201cI appreciate you.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not really an I-love-you kind of guy, is he? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he agrees. Nor much of a hugger. That comes into the film, that there wasn\u2019t much hugging in his family growing up. One critic described it as \u201ca cautionary study of what can happen when you don\u2019t hug your children\u201d. But Honnold has taught himself to hug, he says, and he is getting better at it. Can I get one? Sure. We stand up and embrace; there is even a little shoulder- patting going on. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, huh?\u201d he says. It is \u2013 big strong arms.</p> <p>The no-huggy thing is part of something else going on in the film. He doesn\u2019t always seem switched on to McCandless\u2019s emotional expectations. His remark that previous girlfriends have accused him of having a personality disorder; his obsessiveness; the extraordinary detail of his preparations and the pages and pages of notes; the fact that he began to climb alone in Yosemite because it was easier than asking people to climb with him; his mum saying his dad had Asperger\u2019s \u2026 It is implicit rather than explicit, but you could easily come away from watching Free Solo thinking that Honnold might have a rubber-soled toehold somewhere on the spectrum.</p> <p>He recognises that people might think that, and that it is a seam in the film, and he is not surprised or in any way offended.

      "bodyText": "The greatest rock climber in the world is climbing the greatest rock in the world. Alex Honnold is on El Capitan, free-soloing it \u2013 meaning no rope, no one else, just a man alone on a wall. He is at the crux, the most difficult section, known as the boulder problem, the main problem being that it is really, really hard. But he moves gracefully, balletically even: drive up off the left foot into the thumb press, roll two fingers over the thumb, switch feet, left foot out to a bad sloping foothold, switch thumbs, reach out left to a grainy rounded hold before launching into the karate kick \u2026 And that is where he slips and falls. Not 700 metres to his death, though, which is what would have happened if he was on the real El Cap, in Yosemite, California. He is actually in Vauxhall, south London, at a climbing centre where they have tried to recreate the hardest section of the route that Honnold really did climb, alone and without a rope. So this time he has fallen about two and a half metres on to a crash mat, nothing hurt except a little pride. \u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d he laughs. Hahaha. Alex Honnold, now 33, has been a legend in the sport for a while, with a rack of insane firsts and nobody-will-evers hanging from his harness (except he doesn\u2019t usually wear one of those). With a goofy grin and a bad haircut, he has been fighting a single-handed battle against gravity, and winning. When, on 3 June 2017, he free-soloed the freerider route on El Capitan, the New York Times described it as \u201cone of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever\u201d. Then the film about that climb \u2013 Free Solo \u2013 came out, and the world outside the climbing community sat up and took note. It is a brilliant, beautiful film \u2013 not just the story of an incredible physical performance (with some of the most buttock-clenchingly tense viewing you\u2019re ever likely to squirm through), but a very human story of a remarkable, beguiling character. Oh, and it\u2019s a love story, too. It has just won the Oscar for best documentary, after winning a Bafta earlier in the month. Honnold is in town to promote the film. You can\u2019t keep him away from climbing for long, though, even in the city, and this is where he comes when he is in London. It\u2019s not unlike the climbing wall where he started off in Sacramento, he says. There is a buzz about the place among the men and women who work here \u2013 imagine Lionel Messi dropping in to your amateur football club. They have recreated this section of the boulder problem in his honour. But it\u2019s not quite right: this hold needs to come in a bit, the thumb press presses the wrong way, there shouldn\u2019t be a foothold on the end of the karate kick \u2026 He is telling them where everything should be from memory. He knows every millimetre of this section of El Capitan, practised it 40 or 50 times with a rope before attempting it without. That \u2013 the meticulous practice and preparation \u2013 is the key to not falling. If the recreated boulder problem was exactly the same as the real boulder problem, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. Honnold climbs because he loves it; he grew up doing it. \u201cI like the movement, I like swinging, it all feels kinda playful and fun.\u201d But why without a rope, when the stakes are so much higher? He has obviously been asked the question a thousand times before, but he still seems to think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I say that climbing is all about fun; free soloing is sort of the extreme. If you do something for fun all the time, every once in a while you want to have consequences.\u201d I speak to Jimmy Chin, who filmed a lot of Free Solo and co-directed it with his wife, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, after a screening of the documentary. A hugely accomplished climber himself, he says he wouldn\u2019t attempt to free-solo a single pitch of El Capitan, but he understands what drove Honnold. \u201cIf you had a superpower and you could fly, you would probably do it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cThe drive and ambition to do something that pushes you, that you love \u2013 it\u2019s hard to put that away and not use it.\u201d Chin is in no doubt about what it meant to free-solo El Capitan, which he compares to an Olympic gold medal gymnastics floor routine. \u201cBut the floor routine is four hours long. And every single move, every second, you have to be performing perfectly, knowing that if you make a single mistake you would die.\u201d Honnold knew he wasn\u2019t going to fall off El Capitan because of the practice and preparation. What about all the other people mentioned in the film who have died free-soloing \u2013 people he knew, such as Ueli Steck? \u201cHe died climbing a mountain at 7,000 metres in the snow wearing crampons \u2013 it\u2019s a completely different experience,\u201d Honnold says. Another climbing legend, John Bachar? He did die free-soloing, but \u201cwith extenuating circumstances. He\u2019d been in this car accident and had nerve damage. He died soloing on something quite easy.\u201d Dean Potter, a free-soloing pal of Honnold\u2019s who also features in the film, died while Base jumping: jumping off a cliff with a parachute. Honnold wouldn\u2019t do that, \u201cbecause everyone dies, honestly\u201d. He explains the difference in risk. With Base jumping, you die unless everything works perfectly \u2013 the parachute opens, you\u2019re facing the right way when it does etc. With free-soloing, you\u2019re OK unless something goes badly wrong. If any of this talk about death \u2013 of people he knew and potentially his own \u2013 comes across as unfeeling or callous, it doesn\u2019t seem like that at the time. He just has a matter-of-fact directness that is arresting, but also honest and refreshing. He is not an adrenaline junkie thrill-seeker: he climbs because he loves to climb, not because of the danger of death. A lot of work goes into minimising that danger. He boulders as we talk, picking his way up, sometimes three metres above me, stretched out, a human bridge between a couple of smears on the wall, then back down at ground level again. I have a go and I can\u2019t even get on to the beginning of the boulder problem; the idea of 600 metres of air below me is ridiculous. I try something easier and Honnold offers advice and encouragement from below. I do a bit of outdoor climbing, but I get scared high up on exposed routes. Keep on doing it until the fear goes away, he tells me. Eventually, we sit down. It\u2019s freezing, so he puts on a jacket by a well-known outdoor clothing company. It pays him about what a well-paid dentist gets, he says in the film. Since then, it has become more \u201clike a really successful orthodontist\u201d, he admits. Anyway, he is no longer a dirtbagger living in a van, but has a house in Las Vegas. If Vegas seems an unlikely place for him, it has nothing to do with the city itself and everything to do with the fact it is surrounded by some of the best climbing in the country. He lives with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, a life coach who plays a big part in Free Solo. That is the love story bit, although it\u2019s not easy dating a guy who crawls out of bed before dawn to go and hang off cliffs. When he reached the top of El Capitan after three hours 56 minutes (to put it in perspective, it took a German team of professional climbers doing it with ropes four days), with the biggest grin of his life, he called McCandless. \u201cI love you,\u201d he just about managed to say, awkwardly, before ruining it by downgrading it to: \u201cI appreciate you.\u201d He\u2019s not really an I-love-you kind of guy, is he? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he agrees. Nor much of a hugger. That comes into the film, that there wasn\u2019t much hugging in his family growing up. One critic described it as \u201ca cautionary study of what can happen when you don\u2019t hug your children\u201d. But Honnold has taught himself to hug, he says, and he is getting better at it. Can I get one? Sure. We stand up and embrace; there is even a little shoulder- patting going on. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, huh?\u201d he says. It is \u2013 big strong arms. The no-huggy thing is part of something else going on in the film. He doesn\u2019t always seem switched on to McCandless\u2019s emotional expectations. His remark that previous girlfriends have accused him of having a personality disorder; his obsessiveness; the extraordinary detail of his preparations and the pages and pages of notes; the fact that he began to climb alone in Yosemite because it was easier than asking people to climb with him; his mum saying his dad had Asperger\u2019s \u2026 It is implicit rather than explicit, but you could easily come away from watching Free Solo thinking that Honnold might have a rubber-soled toehold somewhere on the spectrum. He recognises that people might think that, and that it is a seam in the film, and he is not surprised or in any way offended. He wouldn\u2019t mind if he did have a spectrum disorder, but he doesn\u2019t think he does and picks holes in some of the evidence. He was shy, is shy, doesn\u2019t like talking to strangers much now (my hug is feeling more and more special), but he also wanted to climb on his own \u2013 there is a strong tradition of it in Yosemite. The obsessive focus and detail? Any elite climber would and has to do the same. He says he has no problem knowing what other people are thinking \u2013 McCandless, for example. \u201cI can tell she would prefer something different but, you know, do I have to? Is she going to leave me? No. So you\u2019re sort of like, well, I guess it\u2019s not that serious.\u201d Risk assessed, safe to continue, basically.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Deeply disturbing.\u201d That was how the prisons minister Rory Stewart summed up the state of some British prisons last year. After an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/17/uk-brutal-prisons-failing-violence-drugs-gangs\">Observer investigation</a> revealed that standards in two thirds of institutions were deemed sub-par and two in five unsafe, Stewart acknowledged \u201cincreasing levels of violence committed by prisoners, and horrifying rates of self-harm\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/06/fire-service-called-to-riot-at-bedford-prison\">Prison riots</a>, drug use, overcrowding and staff cuts are all widely reported.</p> <p>Our understanding of prison life is mostly shaped by such reportage or drama. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t seen by many people,\u201d says Anna Herrmann, co-artistic director of the <a href=\"https://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/\">Clean Break</a> theatre company. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we break down misconceptions.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s new show, <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/insidebitch/\">Inside Bitch</a> was conceived by writers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/13/deborah-pearson-made-visible-yard-theatre\">Deborah Pearson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/27/stacey-gregg-women-birth-choice-scorch\">Stacey Gregg</a>, and devised by four Clean Break members who are all women with experience of the penal system. It is an attempt to dismantle the pop-culture stereotypes passed down in TV dramas like Bad Girls and Orange is the New Black.</p> <p>\u201cThose representations can hinder the experiences of our members,\u201d says co-artistic director R\u00f3is\u00edn McBrinn, citing such programmes\u2019 fixation on relationships and rivalries, corrupt officers and brutality. She does, however, recognise the necessity of a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between drama and reality. \u201cThe truth is staying in your cell for however many hours a day is not great TV.\u201d The point about Inside Bitch is that it wrings entertainment out of lived experience. As McBrinn says, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely theirs.\u201d</p> <p>In a sense, Clean Break has returned to its roots. The company is best known for its recent collaboration with Phyllida Lloyd on the Donmar Warehouse\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/13/julius-caesar-donmar-warehouse-josie-rourke-kate-pakenham-harriet-walter-shakespeare-bbc-four\">all-female Shakespeare trilogy</a>, but its beginnings were forged in self-expression. \u201cIt was very much about women telling their own stories,\u201d Herrmann stresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"037d0f07c15f7a1ccc5fb7c2cc14e41d20709759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037d0f07c15f7a1ccc5fb7c2cc14e41d20709759/0_0_3405_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the cast for Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s Julius Caesar production at the Donmar in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the cast for Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s Julius Caesar production at the Donmar in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo by Helen Maybanks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forty years ago, Jenny Hicks and Jackie Holborough started staging shows when they were serving sentences in Askham Grange open prison in York, expanding its annual Christmas revue into a two-hour show about prison life, Efemera. It was good enough to gain a two-night run at York Arts Centre, making its 21-strong cast the first British prisoners to perform outside prison. On release, Hicks and Holborough launched Clean Break to tour plays written and performed by former female prisoners and within a year, the company was at the Royal Court. In time, they brought in professional playwrights to write scripts from members\u2019 stories and deliver educational workshops in penal institutions.</p> <p>Clean Break\u2019s workshops are a kind of creative intervention. Working with women who feel shut out by education or society, Herrmann says the aim is to \u201ccreate a space where they\u2019re right, where they\u2019re valued and where their experiences are useful\u201d. She talks of \u201can intensive blossoming, a feeling of being respectful and having something to say\u201d. That\u2019s where empowering its members to create art coincides with issues of representation \u2013 something Inside Bitch hopes to make manifest.</p> <p>For the playwright Luke Barnes, art is \u201cabout starting a conversation in a community and no one\u2019s doing that in prisons\u201d. Last year, the Young Vic took their production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/28/brothers-size-review-young-vic-sheibani-alvin-mccraney-brotherhood-dirisu-ajayi\">The Brothers Size</a> into Wandsworth prison, following it with a series of participatory workshops led by Barnes and director Justin Audibert. Barnes wanted to make something \u201ctangibly useful\u201d within Wandsworth\u2019s walls \u2013 \u201cnot just to put a play on for the sake of it\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Deeply disturbing.\u201d That was how the prisons minister Rory Stewart summed up the state of some British prisons last year. After an Observer investigation revealed that standards in two thirds of institutions were deemed sub-par and two in five unsafe, Stewart acknowledged \u201cincreasing levels of violence committed by prisoners, and horrifying rates of self-harm\u201d. Prison riots, drug use, overcrowding and staff cuts are all widely reported. Our understanding of prison life is mostly shaped by such reportage or drama. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t seen by many people,\u201d says Anna Herrmann, co-artistic director of the Clean Break theatre company. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we break down misconceptions.\u201d The company\u2019s new show, Inside Bitch was conceived by writers Deborah Pearson and Stacey Gregg, and devised by four Clean Break members who are all women with experience of the penal system. It is an attempt to dismantle the pop-culture stereotypes passed down in TV dramas like Bad Girls and Orange is the New Black. \u201cThose representations can hinder the experiences of our members,\u201d says co-artistic director R\u00f3is\u00edn McBrinn, citing such programmes\u2019 fixation on relationships and rivalries, corrupt officers and brutality. She does, however, recognise the necessity of a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between drama and reality. \u201cThe truth is staying in your cell for however many hours a day is not great TV.\u201d The point about Inside Bitch is that it wrings entertainment out of lived experience. As McBrinn says, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely theirs.\u201d In a sense, Clean Break has returned to its roots. The company is best known for its recent collaboration with Phyllida Lloyd on the Donmar Warehouse\u2019s all-female Shakespeare trilogy, but its beginnings were forged in self-expression. \u201cIt was very much about women telling their own stories,\u201d Herrmann stresses. Forty years ago, Jenny Hicks and Jackie Holborough started staging shows when they were serving sentences in Askham Grange open prison in York, expanding its annual Christmas revue into a two-hour show about prison life, Efemera. It was good enough to gain a two-night run at York Arts Centre, making its 21-strong cast the first British prisoners to perform outside prison. On release, Hicks and Holborough launched Clean Break to tour plays written and performed by former female prisoners and within a year, the company was at the Royal Court. In time, they brought in professional playwrights to write scripts from members\u2019 stories and deliver educational workshops in penal institutions. Clean Break\u2019s workshops are a kind of creative intervention. Working with women who feel shut out by education or society, Herrmann says the aim is to \u201ccreate a space where they\u2019re right, where they\u2019re valued and where their experiences are useful\u201d. She talks of \u201can intensive blossoming, a feeling of being respectful and having something to say\u201d. That\u2019s where empowering its members to create art coincides with issues of representation \u2013 something Inside Bitch hopes to make manifest. For the playwright Luke Barnes, art is \u201cabout starting a conversation in a community and no one\u2019s doing that in prisons\u201d. Last year, the Young Vic took their production of The Brothers Size into Wandsworth prison, following it with a series of participatory workshops led by Barnes and director Justin Audibert. Barnes wanted to make something \u201ctangibly useful\u201d within Wandsworth\u2019s walls \u2013 \u201cnot just to put a play on for the sake of it\u201d. One young inmate suggested the group find a way to admit feeling scared. \u201cHe was like, \u2018We\u2019re all putting on this bravado, but actually it\u2019s a terrifying experience. Life is passing us by outside.\u2019 That was the starting point. The piece became about finding a way for these men to talk about the emotional experience of being inside.\u201d Peter Wayne is part of the group that workshopped Barnes\u2019s resulting play, The Jumper Factory.

      "body": "<p>The year is 2025 and the prime minister, David Lammy, has just phoned the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to congratulate her on victory in Ireland\u2019s unification referendum. The deputy prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour. Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees-Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen.

It\u2019s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well. Theresa May has red lines, the European Research Group (ERG) has absolute red lines, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has blood-red lines, and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell.

It\u2019s only ever been about sovereignty. For the gammons and bowler hats on the team, the final destination has always been the top of the white cliffs of Dover dressed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/21/brexit-dads-army-jacob-rees-mogg\" title=\"\">Dad\u2019s Army</a>, straddling Dysons.</p> \n<p>Northern Ireland has always been about sovereignty for a different reason \u2013 almost half of its population see themselves as Irish. How very rude. Yet as Brexiteers preach about their precious union, Irish nationalists in the same country are meant to park the union they want and just work out how the chicken crosses the border.</p> \n<p>Last week I was back in my home village of Dundrum, County Down. It lies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Down_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"\">in a constituency</a> that in the past has elected both \u00c9amon de Valera and Enoch Powell, but when talk in the pub turned to Brexit, the same truths were repeated again and again: nothing good can come of this for Northern Ireland. And: we knew this would happen.</p> \n<p>Most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU because there have only ever been two options post-Brexit \u2013 customs checks at the Irish border or in the Irish Sea. Each would cause divisions just as we were bridging the gaps (in spite of our politicians). Depressingly, there\u2019s no way through this.</p> \n<p>As the prime minister Maybots her way through the charade of alternative arrangements, there\u2019s only one thing you need to know \u2013 there are no workable alternative arrangements. If there were, you\u2019d have heard of them by now. The details of this technological masterpiece would already be a double-page spread in the Daily Mail with Rees-Mogg mocked up as Alan Turing under the headline \u201cEnigma cracks Enigma \u2013 spirit of Bletchley takes back control\u201d. If an alternative arrangement that worked actually existed (or was likely to exist in the next couple of years) Brexiteers would have already accepted the backstop, knowing they could easily replace it with their idea during the transition. The fact that they won\u2019t bet on themselves tells you all you need to know about what they have in the locker.</p> \n<p>Yet none of that matters when you\u2019ve inoculated yourself against reality. It\u2019s why the ERG continues to cup its balls and cough while looking at a picture of Winston Churchill. \u201cDid you feel that, too? We need a clean break.\u201d Meanwhile, Corbyn complains the clock is being run down, but knows his last hope of a general election is when time\u2019s up. To those outside the Labour party he\u2019s become the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho of Brexit, sticking to a system that has lost half the dressing room while a people\u2019s vote remains benched like Paul Pogba for daring to be more popular than the manager.</p> \n<p>All of this could have been avoided if the majority in Northern Ireland had been listened to during the referendum campaign. But as Nigel Farage and Johnson trumpeted their migrant-free magic kingdom, we were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/30/home-alone-review-yuletide-rerelease\" title=\"\">Kevin in Home Alone</a> \u2013 only remembered at the baggage carousel after the plane had landed. It\u2019s why the minutes of the first meeting between Michel Barnier and David Davis will never be released. \u201cSo, what do you propose for your land border with Europe?\u201d Polite laughter. \u201cWe have a land border with you guys?\u201d</p> \n<p>Even at this late stage, it remains the unanswered question \u2013 how can you take back control of your borders when the only land border you have can\u2019t be put back in place? The fact that more than 70% of people in Northern Ireland voted to give up control of that border via the Good Friday agreement so they could live in peace remains totally ignored.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3791b4b0-e277-4c6c-b835-cd76d94dfa77\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Malthouse Compromise is named after housing minister Kit Malthouse, who brokered cross-party talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.</p>\n    <p>The result involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.</p>\n    <p>It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021.

Like a stable block with planning permission, they know the extra square footage adds value but they\u2019ve no intention of actually developing it. Just as long as they can see it from the big house, they\u2019re happy. As for those who live in the stable? If Brexit has proved anything, it\u2019s that many Tories don\u2019t give a stuff about the people of Northern Ireland \u2013 not even the unionists. If they did, they wouldn\u2019t dream of a hard Brexit because it only guarantees one thing \u2013 a border poll.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s one that will be decided not by Sinn F\u00e9in or DUP votes, but by the moderates in the middle \u2013 nationalists who once felt Irish enough post-Good Friday agreement and those pro-European unionists applying for Irish passports. The inevitable economic downturn and border circus of a hard Brexit might just be enough to swing those floating voters and Northern Ireland out of the union. So, why would any member of the Conservative and Unionist party take that risk? Because no matter what they say in public, they\u2019ve never honestly believed Belfast is just like Finchley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a57be0426a0ce3220ee95a986ee129682641d131\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a57be0426a0ce3220ee95a986ee129682641d131/0_298_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Padlocks on gates at Stormont Parliament Buildings, Belfast, Northern Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Stormont Assembly, where rules should actually be made for Northern Ireland, remains in mothballs since 2016 because the DUP backed out of a deal with Sinn Fein to restore power-sharing.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PAUL McERLANE/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All notions of a border poll could easily have been damped if, post-Brexit referendum, the DUP had accepted that Northern Ireland was a special case.

Or how same-sex marriage and abortion laws are different to the rest of the UK thanks to a veto by the DUP in the Northern Ireland assembly (apparently, it\u2019s also in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Lord Jesus). But that was never on the cards because, for the DUP, Brexit is about proving they\u2019re biologically British, not adopted. It means the party will always order what Johnson and Farage are having but, unlike them, actually eat it.</p> \n<p>Of course, special status for Northern Ireland would mean some form of \u201cdreaded backstop\u201d (pause, pearl clutch, continue), but when a country has more than 300 land border crossings and only five main ports to the mainland, where would you rather try to do the \u201cdreaded paperwork\u201d? And, let\u2019s face it, any customs check that can take place in the middle of the Irish Sea while a lorry driver hoovers a fry-up on the ferry then has a snooze in his bunk has to be a good thing. Cue sash-shaking Brexiteer rage. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand Northern Ireland would then become a rule-taker not a rule-maker?!\u201d Because apparently, it\u2019s all about rule-making \u2013 as the Stormont assembly, where rules should actually be made for Northern Ireland, remains in mothballs since 2016 because the DUP backed out of a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in to restore power sharing. So we\u2019ve reached the fatberg in the sewer of principle. We\u2019re told that the DUP has the government over a pork barrel and unless the backstop goes, it will bring the house down. But as time runs out, it\u2019s actually the Tories who have the political wing of the Old Testament surrounded.</p> \n<p>On the one side is May\u2019s deal (complete with backstop). On the other is the ERG and a hard Brexit. If the DUP buckles on the backstop, party members will walk away with their UK sovereignty between their legs. For those of us who have their early albums, this isn\u2019t going to happen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/ireland-hard-border-brexit-backstop-good-friday-agreement\">The backstop isn\u2019t just about trade.

The DUP holds firm and jumps off the cliff with the ERG, knowing a hard Brexit is the only scenario that guarantees a hard border in Ireland, a border poll in Northern Ireland and the perfect economic storm where it could lose that vote.

      "bodyText": "The year is 2025 and the prime minister, David Lammy, has just phoned the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to congratulate her on victory in Ireland\u2019s unification referendum. The deputy prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour. Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees-Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen. The Tory leader, Amber Rudd, refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but, like the rest of what\u2019s left of the country, she knows the truth. As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you, principles guarantee no deal. It\u2019s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well. Theresa May has red lines, the European Research Group (ERG) has absolute red lines, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has blood-red lines, and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell. If they all hold firm, we\u2019re heading for a hard Brexit. And a united Ireland. We were always going to end up here because Brexit has never been about Nissan X-Trails or the shape of your bananas. It\u2019s only ever been about sovereignty. For the gammons and bowler hats on the team, the final destination has always been the top of the white cliffs of Dover dressed as Dad\u2019s Army, straddling Dysons. Northern Ireland has always been about sovereignty for a different reason \u2013 almost half of its population see themselves as Irish. How very rude. Yet as Brexiteers preach about their precious union, Irish nationalists in the same country are meant to park the union they want and just work out how the chicken crosses the border. Last week I was back in my home village of Dundrum, County Down. It lies in a constituency that in the past has elected both \u00c9amon de Valera and Enoch Powell, but when talk in the pub turned to Brexit, the same truths were repeated again and again: nothing good can come of this for Northern Ireland. And: we knew this would happen. Most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU because there have only ever been two options post-Brexit \u2013 customs checks at the Irish border or in the Irish Sea. Each would cause divisions just as we were bridging the gaps (in spite of our politicians). Depressingly, there\u2019s no way through this. As the prime minister Maybots her way through the charade of alternative arrangements, there\u2019s only one thing you need to know \u2013 there are no workable alternative arrangements. If there were, you\u2019d have heard of them by now. The details of this technological masterpiece would already be a double-page spread in the Daily Mail with Rees-Mogg mocked up as Alan Turing under the headline \u201cEnigma cracks Enigma \u2013 spirit of Bletchley takes back control\u201d. If an alternative arrangement that worked actually existed (or was likely to exist in the next couple of years) Brexiteers would have already accepted the backstop, knowing they could easily replace it with their idea during the transition. The fact that they won\u2019t bet on themselves tells you all you need to know about what they have in the locker. Yet none of that matters when you\u2019ve inoculated yourself against reality. It\u2019s why the ERG continues to cup its balls and cough while looking at a picture of Winston Churchill. \u201cDid you feel that, too? We need a clean break.\u201d Meanwhile, Corbyn complains the clock is being run down, but knows his last hope of a general election is when time\u2019s up. To those outside the Labour party he\u2019s become the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho of Brexit, sticking to a system that has lost half the dressing room while a people\u2019s vote remains benched like Paul Pogba for daring to be more popular than the manager. All of this could have been avoided if the majority in Northern Ireland had been listened to during the referendum campaign. But as Nigel Farage and Johnson trumpeted their migrant-free magic kingdom, we were Kevin in Home Alone \u2013 only remembered at the baggage carousel after the plane had landed. It\u2019s why the minutes of the first meeting between Michel Barnier and David Davis will never be released. \u201cSo, what do you propose for your land border with Europe?\u201d Polite laughter. \u201cWe have a land border with you guys?\u201d Even at this late stage, it remains the unanswered question \u2013 how can you take back control of your borders when the only land border you have can\u2019t be put back in place? The fact that more than 70% of people in Northern Ireland voted to give up control of that border via the Good Friday agreement so they could live in peace remains totally ignored. When Conservatives say they care about Northern Ireland, they actually just mean the freehold. Like a stable block with planning permission, they know the extra square footage adds value but they\u2019ve no intention of actually developing it. Just as long as they can see it from the big house, they\u2019re happy. As for those who live in the stable? If Brexit has proved anything, it\u2019s that many Tories don\u2019t give a stuff about the people of Northern Ireland \u2013 not even the unionists. If they did, they wouldn\u2019t dream of a hard Brexit because it only guarantees one thing \u2013 a border poll. That\u2019s one that will be decided not by Sinn F\u00e9in or DUP votes, but by the moderates in the middle \u2013 nationalists who once felt Irish enough post-Good Friday agreement and those pro-European unionists applying for Irish passports. The inevitable economic downturn and border circus of a hard Brexit might just be enough to swing those floating voters and Northern Ireland out of the union. So, why would any member of the Conservative and Unionist party take that risk? Because no matter what they say in public, they\u2019ve never honestly believed Belfast is just like Finchley. All notions of a border poll could easily have been damped if, post-Brexit referendum, the DUP had accepted that Northern Ireland was a special case. Like they insisted it was when they asked George Osborne to drop Northern Ireland\u2019s corporation tax to mirror the Republic back in 2014. Or how same-sex marriage and abortion laws are different to the rest of the UK thanks to a veto by the DUP in the Northern Ireland assembly (apparently, it\u2019s also in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Lord Jesus). But that was never on the cards because, for the DUP, Brexit is about proving they\u2019re biologically British, not adopted. It means the party will always order what Johnson and Farage are having but, unlike them, actually eat it. Of course, special status for Northern Ireland would mean some form of \u201cdreaded backstop\u201d (pause, pearl clutch, continue), but when a country has more than 300 land border crossings and only five main ports to the mainland, where would you rather try to do the \u201cdreaded paperwork\u201d? And, let\u2019s face it, any customs check that can take place in the middle of the Irish Sea while a lorry driver hoovers a fry-up on the ferry then has a snooze in his bunk has to be a good thing. Cue sash-shaking Brexiteer rage. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand Northern Ireland would then become a rule-taker not a rule-maker?!\u201d Because apparently, it\u2019s all about rule-making \u2013 as the Stormont assembly, where rules should actually be made for Northern Ireland, remains in mothballs since 2016 because the DUP backed out of a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in to restore power sharing. So we\u2019ve reached the fatberg in the sewer of principle. We\u2019re told that the DUP has the government over a pork barrel and unless the backstop goes, it will bring the house down. But as time runs out, it\u2019s actually the Tories who have the political wing of the Old Testament surrounded. On the one side is May\u2019s deal (complete with backstop). On the other is the ERG and a hard Brexit. If the DUP buckles on the backstop, party members will walk away with their UK sovereignty between their legs. For those of us who have their early albums, this isn\u2019t going to happen. Which leaves just one option. The DUP holds firm and jumps off the cliff with the ERG, knowing a hard Brexit is the only scenario that guarantees a hard border in Ireland, a border poll in Northern Ireland and the perfect economic storm where it could lose that vote. By trying to be the most British person in the room, the DUP could actually end up the most Irish. Whisper it quietly, but the best outcome for the DUP is actually a people\u2019s vote. They\u2019ll scream red, white and blue murder if it happens but privately breathe a sigh of relief. Like Boris Johnson, they never wanted Brexit but wanted to be seen to support it. A second referendum offers an escape from their worst nightmare, while allowing them to reluctantly go along with \u201cthe will of the entire country\u201d. Very unionist. For Northern Ireland as a whole, another EU referendum is also the only way out of this mess. Not to save face. But to save peace, prosperity and a shared future. It\u2019s wrong that Northern Ireland should take one for the team so that others can have their version of Brexit. It\u2019s now time to act, or Northern Ireland might decide the team is no longer worth playing for. \u2022 Patrick Kielty is a Northern Ireland-born comedian and TV presenter.

In this series of articles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/guardian-concrete-week\">Concrete Week</a> will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.</p>\n    <p><b>Chris Michael, Cities editor</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Only a tiny fraction of the world\u2019s concrete production is used in architecture, and yet it is architects who have done more than anyone else to shape the popular imagination of the material, for better and worse. After a generation in the doghouse, when concrete behemoths <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3126946.stm\">regularly topped</a> surveys of buildings most hated by the public, the material has become more fashionable than ever \u2013 at a time when its catastrophic environmental impacts are finally being noticed. A recent report found that cement production <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46455844\">accounts for up to 8% of all CO2 emissions worldwide</a>, while concrete waste likely makes up as much as one-fourth of all landfill.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be using concrete at all,\u201d says Barnabas Calder, historian of postwar architecture and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/raw-concrete-beauty-of-barbarism-barnabas-calder-review\">Raw Concrete</a>, a passionately argued book on the beauty of brutalism. It is an unlikely comment coming from a self-professed addict of the rough stuff, who keeps cherished fragments of demolished car parks as if they were holy relics. \u201cOf course it looks lovely, but it has a massive carbon footprint.

Increased environmental awareness since the glory days of in situ concrete in the 1960s mean that <a href=\"https://www.bregroup.com/certifiedthermalproducts/page.jsp?id=3073\">thermal bridging</a> is now out of the question: a material exposed on the outside of a building cannot continue through to the interior, without a big layer of insulation in between.

Both projects use naked concrete as a means of simulating an \u201cas found\u201d industrial character. The former riffs off the old oil tanks of the Bankside power station, while the latter creates the illusion of a converted warehouse for tech start-ups at east London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout.

It adds real character too.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is now common to find it in housing developments as well, where concrete surfaces are left exposed on both environmental grounds (it cools the building in summer and retains warmth in winter), and to give the feeling of a simple, honest shell: you\u2019re not paying for fixtures and fittings that you don\u2019t need. Designs for the affordable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/24/mayor-subsidise-naked-homes-london-housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-new-builds\">Naked House scheme</a>, by young practice OMMX, fetishise its spartan finish, with exposed concrete floors and blockwork walls, implying a level of adaptability and customisation.

It allows infinite possibilities for sculptural and tactile effect, capable of being polished or ground, bush-hammered or etched, poured like oil or roughly rammed like compacted muesli. But our chief concern should be looking after what we already have: given the amount of energy embodied in the existing stock of concrete-framed buildings, the priority must be on preserving, retrofitting and reviving what is already there, rather than demolishing and adding to the landfill heap.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor all the enthusiasm, concrete buildings are still being needlessly demolished,\u201d says Calder, \u201cat the same time as being almost excessively voguish on social media.

The result is that visible concrete has generally retreated to the realm of interiors, from the sweeping spiral staircase and angled buttresses inside Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s Tate Modern Switch House, to the raw ceilings and walls in AHMM\u2019s White Collar Factory office building. Both projects use naked concrete as a means of simulating an \u201cas found\u201d industrial character. The former riffs off the old oil tanks of the Bankside power station, while the latter creates the illusion of a converted warehouse for tech start-ups at east London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout. Both indulge in fakery, nostalgia and the theatrical power of bare mineral mass. The sweeping spiral staircase and angled buttresses inside Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s Tate Modern Switch House. Photograph: View Pictures/REX/Shutterstock \u201cThere\u2019s been a real shift in the last decade,\u201d says Elaine Toogood of The Concrete Centre, part of the industry\u2019s trade association. \u201cThere\u2019s much more acceptance of office buildings having exposed concrete ceilings, which is good for thermal mass and allows you to have higher spaces because it does away with the suspended ceiling. It adds real character too.\u201d It is now common to find it in housing developments as well, where concrete surfaces are left exposed on both environmental grounds (it cools the building in summer and retains warmth in winter), and to give the feeling of a simple, honest shell: you\u2019re not paying for fixtures and fittings that you don\u2019t need. Designs for the affordable Naked House scheme, by young practice OMMX, fetishise its spartan finish, with exposed concrete floors and blockwork walls, implying a level of adaptability and customisation. It is a blank canvas for the residents to make their own mark. The equally spartan exterior and interior of the affordable Naked House, by young practice OMMX Concrete may increasingly be seen as a guilty pleasure, but it isn\u2019t going anywhere fast. It allows infinite possibilities for sculptural and tactile effect, capable of being polished or ground, bush-hammered or etched, poured like oil or roughly rammed like compacted muesli. But our chief concern should be looking after what we already have: given the amount of energy embodied in the existing stock of concrete-framed buildings, the priority must be on preserving, retrofitting and reviving what is already there, rather than demolishing and adding to the landfill heap. \u201cFor all the enthusiasm, concrete buildings are still being needlessly demolished,\u201d says Calder, \u201cat the same time as being almost excessively voguish on social media. It is a catastrophic waste of resources.\u201d The hashtags and tea towels, it seems, haven\u2019t yet translated into real love and care.

      "bodyText": "Aid groups have slammed Australia\u2019s \u201cbizarre\u201d decision not to increase its $23m aid contribution to war-torn Yemen amid revelations a Canberra defence company had received a $36m taxpayer subsidy towards its military exports to Saudi Arabia. The United Nations is rattling the tin at an international conference in Geneva urging countries to stump up billions to support 24 million Yemenis or 80% of the population in humanitarian need. Guardian Australia understands the federal government isn\u2019t pledging any extra cash on top of the $23m allocated to Yemen since 2017. Australia\u2019s last contribution was $3m last April. The Save the Children spokesman Mat Tinkler said Australia should be in a position to do much more. \u201cThis is a tragedy. One child is dying every 10 minutes,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Two-thirds of the country is pre-famine amid four years of war and economic collapse. An estimated 85,000 children aged under five have died from starvation in the past three years. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had been funding a Save the Children field hospital in the capital Sana\u2019a which had been caring for malnourished newborns and mothers. \u201cWe were very much hoping for additional contributions to continue that work,\u201d Tinkler said. \u201cIt\u2019s at risk. It\u2019s being supported by Save the Children\u2019s own funding at the moment.\u201d The UN had dubbed the field hospital the \u201cgold standard\u201d and was looking to replicate the model in other parts of Yemen, Tinkler said. He seized on revelations from last week the federal government had given Canberra-based defence firm Electro Optic Systems $36m in taxpayer subsidies. The company has contracts to export its remote weapons systems to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 both countries are involved in the Yemen conflict. Save the Children has launched a petition calling on the government to ban Australian arms exports to the countries. A steady stream of other countries are shunning Saudi Arabia as a military export destination. A British parliamentary committee report said the UK is on \u201cthe wrong side of the law\u201d by sanctioning arms exports to Saudi Arabia and should suspend export licences. Germany has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and Italy, Denmark and Finland have announced plans to follow suit. The US Congress has voted to withdraw US support from involvement in Yemen. Australian defence officials couldn\u2019t guarantee the EOS weapons systems are not being used in the Yemen.",

      "bodyText": "The Middle East\u2019s polarised and repressive politics will lead to even more instability in the region unless countries take steps to reform and calm tensions, a senior Qatari politician has said. Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Qatar\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, urged international powers including the US to be more inclusive in their approach to the region, saying one-sided initiatives that excluded either the Iranians or Palestinians did not work. \u201cAnyone that looks at the situation right now \u2013 the polarisation in the region \u2013 is quite certain that things will not remain like this,\u201d Thani said. \u201cYou cannot keep people under oppression for a long time, so to prevent this instability from happening, we just want leaders to start reforming. We have to practice preventative diplomacy rather than reactive diplomacy.\u201d He called on Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the inquiry set up by the UN to look into the death of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Qatar has been on the receiving end of an economic, diplomatic and political boycott by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, stretching back to June 2017. Those countries accuse Qatar of funding extremist groups and being too close to Iran \u2013 allegations Qatar denies. The Qatari government consider itself a benefactor and mediator, offering its territory as the UN\u2019s sub-station in the middle east. The country, which has a $300bn (\u00a3230bn) sovereign wealth fund and large gas reserves, hopes hosting the football world cup in 2022 will boost its prestige on the international stage. As well as acting as a mediator with the Taliban, Qatar has, according to Thani, provided more than $1bn in help to alleviate suffering in Gaza and spent $500m to stabilise the Lebanese economy, a country previously seen as domain of the Saudis. More recently, it has been extending its reach into African and Asian markets. Unlike most other Gulf states, Qatar has continued to support the Iran nuclear deal, distancing itself from the anti-Iranian axis of the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel. \u201cOur position on the Iran deal is that, like the Europeans, we support it,\u201d Thani said. \u201cWe do not want a nuclear arms race in our region, and that is the danger.\u201d He insisted this did not mean his country had now, as some claimed, formed a new axis with Iran and Turkey. \u201cOur geography is difficult.

      "bodyText": "As many as 100 journalists have been threatened with a charge of contempt of court \u2013 and could face possible jail terms \u2013 over reporting of the Cardinal George Pell trial. Victoria\u2019s director of public prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, has written to as many as 100 individual publishers, editors, broadcasters, reporters and subeditors at the media giants News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment, the ABC, Crikey and several smaller publications, accusing them of breaching a nationwide suppression order imposed during the case. Nine\u2019s Melbourne masthead The Age alone received more than 30 letters. Letters were sent to the journalists in early February saying that they had potentially interfered with the administration of justice and scandalised the court. The ones who do not have a strong enough explanation could be prosecuted. The suppression order was issued by the chief judge of Melbourne\u2019s county court, Peter Kidd, on 25 June 2018 in the matter of DPP v George Pell. The prosecution had applied for the suppression order to prevent \u201ca real and substantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice\u201d because Pell originally was to face a second trial on separate charges. But when the guilty verdict came down in December, some international media outlets \u2013 who were unlikely to have been in court \u2013 published or broadcast the news. These international outlets included the Daily Beast, the Washington Post and several Catholic websites. \u201cCardinal George Pell has been found guilty in Australia of charges related to sexual abuse, according to two people familiar with the case and other media reports, becoming the highest-ranking Vatican official to face such a conviction,\u201d the Washington Post reported on 12 December. Many of the articles were later removed. Some local media followed suit, publishing articles which Kidd said raised a question of whether they were aimed at putting \u201cinappropriate pressure on him\u201d \u2013 even though these were vague and did not mention Pell\u2019s name or the verdict. The outlets which published or broadcast pieces in relation to the trial included the Herald Sun, the Age, Macquarie Media, Nine News in Melbourne, an ABC radio program outside Melbourne and News Corp\u2019s the Australian. Private Media\u2019s Crikey website published a wrap of how the newspapers covered the Pell verdict, with snapshots of the front pages. The small website alone received five letters from the DPP. The Herald Sun published the most dramatic piece: a black front page with the word CENSORED in large white letters. \u201cThe world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,\u201d the page one editorial said. \u201cThe Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this very significant news. But trust us, it\u2019s a story you deserve to read.\u201d A group of eight court reporters who attended both Pell trials every day, who included journalists from Guardian Australia and ABC News, did not breach the suppression order. Judd asked some recipients of the letter to reply by 15 February as to why they should not be charged with contempt of court. All the publications which referenced the Pell case, even obliquely, were targeted because there was a blanket suppression on any information about the case. Some of the alleged breaches were considered to be more flagrant than others. As many as 30 people at the Herald Sun and the Age received letters \u2013 even those who were not involved or who were not working on the day. When the judge was made aware of the breaches he told a closed court they were of a serious nature and certain editors faced imprisonment. The local online articles were removed when editors read Kidd\u2019s angry comments in a transcript sent to media outlets. Nine\u2019s The Australian Financial Review, which published Kidd\u2019s angry comments, also received two letters from the DPP. Kidd told the court the publications had potentially breached the law, brought improper pressure upon the court and had committed a \u201cpotentially egregious and flagrant\u201d contempt of court. \u201cA number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment, and it may well be that many significant members of the media community are in that potential position,\u201d Kidd said on 13 December. Rival news organisations have been working together to respond to the charges. Lawyers for Nine\u2019s the Age and News Corp\u2019s the Herald Sun have prepared a joint response to the DPP, a source said. Addressing Pell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, Kidd said the media were \u201coperating on a misinformed basis that it\u2019s OK to print everything and anything apart from the name of your client\u201d. Discussing the Herald Sun report, Richter said although Pell\u2019s name was not mentioned, the reference to \u201ca very prominent Australian figure\u201d meant the \u201cconnection cannot fail to be made\u201d. \u201cI am told it was on Wikipedia last night \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen that but it was apparently removed this morning \u2013 and so it really is a matter for showing cause if there is one,\u201d Richter said. Kidd said he believed some of the articles were designed to put pressure on the court, a tactic he labelled \u201cbreathtaking\u201d. The Age reported after the suppression order was lifted on Tuesday that its lawyer Justin Quill was representing 53 media clients including those at The Age. Quill wrote to the DPP saying that the \u2018\u2018virtually identical\u2019\u2019 letters had distressed the staff, represented a scattergun approach and were \u2018\u2018inappropriate and disturbing\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2018It is difficult to understand your letters as anything other than a concerted and strategic attack on the media, rather than an upholding of the law,\u201d Quill wrote. A spokeswoman for Nine Entertainment said Quill was representing all the Nine outlets, News Corp and smaller websites like Mamamia. \u201cLike a large number of media outlets, we received these letters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe deny all the allegations made by the DPP.\u201d The Melbourne broadcaster Jon Faine, who has not been sent a letter, mentioned the suppression order on his ABC program this month without referring to the specifics of the case. Faine said when suppression orders were \u201cproperly used\u201d any breaches must be prosecuted. \u201cThis week, a large number \u2013 I am told 70 \u2013 media outlets and journalists across Australia and some overseas \u2013 including sadly one ABC program \u2013 have been asked to show cause why they ought not be proceeded against for a clear breach of a suppression order from one of our courts. \u201cEditors and publishers as well as journalists could well go to jail. This mass prosecution could lead to a test of the powers of the courts in the digital age, to control the flow of information that can interfere with the administration of justice. \u201cJudge-alone trials \u2013 instead of juries \u2013 in publicity sensitive matters are part of the answer and must be adopted urgently.\u201d \u2022 On 28 February 2019 this article was amended to remove CNN as one of the news organisations that published the Pell verdict in December.",

Kim will meet the US president for a brief one-on-one conversation, followed by a social dinner, at which they will each be accompanied by two guests and interpreters, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Their meeting comes eight months after the historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, which failed to produce concrete results on a path to denuclearisation. Kim arrived on Tuesday at the station in the Vietnamese town of Dong Dang after crossing into China on Saturday thousands of kilometres further north at the city of Dandong. Vietnamese officials were on hand to receive him at the station with a red carpet and guard of honour, with North Korean and Vietnamese flags flying. Kim was seen leaving the train in Dong Dang and getting into a Mercedes Benz for the 170km (105-mile) journey to the capital, Hanoi. He waved to young people lining the street as the car set off, flanked by about a dozen bodyguards running alongside. There is no real expectation the second meeting will bring a final deal on ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons that threaten the US, but there are some hopes it could lead to a declaration that the 1950-53 Korean War is at last formally over. The world leaders will be joined US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who also arrived on Tuesday morning. Trump and Kim will then hold a series of official meetings on Thursday. Trump, who lands in Vietnam late on Tuesday, will have meetings with the host country\u2019s president and prime minister on Wednesday before seeing Kim. Before leaving Washington on Monday, Trump tweeted that he was \u201cLooking forward to a very productive summit.\u201d He earlier told US governors that \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a very tremendous summit.\u201d His upbeat assessment contrasts with earlier comments that the US will be \u201chappy\u201d if North Korea simply agrees to continue its moratorium on nuclear and missile testing. The US president\u2019s remarks on Sunday night represented a lowering of already modest expectations for the second meeting. Trump once warned that North Korea\u2019s arsenal posed such a threat to humanity that he may have no choice but to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the rogue nation, yet last week he declared that he was in \u201cno rush\u201d for Pyongyang to prove it was abandoning its weapons.

      "bodyText": "Cardinal George Pell, once the third most powerful man in the Vatican and Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, has been found guilty of child sexual abuse after a trial in Melbourne. A jury delivered the unanimous verdict on 11 December in Melbourne\u2019s county court, but the result was subject to a suppression order and could not be reported until now. A previous trial on the same five charges, which began in August, resulted in a hung jury, leading to a retrial. Pell, who is on leave from his role in Rome as Vatican treasurer, was found guilty of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 as well as four charges of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. The offences occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne. He is due to be sentenced next week but may be taken into custody at a plea hearing on Wednesday, having been out on bail since the verdict and recovering from knee surgery. Pope Francis, who has previously praised Pell for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, has yet to publicly react, but just two days after the unreported verdict in December the Vatican announced that Pell and two other cardinals had been removed from the pontiff\u2019s council of advisers. Pell\u2019s conviction and likely imprisonment will cause shockwaves through a global Catholic congregation and is a blow to Francis\u2019s efforts to get a grip on sexual abuse. It comes just days after an unprecedented summit of cardinals and senior bishops in the presence of the pope at the Vatican, intended to signal a turning point on the issue that has gravely damaged the church and imperilled Francis\u2019s papacy. The suppression order covering the case was lifted by county court chief judge Peter Kidd on Tuesday morning. Pell walked from the Melbourne courtroom to a waiting car surrounded by a phalanx of police and press. He was jeered by survivors of sexual abuse who had gathered outside. \u201cYou\u2019re going to burn in hell. Burn in hell, Pell,\u201d one man yelled. Pell did not comment but a statement released by his solicitor Paul Galbally said the cardinal \u201chas always maintained his innocence and continues to do so.\u201d \u201cAn appeal has been lodged against his conviction and he will await the outcome of the appeal process.\u201d One of the complainants at the centre of the case, who cannot be named, asked for privacy in the wake of the suppression order being lifted, saying he was \u201ca regular guy working to support and protect my family as best I can.\u201d \u201cLike many survivors I have experienced shame, loneliness, depression and struggle,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLike many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life. \u201cAt some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust. I would like to thank my family near and far for their support of me, and of each other.\u201d Before returning to Australia to face the charges, Pell was for three years prefect of the secretariat for the economy of the Holy See, making him one of the most senior Catholics in the world. He was one of Francis\u2019s most trusted advisers, and was handpicked to oversee the Vatican\u2019s complex finances and root out corruption.On the day of the dramatic verdict, after a four-and-a-half-week trial, Pell stood in the dock showing no reaction and staring straight ahead. The room was silent as the foreman told the court that the jury had found the cardinal guilty on all charges. Pell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, when asked by journalists if he would appeal, responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Pell will now almost certainly face jail time. The jury found that in the second half of December 1996, while he was archbishop of Melbourne, Pell walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and sexually assaulted them. The complainant, who is now aged 35, said he and the other choirboy had separated from the choir procession as it exited the church building. The prosecution\u2019s case hinged on his evidence, as the other victim died in 2014 after a heroin overdose. Neither victim told anyone about the offending at the time. After leaving the procession, the complainant said, he and the other boy sneaked back into the church corridors and entered the priest\u2019s sacristy, a place they knew they should not be. There they found some sacramental wine and began to drink. The complainant alleged that Pell had walked in on them and told them something to the effect that they were in trouble. Pell manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. He stepped forward, grabbed the other boy by the back of his head, and forced the boy\u2019s head on to his penis, the complainant told the court. Pell then did the same thing to the complainant, orally raping him. Once he had finished, he ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself. The complainant said the attack lasted only a few minutes, and the boys left the room afterwards, hung up their choir robes and went home. Being in the choir was a condition of the complainant\u2019s scholarship to attend St Kevin\u2019s College, an elite independent school in the affluent inner-Melbourne suburb of Toorak, the court heard. \u201cI knew a scholarship could be given or taken away even at that age,\u201d the complainant told the court. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose that. It meant so much to me. And what would I do if I said such a thing about an archbishop? It\u2019s something I carried with me the whole of my life.\u201d The complainant alleged that either later that year in 1996, or in early 1997, Pell attacked him again. He said he was walking down a hallway to the choristers\u2019 change room, again after singing at Sunday solemn mass at the cathedral, when Pell allegedly pushed him against the wall and squeezed his genitals hard through his choir robes, before walking off. The complainant told the court that after the attacks he could not fathom what had happened to him and that he dealt with it by pushing it to the \u201cdarkest corners and recesses\u201d of his mind. In his police statement, the complainant said he remembered Pell \u201cbeing a big force in the place\u201d. \u201cHe emanated an air of being a powerful person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with this a long time \u2026 and my ability to be here. [Because] I think Pell has terrified me my whole life \u2026 he was [later] in the Vatican. He was an extremely, presidentially powerful guy who had a lot of connections.\u201d In his closing address, the crown prosecutor Mark Gibson told the jury their verdict would come down to whether they believed the complainant beyond reasonable doubt.

He was interviewed by a Victorian detective, Christopher Reed, in Rome in October 2016, and the video of that interview was played to the court.

One of the slides read: \u201cOnly a madman would attempt to rape two boys in the priests\u2019 sacristy immediately after Sunday solemn mass.\u201d In his directions to the jury, Kidd told them that the trial was not an opportunity to make Pell a scapegoat for the failures of the Catholic church.

The Grammy-winning soundtrack went on to become the highest selling album of 2018, and the film\u2019s director, Michael Gracey, told the Sun last week that they were working on a follow-up film. \u201cWhen a movie becomes as big a success as this, it\u2019s only natural there is demand for a sequel,\u201d Gracey said. \u201cSo those discussions have started and we are working on one right now.\u201d Jackman announced the Australian dates at a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday, where he performed A Million Dreams, a song from the Greatest Showman, with 50 singers from the Australian Girls Choir. Settle sang the Golden Globe-winning song This Is Me, before Jackman, Settle and host Andy Lee surprised the gathered journalists by performing an \u201celegant, swellegant\u201d (and fairly hammy) all-singing Q&amp;A. Settle will be joining Jackman for each show on the Australian tour. Jackman told the audience about the day she was cast in The Greatest Showman. Given only two days to learn This Is Me, he said, she moved the music stand aside during the final auditions, and sang it with her back turned to the studio executives. \u201cShe sang the song. Killed it. Tears coming down her face. Everyone, every single studio executive, all crying,\u201d Jackman said. \u201cThe head of the studio leaps up out of his chair, runs across the stage, hugs her and says, \u2018You just booked your first major motion picture\u2019.\u201d Jackman, 50, performed the opening number at last week\u2019s Brit awards; he said his live show requires \u201ca lot of preparation\u201d. \u201cThis show has got a lot of dancing in it, and my choreographer likes to think I\u2019m 25 years of age and so yeah, my knees are bending in ways they haven\u2019t in a while.\u201d Jackman toured a similar stage show in Australia in 2015, but promised \u201ca bunch of stories that nobody\u2019s heard before\u201d this time, and said he would be \u201csinging some different stuff from last time\u201d. Asked whether he would be singing any songs in character as Wolverine, he shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve tried. And I will keep trying to somehow get a Wolverine kickline into the repertoire \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t seem to work.\u201d Tickets for the Australian shows will be on sale on Thursday 7 March.",

A petition from the Papua New Guinean employees of Pomwan Paladin Security, addressed to Paladin management, said the staff had shown \u201cdedication and loyalty\u201d to the firm but were now being treated unfairly. It claimed the employees were underpaid, with no risk allowances added to the rates of $2-$3 an hour, or overtime paid for shifts of up to 12 hours, and that those who had transitioned from jobs with the former contractor Broadspectrum had had their pay cut. Hundreds of employees walked away from their work and staged a sit-in in Lorengau on Tuesday morning. \u201cOur petition had been raised and we want Paladin to meet our demands,\u201d one employee said. They said employees were told a Paladin national manager would be flying in to meet them on Tuesday afternoon. Guardian Australia was told employees of Pacific International Hospital \u2013 the contracted health clinic for asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 as well as cleaning staff and bus drivers, also walked off the job because they had no security. Paladin took over garrison services for the refugee and asylum seeker cohort on Manus Island from Broadspectrum in 2017, when the detention centre was closed and the hundreds of men were moved into three separate accomodation units. There has been a renewed focus on the size of the contract given to Paladin Solutions to run garrison services on Manus Island, with many now questioning the $423m price tag and the limited tender process run by the Australian government. In the petition, the Paladin workers demanded pay rises for all local staff, overtime for long shifts and the provision of three meals a day. They gave Paladin three days to respond, promising \u201cfurther planned actions\u201d if the demands were not met. \u201cDuring the transition from Lombrum to Lorengau we were compensated well in terms of our wages/salaries,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever wages were dropped and till now, no increments were implemented to help with the burden of working long hours.\u201d It said workplace health and safety were compromised by employees having to work inside hot containers for hours. \u201cWe\u2019ve had issues of employees feeling faint and sick.

That attempt to bring in foreign workers sparked tension on Manus Island and a standoff with another security provider who felt his company, Kingfisher, should have been given the contract. Paladin declined to comment on the petition or answer specific questions around the pay and conditions of its workforce. It directed Guardian Australia to its previous statement, which said the company engaged with communities \u201cwherever\u201d it works. \u201cWe understand our guard force in Manus under Pomwan Paladin Security Limited to be among the highest trained and highest paid in Papua New Guinea (Security Industry Authority 2018),\u201d it said. \u201cOur partnership success story under the Pomwan Paladin Joint Venture with Manusian businessman Rodney Pokapin should be celebrated and encouraged.

The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday \u201cstate governments have particular responsibilities\u201d when it comes to transmission infrastructure required to ensure the proposed expansion adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity is technically feasible. A scoping study for the project undertaken in 2017 was clear that the proposed expansion would \u201cnot be feasible without adequate and deep transmission augmentation to increase the capacity of the transmission lines between the scheme and the load centres in NSW and Victoria\u201d. \u201cThe project requires this transmission augmentation so the benefits and products can be delivered both north and south,\u201d it said.

The cost estimates in the business case for the Snowy 2.0 expansion have not been released publicly.

Paul Broad, the chief executive of Snowy Hydro, told reporters the plan was for the project to be operational from late 2024. But the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government should release the full business case so the opposition and other stakeholders could ensure the project stacked up. He noted the government had already spent $6bn on the project, buying stakes previously controlled by NSW and Victoria, and now the commonwealth was kicking in another $1.38bn. \u201cWe have said, since Malcolm Turnbull made this announcement, that we support these pumped hydro projects in principle, subject only to being able to see the full business case, which still hasn\u2019t been released publicly,\u201d Butler told the ABC. \u201cI mean, today\u2019s announcement takes the spend by this government on Snowy to about $7.5bn, but they still won\u2019t show people the full business case.\u201d \u201cWe do want to be able to kick the tyres on this thing\u201d. While there are concerns in the renewables sector that the Snowy project is expensive and potentially crowds out other developments, Morrison declared the project was essential to ensuring the transition to renewable energy. \u201cIf you want to transition over time to a renewable future for energy, then you cannot do it without stations like this and stations like in Tasmania, because as we all know, the wind does know blow all the time and the sun does not always shine, and it\u2019s these projects \u2013 the battery we\u2019re talking about here is immense and that firms the renewable power investments that have been made in other types of renewable power, because this will be here to back it up when those power sources fail,\u201d the prime minister said. Morrison said the government\u2019s objective was to achieve \u201clower emissions, lower prices, and reliability\u201d \u2013 and that was what voters wanted. The prime minister is using the week to attempt a pivot on climate change in an effort to shore up the government\u2019s \u201csmall-l\u201d liberal constituency ahead of the coming election. Morrison has been lobbied by colleagues to give them a policy to sell on climate change, with voters deeply concerned about the government\u2019s record in the area. The prime minister on Monday committed $2bn to reboot and rebadge Tony Abbott\u2019s emissions reduction fund and he is also working with the Tasmanian government on a new interconnector between the island and the mainland. The Snowy commitment is also part of the current climate offensive, with other hydro projects to follow. Morrison also outlined steps that he said would ensure Australia meets its Paris climate target, but in the process of doing that, has revealed the government will factor in 367 megatonnes of abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030).",

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis must have hoped that last week\u2019s unprecedented summit in Rome of senior bishops and church figures from around the world would mark a turning point for his papacy on sexual abuse. The world would see that the Vatican was finally getting a grip on the issue that has caused such grave damage to the church for the past 20 years. Such hopes have been dealt a devastating blow by the news that Cardinal George Pell, until recently the third most senior figure at the Vatican, is facing a prison term for the sexual abuse of minors in the 1990s. The Australian\u2019s conviction on criminal charges will have powerful reverberations throughout the global church. It propels the toxic issue of the \u201cabominations\u201d of children \u2013 Francis\u2019s own word \u2013 directly into the heart of the papacy, where until December the disgraced cardinal had a seat as an influential member of C9, the inner circle of pontifical advisers. It is likely to herald further haemorrhaging from the pews of Roman Catholic churches by disillusioned and despairing parishioners in the west. And it sends a potent message to the church\u2019s elite that no one is too important or too powerful to escape justice; some will be quaking in fear under their cassocks as Pell is led away to prison. Pell\u2019s downfall comes just days after another high-profile figure was defrocked by the pope after a Vatican hearing found him guilty of sexually abusing minors. Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington, was removed from the priesthood after years of swirling rumours about his predatory behaviour with trainee priests. Francis was accused of failing to investigate or take action until a man went public last summer. In France, a verdict is expected next week in the trial of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon, who is accused with five others of helping to cover up alleged sexual abuse. Last month, the Vatican announced that Gustavo Zanchetta, a former Argentinian bishop who was appointed to a senior position at the Holy See in 2017, was under preliminary investigation over alleged sexual abuse claims. Last June, Francis accepted the resignation of three Chilean bishops over their handling of abuse cases, including one he had robustly defended a few months earlier. In July, Philip Wilson stepped down as archbishop of Adelaide after he was convicted of concealing child abuse, although he was subsequently acquitted on appeal. In August, a damning grand jury report laid bare the scale of sexual abuse and its cover-up in Pennsylvania. After a disastrous papal visit to Ireland, a once staunchly Catholic country where the legacy of sexual abuse has decimated some congregations, an investigation in Germany found that more than 1,600 clergy were implicated in the abuse of 3,677 children over a 60-year period; it was \u201cprobably only the tip of the iceberg\u201d.

If you wanted to save hundreds of millions of dollars that victims of abuse might win in the courts, Pell was your man. If you wanted to block official inquiries into the abuse of children by clerics for as long as humanly possible, Pell was your man. When the inquiry came \u2013 the first national inquiry in the world \u2013 its examination of the faults of all the faiths was forensic and damning. The Catholic church came out of the royal commission into the institutional responses to child abuse covered in shame. Pell gave evidence several times. He cuts an awkward figure in a witness box. Answering questions is not his natural metier. But the commissioners only looked at Pell\u2019s sins of omission, his failures over the years to protect children, to discipline priests and to comfort the abused. They did not revisit the allegations that, as a seminarian, he had abused boys at a camp on Phillip Island. In his early days as archbishop of Sydney, Pell had to stand aside for a few months while the church examined the claims of one of those former altar boys. The verdict of the retired judge was: not proven but not dismissed. The commissioners grilled Pell instead on the record of the church. He admitted faults. He expressed regrets. He boasted the work of his Melbourne Response in addressing the needs of victims. He made only a grudging admission that celibacy might be \u201ca factor\u201d in the abuse of children. Pell stood for a deeper truth: the sacred mission of not having priestly sex at all. What hymns of praise this man has sung to that over the years. No sex is sacred. No sex is an offering to Christ. No sex proves our first love is to God and not one another. No sex releases energy and spirit for the service of man. No sex leaves the heart undivided. No sex makes each priest another Christ called to spiritual paternity through the sacraments. That sort of stuff impressed John Paul II and Benedict XVI immensely, but Francis takes a rather more jaundiced view. \u201cBehind rigidity something always lies hidden,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many cases, a double life.\u201d The world can now know that a little over 20 years ago, in Pell\u2019s first months as archbishop of Melbourne, this scourge of sex was forcing choirboys to suck his penis. \u2022 David Marr is a Guardian Australia journalist and author of The Prince: Faith, Abuse and George Pell \u2022 Changes were made in error to this article after publication.

      "bodyText": "A schism within the NSW Greens may end up in court, with two members preparing to launch legal action in a last-minute attempt to change the party\u2019s upper house ticket just weeks before the state election. A former City of Sydney lord mayoral candidate, Lindsay Johnston, and former councillor Chris Harris plan to file legal action in the NSW supreme court as early as Tuesday afternoon to get an official recount of the members\u2019 preselection ballots. At issue is the crucial second spot on the party\u2019s legislative council ballot \u2013 with only the first and second positions likely to be winnable for the party at the 23 March state election. Long-simmering tensions between key figures in the party exploded last year following the ousting of MLC Jeremy Buckingham from the upper-house ticket. Buckingham was formally asked to step aside from the ticket in December, following accusations of sexual misconduct from a former Greens staffer, which Buckingham strenuously denied. He has since quit the party and is running as an independent. MLCs Cate Faerhmann and Justin Field, factional allies of Buckingham, warned an \u201cirrevocable split\u201d was imminent in December unless there was a recount of the ballots for the upper-house preselection. Another ally, MLC Dawn Walker, also requested a formal recount, arguing in December that people who had voted for Buckingham risked being \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d. The preselection was decided by a members\u2019 vote earlier last year, in which the incumbent MLC David Shoebridge, from the party\u2019s left, received the most first preference votes (1,161), followed by Buckingham (780). Due to the party\u2019s affirmative action rules, two men cannot occupy the first and second spots, so Abigail Boyd was placed second on the ballot after the distribution of preferences, Buckingham was placed third and Walker fourth. Buckingham was later removed from the ballot. Walker and her supporters hope a recount could bump her into the second position in place of Boyd. \u201cIf Jeremy was excluded from the count and his 780 first-preference votes were distributed prior to the first count, the order of the ballot may have been different and would have directly elected a woman into the second position, as per the Greens NSW constitution,\u201d Walker wrote in December. Earlier demands for a recount have failed \u2013 the deadline for parties to lodge their tickets is 6 March. Harris told Guardian Australia he and Johnston believed moving candidates up the order of the ballot, rather than carrying out a recount, ran contrary to the Greens\u2019 principle of grassroots democracy. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this action because 780 members voted in the preselection, that\u2019s 30% of the voters, and their votes have been put aside by using this practice, which some inside the Greens say is the usual practice. We disagree with that.\u201d The matter was due to be addressed at a meeting of the state delegates council at the weekend, but a spokesman for the NSW party said a proposal for the recount was withdrawn. \u201cThe upper-house candidates remain David Shoebridge, Abigail Boyd and Dawn Walker \u2013 in that order,\u201d he said. The allegations against Buckingham, which were detailed in an investigation on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program in August and were also the subject of a speech under parliamentary privilege by the Greens MP Jenny Leong, were investigated by an external company, Workdynamic. The full report has never been made public but the party confirmed the investigation found Workdynamic was \u201cnot satisfied that there is sufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities that an incident of sexual harassment as defined by the legislation occurred\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "While prime minister Scott Morrison has spent the past fortnight resurrecting the notorious political wedge of border protection, evidence is mounting that the weapon he is brandishing may be about to malfunction. After Labor worked with the Greens and once-Liberal independents to evacuate asylum seekers in need of medical attention from Nauru and Manus Islands, the PM jumped on to his own historic defeat as though it were a political life raft. With the amplification of News Corp and the outlet formally known as Fairfax, medevac was billed as the \u201cthree-quel\u201d to 2001\u2019s Tampa and 2013\u2019s Turn Back the Boats, the trifecta of conservative election game-changers. The polls are now testing that cargo cult. First Newspoll refused to budge, now this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll has found a similar, though slightly slimmer two-party-preferred figure. But it\u2019s the responses to more detailed questions on the bill that are even more instructive. The breakdown of responses to our Goldilocks propositions \u2013 too hard, too soft or about right \u2013 suggests the split that is occurring is at the Liberal base. The vast majority of Labor voters believe the legislation strikes the right balance or does not go far enough. In contrast, more than a third of Liberal voters see the legislation as reasonable and a further 5% want something even more humane. Given this legislation was conceived by a group of independents who are holding traditionally heartland Liberal seats and espousing traditionally \u201csmall l\u201d liberal values, this should hardly surprise. While it is true the feelings are yet to be tested in the shrill and highly resourced roar of a federal campaign, these numbers suggest that far from destroying Labor, an all-out campaign on boats has the real prospect of further cannibalising the government\u2019s base. On these figures, expect the PM to do what he does best and saunter on to his next scare: likely to be a vociferous attempt to conflate the series of measures Labor has taken to close tax loopholes with another old standard: Labor is for higher taxes. Morrison will confect a budget surplus, splash tax cuts around and then attempt to make the election about tax. His only problem is \u2013 according to another table in this week\u2019s report \u2013 it will again be his base that splits. When we presented respondents with clear choices between stated ALP policy and some of the so-called \u201ctax cuts\u201d they are being accused of pursuing, there was a clear preference for closing the loopholes with everyone \u2013 except Coalition voters who are split right down the middle. These figures suggest to me that politics of boats and tax has moved on from the Howard years. The mainstream is more progressive, and one-time Liberal voters are finding their values aligned with what they used to regard as the other side of politics. So while the wedge is undoubtedly on, it\u2019s of a new garden variety \u2013 the self-administered atomic wedgie, where the flanks of the victim are painfully separated as the wearer blindly lurches around with his own elastic waistband obscuring his vision. \u2022 Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "A Republican senator said he will vote to disapprove of Donald Trump\u2019s national-emergency declaration, even though he supports the border wall. Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Trump\u2019s comments show a \u201clack of understanding\u201d of the Federal Reserve and that she doubts that he has a good grasp of economic policy. The Senate voted down a bill that would make it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect a baby who survives an \u201cattempted abortion\u201d. Democrats pointed out that it was already a felony to harm or neglect an infant, and that the bill only sought to restrict doctors from making case-by-case decisions. \u201cDemocrats have swung so far to the left that they cannot even bring themselves to affirm that babies born alive should be protected,\u201d South Dakota Senator John Thune said. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, wrote an oped for the Washington Post in which he states that even though he supports President Trump\u2019s stance on immigration and call for a border wall, he will vote to disapprove of the president\u2019s national-emergency declaration. Tillis\u2019 main concern appeared to be that \u201cwhen a Democrat once again controls the White House, cites the precedent set by Trump, and declares his or her own national emergency to advance a policy that couldn\u2019t gain congressional approval.\u201d This isn\u2019t just conjecture. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other prominent Democratic elected officials have already hinted that emergency declarations will be part of the playbook for the left, with Pelosi musing, \u201cjust think about what a president with different values can present to the American people.\u201d Conservatives should take these warnings seriously. They should be thinking about whether they would accept the prospect of a President Bernie Sanders declaring a national emergency to implement parts of the radical Green New Deal; a President Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation\u2019s financial institutions; or a President Cory Booker declaring a national emergency to restrict Second Amendment rights. Read the whole oped here. The Senate voted down a bill that sought to make it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect a baby who survives an \u201cattempted abortion,\u201d which Politico is reporting is \u201cpart of a Republican effort to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.\u201d Ahead of the vote, the bill\u2019s Republican sponsors and outside anti-abortion groups lobbying for its passage made it clear that the intent of Monday\u2019s vote was to undermine the growing pool of Senate Democrats running for president. In a speech just before the vote, bill author Sen. Ben Sasse quoted campaign stump speeches by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders vowing to look out for society\u2019s \u201cvoiceless and vulnerable\u201d and accused them of hypocrisy for opposing his bill\u2019s regulations for the care of newborns. \u201cWas that all just clap track for the campaign trail and for soundbites? Or do people mean the stuff that they say around here?\u201d he said of his colleagues with White House aspirations. Several Republican senators took to Twitter to express their disappointment over the vote. Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Gillibrand all voted against the bill, according to Politico. Democrats and reproductive rights advocates blasted the bill, saying it\u2019s already a felony to harm or neglect an infant and that the \u201cmedically irresponsible\u201d bill would restricts doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers. \u201cThis bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed\u2014because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \u201cThis bill is government interference in women\u2019s health care, in families\u2019 lives, and in medicine on steroids.\u201d The Florida Supreme Court granted Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 request for a statewide grand jury to investigate school safety laws enacted in the wake of the Parkland high school shooting that left 17 dead, the Associated Press is reporting. The Supreme Court issued the order Tuesday, less than two weeks after DeSantis called for the grand jury. The 18-member panel will meet for a year. The grand jury will have the power to call witnesses and return indictments. It will mark yet another probe launched in the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The grand jury will investigate whether school officials have committed fraud by misusing money intended for school safety and whether they are failing to report criminal activity in schools to the Department of Education. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for Tom McCarthy. Happy Monday. Let\u2019s see what the rest of the day has in store. Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says she doubts that President Donald Trump has a good grasp of economic policy or even knows the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandates, the AP reports: In an interview with radio program Marketplace, Yellen says, \u201cI doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed\u2019s goals are maximum employment and price stability.\u201d More from AP: She says Trump\u2019s comments demonstrate a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about the Fed. In the interview released Monday Yellen made her most pointed comments about Trump since he decided not to nominate her for a second term as Fed leader. She left the Fed a year ago and was succeeded as chairman by Powell. She is now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u2022A former staff member of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has filed a federal lawsuit against the president, claiming he kissed her without consent. Alva Johnson said Trump \u201cgrasped her hand and did not let go\u201d and kissed her on the corner of her mouth as she turned slightly away. The White House denied the allegation. \u2022US Capitol Police arrested 42 of the hundreds of protesters with the environmental group Sunrise Movement, who protested outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Washington DC office. McConnell is planning a vote on the Green New Deal, a massive proposal to fight climate change, with the likely intention of torpedoing the plan. \u2022Donald Trump is en route to Vietnam for a summit with Kim Jong-Un. Trump, Kim and senior officials from both countries are scheduled to resume talks held in Singapore in June last year over North Korean nuclear disarmament. Trump has claimed North Korea is \u201cno longer a nuclear threat\u201d. His intelligence agencies, and Secretary of State, disagree. \u202258 former top national security officials condemned Trump\u2019s declaration of an emergency on the southern border. There is no real emergency and the declaration harms American interests, said the letter, signatories of which included both Republicans and Democrats. \u2022Warren Buffett made the case for rich Americans to pay more taxes, in an interview with CNBC. Buffett said the rich will continue to get richer in the coming years, adding: \u201cI think the income tax credit is the best way to address that.\u201d Buffett said the proposal \u201cprobably means more taxes for guys like me, and I\u2019m fine with it Fifty-eight former top national security officials have signed their names to a public letter (full text here) condemning Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency on the southern US border. The signatories include both Republicans and Democrats (with a heavy sprinkling of former Obama officials) and also include: two former secretaries of state, two former secretaries of defense, a former secretary of homeland security, a former CIA director, a former director of national intelligence, a former national security adviser, multiple former directors of the national counterterrorism center and many ambassadors. The letter reads in part: We have served in senior leadership roles in administrations of both major political parties, and collectively we have devoted a great many decades to protecting the security interests of the United States. [...] We are aware of no emergency that remotely justifies such a step. The President\u2019s actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration\u2019s own data and estimates. We have lived and worked through national emergencies, and we support the President\u2019s power to mobilize the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the President to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border. Key points the letter makes include: Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. There is no documented terrorist or national security emergency at the southern border. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the southern border. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can be addressed by a wall at the southern border. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian concerns that do exist at the southern border. Redirecting funds for the claimed \u201cnational emergency\u201d will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The situation at the border does not require the use of the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the use of the armed forces. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations process with a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. The signatories are: 1. Madeleine K. Albright 2. Jeremy B. Bash 3.

Trump claims a delay in tariffs on Chinese goods is related to a trade deal he is crafting which he says is \u201cin advanced stages\u201d: Could Green Book\u2019s victory at the Oscars last night indicate unexpected traction for Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign? We\u2019re kidding \u2013 of course it doesn\u2019t mean that. But CNN\u2019s Harry Enten pointed out last week that betting markets rated both outcomes at around 20% likelihood, the point here being that sometimes 20% happens. (We\u2019re reserving judgment on the quality of the oddsmakers\u2019 numbers. Maybe Green Book was in fact a better-than-one-in-five bet. Mahershala Ali was really good in it. Maybe Sanders has a less-than-20% shot. What do you give him?) National security adviser John Bolton has echoed vice president Mike Pence\u2019s tough talk on Venezuela, saying in a statement that \u201cMaduro\u2019s actions will not go unpunished\u201d: Earlier Pence called for Maduro to be deposed and said, \u201cwe hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.\u201d The former Daily Show host Jon Stewart is on the Hill today supporting legislation to extend the 9-11 victims\u2019 fund: Scene from a Trump meeting at the White House today with state governors following last night\u2019s \u201cGovernor\u2019s Ball\u201d, via the Toronto Star correspondent Daniel Dale: Here\u2019s video of the event: Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has been overseeing much of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, delivered remarks in Washington on Monday about upholding the rule of law. But in case you were expecting a speech chock full of subtle references to Donald Trump \u2013 a president who hasn\u2019t shown much deference for rules and norms \u2013 guess again. Rosenstein studiously avoided the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, the conclusion of which is expected as early as this week. As Mueller prepares to deliver a report summarizing his team\u2019s findings, Rosenstein emphasized caution with respect to allegations that remain unproven. \u201cMy view is the Department of Justice is best served when people are confident that we\u2019re going to operate \u2014 when we\u2019re investigating American citizens in particular \u2014 we\u2019re going to do it with appropriate sensitivity to the rights of uncharged people,\u201d Rosenstein said, at discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens \u2026 I know there\u2019s a tension there.\u201d Rosenstein also expressed confidence in William Barr, the newly confirmed attorney general who will be tasked with deciding whether or not to make the Mueller report public. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a decision the attorney general makes as to what to do with whatever information is provided to him,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cI think Attorney General Barr is going to make the right decision. You can trust him to do this \u2026 I think we can count on him to do the right thing.\u201d Democrats have said they would be willing to subpoena the special counsel report and have Mueller testify on Capitol Hill if necessary, citing concerns that Barr may not sufficiently disclose its findings. But even as he declined to specifically discuss the Mueller investigation, Rosenstein suggested there was good cause to not always be transparent about the government\u2019s work. \u201cJust because the government collects information doesn\u2019t mean that information is accurate, and it can be really misleading if you\u2019re overly transparent about information that the government collects, so I think we do need to be really cautious about that,\u201d he said. So was Rosenstein tempering expectations or simply speaking generally about Justice Department guidelines? We will soon find out. The US and other allies of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 are seeking ways to ramp up pressure on a country that is already heavily sanctioned and isolated, after a weekend bid to defy Caracas by bringing food and medical aid into the country ended in failure and violence, my colleagues Emma Graham-Harrison, Joe Parkin Daniels and Sam Jones report: At an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1, the US vice-president repeated calls for increased international pressure on Venezuela\u2019s leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Pence said: \u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro is a usurper with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro must go.\u201d He went on: \u201cTo leaders around the world: it\u2019s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela\u2019s struggle for freedom. As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.\u201d [...] That apparent hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion. Read the piece in full here: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will eschew paid-for fundraising dinners and lengthy courting of donors during her presidential campaign. In a Medium post Warren said her campaign \u201cwill be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it\u201d. \u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks. And when I thank the people giving to my campaign, it will not be based on the size of their donation,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cIt means that wealthy donors won\u2019t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events. And it means I won\u2019t be doing \u2018call time\u2019, which is when candidates take hours to call wealthy donors to ask for their support.\u201d For every time you see a presidential candidate talking with voters at a town hall, rally, or local diner, those same candidates are spending three or four or five times as long with wealthy donors \u2014 on the phone, or in conference rooms at hedge fund offices, or at fancy receptions and intimate dinners \u2014 all behind closed doors. Even when the candidate\u2019s heart is in the right place and the donor is well-intentioned, that time creates a direct relationship between wealth and access to our political leaders. I believe that\u2019s wrong: The amount of money you can give shouldn\u2019t determine the amount of time you get to spend with a candidate. House Democrats are preparing to investigate Donald Trump\u2019s personal finances in the coming weeks, with particular scrutiny on his relationship with Deutsche Bank \u2013 the German bank which is under scrutiny for its role in Russian money laundering. Politico reports that the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees \u201chave been staffing up for their probes into the bank and Trump\u2019s Russia ties\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened need to look into anything that could compromise the president or the country, particularly if it\u2019s not being investigated elsewhere,\u201d House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t know that to be the case but I just haven\u2019t seen any external signs that that\u2019s happening.\u201d Democrats on the panels say that with Deutsche Bank they are willing to pursue a key area that [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller may have avoided \u2014 crossing what Trump sees as a \u201cred line\u201d into his personal finances. The German bank, which has been under scrutiny for its role in Russian money laundering, lent Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over the years for his property development ventures. In his latest financial disclosure filing, Trump reported owing Deutsche Bank at least $130 million. The US Capitol Police arrested 42 of the hundreds of protesters with the youth-led Sunrise Movement who protested outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Washington DC office to urge him to act on climate change. The protesters were led in groups with hands behind their backs to a bus outside the Senate office building. Supporters wearing shirts that said \u201c12 years\u201d and \u201cWe have a right to good jobs and a livable future,\u201d continued to chant. \u201cWhich side are you on now?\u201d they sang as some of the protesters were processed for arrest with pat-downs. McConnell has promised a vote on the Green New Deal, a massive proposal to fight climate change and guarantee jobs, health care and education to all Americans. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey recently introduced text laying out the broad strokes of the plan. The Sunrise Movement in a press release called McConnell\u2019s plans for a vote a \u201cshameful ploy.\u201d His move for a vote is likely meant to expose moderates who would find it difficult to vote for the plan\u2019s expansive social goals, particularly without more specific provisions. A staffer greeted the group and took down their information, but no one from McConnell\u2019s office spoke with them. Protesters from Kentucky said they have repeatedly sought meetings with him. Donald Trump has left for Vietnam, for his summit with Kim Jong-Un. Trump, Kim and senior officials from both countries are scheduled to meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Wednesday and Thursday, resuming talks held in Singapore in June last year \u2013 the first between the two countries\u2019 heads of state. Trump has previously overstated the concessions made by North Korea in its goal to develop a nuclear weapon, but yesterday he set a more realistic tone. Trump said in a tweet he expected \u201ca continuation of the progress\u201d made at their first summit last year, adding simply: \u201cDenuclearization?\u201d He later said North Korea could become \u201cone of the great economic powers\u201d if it abandoned nuclear weapons. Washington state is planning to sue the Trump administration over its new policy setting up further obstacles for women seeking abortions. The government issued a rule on Friday that bars federally funded family planning programs from referring women for abortions. The move could strip millions of federal dollars from Planned Parenthood and divert it toward faith-based care providers. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who has challenged other Trump policies, including the travel ban, announced the lawsuit on Monday. The American Medical Association had warned that the policy could have an impact beyond abortion. The association says the policy could affect access to health care services provided to low-income women by the clinics, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Warren Buffett has made the case for rich Americans to pay more taxes, in an interview with CNBC. \u201cAs we get more specialized, the rich will get richer. The question is: How do you take care of a guy who is a wonderful citizen whose father died in Normandy and just doesn\u2019t have market skills? I think the income tax credit is the best way to address that,\u201d Buffett told the news channel. That probably means more taxes for guys like me, and I\u2019m fine with it. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, have both proposed measures which would tax the super rich. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal would apply a 70 percent marginal tax on incomes over $10 million. Warrnen has suggested an \u201cultra-millionaire\u201d tax that would apply to people with more than $50 million in assets. A number of the Green New Deal activists who are protesting outside Mitch McConnell\u2019s office are now being led away by police, the Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden is reporting: A group of young Kentuckians are protesting outside Mitch McConnell\u2019s DC office this morning, to demand the Republican Senate majority leader take action on climate change. Emily Holden, the Guardian\u2019s climate reporter, is with the 200 activists as they line the halls outside McConnell\u2019s office. The protestors, have travelled to DC from McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky with the aid of the Sunrise Movement, an environmental activist group. Sunrise Movement is aiming to raise support for the Green New Deal, a 10-year plan to mobilize America toward 100% renewable energy. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced resolutions to bring the Deal to Congress this week. Trump\u2019s defenders in the Alva Johnson sexual misconduct allegations are likely to point to a recently sealed lawsuit involving the former campaign worker. The Washington Post reported that in September 2018, three months after Johnson hired the Washington DC attorney Hassan Zavareei to handle the Trump case, Johnson \u201cmoved to seal a years-old court case in which two family members had briefly sought a temporary restraining order against her\u201d. The restraining order was brought against Johnson in 2006. According to the Post, Johnson\u2019s half-sister alleged that Johnson had been calling another sister\u2019s school and falsely claiming that the teenager was using drugs. The family members withdrew the petition three weeks later. \u201cThese false allegations came in the context of a family dispute that was resolved amicably years ago,\u201d Zavareei said. \u201cMs. Johnson\u2019s family stands firmly behind her pursuit of justice against Donald Trump for the sexual assaults he has committed against Ms. Johnson and so many other women over the course of decades.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has dismissed the accusation he kissed a woman without her consent as \u201cabsurd\u201d. The full statement from the White House: This accusation is absurd on its face. This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts. Of course, Trump himself was caught on an Access Hollywood tape specifically saying he kisses women without their consent. The tape was released by NBC in 2016. From the transcript: I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful\u2014I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2018em by the pussy. You can do anything This is not the first time Donald Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct. More than a dozen women have made allegations against the president, ranging from sexual assault to sexual harrassment. In November 2017 the Guardian reported on 20 women who had accused Trump of misconduct. At the time Trump said each of the women were lying, and suggested some of the accusers were not attractive enough for him to want to sexually assault. A list of the women, and their accusations, is here. Clearly, the number has continued to grow. Here\u2019s more on the Harry Reid-Donald Trump row that erupted this morning, where the former Senate majority leader said Donald Trump is making George W. Bush look like Babe Ruth. Reid\u2019s slight came during an interview with CNN, as the the man who clashed constantly with Bush during his presidency said he now wishes for Bush back \u201cevery day.\u201d Erin Durkin reports: \u201cHe and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism. Our battles were strictly political battles,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that George Bush would be Babe Ruth in this league that he\u2019s in with Donald Trump in the league. Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t make the team.\u201d The Nevada Democrat said he couldn\u2019t think of a single good thing about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI just have trouble accepting him as a person, so frankly I don\u2019t see anything he\u2019s doing right.\u201d Still, Reid dismissed calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment as a \u201cwaste of time\u201d since Senate Republicans will never go along. And he advised Democratic presidential candidates not to focus their message on the president. \u201cThe candidates running need not talk about how bad President Trump is, they just need to talk about what\u2019s good for the country. Everyone knows, even those people supporting knows what problems he has,\u201d he told CNN. Reid, who has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was reported last month not to have long to live, said his cancer is now in remission, though chemotherapy treatment took a harsh toll on his health and left him unable to walk much without assistance. His health troubles didn\u2019t stop Trump from hitting back at him on Twitter. \u201cFormer Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer,\u201d the president said. \u201cSome things just never change!\u201d Donald Trump has complained about a \u201cracist hit\u201d he said Spike Lee carried out on him at the Oscars. The film-maker, 61, won his first competitive Academy Award, best adapted screenplay, for his film BlacKkKlansman, which was also nominated for best picture. Lee received an honorary Oscar in 2015. Ata press conference after the awards ceremony, Lee was asked if his film had changed America. He responded by discussing the white nationalist rally and march in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017, during which Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old counter-protester, was killed by a car driven by an extremist. Lee included footage of the attack in BlacKkKlansman. Trump infamously said there had been \u201cvery fine people, on both sides\u201d of the protests. \u201cThat car drove down that one street in Virginia,\u201d Lee said, \u201cand the president of the United States did not reject, refute [or] did not denounce the Klan, \u2018alt-right\u2019 and neo-Nazis. This film, whether we won best picture or not, this film will stand the test of time being on the right side of history.\u201d Around dawn on Monday, from the White House, Trump duly responded with a nasty personal jab. He wrote: \u201cBe nice if Spike Lee could read his notes or better yet not have to use notes at all when doing his racist hit on your president.\u201d A former staff member of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has filed a federal lawsuit against the president, claiming he kissed her without consent. Alva Johnson, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign\u2019s director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama in 2016, told the Washington Post that Trump \u201cgrabbed her hand and leaned in to kiss her on the lips\u201d, as the then-candidate exited an RV at a rally in Tampa on August 24 2016. According to the Post: Johnson said she turned her head and the unwanted kiss landed on the side of her mouth, which she called \u201csuper-creepy and inappropriate.\u201d \u201cI immediately felt violated because I wasn\u2019t expecting it or wanting it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can still see his lips coming straight for my face.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Johnson\u2019s allegation as \u201cabsurd on its face\u201d in a statement to the newspaper. \u201cThis never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts,\u201d Sanders said. Johnson filed the lawsuit in Florida on Monday. She is seeking damages for emotional pain and suffering. The Washington Post said the lawsuit \u201calso alleges that the campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white male counterparts\u201d. A spokesman for the campaign denied the claim. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. \u2022It\u2019s set to be a big week in Washington DC. Particularly for Michael Cohen. Trump\u2019s former fixer, who in December was sentenced to 36 months in prison for crimes including lying to Congress and facilitating illegal payments, is giving testimony before the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday and Thursday. We\u2019ll watch out for developments before his appearances. \u2022Mike Pence is meeting with Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido in Colombia today. The vice-president will announce \u201cconcrete steps\u201d and \u201cclear actions\u201d to address the Venezuela crisis, Reuters reported. The US has called for President Nicolas Maduro to step down. \u2022Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid has been weighing in on Donald Trump this morning, saying the president is so bad he makes George W Bush look like \u201cBabe Ruth\u201d. Trump has used his regular morning Twitter riff to claim Reid has a \u201cfailed career\u201d. \u2022Trump has been busy on other topics too, warning Republican senators not to be \u201cled down the path of weak and ineffective border security\u201d. Trump reiterated that there is a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d at the southern border.",

Chelsea have sought to draw a line under the incident after Arrizabalaga\u2019s show of dissent at Wembley, put down to a misunderstanding in the immediate aftermath of the defeat by Manchester City on penalties, publicly undermined Sarri\u2019s authority. The Italian has found himself under mounting pressure of late with open revolt erupting in the stands over his tactics during the recent FA Cup elimination by Manchester United, and Arrizabalaga\u2019s actions had fuelled the suspicion that a mutinous mood was now spreading on to the pitch. The goalkeeper had twice required treatment during extra time, apparently suffering from cramp \u2013 he subsequently suggested he had been buying time for his teammates to recover after a gruelling goalless final \u2013 before angrily waving away frantic attempts by Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, to replace him with Willy Caballero in the last minute of extra time. His refusal to leave the field prompted a furious reaction from Sarri who, after the final whistle, attempted to confront the 24-year-old and had to be held back by Antonio R\u00fcdiger as the players gathered to compose themselves for the shootout. That was duly lost 4-3, with Arrizabalaga saving from Leroy San\u00e9 but allowing Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s penalty to slip under his body and in. The pair spoke post-match, insisting the incident had stemmed from a breakdown in communication with the \u00a371.3m world-record signing insisting it had \u201cnever been my intention to go against the manager\u201d. He subsequently went further on social media: \u201cI have full respect for the coach and his authority.\u201d While no senior players had attempted to usher him off with the fourth official holding up his number and his prospective replacement waiting awkwardly on the touchline, his refusal to leave the pitch is understood to have left teammates distinctly unimpressed. Sarri and Arrizabalaga had attempted to clear the air in the dressing room after media duties had been completed, with the issue addressed again at a team meeting at Cobham before the squad\u2019s warm-down session on Monday. Regardless, the head coach and player still felt compelled to release statements through the club late on Monday night to resolve the issue well in advance of Wednesday\u2019s Premier League game at home against Tottenham. \u201cI was very happy to play in my first cup final for Chelsea and very proud of the team performance,\u201d said Arrizabalaga. \u201cI have thought a lot more about yesterday\u2019s events.

I have done this and now I want to offer the same apology to the fans.

      "body": "<p>Monsanto is facing its first federal trial over allegations that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, but a US judge has blocked attorneys from discussing the corporation\u2019s alleged manipulation of science.</p> <p>In an extraordinary move in a packed San Francisco courtroom on Monday, US judge Vince Chhabria threatened to sanction and \u201cshut down\u201d a cancer patient\u2019s attorney for violating his ban on talking about Monsanto\u2019s influence on government regulators and cancer research.<strong> </strong>\u201cYou\u2019ve completely disregarded the limitations that were set upon you,\u201d the visibly angry judge said to attorney Aimee Wagstaff, threatening to prevent her from continuing. \u201cIf you cross the line one more time \u2026 your opening statement will be over \u2026 If I see a single inappropriate thing on those slides, I\u2019m shutting you down.\u201d</p> <p>The unusual conflict in the federal courtroom has fueled concerns among Monsanto\u2019s critics<strong> </strong>that the trial may be unfairly stacked against the plaintiff, Edwin Hardeman, a 70-year-old Santa Rosa man who alleges that his exposure to Roundup over several decades caused his cancer. Building on longstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/one-mans-suffering-exposed-monsantos-secrets-to-the-world\">allegations</a>, Hardeman\u2019s lawyers and other critics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/monsanto-trial-roundup-weedkiller-cancer-dewayne-johnson\">argued</a> that Monsanto has for years suppressed negative studies and worked to promote and \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable studies about its herbicide to influence the public and regulators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/weed-killing-products-increase-cancer-risk-of-cancer\">Weedkiller 'raises risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by 41%'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a blow to the plaintiffs, Chhabria this year <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-roundup-case-the-science-will-go-on-trial-first-11550246311\">approved Monsanto\u2019s request</a> to <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2019/01/Pretrial-order-on-bifurcation.pdf\">prohibit</a> Hardeman\u2019s attorneys from raising allegations about the corporation\u2019s conduct, saying issues about its influence on science and government were a \u201csignificant \u2026 distraction\u201d. That <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/pesticides/monsanto-roundup-trial-tracker/\">means</a> jurors must narrowly consider the studies surrounding Roundup\u2019s cancer risks, and if they rule that Monsanto caused Hardeman\u2019s illness, then in a second phase the jury would learn about the company\u2019s conduct when assessing liability and punitive damages.</p> <p>Hardeman\u2019s trial is considered a \u201cbellwether\u201d case for hundreds of other federal plaintiffs who have made similar claims, meaning its outcome could have an impact on the course of future litigation and potential settlements. The high-stakes case comes amid growing global scrutiny of the health impacts of glyphosate, which is sold under the Roundup brand.</p> <p>Concerns about the product escalated last August after a California jury issued an historic verdict, saying Monsanto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/monsanto-trial-cancer-dewayne-johnson-ruling\">was liable for a terminally ill man\u2019s cancer</a> and owed him $289m in damages. The groundbreaking ruling against Monsanto set the stage for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/07/monsanto-trial-cancer-appeal-glyphosate-chemical\">new wave of cancer litigation in the US</a> and sparked regulatory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/13/australia-urged-to-restrict-monsantos-roundup-after-us-court-rules-it-caused-cancer\">debates</a> and campaigns to restrict the chemical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/homebase-to-review-sale-of-monsanto-weedkiller-after-us-cancer-verdict-roundup\">across the globe</a>.</p> <p>Monsanto is now owned by German pharmaceutical company Bayer, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit/u-s-judge-selects-first-case-in-federal-monsanto-weed-killer-litigation-idUSKCN1NP2HZ\">suffered</a> a 30% share price drop after the verdict and<strong> </strong>is now facing more than 9,000 similar <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit/u-s-judge-limits-evidence-in-trial-over-roundup-cancer-claims-idUSKCN1OY03N\">lawsuits</a> across the country.</p> <p>Wagstaff told the Guardian last week before trial began that the limitations on evidence in the first phase meant the \u201cjury will only hear half of the story\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe jury will hear about the science, but they won\u2019t get to hear about how Monsanto influenced it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jury won\u2019t have a complete understanding of the science. If we win without the jury knowing the complete science, that\u2019s a real problem for Monsanto.\u201d</p> <p>Chhabria repeatedly interrupted Wagstaff\u2019s opening statement Monday morning, reminding jurors that her comments did not constitute evidence and should be taken with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d. He also asked her to speed up when she was introducing Hardeman and his wife and discussing how they first met in 1975.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93a2768ea5a4544f5d2ca88ee75137e03a08055b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93a2768ea5a4544f5d2ca88ee75137e03a08055b/86_174_1101_1471/748.jpg\" alt=\"Edwin Hardeman with a jar of Roundup.\" width=\"748\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edwin Hardeman with a jar of Roundup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Andrus Wagstaff PC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wagstaff spoke in detail about the research on cancer and glyphosate, about some of Monsanto\u2019s involvement in studies, and about the company\u2019s communications with the Environmental Protection Agency. Eventually, the judge ordered the jury to take a break and issued his threat to sanction Wagstaff, though it was unclear which specific statements he had opposed.</p> <p>When she tried to clarify her remarks, noting that she had clearly made the judge \u201cupset\u201d, Chhabria responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being upset. It\u2019s about running an orderly trial.\u201d</p> <p>He then ordered her to file a written motion by the end of the day arguing why he should not sanction her \u2013 and said he was considering a fine of $1,000.</p> <p>The judge also said he didn\u2019t trust her to continue using her prepared materials: \u201cShould I save Ms Wagstaff from herself by barring her from further use of slides?\u201d He ultimately allowed her to finish her opening statement. He ended the day by again attacking her opening remarks, saying her statements were \u201cincredibly dumb\u201d.</p> <p>Hardeman, who sat in court with his wife, has <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2018/12/Edward-Hardeman-1st-amended-complaint-Feb.-2016.pdf\">alleged</a> that his use of Roundup starting in 1986 to control poison oak and weeds on his property caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer that affects the immune system.</p> <p>Hardeman\u2019s case builds on a key 2015 ruling by the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d, based on a review of existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/weed-killing-products-increase-cancer-risk-of-cancer\">research</a>. Monsanto continues to argue that Roundup is safe, citing other studies. The company has also suggested Hardeman\u2019s hepatitis C could be a possible cause of his cancer.</p> <p>Brian Stekloff, Monsanto\u2019s attorney, described NHL as a \u201ccommon cancer\u201d in his opening remarks, saying the cause is \u201cunknown\u201d for the vast majority of cases, adding: \u201cRoundup did not cause Mr Hardeman\u2019s non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d</p> <p>He noted that doctors have not specifically noted Hardeman\u2019s use of Roundup in his medical records.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/eu-glyphosate-approval-was-based-on-plagiarised-monsanto-text-report-finds\">EU glyphosate approval was based on plagiarised Monsanto text, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Bayer spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the \u201cextensive body of scientific research ... supports the conclusion that Roundup is not responsible for his illness\u201d and noted the EPA\u2019s 2017 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pesticides-glyphosate/u-s-epa-says-glyphosate-not-likely-to-be-carcinogenic-to-people-idUSKBN1EE2XH\">assessment</a>, finding that glyphosate was \u201cnot likely to be carcinogenic to humans\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Monsanto is facing its first federal trial over allegations that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, but a US judge has blocked attorneys from discussing the corporation\u2019s alleged manipulation of science. In an extraordinary move in a packed San Francisco courtroom on Monday, US judge Vince Chhabria threatened to sanction and \u201cshut down\u201d a cancer patient\u2019s attorney for violating his ban on talking about Monsanto\u2019s influence on government regulators and cancer research. \u201cYou\u2019ve completely disregarded the limitations that were set upon you,\u201d the visibly angry judge said to attorney Aimee Wagstaff, threatening to prevent her from continuing. \u201cIf you cross the line one more time \u2026 your opening statement will be over \u2026 If I see a single inappropriate thing on those slides, I\u2019m shutting you down.\u201d The unusual conflict in the federal courtroom has fueled concerns among Monsanto\u2019s critics that the trial may be unfairly stacked against the plaintiff, Edwin Hardeman, a 70-year-old Santa Rosa man who alleges that his exposure to Roundup over several decades caused his cancer. Building on longstanding allegations, Hardeman\u2019s lawyers and other critics have argued that Monsanto has for years suppressed negative studies and worked to promote and \u201cghostwrite\u201d favorable studies about its herbicide to influence the public and regulators. In a blow to the plaintiffs, Chhabria this year approved Monsanto\u2019s request to prohibit Hardeman\u2019s attorneys from raising allegations about the corporation\u2019s conduct, saying issues about its influence on science and government were a \u201csignificant \u2026 distraction\u201d. That means jurors must narrowly consider the studies surrounding Roundup\u2019s cancer risks, and if they rule that Monsanto caused Hardeman\u2019s illness, then in a second phase the jury would learn about the company\u2019s conduct when assessing liability and punitive damages. Hardeman\u2019s trial is considered a \u201cbellwether\u201d case for hundreds of other federal plaintiffs who have made similar claims, meaning its outcome could have an impact on the course of future litigation and potential settlements. The high-stakes case comes amid growing global scrutiny of the health impacts of glyphosate, which is sold under the Roundup brand. Concerns about the product escalated last August after a California jury issued an historic verdict, saying Monsanto was liable for a terminally ill man\u2019s cancer and owed him $289m in damages. The groundbreaking ruling against Monsanto set the stage for a new wave of cancer litigation in the US and sparked regulatory debates and campaigns to restrict the chemical across the globe. Monsanto is now owned by German pharmaceutical company Bayer, which suffered a 30% share price drop after the verdict and is now facing more than 9,000 similar lawsuits across the country. Wagstaff told the Guardian last week before trial began that the limitations on evidence in the first phase meant the \u201cjury will only hear half of the story\u201d. \u201cThe jury will hear about the science, but they won\u2019t get to hear about how Monsanto influenced it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jury won\u2019t have a complete understanding of the science. If we win without the jury knowing the complete science, that\u2019s a real problem for Monsanto.\u201d Chhabria repeatedly interrupted Wagstaff\u2019s opening statement Monday morning, reminding jurors that her comments did not constitute evidence and should be taken with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d. He also asked her to speed up when she was introducing Hardeman and his wife and discussing how they first met in 1975. Wagstaff spoke in detail about the research on cancer and glyphosate, about some of Monsanto\u2019s involvement in studies, and about the company\u2019s communications with the Environmental Protection Agency. Eventually, the judge ordered the jury to take a break and issued his threat to sanction Wagstaff, though it was unclear which specific statements he had opposed. When she tried to clarify her remarks, noting that she had clearly made the judge \u201cupset\u201d, Chhabria responded: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being upset. It\u2019s about running an orderly trial.\u201d He then ordered her to file a written motion by the end of the day arguing why he should not sanction her \u2013 and said he was considering a fine of $1,000. The judge also said he didn\u2019t trust her to continue using her prepared materials: \u201cShould I save Ms Wagstaff from herself by barring her from further use of slides?\u201d He ultimately allowed her to finish her opening statement. He ended the day by again attacking her opening remarks, saying her statements were \u201cincredibly dumb\u201d. Hardeman, who sat in court with his wife, has alleged that his use of Roundup starting in 1986 to control poison oak and weeds on his property caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer that affects the immune system. Hardeman\u2019s case builds on a key 2015 ruling by the World Health Organization\u2019s international agency for research on cancer (IARC) that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d, based on a review of existing research. Monsanto continues to argue that Roundup is safe, citing other studies. The company has also suggested Hardeman\u2019s hepatitis C could be a possible cause of his cancer. Brian Stekloff, Monsanto\u2019s attorney, described NHL as a \u201ccommon cancer\u201d in his opening remarks, saying the cause is \u201cunknown\u201d for the vast majority of cases, adding: \u201cRoundup did not cause Mr Hardeman\u2019s non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d He noted that doctors have not specifically noted Hardeman\u2019s use of Roundup in his medical records. A Bayer spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the \u201cextensive body of scientific research ... supports the conclusion that Roundup is not responsible for his illness\u201d and noted the EPA\u2019s 2017 assessment, finding that glyphosate was \u201cnot likely to be carcinogenic to humans\u201d. The EPA previously faced backlash when emails revealed the agency\u2019s close communications with Monsanto. Hardeman, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of NHL in 2015, has remained dedicated to the lawsuit, even if though it has taken a \u201ctoll on him emotionally and physically\u201d, Wagstaff said in interview before trial: \u201cIt\u2019s really important for him now to do this. He\u2019s a man with high integrity \u2026 When you see some of the ways Monsanto has manipulated the science and robbed him of his choices, it\u2019s pretty egregious.\u201d Dewayne Johnson, a former school groundskeeper, won the landmark victory last year when the jurors ruled that Monsanto failed to warn him of the health hazards from exposure to Roundup, had \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d, and was responsible for \u201cnegligent failure\u201d. A judge later reduced the damages to $78m, but rejected Monsanto\u2019s appeal to overturn the verdict. Johnson\u2019s case presented internal documents that his lawyers said revealed the ways Monsanto had \u201cbullied\u201d scientists with critical findings. The restrictions on testimony about Monsanto\u2019s conduct and alleged manipulation of science is likely to be a major detriment to Hardeman and future plaintiffs, said Jean M Eggen, professor emerita at Widener University Delaware Law School. \u201cIt was a brilliant move on the part of the defendant Bayer to try to keep [out] all of that information,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it may pay off for them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Christian Porter appointed a Liberal party member to a lucrative government job just three days before she unsuccessfully contested preselection for the Victorian federal seat of Higgins. On Thursday the attorney general appointed lawyer Jane Bell to the administrative appeals tribunal, along with 14 other former Coalition parliamentarians and staffers, including his own former senior adviser William Frost. On Sunday Bell, a solicitor for 22 years, board member of Monash Health and deputy chair of Biomedical Research Victoria, lost the Higgins preselection to paediatrician Katie Allen. Bell got a part-time position at the AAT while Frost was appointed full-time, a position that attracts a $244,000 salary. The Coalition has come under fire from Labor for stacking the tribunal, which has wide-ranging powers to review government and administrative decisions in areas including appeals against robodebts and asylum applications. The latest crop of appointments led the Law Council of Australia to renew calls for a transparent, merit-based process because of fears the tribunal\u2019s independence and integrity would be compromised. Of the 34 new appointments announced on Thursday, six were former Coalition parliamentarians and eight were former Coalition staffers, including Frost, a senior adviser to Porter from 2015 to 2019 during his stints as social services minister and attorney general. Just one former Labor MP, David Cox, was appointed. Porter told Guardian Australia that Bell had nominated for Higgins \u201cafter the substantive preselection process but before her final appointment\u201d. \u201cThere is no reason why a person during the selection and appointment process for the AAT is not able to nominate for a preselection or commence other employment application processes, if that is their wish,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, Ms Bell was not successful so it has no impact on her ability to take up the AAT role.\u201d Porter said Frost was \u201can experienced lawyer and there is no question that he\u2019s an outstanding candidate for the position, bringing extensive legal knowledge and practical experience in administrative law\u201d. \u201cLabor appointed a number of its former staff to roles within the AAT and the latest round of appointments announced by me last week includes the reappointment of some of those staff and, indeed, the new appointment of a former Labor parliamentarian.\u201d On Monday Porter told 6PR radio he was keen to appoint \u201cpeople who would reflect community values in migration decisions, because we have had a very large number of ministerial migration decisions overturned by the AAT\u201d. He cited the independent tribunal\u2019s decision to overturn 39% of migration cases, more than 4,000 in the past year. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has been pushing to restrict the AAT\u2019s powers of review, claiming that it is out of step with community standards in overturning departmental cancellations of visas on character grounds. On Friday the Law Council president, Arthur Moses SC, said the legal profession was concerned and troubled by the latest round of appointments. \u201cThe independence and integrity of the AAT depends on an apolitical, open and merit-based appointment system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s announcement of 34 new appointments to the AAT made without community consultation and 52 reappointments for existing members is concerning.\u201d Moses cited the number of reappointments of existing members \u201cwell before the expiry of their current terms\u201d. \u201cIn the context of an upcoming federal election, [this] may give rise to a reasonable apprehension that decisions are affected by political considerations and therefore compromises the reputation of the tribunal.\u201d The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has accused the Coalition of a \u201cshameful record\u201d of stacking the tribunal by making 86 appointments \u201cfull of Liberal mates\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Mohammad Javad Zarif was Iran\u2019s lead negotiator of the 2015 nuclear deal, and if his resignation is accepted, it will be another large nail in the agreement\u2019s mostly sealed coffin. Iran\u2019s presidential chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi denied the resignation had been accepted. But for the president, Hassan Rouhani, the departure of such a close ally at a time of prolonged intense political pressure will be a serious blow. It will be the reaction of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, which will determine Zarif\u2019s fate. He has threatened to resign before as the nuclear deal came under sustained criticism by hardliners, but never so publicly. Zarif is quoted in the Iranian media as saying that the immediate cause of his abrupt offer to resign, announced in the middle of the night on Instagram, was the fact that he was not invited to meet Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator visited Tehran on Monday. By some accounts he was not even informed in advance about the visit. The news website Entekhab quoted him as referring to himself in the third person and saying \u201cafter the pictures of the meetings today, Javad Zarif has no credibility in the world as a foreign minister.\u201d Policy in Syria is largely run by the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and its leader Qassem Suleimani, but Zarif has participated in meetings with Assad before, and his exclusion from invitation list seems to be a clear snub. It also appears to signal a downgrading of the importance of the foreign ministry and its advocacy of openness to the world and keeping faith with the nuclear deal. Since Donald Trump took the US out of the multilateral agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), by which Iran accepted severe constraints on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, there has been a rising chorus of calls in Iran for it to cease abiding by the deal\u2019s restrictions. The European states who were party to the agreement \u2013 the UK, France, Germany and Russia \u2013 along with China have urged Tehran to stick with the agreement, and have tried to devise ways of bypassing US sanctions. However, the threat of secondary US sanctions on any companies trading with Iran has been enough to scare most foreign investors and traders out, robbing Iran of any substantial benefits from the deal. Jamal Abdi, the head of the National Iranian-American Council, a pro-diplomacy advocacy group, said \u201cZarif\u2019s resignation is a boon for the radical hardline forces in Tehran who oppose the JCPOA and further engagement with the West.

A video of Pell\u2019s hubristic stance as he was questioned on camera by two Australian detectives in Rome was played to the jurors. At the time of the interview, Pell was the third most powerful man in the Vatican, responsible for managing the finances of the Catholic church, and a confidant to Pope Francis. The detectives, from the police taskforce investigating historical child sexual abuse, recorded the interview, conducted in the conference room of a hotel on 19 October 2016. Pell did not take to the witness stand in his subsequent trial but the video was screened. It showed that before the detectives had elaborated on the allegations against him, Pell read a prepared statement. \u201cI have to rely on the law and my conscience, which says that I am innocent, and I have to rely on the integrity of investigators not setting out to make a case but actually searching for the truth,\u201d he told them. He said he would give police a list of names of people to interview, who he said would speak \u201cauthoritatively\u201d about his conduct in 1996 and 1997, when the offences occurred. At the time he was the archbishop of Melbourne. \u201cI would earnestly hope that this is done before any decision is made whether to lay charges, because immeasurable damage will be done to me and the church by the mere laying of charges which on proper examination will be later found to be untrue,\u201d Pell said. Less than nine months later, on 28 June 2017, detectives did charge him. On 11 December 2018 a jury before Melbourne\u2019s county court convicted him on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16. Once Pell had read his statement, prepared with the assistance of his solicitors, Det Chris Reed attempted to begin his questioning.

Madness.\u201d He then invited Reed to \u201cgo on \u2026 what happened after the mass?\u201d Reed replied: \u201cIt\u2019s alleged you stepped forward and grabbed [a boy] by his head and forced his head on to your penis.\u201d Again Pell interrupted: \u201cCompletely false.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to comment at this stage,\u201d Reed replied. \u201cI can continue on.\u201d Pell: \u201cPlease do.\u201d Reed told him it was alleged that some time in the second half of 1996 while Pell was archbishop of Melbourne, he had come across two choirboys in the priest\u2019s sacristy of St Patrick\u2019s cathedral after Sunday solemn mass. It had been alleged Pell orally raped one of the boys, forcing his penis into his mouth, and that he had also performed indecent acts on them. Pell, sucking on sweets throughout the interview, repeatedly interrupted Reed to confirm: \u201cThis is after mass?\u201d and \u201cThis is in the sacristy at the cathedral after Sunday mass?\u201d When Reed confirmed that was the allegation, Pell replied: \u201cThat\u2019s good for me, because it makes it even more fantastic and impossible. \u201cThe most rudimentary interview of staff and those who were choirboys at the cathedral in that year and later would confirm the allegations are fundamentally improbable and most certainly false.\u201d At times, Pell scoffed as Reed outlined the allegations. \u201cWhat a load of garbage and falsehood, and deranged falsehood,\u201d he said. At the end of the roughly 45-minute interview, Pell was asked if he had anything more to say in answer to possible charges that might be laid. \u201cThat I\u2019m certainly not guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe on many, many details I\u2019ve been able to prove that the charges are false and I believe with more work and information we\u2019ll be able to further enhance the strength of those denials.\u201d",

Pell is essentially the treasurer of the Vatican and the Holy See in Rome, a high-ranking position that makes him among the world\u2019s most powerful Catholics. He has also been a longtime confidant to Pope Francis. Before his appointment to the Vatican in 2014, Pell held senior positions within the Catholic church in Australia, including as the archbishop of Sydney and the archbishop of Melbourne. He is known for his staunch conservativism on issues including marriage equality and abortion. He is Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic. He was made a companion in the Order of Australia in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours in 2005 for his service to the church. Pell is now also the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to have been convicted of child sexual abuse. How has he responded to child sexual abuse in the church? Pell has attracted criticism since the 1990s for the way he responded to allegations of child sexual abuse while he was working in Australian Catholic institutions. As archbishop of Melbourne he formulated the much-criticised Melbourne Response, which offered support and counselling to victims of sexual abuse but capped compensation payments. In 2014 he said the church was no more responsible for child abuse carried out by church figures than a trucking company would be if they employed a driver who molested women. At Australia\u2019s child sex abuse royal commission, he described offending by his one-time friend, the priest Gerald Ridsdale, as a \u201csad story\u201d that \u201cwasn\u2019t of much interest to me\u201d. Ridsdale has been found guilty of offending against more than 60 children. What happened in his own case? In June 2017 Pell was charged with child sexual assault offences by Australian police. Pell took leave from the Vatican and stood aside from his position there to return to Australia and face a committal hearing, which began in March 2018. In a committal hearing, a magistrate decides if there is enough evidence to go to trial. The magistrate threw out the most serious charges owing to credibility issues of witnesses. Other charges were withdrawn by prosecutors. Pell was left facing several charges, which were split into two trials. The first group related to offending in 1996 at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne when he was archbishop. The second group related to alleged offending in a swimming pool while he was a priest in the regional Victorian town of Ballarat in the 1970s. The cathedral trial was held in August and resulted in a hung jury. A mistrial was declared and the trial was held a second time, beginning in November. On 11 December the jury returned a verdict of guilty on five charges; one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and four counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of 16. The convictions relate to Pell\u2019s offending against two 13-year-old choirboys. Why are the details only coming out now? A suppression order was in place so that jurors in the trial of the second group of alleged offences would not be prejudiced by reporting of the first trial. Such suppression orders are standard when an accused person is facing multiple trials. But the swimming pool charges were dropped by prosecutors on Tuesday after evidence they were relying on to build their case was deemed inadmissible by the judge, Peter Kidd. With Pell no longer facing a further trial, the suppression order was lifted and the cathedral trial and mistrial can now be reported in full. What happens next? Pell\u2019s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, has indicated that his client will appeal. Usually, a single judge considers the appeal application and decides whether the accused has legal grounds for appealing. If there are grounds for appeal, the matter proceeds to a hearing. If the judge refuses the application, a convicted person can elect to have the refusal reconsidered by other judges of the court of appeal. If the matter goes to a hearing and the conviction is set aside, the court may order a new trial, or acquit the person. The process can take eight to 10 months, sometimes longer. In the meantime, Pell is due to be sentenced next week, but may be taken into custody at a plea hearing on Wednesday. He was granted bail in December to undergo knee surgery, which he has since had. Now that the trial is over, the royal commission may release its findings relating to Pell. When the five-year inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse delivered its final report in 2017, the section relating to Pell was redacted so as not to prejudice court proceedings. How has the pope responded? The Vatican will have been made aware of the verdict when it was delivered in December. A Vatican spokesman has consistently said the pope does not intend to speak until the judicial process is complete, including a possible appeal. Two days after the verdict, Pope Francis removed Pell from his inner circle in a restructure of his Council of Cardinals. Pell was not removed from his position as financial controller of the Vatican, a position he technically still holds. On Pell\u2019s removal from the council, Francis thanked him for his work reforming the Vatican bureaucracy. There will be pressure on the Vatican to respond to Pell\u2019s verdict quickly, given growing global anger about the way the church has responded to and concealed child sexual abuse. Last week\u2019s landmark child sexual abuse summit at the Vatican drew criticism after Francis failed to promise a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to paedophiles and those who cover up their crimes.",

Asthma UK is urging ministers to add the disease to the list of conditions for which sufferers in England do not have to pay for their medication. \u201cIt is unfair that people with asthma have to pay for their prescriptions to stay alive, especially as people with other long-term conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy, and those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland get free prescriptions,\u201d it says. Almost everyone earning less than \u00a320,000 a year struggles to afford their asthma drugs, it said. People with diabetes, epilepsy, cancer and hyperthyroidism already get their medications free on the NHS. The last Labour government pledged to include asthma drugs on that list but did not. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring people with long-term conditions get access to the treatment they need, including affordable prescriptions. \u201cThere are a number of prescription charge exemptions in place to protect at-risk groups and around 90% of prescription items dispensed in local pharmacies are free on the NHS in England.\u201d It added that it had frozen the cost of the prescription pre-payment certificates for another year.",

More than 1,000 children\u2019s centres and 600 youth clubs have closed. Spending on disabled children fell 11%. \u2022 There was a 12% increase in spending on late intervention, fuelled by a 17% increase in the number of children in care since 2010. Child protection and youth justice spending also soared, a trend that was \u201cunlikely to change in the near future\u201d, the charities said. The minister for children and families, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cWe want every child to have the best start in life, with the opportunities and the stability to fulfil their potential, which is why we have made \u00a3200bn available to councils up to 2020 for local services, including those for children and young people.\u201d Emma Lewell-Buck, Labour\u2019s minister for children and families, said: \u201cThis report should be a wake-up call to the government. With cuts set to continue while demand rises, more children will lose out on these vital services, and the devastating impact of austerity will be felt in the most vulnerable communities for years to come.\u201d Stuart Gallimore, the president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s services, said demand for services had risen in tandem with child poverty, and poorer families struggled to afford necessities such as food and clothes: \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but this doesn\u2019t sound like a country that works for all children.\u201d Barnardo\u2019s chief executive, Javed Khan, said: \u201cIn every community children face growing challenges \u2026 and in many areas the services they once relied on just aren\u2019t there any more. As a result, far too often families are reaching crisis point \u2013 with rising numbers of children being taken into local authority care.\u201d The research comes amid concern long waits for youth mental health services, school budget cuts and growing demand for services for youngsters with special educational needs and disabilities. Councils have said financial pressures caused by rising demand for children\u2019s services threaten to tip town halls into bankruptcy.",
