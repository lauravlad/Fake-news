      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has said he regrets his delay in calling the banking royal commission, admitting he now believes \u201cwe should have got on with it earlier\u201d. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has so far avoided replying when asked whether the government was sorry it had not called the commission sooner, after voting against its establishment 26 times \u2013 instead pointing to what he said were Labor\u2019s \u201cfailures\u201d while in government five years ago. But his former leader openly admitted he had got it wrong, telling reporters at a doorstop interview in Melbourne he regretted not establishing the commission earlier, while distancing himself from individual responsibility. \u201cI do,\u201d he said, when asked if he regretted his opposition. \u201cI think we should have got on with it earlier. It was \u2013 look, the reason I didn\u2019t support a royal commission and the government didn\u2019t, and that was a collective view of the government, not just mine, was because I could see what the problem was, a failure of responsibility and trust, and I wanted to get on and deal with it immediately. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have the delay of the royal commission. In a sense, we\u2019ve ended up with both approaches being used. We did get on with a lot of very important reforms and I want to congratulate Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, in particular, for leading the charge on those. \u201cSome very important changes were made, in terms of regulation, in terms of banking executives\u2019 responsibility, so a lot of big reforms were made to address the problems. \u201cThere has been the royal commission as well. My concern was to do the right thing by the customers as quickly as possible and the government did that but, clearly, there was very strong public expectation to have a royal commission and so, at the end of 2017, I established the royal commission.\u201d Speaking after Turnbull\u2019s press conference, Scott Morrison said he had expressed regret last year, and was now focusing on the future. \u201cI expressed last year my own regret as treasurer when it came to being very focused on the issues of financial systems\u2019 stability, but I expressed my own regret at some of the human factors that needed greater consideration in terms of calling the royal commission,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let me be frank, I called for the royal commission. We introduced the Australian financial complaints authority, we introduced the additional resources and support for Asic. \u201cWe acted on the financial systems inquiry that we implemented when we came to government in 2013. As a government, we have been taking action on this issue from the day we were elected.\u201d The former prime minister was less forthcoming when it came to Morrison\u2019s chances of winning the next election, saying he was \u201cin with a chance\u201d. Turnbull was much more effusive in his praise of the newly independent Julia Banks, who has announced she will challenge Greg Hunt in the Victorian seat of Flinders. \u201cEvery election can be won and all Australian elections are close. I wish him all the best,\u201d Turnbull said of Morrison. \u201cJulia Banks is an outstanding parliamentarian. She is a great \u2013 she came to parliament with a life of experience as a lawyer in the business world. She is really an outstanding representative. \u201cShe\u2019s explained why she left the Liberal party and she\u2019s done so in her own words and I respect the decision she\u2019s taken. I believe that the people of Flinders will have a very stimulating contest between her and Greg Hunt and no doubt the other candidates.\u201d Turnbull has previously admitted he could have saved himself \u201cpolitical grief\u201d by calling the royal commission earlier. On Tuesday he said he had been \u201cshocked\u201d by some of the cases that emerged during its hearings. \u201cI did not believe the cultural failures had been as bad as that,\u201d he told Sky News. Labor was the first of the major parties to reverse its opposition to a royal commission into the banking industry, calling for one in April 2016, a move which was soundly rejected by the government, including by Turnbull and Morrison. An internal party revolt, led by the Nationals senator John Williams, forced the government to announce a royal commission in November 2017, which Morrison said was a \u201cregrettable but necessary\u201d move. The government has said it will \u201cact\u201d on all 76 recommendations put forward by the commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, although it has hesitated on following all the way through with the \u201cuser-pays\u201d recommendation for mortgage brokers. Frydenberg said that was because of concerns that mortgage brokers could be put out of business, handing more power to the big banks. But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, accused the government of using \u201cweasel words\u201d. \u201cThey attempted to avoid the royal commission, didn\u2019t even believe in it. Even when they announced it, said it was regrettable. Voted against it 26 times. Their heart is not in it.\u201d The National Australia Bank bosses Andrew Thorburn and Ken Henry, who came in for particular criticism from Hayne in his final report, have joined other bank leaders in promising change. \u201cThe final report references matters concerning the NAB Group which have been referred to the relevant regulator,\u201d Thorburn said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday. \u201cWe will engage constructively on these matters. \u201cIn addition, the commissioner has expressed his view that we at NAB may not be learning the lessons we need to from the past and, in particular, that we don\u2019t know what the right thing to do is. \u201cAs the CEO, this is very hard to read, and does not reflect who I am or how I am leading, nor the change that is occurring inside our bank. While we have made mistakes, I believe there is a lot of evidence that we are making sustainable and serious change to once again regain the trust of all our customers.\u201d Thorburn said he had cancelled planned long-service leave to deal with the fallout. Hayne recommended the regulators review at least 24 cases for criminal and civil misconduct.",

But we should remind ourselves Klopp\u2019s side are still three clear at the top. There will be plenty more twists yet.

We scored the goal which I heard after the game was offside, which explains a little bit the second half, because I think the referee knew at half-time, I thought they only knew at full time but he knew it for sure at half-time. But there were a lot of strange situations, not decisive but rhythm-breakers, which doesn\u2019t help. They scored the goal so it\u2019s a deserved draw. I spoke to the ref about the situations but really calmly. He did not respond nicely. I asked is that the way we talk now? And he said we don\u2019t talk at all. And then I left, so nothing serious. The second half there were so many free kicks for the other team in a counter-press situation when Naby wins the ball back and they go down. That\u2019s not a foul. But as a human being if I knew I made a big mistake in the first half, I don\u2019t want to open the gap a bit more, so I understand that. But during the game I did not understand it because I didn\u2019t know our goal was offside. It\u2019s a point, so let\u2019s carry on. We have to perform. It is too early to talk about a title race. I didn\u2019t see a good game, and a couple of players did not perform at the highest level, but that\u2019s normal, it has happened before and will happen again.\u201d He seemed a lot happier towards the end of the interview; maybe having got that off his chest, he\u2019s talked himself out of a hot funk.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c58b7d8e4b0c3e1fbdbe332\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T22:19:04.698Z\">10.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Now it\u2019s the turn of West Ham captain Mark Noble.</strong> \u201cJanuary was a bad month, so to come here after three defeats was massive for us. We should have scored more goals. Liverpool are a fantastic team but we defended well tonight and we deserved to win. You have to defend really well, and keep your shape. As well as that, we scared them with two or three counters. I\u2019m just gutted we didn\u2019t come away with the three points. We\u2019re gutted in there because their goal was a mile offside. All in all, they\u2019re probably the best team in the league at the minute and we played really well today.\u201d</p> <p><strong>He\u2019s then asked whether Liverpool\u2019s nerves are betraying them. </strong>And his response is pretty interesting. \u201cWell I watched the game at Anfield in the week [against Leicester] and you can tell that with the history Liverpool have got, there was anxiety around the stadium, and that feeds into the players. You could feel it sitting at home on my sofa. It\u2019s just that Liverpool want to win the league so much. They\u2019ve got a great chance of doing it, but obviously their fans have to stick by and keep supporting them, especially when you\u2019re leading and everyone\u2019s chasing. And Man City are not going to rest for one game. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll be fine, they\u2019ve got a fantastic squad of players and a world-class manager and do you know what? For the Liverpool people, I think it\u2019d be fantastic if they did win it. Manchester City have won a few!\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c58b640e4b0d86c56438fe2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T22:06:51.187Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A melancholic Virgil van Dijk speaks.</strong> \u201cA draw is tough but they defended very well, and we were unlucky we didn\u2019t win. Our defending could have been a lot better, but it is what it is. We have to take our one point from tonight and keep going. Set pieces are their strength, they practice them a lot and it showed. For us, it would have been better to not give easy fouls away. Though I think the referee was a bit easy at times, but it\u2019s his decision and we need to do better as well. All the players who come in have the quality to fill in, but when you have a back four that doesn\u2019t change, maybe it\u2019s a little easier. What can we do? We take it game by game. We\u2019re still top of the league, though we\u2019ve made it hard for ourselves. But we\u2019re still in the title race, and some teams are not. You need to enjoy the pressure, you can also be playing for nothing. We need to be our best for the rest of the season.

Neither man seems particularly interested in engaging. Not sure what his problem is, to be honest. It might be about the amount of added time? In which case, Liverpool still had 94 minutes across the piece to score more than one goal. His team were very poor tonight. West Ham, by comparison, were excellent. Their point consolidates their position in 12th, where they sit behind Leicester on goal difference, 32 points. Liverpool extend their lead over Manchester City to three points, on 62 points, but they\u2019ll be knocked off top spot in a couple of days should Pep Guardiola\u2019s side win at Everton. City will have played a game more, of course, but then Liverpool\u2019s corresponding extra fixture is at Manchester United, and the form book suggests only one winner there.

Mark Noble leads out the hosts, James Milner the visitors. A rare old noise at the London Stadium. It\u2019s not quite at Upton Park levels, but it is what it is. As the teams shake hands, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah both look extremely relaxed; the same can\u2019t be said for some of their supporters. For example, here\u2019s Matt Dony: \u201cGoes without saying, but it\u2019s a big game tonight. I actually don\u2019t think nerves were a big issue last week; more a case of a makeshift defence and a collective off-day. These things happen to every team now and then. But, there\u2019s been so much talk about \u2018nervousness\u2019 since then, it\u2019s bound to have some kind of effect. There\u2019s an enormous amount of pressure on the players, they\u2019re in an unfamiliar position, and it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Keep telling them that they\u2019re nervous, and nerves will creep in. A big performance and a comfortable win tonight, and just maybe I can let myself start to dream. Any less than that, and I fear City will have the impetus. Argh!

If you want to be first at the end of the season you need to be ready for a tough fight, you cannot hope that you will be champion in March, that\u2019s happened only two or three times in history, and at really big clubs in a much worse league than the Premier League.

And if he does a number on them as West Ham United boss tonight, he\u2019ll throw a spanner in the works of their latest championship challenge. \u201cIf we win, I will be very happy for our club first,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, if we can give a hand to Manchester City, it\u2019s not our problem, but of course I am a fan of Manchester City also.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Looking at it one way, Pellegrini is talking more in hope than expectation. </strong>Liverpool have put four goals past West Ham in each of their last four meetings. They\u2019re top of the table, two points clear of champions Manchester City with a game in hand, while the Hammers are marooned in mid-table having lost their last three matches. That\u2019ll explain why the home side are priced 8-1 for the win at your local turf accountant.</p> <p><strong>Then again, West Ham were extremely impressive in their last match at the London Stadium, a victory over Arsenal more comprehensive than the 1-0 scoreline suggests. </strong>Their most potent goal threat, Marko Arnautovic, is expected to have recovered from injury in time for this match. Also, Declan Rice. Overall, the Hammers are steadily improving under Pellegrini, and are certainly more of a threat than the team brushed aside at Anfield on the opening day.</p> <p><strong>And Liverpool will be nervous. </strong>It\u2019s only February, but with City breathing down their necks, any dropped points will feel like ... well, a Hammer blow. Which sets this up deliciously. Both teams are desirous of a statement victory, West Ham to regain that upward momentum, Liverpool to re-establish that five-point cushion at the top. Here goes another crucial match in the title race, then. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "No word from Manuel Pellegrini, so that\u2019s your lot! It\u2019s been a poor evening for Liverpool, a good evening for West Ham United, and an even better one for Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. But we should remind ourselves Klopp\u2019s side are still three clear at the top. There will be plenty more twists yet. Jacob Steinberg was on hand at the London Stadium to witness the latest turn, and here\u2019s his verdict. Thanks for reading, and nighty night! And now an agitated Jurgen Klopp, who isn\u2019t happy with the referee at all. \u201cIt was not our best. We scored the goal which I heard after the game was offside, which explains a little bit the second half, because I think the referee knew at half-time, I thought they only knew at full time but he knew it for sure at half-time. But there were a lot of strange situations, not decisive but rhythm-breakers, which doesn\u2019t help. They scored the goal so it\u2019s a deserved draw. I spoke to the ref about the situations but really calmly. He did not respond nicely. I asked is that the way we talk now? And he said we don\u2019t talk at all. And then I left, so nothing serious. The second half there were so many free kicks for the other team in a counter-press situation when Naby wins the ball back and they go down. That\u2019s not a foul. But as a human being if I knew I made a big mistake in the first half, I don\u2019t want to open the gap a bit more, so I understand that. But during the game I did not understand it because I didn\u2019t know our goal was offside. It\u2019s a point, so let\u2019s carry on. We have to perform. It is too early to talk about a title race. I didn\u2019t see a good game, and a couple of players did not perform at the highest level, but that\u2019s normal, it has happened before and will happen again.\u201d He seemed a lot happier towards the end of the interview; maybe having got that off his chest, he\u2019s talked himself out of a hot funk. Now it\u2019s the turn of West Ham captain Mark Noble. \u201cJanuary was a bad month, so to come here after three defeats was massive for us. We should have scored more goals. Liverpool are a fantastic team but we defended well tonight and we deserved to win. You have to defend really well, and keep your shape. As well as that, we scared them with two or three counters. I\u2019m just gutted we didn\u2019t come away with the three points. We\u2019re gutted in there because their goal was a mile offside. All in all, they\u2019re probably the best team in the league at the minute and we played really well today.\u201d He\u2019s then asked whether Liverpool\u2019s nerves are betraying them. And his response is pretty interesting. \u201cWell I watched the game at Anfield in the week [against Leicester] and you can tell that with the history Liverpool have got, there was anxiety around the stadium, and that feeds into the players. You could feel it sitting at home on my sofa. It\u2019s just that Liverpool want to win the league so much. They\u2019ve got a great chance of doing it, but obviously their fans have to stick by and keep supporting them, especially when you\u2019re leading and everyone\u2019s chasing. And Man City are not going to rest for one game. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll be fine, they\u2019ve got a fantastic squad of players and a world-class manager and do you know what? For the Liverpool people, I think it\u2019d be fantastic if they did win it. Manchester City have won a few!\u201d A melancholic Virgil van Dijk speaks. \u201cA draw is tough but they defended very well, and we were unlucky we didn\u2019t win. Our defending could have been a lot better, but it is what it is. We have to take our one point from tonight and keep going. Set pieces are their strength, they practice them a lot and it showed. For us, it would have been better to not give easy fouls away. Though I think the referee was a bit easy at times, but it\u2019s his decision and we need to do better as well. All the players who come in have the quality to fill in, but when you have a back four that doesn\u2019t change, maybe it\u2019s a little easier. What can we do? We take it game by game. We\u2019re still top of the league, though we\u2019ve made it hard for ourselves. But we\u2019re still in the title race, and some teams are not. You need to enjoy the pressure, you can also be playing for nothing. We need to be our best for the rest of the season. We\u2019re disappointed, but we go again.\u201d Jurgen Klopp doesn\u2019t look happy at all. He holds a full-and-frank discussion with Manuel Pellegrini as the pair shake hands, then rants awhile at the referee. Neither man seems particularly interested in engaging. Not sure what his problem is, to be honest. It might be about the amount of added time? In which case, Liverpool still had 94 minutes across the piece to score more than one goal. His team were very poor tonight. West Ham, by comparison, were excellent. Their point consolidates their position in 12th, where they sit behind Leicester on goal difference, 32 points. Liverpool extend their lead over Manchester City to three points, on 62 points, but they\u2019ll be knocked off top spot in a couple of days should Pep Guardiola\u2019s side win at Everton. City will have played a game more, of course, but then Liverpool\u2019s corresponding extra fixture is at Manchester United, and the form book suggests only one winner there. It\u2019s not been a good week for Liverpool at all. Keita flicks the ball over the West Ham back line to release Origi! But the striker can\u2019t sort his feet out, and shoots straight at Fabianski! And that\u2019s it! Liverpool drop two points in the title race, West Ham more than deserving of the draw! 90 min +2: Milner crosses from right. Doip slices hysterically into the air. But Ogbonna clears. Up the other end, Allison races from the box only to head straight to Carroll! Fortunately for the keeper, Robertson is on hand to sweep up. 90 min +1: Nothing happens in the first added minute. It\u2019s all played in Liverpool\u2019s half, as well. West Ham have been excellent tonight. 90 min: Felipe Anderson makes way for Arthur Masuaku, as the stadium announcer gives him the man-of-the-match award. There will be three minutes of added time. 89 min: Fellow would-be title-winners Spurs have found late goals in each of their last three matches. Can Liverpool get one here? It doesn\u2019t look like it right now. Milner finds a bit of space down the right and pulls one back for Keita, who shapes to shoot but hesitates. He\u2019s eventually dispossessed by Snodgrass, who wins a free kick into the bargain. 87 min: Robertson and Mane pair up to zip down the left. Robertson\u2019s eventual low cross forces Cresswell to hack out for a corner. The set piece falls to the feet of Salah, but Antonio is up in his grille in short order, and the danger is cleared. Salah looks pained. 85 min: Keita has the ball in the middle of West Ham territory. But there\u2019s no movement ahead of him, no pass to be made. He waves his arms about in Kloppian style, equally frustrated with how this match is panning out. 83 min: Salah and Shaqiri try to combine down the inside-right channel, but the passes aren\u2019t sticking. On the touchline, Klopp is incandescent, throwing his arms around in a very animated manner. It\u2019s only a month ago that Liverpool were playing a match at Manchester City in the hope of going ten points clear. Now, unless they score in the next seven minutes, City can leapfrog them by winning at Everton in a couple of days. 81 min: Origi motors his way down the left and is illegally tugged back. A free kick, and a chance for Liverpool to load the West Ham box. Shaqiri takes. It\u2019s half cleared. Salah takes a shot from the edge of the D. It hits van Dijk, who isn\u2019t offside and can bustle down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s clear in the box but doesn\u2019t fancy a shot from a tight angle. Instead, his weak cross is easily snaffled by Fabianski. 79 min: A double change by West Ham. Mark Noble and Javier Hernandez are replaced by Pedro Obiang and Liverpool\u2019s former \u00a335m man Andy Carroll. This script almost writes itself. Let\u2019s see where this goes, then. 77 min: Felipe Anderson is sent racing down the left by Noble\u2019s fine crossfield ball. He one-twos with Snodgrass on the edge of the Liverpool box. It looks for a nanosecond like he\u2019s through, but Matip reads it well, sticks out a telescopic leg, intercepts and clears. 76 min: Liverpool have scored 14 times this season in the final 15 minutes. Only Arsenal and Chelsea can match that record. What the visitors would do to grab a precious 15th tonight. They\u2019re seeing plenty of the ball; they\u2019re just not doing a great deal with it, and West Ham look extremely comfortable. 75 min: Liverpool make their second change of the evening, hooking Firmino, strangely ineffectual tonight, and sending on Divock Origi. 74 min: Keita\u2019s cute dribble down the inside-left channel nearly opens up West Ham. But his flick to Salah comes off his team-mate\u2019s arm, and the pressure is off. 73 min: Snodgrass dribbles his way past Matip down the left. He cuts back for Felipe Anderson, who half handles the ball into the path of Noble. The West Ham captain sends a first-time shot inches over the bar. That was so close. West Ham have had their chances. 71 min: There\u2019s not a great deal going on right now. West Ham will be happy enough with that: a point will put a stop to their current losing run. Liverpool, not so much. This is a big 20 minutes in the Premier League season. Far from decisive, of course; it\u2019s only February after all. But big enough. 69 min: Liverpool are finally able to make their substitution. Lallana is sacrificed for Shaqiri. 67 min: Liverpool have very little going on right now. Accordingly, they\u2019re preparing to bring on Xherdan Shaqiri. 65 min: Matip beckenbauers his way upfield, but there\u2019s one feint too many. He has the ball nicked off him by Rice, who launches a counter into the space left by the Liverpool defender. The ball is sent wide right for Antonio, who instigates a game of pinball in the Liverpool area. Hernandez doesn\u2019t get the break, and Liverpool can hack clear. 64 min: Liverpool\u2019s desperation is beginning to bubble to the surface. Robertson tries his luck, 30 yards out down the left. Nope! 62 min: Salah suddenly looks lively. Another shot, this time wild and over the bar. But he was a complete non-event in the first half, and this represents a big improvement. Liverpool certainly need something more from him. On the touchline, Klopp claps in encouragement. 61 min: Salah jigs in from the right and shapes a shot around Cresswell, towards the far corner. But there\u2019s no real whip on the shot, and it\u2019s easy pickings for Fabianski. Salah looks pained; the away fans sing his name by way of support. 60 min: Hernandez is booked for coming through the back of Fabinho in the centre circle. A pointless challenge. 59 min: Liverpool are looking very rusty. They\u2019ve got a three-on-two, but Mane and Firmino confuse each other with misplaced passes, and West Ham can tear clear. 58 min: Salah is sent free by Fabinho\u2019s long ball down the inside left, but Fredericks has him covered and it turns out Salah is offside anyway. West Ham go up the other end through the ever-impressive Felipe Anderson, who nearly sets Cresswell off on the overlap, but overhits the pass slightly. Goal kick. This match continues to entertain, even if the quality isn\u2019t from the top drawer. 56 min: Space for Milner down the right. His whipped cross is a dangerous one, but avoids everyone. Robertson tries again from the other flank, having retrieved the ball, but his cross takes a deflection and loops into the arms of Fabianski. 55 min: Cresswell slams the free kick straight into the Liverpool wall and then sprays the rebound miles over the bar. 54 min: And now Matip goes in the book as he drags Felipe Anderson to ground as the West Ham winger spins him. Lallana is still moaning about the non-decision earlier. Anyway, this is a free kick in a central position, 30 yards out. 53 min: Lallana throws his arms in the air after failing to get a free-kick decision from a common-or-garden tussle in the midfield. Liverpool could do with calming down. 51 min: Robertson slips a ball down the left for Mane, who lays off to Lallana on the edge of the box. Lallana tees up Salah, rushing in, but the resulting shot, while powerful, is straight at Fabianski. 49 min: Lallana scampers down the right and attempts a flick into the box. The ball hits Ogbonna, just inside the area, on his arm. Lallana claims for a penalty, but that was totally accidental, Liverpool were never getting that. The first signs of frustration from Liverpool, who shouldn\u2019t be getting desperate yet. 48 min: But Liverpool don\u2019t clear their lines properly, Allison slicing an upfield hoof straight out of play on the left. Antonio wins a corner from the throw. And from the corner, Diop has a clear header eight yards out, but guides it wide left. Liverpool can\u2019t keep giving up chances like this. 47 min: Felipe Anderson embarks on a skitter down the left and is blocked off by Milner. Yet another chance for West Ham to bother Liverpool with a cheeky free kick. But they make a balls of this one, Anderson dribbling in from the left and shooting witlessly into a thicket. And we\u2019re off again! Liverpool are out early, waiting for West Ham. In the dugout, a pensive Jurgen Klopp sits biting his lip. He may be considering how Manchester City will be able to go top on Wednesday night if things stay the same here and they win at Everton. His charges get the second half underway when the hosts eventually turn up. Half-time entertainment: And that\u2019s that for the first half. Title-chasing Liverpool will be pleased to hear the whistle, as they were beginning to seriously rock at the back. West Ham look much the happier as the players trudge off. Jurgen Klopp races down the tunnel, preparing to tell his defenders a few home truths, I\u2019ll be bound. Don\u2019t go anywhere, this promises to be a rip-roaring second half! 45 min: There will be one added minute. This half of football has flown by. 44 min: Mane nearly adds insult to injury, as he meets Milner\u2019s inswinging free kick with a flashed header by the near post. Fortunately for West Ham, it\u2019s straight at Fabianski. 43 min: Fredericks thinks Mane has pushed him as the pair contest a ball down the Liverpool left. He\u2019s not getting the free kick, though he should. So then he loses his composure and barges into the back of Mane. This time the free kick\u2019s given, just to the left of the West Ham area. 41 min: Fabinho gives away another free kick, needlessly tripping a surrounded Hernandez out on the West Ham right. What will they come up with this time? Felipe Anderson sends a diagonal curler over the top of the pack lined up on the edge of the box. It drops to Rice, totally free, 12 yards out! But Rice sends his header screaming over the bar when it was surely easier to score! He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s missed it ... though he might (stress might, it was very close) have been offside. Either way, though, the flag stayed down, and Liverpool\u2019s defence is a complete shambles. 39 min: Keita continues to attack with elan, gliding down the left and releasing Robertson on the overlap. Robertson crosses low and hard, through the six-yard box, but Ogbonna toe-pokes it away from Firmino and out for a corner. A corner that\u2019s not awarded. Liverpool are collectively livid, and the crowd enjoyed that very much, cheering the decision almost as loudly as the equaliser. 37 min: Snodgrass makes to bulldoze down the middle of the park, but he\u2019s sent flying as Mane runs into his back. It should be a booking, but it\u2019s only a free kick. And once again Liverpool are half asleep. Felipe Anderson wedges the set piece down the left, where Hernandez has peeled away into space. Fortunately for Liverpool, he shins one high into the air, miles off target. Liverpool do not look comfortable at the back at all. 36 min: Lallana drags down Noble, out on the West Ham left. Another chance to load the box. Snodgrass\u2019s free kick is half cleared by Matip, but only to Noble on the edge of the area. Noble takes a touch and shoots low and hard, but van Dijk is on hand to block and blooters clear. 34 min: This is high-octane fare. Accurate passes are at a premium right now. 32 min: Keita hasn\u2019t let his role in the equaliser affect him too much. Again he dribbles with purpose at West Ham, down the inside-left channel, and is nearly sent clear into the area after one-twoing with Firmino. But Firmino\u2019s backheel is too firm, and Fabianski gathers without fuss. 30 min: Keita\u2019s see-saw match continues, as he drives towards the West Ham box, a fine run that earns a corner. That one comes to nothing. Good luck predicting how this one\u2019s going to end up. Surely not 1-1. It\u2019s such an open, entertaining game. Fabinho clumsily bundles Snodgrass to the ground, gifting West Ham a free kick 35 yards out, Everyone\u2019s bunched to the left of the D. Felipe Anderson gives it the eyebrows, making to cross, then slips a cheeky one down the right. Antonio is in the box free, having torn away from a dozing Keita. Antonio threads a glorious shot across Allison and into the bottom left! What a brilliant training ground free kick ... but terrible sleepy defending by the title hopefuls. 26 min: Salah romps down the right and slips the ball inside for Mane, who rolls it on to Keita. Liverpool\u2019s summer signing has been short on confidence, but here it seems to flood back with immediate effect, flicking an outrageous first-time backheel down the left to release Robertson. But Robertson\u2019s low cross is blocked out for a corner, which leads to nothing. 24 min: Liverpool haven\u2019t lost after scoring first since April 2017, bogey team Crystal Palace doing for them that time. West Ham have troubled Liverpool already, though; can they put an end to that record? The in-form Mane gives Liverpool the lead against the run of play! It\u2019s wonderful work by Lallana, tiptoeing on the right-hand touchline and dinking the ball past Cresswell and Snodgrass, who had surely boxed him in. But no! Milner\u2019s set free. Milner pulls the ball back for Mane, who takes a touch, turns and pearls a shot into the bottom left! That was a delightful move. There\u2019s only one problem, though ... Milner was a good yard offside when Lallana found him with his twinkle toes. Liverpool get a huge break there. 21 min: Felipe Anderson nearly gets past Milner down the left, but earns a corner off the stand-in right-back. Cresswell takes the set piece, but it\u2019s extremely poor and Salah is able to sweep the ball away from the danger zone without any trouble. 20 min: A one-two between Firmino and Mane down the centre, and Firmino enters the box just to the left of centre. He looks for the bottom right, but scuffs his effort and the ball bounces harmlessly into the arms of Fabianski. 18 min: Something of a lull, which Liverpool will welcome, having been unable to get a secure foothold in this match so far. It quietens the crowd. Well, a bit. \u201cGood to see Liverpool wearing grey tonight rather than that \u2018highlighter pen orange\u2019 from last year,\u201d writes Ian Sargeant. \u201cIf my memory serves they wore grey when Paul Ince did his thing in the League Cup 30 years ago. Yes that is a straw clutch.\u201d 16 min: Space for Cresswell down the left. He hooks low into the area, looking for Snodgrass. But the ball clanks off Lallana and back into Allison\u2019s arms. A lucky break. But West Ham are soon coming at Liverpool again, Hernandez pearling a shot from the right of the D towards the top left. Allison does extremely well to bat it away at full stretch, and the danger is over. Liverpool are looking very nervous; West Ham can sense their shakiness. 14 min: Felipe Anderson slips a pass down the left. It would have released Snodgrass, but the Scotland international slips on the turf, allowing Milner to swan off with the ball. The crowd appreciated that; West Ham have started very well in attack and Liverpool already don\u2019t look totally secure at the back. 12 min: Milner fires a low pass down the right. Salah is this close to shuttling it through a gap first time, down the channel to release Lallana. Ogbonna does extremely well to step in and close the door. 10 min: And once again, West Ham are inches away from pearling one into the bottom right of Liverpool\u2019s net! This time it\u2019s Cresswell, who sends a low diagonal screamer just wide after cutting in from the left, the finishing touch to a good move involving Antonio down the other wing. The home fans thought that one was in, and no wonder, it was so, so close! 9 min: Another corner for Liverpool out on the left, won by Robertson who had been sent into acres of space by a lovely van Dijk crossfield ball. Salah hits the corner too long, but it clanks off Cresswell and pinballs back to Firmino, who tees up Lallana on the edge of the area. He\u2019s got plenty of space and time, but snatches woefully at the shot and sends a dribbler through to Fabianski. That was a real chance. 7 min: Fredericks sends a poor clearance up the West Ham right. Liverpool come back at him through Mane, who dribbles his way to a corner off the same player. The gift of a set piece comes to nothing. This is a lively enough start. 5 min: Keita scuttles around on the left, then launches a long diagonal pass to send Salah free down the middle. Just a little too much on the ball, which Fabianski deals with at the very edge of his box. Salah not miles off from that, though. 4 min: Mane and Firmino combine well down the Liverpool left. A crisp little jink and flick from Firmino then sets Robertson clear into the box, but the flag goes up for offside. A sense already that there may be goals in this game. 3 min: West Ham come so close to an early goal! Cresswell drives down the left. He cuts inside and finds Felipe Anderson, who feeds Noble, who slides a fine pass down the inside-left channel. Hernandez is able to turn van Dijk and curl low and hard towards the bottom right. The ball flashes inches wide of the post. Not sure Allison was getting to that, had it been on target. 2 min: Some head tennis in the centre circle. Nobody\u2019s quite found their range yet. Under a big screen screaming Come On You Irons, Hernandez gets the ball rolling! The hosts immediately blooter the ball out of play; the home fans finish a full-throated rendition of Bubbles. Both sets of supporters giving it plenty! The teams are out! Thousands of pretty bubbles float into the night air as West Ham United and Liverpool take to the pitch at the London Stadium. Mark Noble leads out the hosts, James Milner the visitors. A rare old noise at the London Stadium. It\u2019s not quite at Upton Park levels, but it is what it is. As the teams shake hands, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah both look extremely relaxed; the same can\u2019t be said for some of their supporters. For example, here\u2019s Matt Dony: \u201cGoes without saying, but it\u2019s a big game tonight. I actually don\u2019t think nerves were a big issue last week; more a case of a makeshift defence and a collective off-day. These things happen to every team now and then. But, there\u2019s been so much talk about \u2018nervousness\u2019 since then, it\u2019s bound to have some kind of effect. There\u2019s an enormous amount of pressure on the players, they\u2019re in an unfamiliar position, and it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Keep telling them that they\u2019re nervous, and nerves will creep in. A big performance and a comfortable win tonight, and just maybe I can let myself start to dream. Any less than that, and I fear City will have the impetus. Argh! I flipping hate football!\u201d Jurgen Klopp talks! \u201cGini had a knee problem, so we couldn\u2019t use him. Hendo yesterday had to finish the session yesterday early. You want to have all your boys around, but that\u2019s the Premier League and we need to be ready for a big fight. But West Ham are without Arnautovic and have a lot of injuries themselves, so that\u2019s how football is. You have to make the best of what you have.\u201d He\u2019s then asked whether it gets harder to put what City are doing to one side. \u201cDoes it get harder to ask that question five million times in a row?! [laughs uproariously at own bon mot] I can\u2019t give a better answer, for me no. If you want to be first at the end of the season you need to be ready for a tough fight, you cannot hope that you will be champion in March, that\u2019s happened only two or three times in history, and at really big clubs in a much worse league than the Premier League. It\u2019s all good, we have to win our games, that doesn\u2019t change.\u201d Tonight\u2019s kits. West Ham will be wearing their famous claret and blue, sported here by the legendary Bobby Moore ... ... while Liverpool will sport a homage to this number from their last title-winning season. The equally handsome Glenn Hysen, ladies and gentlemen. Manuel Pellegrini speaks! \u201cCresswell was injured the last game, but he is normally in the starting eleven. Pablo has been playing too many games so I think it is good for him to take a rest. Hernandez knows what he can give to the team, he\u2019s a box player. Unfortunately for us he\u2019s had a lot of injuries, now he\u2019s got the chance again to start, and hopefully he\u2019ll give us the goal we couldn\u2019t get in the last games. We are playing against the leader, the best team this season, but in football you never know. We are not going to change our style, we are trying to win from the first minute.\u201d Both managers make three changes from midweek. West Ham were hoping that Marko Arnautovic would recover from the foot injury he picked up in the 3-0 defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but he\u2019s not made it. His place up front is taken by Javier Hernandez. Meanwhile Pablo Zabaleta and Arthur Masuaku drop to the bench, making way for Ryan Fredericks and Aaron Cresswell. Liverpool are forced into a rejig in the wake of the 1-1 draw with Leicester City. Jordan Henderson has a muscle problem, while Georginio Wijnaldum has a sore knee. James Milner fills in at left-back, while Fabinho returns to the midfield. Meanwhile Xherdan Shaqiri makes way for Adam Lallana. West Ham United: Fabianski, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Snodgrass, Noble, Rice, Felipe Anderson, Antonio, Hernandez. Subs: Zabaleta, Carroll, Adrian, Obiang, Masuaku, Lucas Perez, Diangana. Liverpool: Alisson, Milner, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Keita, Mane, Firmino, Lallana, Salah. Subs: Sturridge, Moreno, Mignolet, Shaqiri, Origi, Jones, Camacho. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). Manuel Pellegrini has already denied Liverpool a first title since 1990, of course. He was the Manchester City manager who pipped Brendan, Luis, Stevie et al to the Premier League back in 2014. And if he does a number on them as West Ham United boss tonight, he\u2019ll throw a spanner in the works of their latest championship challenge. \u201cIf we win, I will be very happy for our club first,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, if we can give a hand to Manchester City, it\u2019s not our problem, but of course I am a fan of Manchester City also.\u201d Looking at it one way, Pellegrini is talking more in hope than expectation. Liverpool have put four goals past West Ham in each of their last four meetings. They\u2019re top of the table, two points clear of champions Manchester City with a game in hand, while the Hammers are marooned in mid-table having lost their last three matches. That\u2019ll explain why the home side are priced 8-1 for the win at your local turf accountant. Then again, West Ham were extremely impressive in their last match at the London Stadium, a victory over Arsenal more comprehensive than the 1-0 scoreline suggests. Their most potent goal threat, Marko Arnautovic, is expected to have recovered from injury in time for this match. Also, Declan Rice. Overall, the Hammers are steadily improving under Pellegrini, and are certainly more of a threat than the team brushed aside at Anfield on the opening day. And Liverpool will be nervous. It\u2019s only February, but with City breathing down their necks, any dropped points will feel like ... well, a Hammer blow. Which sets this up deliciously. Both teams are desirous of a statement victory, West Ham to regain that upward momentum, Liverpool to re-establish that five-point cushion at the top. Here goes another crucial match in the title race, then. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT.",

No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person.\u201d</p> \n<p>Neeson continued: \u201cI went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I\u2019d be approached by somebody \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed to say that \u2013 and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could \u2026 kill him.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/05/liam-neeson-interview-black-people-actor-racism\">Liam Neeson\u2019s interview shows that for some, black people are still not fully human | Gary Younge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Neeson declines to name the victim and withholds details to protect their anonymity.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt took me a week, maybe a week-and-a-half, to go through that,\u201d he continues. \u201cShe would say, \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going out for a walk.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 \u2018No, no, nothing\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The interviewer gives every indication that Neeson is conscious of the gravity of what he is saying. She quotes him as saying: \u201cIt was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that. And I\u2019ve never admitted that, and I\u2019m saying it to a journalist. God forbid.\u201d</p> \n<p>His breath reportedly \u201ctrembles\u201d as he continues: \u201cIt\u2019s awful.

All this stuff that\u2019s happening in the world, the violence, is proof of that.

Neeson, whose career for the past 15 years has been defined by a series of revenge thrillers, was speaking to promote the latest, Cold Pursuit, in which he plays a man avenging the murder of his son. In the interview for the Independent, Neeson says he understood the \u201cprimal\u201d motivation his character feels. \u201cGod forbid you\u2019ve ever had a member of your family hurt under criminal conditions,\u201d he said, before recounting the story of a time, many years ago, when he returned from overseas to discover that a woman he knew well \u2013 he did not specify if she was a friend or a family member \u2013 had been raped. \u201cShe handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my immediate reaction was \u2026 I asked, did she know who it was? No. What colour were they? She said it was a black person.\u201d Neeson continued: \u201cI went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I\u2019d be approached by somebody \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed to say that \u2013 and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could \u2026 kill him.\u201d Neeson declines to name the victim and withholds details to protect their anonymity. \u201cIt took me a week, maybe a week-and-a-half, to go through that,\u201d he continues. \u201cShe would say, \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 and I would say, \u2018I\u2019m just going out for a walk.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 \u2018No, no, nothing\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d The interviewer gives every indication that Neeson is conscious of the gravity of what he is saying. She quotes him as saying: \u201cIt was horrible, horrible, when I think back, that I did that. And I\u2019ve never admitted that, and I\u2019m saying it to a journalist. God forbid.\u201d His breath reportedly \u201ctrembles\u201d as he continues: \u201cIt\u2019s awful. But I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, \u2018What the fuck are you doing?\u2019\u201d In Cold Pursuit, Neeson plays a snowplough driver named citizen of the year by his home town, who goes on a bloodthirsty spree after his son is killed by drug dealers. It was Taken (2004), in which Neeson\u2019s character tracks down and slaughters the men who have kidnapped his daughter, which jump-started his late wave of fame as an ageing action hero. Neeson added in the interview that growing up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles had also affected his sense of permissible violence. \u201cI knew a couple of guys that died on hunger strike,\u201d he said, \u201cand I had acquaintances who were very caught up in the Troubles, and I understand that need for revenge, but it just leads to more revenge, to more killing and more killing, and Northern Ireland\u2019s proof of that. All this stuff that\u2019s happening in the world, the violence, is proof of that. But that primal need, I understand.\u201d Neeson\u2019s recent dealings with the press has been characterised by a frankness rare amongst A-listers. Last year he raised concerns over the #MeToo movement on Ireland\u2019s The Late Late Show, calling the movement a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. Speaking in a video interview with the Guardian to promote the 2014 thriller Non-Stop, in which Neeson\u2019s federal air marshal must identify a hijacker on an international flight, he said: \u201cWe all racial-profile. It\u2019s a horrible thing to admit to but we all do it. I know I do.\u201d Neeson was most recently seen in Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows, playing the criminal mastermind husband of Viola Davis. The film\u2019s opening scene, in which the couple are seen embracing in bed, won acclaim for its progressive portrayal of a mixed-race marriage. Davis spelt out its significance, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a sexualised kiss. Here I am, I\u2019m dark, I\u2019m 53, I\u2019m in my natural hair \u2013 I\u2019m in bed with Liam Neeson \u2026 And he\u2019s not my slave owner. I\u2019m not a prostitute. We simply are a couple in love. I\u2019ve never seen it before. \u201cWhat struck me in the narrative is that I\u2019d never seen it before. And you\u2019re not going to see it this year, you\u2019re not going to see it next year, you\u2019re not going to see it the year after that.\u201d The Guardian has contacted representatives of Neeson for further comment regarding the Independent\u2019s interview.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will attempt to reassure businesses and Northern Irish politicians by insisting during a visit to Belfast that she can find a way to deliver a Brexit deal MPs can support. The prime minister is due to chair a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning before departing for a two-day visit to Northern Ireland to underscore her commitment to avoiding a hard border with Ireland. She is expected to say: \u201cI know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland. But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland \u2026 that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland \u2026 and that secures a majority in the Westminster parliament.\u201d Privately, however, there is scepticism within the government about the possibility of a breakthrough before May returns to parliament to make a statement about her Brexit plans on 13 February. \u201cShe\u2019s just burning down the clock,\u201d said one cabinet source. Downing Street said it was still planning to give MPs the chance to vote on the government\u2019s intentions on 14 February after rumours in Westminster suggested it could be pushed back into the following week. \u201cThat\u2019s the deadline we\u2019re working to,\u201d said a government source. The prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement faces a new problem in the shape of a potential legal challenge by one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement. David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party when the peace deal was signed, confirmed that he and others were considering legal action over the backstop provisions in the withdrawal agreement. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \u201cWe are exploring this possibility and we are concerned at the way in which the withdrawal agreement that our prime minister agreed actually turns the Belfast agreement on its head and does serious damage to it.\u201d He explained: \u201cThe EU has come in this exit agreement [and] stripped a significant number of competencies out of the devolved administration and put in place a number of top-down structures, and a UK/EU body which is going to supervise. The success of the [Good Friday] agreement is largely because it was bottom up.\u201d While May is in Belfast \u2013 where she is also expected to meet party leaders, including those from Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 an \u201calternative arrangements working group\u201d, made up of Conservative backbenchers, ministers and civil servants will meet in Westminster. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said the first meeting of the group, chaired by the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, had been \u201cdetailed and constructive, and the first step of a process to find common ground on the issue of the backstop\u201d. Attendees included the Treasury select committee chair, Nicky Morgan, the European Research Group\u2019s Steve Baker and the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith. The group was created after Tory MPs from the leave and remain camps came together to promote the Malthouse compromise, which involves a longer transition period while alternatives to the backstop are explored. Morgan said the government was \u201ctaking very seriously the desire of parliament to identify alternative arrangements\u201d. Meanwhile, senior EU figures have continued to underline their objections to replacing the backstop. The chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who held talks with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, on Monday, tweeted that the withdrawal agreement \u201ccannot be reopened\u201d and the EU was \u201cready to work on alternative solutions during transition\u201d \u2013 in other words, after the UK had left. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a supporter of the anti-Brexit campaign Best for Britain, said: \u201cThe alternative arrangements group looks like a colossal waste of taxpayers\u2019 money to create another unicorn plan for peace in the Conservative party. While senior EU and economic experts are already rubbishing the plan, a select group of Tory MPs are simply wasting time on another plan that is already dead as a dodo.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, warned about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland, after the government conceded it had not specifically earmarked funds for avoiding disruption in the province. The Northern Ireland minister, John Penrose, told Cable in a written parliamentary answer that his department had not allocated any funding for no-deal preparations, adding: \u201cA number of staff across the department work on both EU exit and non-EU exit related work.\u201d Cable said: \u201cIf the government is serious about letting Britain crash out of the EU, there should be a dedicated unit in the Northern Ireland Office, preparing for this eventuality. We can only conclude that the no-deal threat is a false one.\u201d",

Alphabet\u2019s revenues for the quarter were 22% higher than the same period last year and the company made a profit of $8.9bn, the company announced on Monday. Revenues in the US rose 20% while revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 29%, helped by the strength of the euro and the pound. It was the latest tech company to announce strong revenue growth \u2013 news that has cheered investors \u2013 but rising costs that come as the company is facing increasing competition from Amazon clouded the news. The fees that Alphabet pays to companies like Apple for Google to be their default search engine rose to $7.4bn up from $6.6bn for the same period last year. The costs of its most ambitious projects also rose sharply. Alphabet\u2019s shares sank 3% in after-hours trading. Google properties account for nearly all of the company\u2019s revenues \u2013 $39.1bn in the last quarter. Revenues from its cloud business, hardware sales and Play, its music and media service, were $6.4bn. \u201cOther bets\u201d, as Alphabet calls its more experimental businesses including Waymo, the self-driving car startup, its fiber optic cable business and Verily, its health division, had revenues of $154m. Losses from other bets nearly doubled over the year to $1.3bn from $748m a year ago. Advertising revenues were up 20% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, to $32.6bn, the same rate of growth as last quarter. Alphabet is the last of the so-called Faang \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 to report its quarterly earnings. Before the results were released the company\u2019s share price had rallied after stumbling along with its peers last year. The rise of the Faangs helped propel stock markets to new highs and their stumble helped to drag down indices across the world last year. But the latest set of tech results have cheered investors. Last week Amazon reported its third record profit in a row, making over $3bn in the last three months of the year. Amazon and Alphabet are increasingly competing for advertising dollars and in cloud computing. On Monday Apple briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable company once again as investors continued to absorb its better than expected results from last week.",

But he hinted that further public spending cuts could be made. \u201cWe can do better while spending less, if we spend in the right places,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s pro-business presidency has in effect been put on hold for more than two months and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/macron-finds-elitist-tag-hard-to-shake-but-he-has-the-upper-hand\">programme to overhaul labour and the welfare state</a> has stalled as he instead grapples to contain gilets jaunes street protests against him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/macron-seeks-to-turn-anger-into-solutions-in-open-letter-to-france\">Macron seeks to turn 'anger into solutions' in open letter to France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is now trying to kickstart his promised \u201ctransformation\u201d of France with a two-month national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/13/macron-seeks-to-turn-anger-into-solutions-in-open-letter-to-france\">\u201cgreat debate\u201d</a> involving town-hall meetings across France where citizens can present their views on taxation, democracy, environment and the way France is run.</p> <p>Macron has deliberately been making high-profile appearances at certain town-hall debates alongside mayors across France, taking the microphone, rolling up his shirtsleeves and sometimes debating for up to six hours at a time. After facing heckling and jeers when he went out at the height of the gilets jaunes crisis in November and December, he is now making carefully organised public appearances at debates, as if back on the election campaign trail.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/nothings-changed-10-years-after-french-riots-banlieues-remain-in-crisis\">high-rise suburban estates on the outskirts of French cities</a> \u2013 which for decades have struggled with unemployment and discrimination \u2013 have not featured prominently in the gilets jaunes crisis.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s appearance on Monday night in \u00c9vry-Courcouronnes, 20 miles south of Paris, was aimed at showing he was listening to communities in the French suburbs or <em>banlieues</em>, where many feel he has failed to address their concerns.</p> <p>Macron met more than 300 elected officials and leaders of community groups from deprived communities. Many expressed their exasperation to the president, warning of the \u201csegregation\u201d and \u201cghettoisation\u201d of communities.</p> <p>Philippe Rio, the Communist mayor of Grigny, won applause when he said deprived communities on the outskirts of cities \u201cdon\u2019t want charity but justice\u201d. He said social and \u201cterritorial apartheid\u201d existed in France and had not been fixed by the state. He said people on housing estates felt that in the eyes of the government they didn\u2019t exist, that the French promise of \u201cliberty, equality, fraternity\u201d was \u201creserved for those of a certain caste\u201d.</p> <p>Macron insisted that by coming to local debates with mayors \u201cI hear things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise hear\u201d. He said he had \u201cconvictions\u201d but not \u201call the solutions\u201d, which he now wanted to find collectively. He said if everything he\u2019d done had worked perfectly, France wouldn\u2019t be in this crisis.</p> <p>To one mayor of a deprived area who beseeched him: \u201cDon\u2019t abandon us!\u201d, Macron replied: \u201cI won\u2019t abandon you, that\u2019s not my temperament.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s vast nationwide debate process, which continues until March, is an exercise that has never been attempted before in France. Some political opponents \u2013 and gilets jaunes protesters themselves \u2013 have questioned whether the government will really listen to citizens\u2019 suggestions.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s personality has become the focus of gilets jaunes protests, which began as a fuel tax revolt in November and quickly morphed into an angry movement against the president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/macrons-arrogance-unites-us-on-the-barricades-with-frances-gilets-jaunes\">who is accused of arrogance</a> and favouring the rich with pro-business policies.</p> <p>Although Macron\u2019s poll ratings have inched up slightly among rightwing voters who approve of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/31/authoritarian-anti-protest-gilets-jaunes-measures-draw-criticism-in-france\">measures to crack down on protests</a>, his overall approval ratings remain low \u2013 hovering between 25% and 35%. A majority of French people see him as cut off from reality. A recent poll by Elabe found that almost eight in 10 French people thought he was authoritarian.</p> <p>In the run-up to European elections in May, Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, is polling neck and neck with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has conceded there has been a \u201cclear breakdown in equality\u201d in high-rise suburbs and housing estates on the edge of major cities as he tours France to try to stem the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government protests. Macron said the state must \u201cguarantee social justice\u201d and stop people in deprived suburban areas becoming trapped \u201cunder a form of social house arrest\u201d as he appeared at a town hall building south of Paris to debate for several hours with mayors and community activists on Monday. But he hinted that further public spending cuts could be made. \u201cWe can do better while spending less, if we spend in the right places,\u201d he argued. Macron\u2019s pro-business presidency has in effect been put on hold for more than two months and his programme to overhaul labour and the welfare state has stalled as he instead grapples to contain gilets jaunes street protests against him. He is now trying to kickstart his promised \u201ctransformation\u201d of France with a two-month national \u201cgreat debate\u201d involving town-hall meetings across France where citizens can present their views on taxation, democracy, environment and the way France is run. Macron has deliberately been making high-profile appearances at certain town-hall debates alongside mayors across France, taking the microphone, rolling up his shirtsleeves and sometimes debating for up to six hours at a time. After facing heckling and jeers when he went out at the height of the gilets jaunes crisis in November and December, he is now making carefully organised public appearances at debates, as if back on the election campaign trail. But the high-rise suburban estates on the outskirts of French cities \u2013 which for decades have struggled with unemployment and discrimination \u2013 have not featured prominently in the gilets jaunes crisis. Macron\u2019s appearance on Monday night in \u00c9vry-Courcouronnes, 20 miles south of Paris, was aimed at showing he was listening to communities in the French suburbs or banlieues, where many feel he has failed to address their concerns. Macron met more than 300 elected officials and leaders of community groups from deprived communities. Many expressed their exasperation to the president, warning of the \u201csegregation\u201d and \u201cghettoisation\u201d of communities. Philippe Rio, the Communist mayor of Grigny, won applause when he said deprived communities on the outskirts of cities \u201cdon\u2019t want charity but justice\u201d. He said social and \u201cterritorial apartheid\u201d existed in France and had not been fixed by the state. He said people on housing estates felt that in the eyes of the government they didn\u2019t exist, that the French promise of \u201cliberty, equality, fraternity\u201d was \u201creserved for those of a certain caste\u201d. Macron insisted that by coming to local debates with mayors \u201cI hear things I wouldn\u2019t otherwise hear\u201d. He said he had \u201cconvictions\u201d but not \u201call the solutions\u201d, which he now wanted to find collectively. He said if everything he\u2019d done had worked perfectly, France wouldn\u2019t be in this crisis. To one mayor of a deprived area who beseeched him: \u201cDon\u2019t abandon us!\u201d, Macron replied: \u201cI won\u2019t abandon you, that\u2019s not my temperament.\u201d Macron\u2019s vast nationwide debate process, which continues until March, is an exercise that has never been attempted before in France. Some political opponents \u2013 and gilets jaunes protesters themselves \u2013 have questioned whether the government will really listen to citizens\u2019 suggestions. Macron\u2019s personality has become the focus of gilets jaunes protests, which began as a fuel tax revolt in November and quickly morphed into an angry movement against the president, who is accused of arrogance and favouring the rich with pro-business policies. Although Macron\u2019s poll ratings have inched up slightly among rightwing voters who approve of measures to crack down on protests, his overall approval ratings remain low \u2013 hovering between 25% and 35%. A majority of French people see him as cut off from reality. A recent poll by Elabe found that almost eight in 10 French people thought he was authoritarian. In the run-up to European elections in May, Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, is polling neck and neck with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally.",

We included anyone who accepted money, including as a consultant or speaker, or who published research funded by industry that was potentially relevant to the guideline area.\u201d</p> <p>Moynihan and his colleagues considered guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC] database added between 2012 and 2014, across 10 health priority areas including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health and obesity. They uncovered 33 guidelines involving 402 authors. Of those, 344 authors had no disclosed pharmaceutical company links.</p> <p>The researchers then conducted a search of each author who had no declared conflicts, going back a period of five years because many guidelines take at least two years to develop, and five years is the timeframe suggested in many guideline disclosure policies. They found 24% had potentially relevant, undisclosed ties.</p> <p>\u201cTransparency is a widespread community expectation, and I think we show it\u2019s one that\u2019s not being met in this vital corner of medicine,\u201d Moynihan said.</p> <p>The study found writers of guidelines developed and funded by government were less likely to have undisclosed financial ties. Undisclosed conflicts of interest were \u201calmost negligent\u201d in the fields of injury and neurology, Moynihan said.</p> <p>\u201cBut the data does show the problem of undisclosed ties is worse in certain areas than in others and the two areas where it is particularly evident is diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

      "bodyText": "Experts developing guidelines to diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are the least likely to disclose their financial ties with drug companies, a study led by Bond University in Queensland has found. The first study in Australia to examine undisclosed financial relationships between drug companies and the doctors who write influential guidelines found almost one in four guideline writers who said they had no ties in fact had a likely conflict of interest. The findings were published in the medical journal BMJ Open on Tuesday. The lead author, Dr Ray Moynihan, said the study was not about shaming individual doctors. But he said it highlighted that the rules governing guideline committees needed to be more transparent and consistent. \u201cIt\u2019s possible for example that a doctor or guideline writer may have disclosed a tie to a committee they were on, but that committee decided not to disclose it in the published guidelines,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cWhether transparency rules are rigorous enough in Australia and what constitutes a relevant tie is an open question, and for this paper our working definition was a broad one. We included anyone who accepted money, including as a consultant or speaker, or who published research funded by industry that was potentially relevant to the guideline area.\u201d Moynihan and his colleagues considered guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC] database added between 2012 and 2014, across 10 health priority areas including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health and obesity. They uncovered 33 guidelines involving 402 authors. Of those, 344 authors had no disclosed pharmaceutical company links. The researchers then conducted a search of each author who had no declared conflicts, going back a period of five years because many guidelines take at least two years to develop, and five years is the timeframe suggested in many guideline disclosure policies. They found 24% had potentially relevant, undisclosed ties. \u201cTransparency is a widespread community expectation, and I think we show it\u2019s one that\u2019s not being met in this vital corner of medicine,\u201d Moynihan said. The study found writers of guidelines developed and funded by government were less likely to have undisclosed financial ties. Undisclosed conflicts of interest were \u201calmost negligent\u201d in the fields of injury and neurology, Moynihan said. \u201cBut the data does show the problem of undisclosed ties is worse in certain areas than in others and the two areas where it is particularly evident is diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. That makes sense as they\u2019re both massive markets for medicines.\u201d The chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum, Leanne Wells, said clinical guidelines should always be of the highest integrity, and promote the latest evidence. \u201cAll authors at all times should declare relevant interests as a matter of best practice and transparency and public trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a growing interest in principles and standards that require greater transparency in the relationship between industry and clinical and consumer groups \u2026 most recently the Australian Consensus Framework for Ethical Collaboration in the Healthcare Sector, which has 60 or so signatories.\u201d The NHMRC is also revising its standards for guideline writers. Dr Justin Coleman is the spokesman for No Advertising Please, an alliance of Australian doctors pledging to ban pharmaceutical company representatives from visits to their practices and to reduce overprescription of drugs. He said it was \u201cnever appropriate\u201d for the chair of a committee to have a link to a related pharmaceutical company. \u201cAn enormous power rests with the chair and even though everyone acts as an individual, it\u2019s these sorts of disclosures that do fall to a chair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey consider what evidence gets discussed, how the literature reviews are done, and what should be relevant disclosures.\u201d",

Margaret Hodge, Ruth Smeeth and Catherine McKinnell criticised the party\u2019s leadership following claims that the general secretary, Jennie Formby, has been slow to tackle dozens of claims of abuse and threats from Labour party members. It followed a motion, unanimously passed by the meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in Westminster, which called on the leadership to do more to tackle antisemitism in the party. The motion called on the leadership \u201cto adequately tackle cases of antisemitism, as failure to do so seriously risks antisemitism in the party appearing normalised and the party seeming to be institutionally antisemitic\u201d. A Labour source denied that the party was covering up the number of allegations, and said that both Jeremy Corbyn and Formby have made tackling claims of antisemitism within the party a priority. Corbyn apologised 10 months ago for the \u201churt and pain\u201d caused by instances of antisemitism within Labour and pledged to redouble his \u201cefforts to bring this anxiety to an end\u201d. MPs were particularly angry at Formby\u2019s refusal to release data showing the number of outstanding cases still to be heard by the party. Outside the meeting, Hodge, the MP for Barking, said: \u201cThe resolution was unanimously supported by the parliamentary Labour party, and then the general secretary of the Labour party basically said she wasn\u2019t prepared to give us the information that was required in the resolution. \u201cFor me if you want to get rid of the cancer of antisemitism in the Labour party you have to have complete transparency.

      "bodyText": "The independent MP Kerryn Phelps says her crossbench colleague Cathy McGowan has given no indication she has withdrawn support for a bill that would give doctors more power to approve medical transfers from offshore detention. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, Phelps said McGowan had \u201ca long track record of supporting the rights of refugees\u201d and that she hadn\u2019t \u201cseen any indication she has changed her mind\u201d on the bill. McGowan is the key vote in deciding whether the Morrison government faces a humiliating defeat on the floor of the House of Representatives when Phelps\u2019 bill for emergency medical transfers from offshore detention goes before parliament. The bill, due to be debated next week, requires the temporary transfer of all children and their families from offshore detention to Australia for the purpose of medical or psychiatric assessment. On Monday Morrison sought to head off what would be a humiliating defeat on the floor of parliament by announcing an independent medical review panel to vet medical transfers of asylum seekers from offshore detention. The proposal resembles a key component of the Phelps bill due to go before the parliament next week. However, it would not allow doctors to override the department blocking critically ill people transferring to Australia for treatment. On Monday\u2019s Q&amp;A a number of key crossbench members including Andrew Wilkie, Rebecca Sharkie and Julia Banks indicated they would still support the Phelps bill. \u201cI will absolutely be supporting Kerryn Phelps\u2019s bill,\u201d Banks said. \u201cFrom my perspective, a sick person who needs help, who is seeking refuge, is a sick person. I don\u2019t think this is the opportunity for the government to say that we\u2019ve got the kids off now, we can all sit back and relax.\u201d Similarly, Wilkie said he would \u201ccertainly\u201d support the Phelps bill. \u201cIt makes sense to me [that] when someone is sick the person who should decide their fate is a doctor,\u201d he said. He said a series of Australian governments were \u201cguilty of crimes against humanity\u201d over the policy, and \u201cif someone dies, the blood will be on their hands\u201d. In order for the bill to pass, it will require McGowan\u2019s support. On Monday McGowan issued a statement which said she was \u201cpleased\u201d with Morrison\u2019s announcement, but did not explicitly state whether she would support the Phelps\u2019 bill. \u201cI will not give up on refugees and my voting record speaks for itself on this issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my speeches and in all my conversations on this topic I have consistently talked about how important it is for Australia to uphold its international obligations. \u201cProviding support for refugees while keeping our borders secure does not mean we should treat people in anything less than a humane way.\u201d However on Monday, Phelps said McGowan had given no indication either way on whether she would support the bill. \u201cShe\u2019s supportive of refugees but won\u2019t show her hand until next week I\u2019d think,\u201d she said. \u2018\u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to say what she will do. The best thing the government can do is to vote with this and because it\u2019s a really good piece of legislation. It\u2019s a medical solution to a medical problem.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The business secretary has been forced to admit the existence of a previously secret package of state aid to Nissan that could have been worth up to \u00a380m had the carmaker gone ahead with plans to manufacture a new model X-Trail in Sunderland after Brexit. Greg Clark released a letter dated October 2016 in which he pledged tens of millions of taxpayer support and promised the Japanese company it would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d after the UK left the EU. Yet, at the time the commitments were first made, Downing Street had said \u201cthere was no special deal for Nissan\u201d and Clark refused six times to answer a question about what was on offer when interviewed on the BBC. He even appeared to suggest no money was involved. Asked on BBC One\u2019s Question Time about the deal, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no chequebook. I don\u2019t have a chequebook.\u201d Clark and the government had repeatedly refused to release the 2016 letter until the promises turned out to be worthless, because Nissan had abandoned its future investment plan, partly because of uncertainty over Brexit. The four-page document, sent by Clark to Nissan\u2019s then chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, committed the government to \u201ca package of support in areas such as skills, R&amp;D and innovation\u201d which \u201ccould amount to additional support of up to \u00a380m\u201d. The state aid package ultimately turned out to be worth \u00a361m when it was formally awarded to Nissan in June 2018, a fact only acknowledged by Clark in a second letter sent on Monday to the Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business select committee. The 2016 letter promised Ghosn it would \u201cbe a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU\u201d. Clark\u2019s Brexit promise, however, could not be met because no deal has been struck with the European Union with less than two months to the scheduled March 29 exit date, causing mounting concern that the UK could crash out without agreeing a deal. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, complained that MPs had not been informed about the deal with Nissan before Monday. She asked why her predecessor, Andrew Tyrie, had not been told about the package when he had asked what assurances had been provided to Nissan in 2016. \u201cIf the government provided financial assistance to Nissan to persuade it to stay in Sunderland, it should set out what this support was and why it did not disclose it to my predecessor,\u201d Morgan said. Clark told MPs Nissan would have to reapply to the government for the financial support, which was offered on the basis that the carmaker would produce its Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland. The company had only received \u00a32.6m so far, he said. The minister, however, sought to deflect the criticism of his handling of the Nissan affair by warning that a no-deal Brexit \u201cwould be ruinous for our prospects\u201d and arguing that MPs should heed the company\u2019s decision and support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cNo-deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects,\u201d Clark told MPs in an unambiguous warning to hard Brexiters in his party. \u201cBut in order to avoid no-deal, we need to come to an agreement in this house.\u201d Clark is one of the strongest voices in cabinet against a no-deal Brexit, alongside Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and David Gauke, the justice secretary. But May has refused to rule it out as a bargaining position, even though talks with the EU are at an impasse. The Nissan car plant in Sunderland, the biggest of its kind in the UK, employs 7,000 people and is one of the UK\u2019s industrial success stories. It operates on the outskirts of a city where 61% voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. There have been concerns about Nissan\u2019s long-term investment plans since the Brexit vote, concerns exacerbated by a slump in demand for diesel vehicles. Vehicles using the fuel are facing tighter regulations across the EU after an emissions-cheating scandal at Volkswagen prompted intense scrutiny of diesel\u2019s environmental impact. Over the weekend, Nissan said it would no longer manufacture the new model X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, stopping a planned expansion. The company said \u201cthe continued uncertainty\u201d over Brexit was one of the factors behind its decision. No jobs were lost as a result of Nissan\u2019s decision, but the investment in the X-Trail had been intended to create 741 new jobs. Clark\u2019s 2016 letter did not make any specific assurances about the UK\u2019s future Brexit policy, although it did seek to provide general comfort to Ghosn and acknowledged his concern about the impact of changes in the terms of trade. \u201cWe will continue to do everything we can to make it as easy and rewarding as possible for Nissan to invest,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cI understand, of course, your worries now about uncertainties as the UK prepares to leave the EU.

Nissan has come under new leadership since Clark\u2019s letter, after Ghosn was ousted following allegations brought by the company that he had under-reported income worth billions of yen. The Japanese businessman Hiroto Saikawa has taken over. Nissan said the letter showed the company\u2019s and the government\u2019s \u201ccontinued desire to support investment in the UK and maintain Sunderland as one of Nissan\u2019s manufacturing hubs in Europe.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 5 February.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>The political fallout from the banking royal commission\u2019s final report is in full swing,</strong> with Labor seizing on the government\u2019s reluctance to create a user-pays system for mortgage brokers. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/04/essential-poll-labor-seizes-on-banking-brawl-as-lead-over-coalition-narrows\">the latest Guardian Essential poll</a> shows Labor\u2019s lead narrowing to 52%-48% on a two-party-preferred basis, the opposition will target the Coalition\u2019s apparent reluctance to wholeheartedly embrace Hayne\u2019s user-pays reforms aimed at breaking up the cosy relationship between banks and brokers. Hayne\u2019s damning report into the banking industry, delivered on Monday, recommended that some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/04/banks-may-face-criminal-charges-after-final-royal-commission-report\">banks could face criminal prosecution</a> over misconduct such as fees for no service and changing dead people for services. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/04/coalition-response-banking-inquiry-pure-politics\">Katharine Murphy explains</a> why the politics of the report left the government with little option but to accept Hayne\u2019s verdict.</p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s cheap, dirty petrol ranks among the worst of the OECD nations,</strong> yet the peak body representing petrol refiners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/among-the-worst-in-oecd-australias-addiction-to-cheap-dirty-petrol\">says the industry should be given until 2027</a> to adjust to stricter regulations. The chief executive of the Australian Institute of Petroleum, Paul Barrett, hit back at critics who have described Australian petrol as low quality thanks to its sulphur content, saying: \u201cThere are a range of fuel parameters which determine the quality of fuel, not just the sulphur content.\u201d But analysts say improving fuel quality could offer significant improvements in CO2 emissions \u201covernight\u201d.</p> <p><strong>At least a third of the huge ice fields in Asia\u2019s towering mountain chain are doomed to melt due to climate change,</strong> according to a landmark report, with serious consequences <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/a-third-of-himalayan-ice-cap-doomed-finds-shocking-report\">for almost 2 billion people</a>. Even if carbon emissions are dramatically and rapidly cut and succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5C, 36% of the glaciers along the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range will have gone by 2100. If emissions are not cut, the loss soars to two-thirds, the report found.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eec5be08b72d557f7a8e4ec436032c46d3e6745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eec5be08b72d557f7a8e4ec436032c46d3e6745/0_197_2953_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas Maduro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, at a military ceremony in Caracas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has hit back at the \u201cgringo plot to overthrow revolution\u201d </strong>in Venezuela,<strong> </strong>following what he called the<strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/venezuela-maduro-hits-back-at-gringo-plot-to-overthrow-revolution\">\u201c</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/venezuela-maduro-hits-back-at-gringo-plot-to-overthrow-revolution\">cowardly\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d decision</a> of European countries to recognise his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as interim president.</p> <p><strong>A suggestion by one of the EU\u2019s most powerful officials of possible further legal assurances on the Irish backstop has failed to win over Brexiter MPs,</strong> leading to heightened talk of the UK leaving the bloc with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/brexiter-mps-unmoved-by-eu-hint-at-legal-assurance-on-backstop\">no deal</a>.</p> <p><strong>The pope and the grand imam of Al-Azhar have signed a historic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/04/pope-and-grand-imam-sign-historic-pledge-of-fraternity-in-uae\">declaration of fraternity</a>,</strong> calling for peace between nations, religions and races, in front of a global audience of Christian, Muslim, Jewish and other religious leaders.</p> <p><strong>About US$190m in cryptocurrency has been locked away in a online black hole after the founder of a currency exchange died,</strong> apparently taking his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/04/quadrigacx-canada-cryptocurrency-exchange-locked-gerald-cotten\">encrypted access to their money</a> with him.</p> <p><strong>In a remarkable new interview, the actor Liam Neeson has said he once wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/04/liam-neeson-after-a-friend-was-raped-i-wanted-to-kill-a-black-man\">murder a black person</a>,</strong> in reaction to the rape of someone to whom he was close.</p> <h2>Opinion and analysis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c43c7f9872beee617b3e790ce30d6220d4a7a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c43c7f9872beee617b3e790ce30d6220d4a7a01/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tasmanian bushfires\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The damage being done to Tasmania by bushfires is \u2018almost certainly as tragic as the coral reef bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef\u2019, writes Richard Flanagan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tasmanians find themselves living in a frightening new world where summer is no longer a time of joy,</strong> but a period of smog-drenched dread that goes on week after week and, it seems inevitable, month after month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/tasmania-is-burning-the-climate-disaster-future-has-arrived-while-those-in-power-laugh-at-us\">writes Richard Flanagan</a>. Whole communities are living in evacuation centres or bunking down with friends and family. Volunteer firefighters find themselves no longer fighting fires for a week but for a season. And this would seem to be the new normal. According to David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, Tasmanians \u201cmust think about fire as part of daily life\u201d. Tasmania\u2019s ancient remnant forest and its woodland alpine heathlands are at profound and immediate risk, while Scott Morrison and his colleagues who refuse to tackle climate change are not just deriding their political opponents but mocking the future with the pure contempt of power.</p> <p><strong>The attempt to extradite Hakeem al-Araibi is a lesson that it\u2019s time to stand up to Bahrain, </strong>writes Aya Majzoub. Despite Bahrain\u2019s atrocious human rights record, its allies have not used their influence to press for improvements, emboldening the Bahraini government to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/05/hakeem-al-araibi-case-bahrain-is-emboldened-to-take-human-rights-abuse-beyond-its-borders\">take its abuses beyond its borders</a>. The international community, including Australia, must make it clear to Bahrain that it cannot get away with torturing and silencing everyone who speaks out against abuses.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>Never have the New England Patriots been so doubted.</strong> A creaking 41-year-old quarterback. A Hall of Fame tight end on his last legs. A slow defence. Julian Edelman, Tom Brady\u2019s favourite weapon, coming off an ACL injury and a doping suspension. Five road losses.

He gazes lovingly at his balls, which in this case are a row of stainless steel spheres suitably blown up to bear an astonishing resemblance to his most famous artistic muse: inflatable rubber toys. But given that Koons shot to notoriety with his 1991 series Made in Heaven \u2013 in which he photographed himself and his then girlfriend Ilona Staller in pretty much every sexual position legal in the state of New York \u2013 this ball chat really could have gone another way.</p> <p>Koons, until very recently the world\u2019s most expensive living artist, has the calm, unruffled air that, in New York, is generally only found in the heavily medicated. But in him, it seems more like the zen of a man who has all but the licence to print money. His works sell for multimillions. The art collector Peter Brant, who bought Koons\u2019s piece Puppy, a 40ft west highland terrier made out of flowers, spends $75,000 a year just maintaining it. \u201cKoons,\u201d read one recent, and typical, critical assessment, \u201chas made his name manufacturing toys for rich old boys.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Koons hates this kind of chat. \u201cThe rest of the world talks so much about money,\u201d he says, \u201cand one of the reasons is I think they feel uncomfortable talking about art. So if they\u2019re writing about art, and they don\u2019t really want to talk about art, then they talk about money \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u2018Whew! I didn\u2019t have to talk about art!\u2019\u201d To which it\u2019s tempting to respond: \u201cSure, Jeff, but it\u2019s kinda hard to see the art when it has a $58m price tag hanging off its neck.\u201d</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>The banking royal commission inevitably dominates this morning\u2019s headlines, with the <strong>West Australian</strong> again doing well in the pun stakes: \u201cSell Sell Cell\u201d, the print front page proclaims above its <a href=\"https://thewest.com.au/business/banking/banking-fat-cats-face-time-in-prison-over-fees-for-no-service-scandal-ng-b881093640z\">main report</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 5 February. Top stories The political fallout from the banking royal commission\u2019s final report is in full swing, with Labor seizing on the government\u2019s reluctance to create a user-pays system for mortgage brokers. As the latest Guardian Essential poll shows Labor\u2019s lead narrowing to 52%-48% on a two-party-preferred basis, the opposition will target the Coalition\u2019s apparent reluctance to wholeheartedly embrace Hayne\u2019s user-pays reforms aimed at breaking up the cosy relationship between banks and brokers. Hayne\u2019s damning report into the banking industry, delivered on Monday, recommended that some banks could face criminal prosecution over misconduct such as fees for no service and changing dead people for services. Katharine Murphy explains why the politics of the report left the government with little option but to accept Hayne\u2019s verdict. Australia\u2019s cheap, dirty petrol ranks among the worst of the OECD nations, yet the peak body representing petrol refiners says the industry should be given until 2027 to adjust to stricter regulations. The chief executive of the Australian Institute of Petroleum, Paul Barrett, hit back at critics who have described Australian petrol as low quality thanks to its sulphur content, saying: \u201cThere are a range of fuel parameters which determine the quality of fuel, not just the sulphur content.\u201d But analysts say improving fuel quality could offer significant improvements in CO2 emissions \u201covernight\u201d. At least a third of the huge ice fields in Asia\u2019s towering mountain chain are doomed to melt due to climate change, according to a landmark report, with serious consequences for almost 2 billion people. Even if carbon emissions are dramatically and rapidly cut and succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5C, 36% of the glaciers along the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range will have gone by 2100. If emissions are not cut, the loss soars to two-thirds, the report found. World Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has hit back at the \u201cgringo plot to overthrow revolution\u201d in Venezuela, following what he called the \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d decision of European countries to recognise his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as interim president. A suggestion by one of the EU\u2019s most powerful officials of possible further legal assurances on the Irish backstop has failed to win over Brexiter MPs, leading to heightened talk of the UK leaving the bloc with no deal. The pope and the grand imam of Al-Azhar have signed a historic declaration of fraternity, calling for peace between nations, religions and races, in front of a global audience of Christian, Muslim, Jewish and other religious leaders. About US$190m in cryptocurrency has been locked away in a online black hole after the founder of a currency exchange died, apparently taking his encrypted access to their money with him. In a remarkable new interview, the actor Liam Neeson has said he once wanted to murder a black person, in reaction to the rape of someone to whom he was close. Opinion and analysis Tasmanians find themselves living in a frightening new world where summer is no longer a time of joy, but a period of smog-drenched dread that goes on week after week and, it seems inevitable, month after month, writes Richard Flanagan. Whole communities are living in evacuation centres or bunking down with friends and family. Volunteer firefighters find themselves no longer fighting fires for a week but for a season. And this would seem to be the new normal. According to David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, Tasmanians \u201cmust think about fire as part of daily life\u201d. Tasmania\u2019s ancient remnant forest and its woodland alpine heathlands are at profound and immediate risk, while Scott Morrison and his colleagues who refuse to tackle climate change are not just deriding their political opponents but mocking the future with the pure contempt of power. The attempt to extradite Hakeem al-Araibi is a lesson that it\u2019s time to stand up to Bahrain, writes Aya Majzoub. Despite Bahrain\u2019s atrocious human rights record, its allies have not used their influence to press for improvements, emboldening the Bahraini government to take its abuses beyond its borders. The international community, including Australia, must make it clear to Bahrain that it cannot get away with torturing and silencing everyone who speaks out against abuses. Sport Never have the New England Patriots been so doubted. A creaking 41-year-old quarterback. A Hall of Fame tight end on his last legs. A slow defence. Julian Edelman, Tom Brady\u2019s favourite weapon, coming off an ACL injury and a doping suspension. Five road losses. It wasn\u2019t the prettiest, but Super Bowl LIII may well have been Bill Belichick\u2019s best coaching job to date. The family of the footballer Emiliano Sala are desperate for the plane he was travelling in to be recovered from the seabed after it emerged that a body had been spotted in the wreckage. Thinking time: Inflatable metaphors \u201cTo get great clarity in the balls, you really need to blow them a lot,\u201d Jeff Koons tells Hadley Freedman, with all the solemnity of a man explaining his tax returns. He gazes lovingly at his balls, which in this case are a row of stainless steel spheres suitably blown up to bear an astonishing resemblance to his most famous artistic muse: inflatable rubber toys. But given that Koons shot to notoriety with his 1991 series Made in Heaven \u2013 in which he photographed himself and his then girlfriend Ilona Staller in pretty much every sexual position legal in the state of New York \u2013 this ball chat really could have gone another way. Koons, until very recently the world\u2019s most expensive living artist, has the calm, unruffled air that, in New York, is generally only found in the heavily medicated. But in him, it seems more like the zen of a man who has all but the licence to print money. His works sell for multimillions. The art collector Peter Brant, who bought Koons\u2019s piece Puppy, a 40ft west highland terrier made out of flowers, spends $75,000 a year just maintaining it. \u201cKoons,\u201d read one recent, and typical, critical assessment, \u201chas made his name manufacturing toys for rich old boys.\u201d Of course, Koons hates this kind of chat. \u201cThe rest of the world talks so much about money,\u201d he says, \u201cand one of the reasons is I think they feel uncomfortable talking about art. So if they\u2019re writing about art, and they don\u2019t really want to talk about art, then they talk about money \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u2018Whew! I didn\u2019t have to talk about art!\u2019\u201d To which it\u2019s tempting to respond: \u201cSure, Jeff, but it\u2019s kinda hard to see the art when it has a $58m price tag hanging off its neck.\u201d Media roundup The banking royal commission inevitably dominates this morning\u2019s headlines, with the West Australian again doing well in the pun stakes: \u201cSell Sell Cell\u201d, the print front page proclaims above its main report. Amid reams of analysis, Adele Ferguson in the Age and Sydney Morning Herald stands out for highlighting the shortcomings of Kenneth Hayne\u2019s recommendations. The Townsville Bulletin understandably has other priorities, reporting that two men are feared missing as the flood crisis continues, while the Herald Sun reports that Monday\u2019s Melbourne tower block fire has again focused urgent attention on combustible cladding throughout the city. Coming up A group opposed to the demolition of Sydney\u2019s Allianz stadium at Moore Park has promised to start legal action today unless the NSW government abandons the plan. Reserve Bank chiefs gather in Sydney for their monthly rate-setting meeting amid growing calls for a reduction in interest rates against a backdrop of rapidly falling house prices.

      "body": "<p>Now we know why the government was so keen to keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/government-letter-to-nissan-reveals-brexit-promise-to-carmarkers\">Greg Clark\u2019s letter to Nissan in 2016</a> under wraps. The document was embarrassing. The business secretary was making promises he couldn\u2019t underwrite and was offering cash he would struggle to reclaim if the Japanese car company didn\u2019t stick to its half of the supposed bargain at Sunderland.</p> <p>On both scores, the foolishness has been exposed. Clark\u2019s vow that Nissan\u2019s UK plants would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by Brexit was merely an expression of hope. Two months before the UK is supposed to leave the European Union, the minister is in no position to guarantee that a no-deal exit can be avoided or, if a deal is secured, say what trading terms with the EU will apply.</p> <p>As for the \u00a361m of grants, these were supposed to be \u201ccontingent\u201d on Nissan building its Qashqai and X-Trail models in its Sunderland plant but the threat looks empty. The X-Trail SUV will now be built in Japan but Nissan is free to reapply for the cash and can be confident of getting a thumbs-up. The government will not want to risk damage to supply chains around Sunderland.</p> <p>It would be wrong to read too many Brexit parables into this tale, of course. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/03/falling-diesel-sales-more-than-brexit-behind-nissans-x-trail-decision\">As has been widely noted</a>, the X-Trail decision was probably driven as much by the downturn in the European diesel market. But one can say this about the government\u2019s dealings with Nissan in 2016: ministers were desperate to say anything to secure a single day\u2019s headlines about \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in Britain. It was hot air.</p> <h2>Ryanair boardroom departures stuck on the tarmac</h2> <p>Any change in Ryanair\u2019s boardroom could be considered dramatic when you remember that Michael O\u2019Leary has been chief executive since 1994, chairman David Bonderman arrived in 1996 and senior director Kyran McLaughlin is in his 18th year as a director. When it finally arrived, however, after some prodding from shareholders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/04/ryanair-no-deal-brexit-michael-oleary-contract\">the shake-up</a> merely served as a reminder that Ryanair is a company that does things on its own terms and at its own pace.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary is staying for another five years, albeit in a rejigged corporate structure. Four divisional bosses, including a yet-to-be-appointed head of the main Ryanair airline, will report to O\u2019Leary, allowing him, in theory, to concentrate on big-picture tasks such as buying aircraft and pondering more takeovers to follow the acquisition of Laudamotion in Austria. What this means in practice, however, is anybody\u2019s guess. O\u2019Leary may be free to fiddle as much, or as little, as he wishes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rejig of the non-executives is happening at a leisurely pace. Last September\u2019s instruction from rebellious shareholders, 30% of whom voted against the re-election of Bonderman, seemed clear. It was time for the chairman to proceed to the departure gate immediately.</p> <p>Bonderman and McLaughlin are leaving \u2013 but not for another 18 months. That may be enough to get Ryanair through another tricky annual shareholder meeting but the problem, in the view of outsiders, was lack of boardroom accountability and a belligerent approach to dealing with newly recognised unions. A minor tinker doesn\u2019t really improve matters.</p> <h2>Ofgem could yet serve cold revenge</h2> <p>Cheung Kong Infrastructure, a Hong Kong-based fund with a large collection of infrastructure assets in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/07/ofgems-muscular-image-jolted-by-an-obstinate-no\">last appeared in this column a year ago</a>. CKI, controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, was the only hold-out against Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan\u2019s efforts to secure \u201cvoluntary contributions\u201d from energy network companies, the firms that manage the nation\u2019s electricity wires and gas supply pipes.</p> <p>Nolan argued that the network operators had enjoyed financial luck from the global trend towards lower interest rates, so handing a small portion of the winnings to customers via their bills would help to sustain \u201cpublic trust\u201d in regulation. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91393b8e-2142-11e8-8d6c-a1920d9e946f\">In a column in the FT</a>, he explained that \u00a3650m-worth of commitments had been secured from the industry but Northern Gas Networks and Wales &amp; West Utilities \u2013 both owned by CKI \u2013 had \u201cyet to step up\u201d.</p> <p>Well, they never did, Ofgem admits now. Nolan\u2019s exercise in naming and shaming yielded nothing. But what\u2019s this? CKI, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/li-ka-shing-plots-2bn-swoop-on-energy-grid-h88hf3swx\">reports the Sunday Times</a>, now fancies buying Electricity North West, a business valued at \u00a32bn that operates the electricity networks around Manchester and up to Cumbria.</p> <p>Ofgem has no formal powers to stop takeovers but it does have lobbying clout. This is a chance to serve some revenge coldly, and it should be taken. If CKI is prepared to ignore the regulator\u2019s pleas over assets it already owns in the UK, it does not deserve a crack at buying another large piece of kit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Now we know why the government was so keen to keep Greg Clark\u2019s letter to Nissan in 2016 under wraps. The document was embarrassing. The business secretary was making promises he couldn\u2019t underwrite and was offering cash he would struggle to reclaim if the Japanese car company didn\u2019t stick to its half of the supposed bargain at Sunderland. On both scores, the foolishness has been exposed. Clark\u2019s vow that Nissan\u2019s UK plants would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by Brexit was merely an expression of hope. Two months before the UK is supposed to leave the European Union, the minister is in no position to guarantee that a no-deal exit can be avoided or, if a deal is secured, say what trading terms with the EU will apply. As for the \u00a361m of grants, these were supposed to be \u201ccontingent\u201d on Nissan building its Qashqai and X-Trail models in its Sunderland plant but the threat looks empty. The X-Trail SUV will now be built in Japan but Nissan is free to reapply for the cash and can be confident of getting a thumbs-up. The government will not want to risk damage to supply chains around Sunderland. It would be wrong to read too many Brexit parables into this tale, of course. As has been widely noted, the X-Trail decision was probably driven as much by the downturn in the European diesel market. But one can say this about the government\u2019s dealings with Nissan in 2016: ministers were desperate to say anything to secure a single day\u2019s headlines about \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in Britain. It was hot air. Ryanair boardroom departures stuck on the tarmac Any change in Ryanair\u2019s boardroom could be considered dramatic when you remember that Michael O\u2019Leary has been chief executive since 1994, chairman David Bonderman arrived in 1996 and senior director Kyran McLaughlin is in his 18th year as a director. When it finally arrived, however, after some prodding from shareholders, the shake-up merely served as a reminder that Ryanair is a company that does things on its own terms and at its own pace. O\u2019Leary is staying for another five years, albeit in a rejigged corporate structure. Four divisional bosses, including a yet-to-be-appointed head of the main Ryanair airline, will report to O\u2019Leary, allowing him, in theory, to concentrate on big-picture tasks such as buying aircraft and pondering more takeovers to follow the acquisition of Laudamotion in Austria. What this means in practice, however, is anybody\u2019s guess. O\u2019Leary may be free to fiddle as much, or as little, as he wishes. Meanwhile, the rejig of the non-executives is happening at a leisurely pace. Last September\u2019s instruction from rebellious shareholders, 30% of whom voted against the re-election of Bonderman, seemed clear. It was time for the chairman to proceed to the departure gate immediately. Bonderman and McLaughlin are leaving \u2013 but not for another 18 months. That may be enough to get Ryanair through another tricky annual shareholder meeting but the problem, in the view of outsiders, was lack of boardroom accountability and a belligerent approach to dealing with newly recognised unions. A minor tinker doesn\u2019t really improve matters. Ofgem could yet serve cold revenge Cheung Kong Infrastructure, a Hong Kong-based fund with a large collection of infrastructure assets in the UK, last appeared in this column a year ago. CKI, controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, was the only hold-out against Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan\u2019s efforts to secure \u201cvoluntary contributions\u201d from energy network companies, the firms that manage the nation\u2019s electricity wires and gas supply pipes. Nolan argued that the network operators had enjoyed financial luck from the global trend towards lower interest rates, so handing a small portion of the winnings to customers via their bills would help to sustain \u201cpublic trust\u201d in regulation. In a column in the FT, he explained that \u00a3650m-worth of commitments had been secured from the industry but Northern Gas Networks and Wales &amp; West Utilities \u2013 both owned by CKI \u2013 had \u201cyet to step up\u201d. Well, they never did, Ofgem admits now. Nolan\u2019s exercise in naming and shaming yielded nothing. But what\u2019s this? CKI, reports the Sunday Times, now fancies buying Electricity North West, a business valued at \u00a32bn that operates the electricity networks around Manchester and up to Cumbria. Ofgem has no formal powers to stop takeovers but it does have lobbying clout. This is a chance to serve some revenge coldly, and it should be taken. If CKI is prepared to ignore the regulator\u2019s pleas over assets it already owns in the UK, it does not deserve a crack at buying another large piece of kit.",

Prosecutors for the Serious Fraud Office presented internal emails and phone calls to a jury at Southwark crown court on Monday, detailing discussions on how the bank might disclose Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani\u2019s planned stake in the bank via his British Virgin Islands-based investment vehicle, Challenger. The court heard Hamad was first involved in fundraising discussions with Barclays through his role as chairman of Qatar Holding, which would end up being a key investor in the bank\u2019s 2008 capital raising. But in a phone call played to the jury, the bank\u2019s former European financial institutions boss Richard Boath recalls Hamad telling the bank\u2019s executives that \u201che\u2019d like his family to have some shares in Barclays\u201d as well. In one email read in court, Boath wrote to colleagues, including the Barclays lawyer Judith Shepherd, detailing a meeting he had with the Qataris\u2019 head of legal, Ahmad al-Sayad. In that email, Boath said he was told that \u201cHE [His Excellency] wants to have a very low profile\u201d and \u201cwould prefer that HE\u2019s BVI-based investment vehicle be our fifth investor and sign its own subscription agreement\u201d. Boath in turn \u201creminded him that we would be required to disclose the identity of this vehicle\u201d. Sayad responded that Barclays \u201cshould find a way to finesse this in order to keep HE under the radar\u201d. In a separate email read to the jury on Monday, Boath said Sayad indicated he was \u201chappy\u201d with disclosure of the investment as long as there there \u201cwasn\u2019t evidence\u201d as to \u201cprecisely who owned the \u2026 vehicle\u201d. But Shepherd insisted in a call that there was a general obligation for fair disclosure \u2013 particularly given the sheik\u2019s head position at Qatar Holding. \u201cWe have to tell the truth, not only in circumstances where we think we wouldn\u2019t get found out, we have to tell the truth because that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d Boath said in response: \u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem.\u201d The SFO alleges that four former Barclays executives \u2013 Boath, John Varley, Roger Jenkins and Tom Kalaris \u2013 lied to the stock market and other investors about how \u00a3322m in fees were paid to Qatar in relation to emergency fundraising of more than \u00a311bn in 2008. Prosecutors say the executives put together two advisory services agreements in order to disguise Qatar\u2019s demand for larger commission payments. The SFO claims the agreements included sums to be received by Challenger. All four men have denied the charges. Prosecutors have not accused Qatar, Hamad or his investment vehicle, of wrongdoing. The trial, which is expected to last up to six months, continues.",

Whitehall-commissioned studies produced in March 2015 warned of potential fatalities unless officials addressed the danger of flames passing through concealed cavities. Officials kept the advice confidential. Experts believe that the same process in the cladding at Grenfell helped spread the June 2017 fire, which claimed 72 lives, including 18 children. Studies by fire experts at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) were blunt in their assessment that fire barriers installed in the wall cavities of some buildings were not performing effectively and that builders needed education on the dangers of getting things wrong. One of the studies presented to officials at the building regulations division at the then Department for Communities and Local Ggovernment said barriers intended to stop fires spreading were \u201coften found to be missing or incomplete or incorrectly positioned\u201d, which is what emerged later from investigations into the refurbishment of Grenfell on behalf of the public inquiry into the disaster.

The studies reflected industry-wide concern in 2015 that construction methods were posing new fire risks not just confined to the way Grenfell was reclad. They referred to 20 fires between 2003 and 2013 that involved inadequate, missing or badly fitted cavity barriers. In the 19 months since the fire, 437 residential buildings and publicly-owned buildings over 18 metres have been identified with Grenfell-style cladding systems that the government says do not meet building regulations and must be removed. The BRE experts urged the government to consider new building regulations guidance and new ways for building inspectors to check works were safe, but neither move was undertaken. Their reports were submitted in the middle of the Grenfell refurbishment, but were treated as \u201ccommercial in confidence\u201d and so were not made public. One study said that \u201cpoor workmanship with inappropriate materials are the main reasons for the inadequate protection of concealed spaces\u201d. It said: \u201cWhilst these concerns have not been disputed by manufacturers there are no drivers to encourage more effective solutions to be developed.\u201d It warned that \u201cinadequacies cannot be seen by the building users and will not be apparent during everyday use\u201d and \u201cwill only become apparent during a fire\u201d. Building inspectors working for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea approved the \u00a310m Grenfell refurbishment after making 16 site visits. Grenfell United said it now expects all the officials involved in the report to be questioned in the public inquiry. \u201cWe fully expect to see BRE and government officials explaining why dangers were known but action wasn\u2019t taken, despite years of warning,\u201d it said. The studies were produced as part of a plan to update building regulations, but government officials conceded this took longer than planned and remained ongoing four years later. \u201cOur technical review will address the issues raised in the reports and our overall plan for stronger, tougher rules on building safety will create a more rigorous system that delivers meaningful and lasting change,\u201d said a spokesman for the MHCLG. The emergence of the warnings will also raise questions about whether the London fire brigade and RBKC should have known more about the risks at Grenfell. The reports were overseen by a steering group of 23 organisations which included the Chief Fire Officers Association and LABC, which represents all local authority building control teams in England and Wales. Dany Cotton, the commissioner of the London Fire Brigade and a member of the National Fire Chiefs Council, repeatedly told the public inquiry in September that it would have been impossible to prepare her staff for the fire because the way the building behaved was so unexpected, saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t develop a training package for a space shuttle landing on the Shard.\u201d A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said compartmentation failure was just one line of enquiry being examined by the inquiry. \u201cWe have recently highlighted a lack of fire safety competence and expertise within the construction industry and have called for loopholes which allow technical fire safety elements to be designed without the involvement of a competent fire safety professional to be closed,\u201d they said. The BRE said it had communicated the findings of the reports to industry audiences before and after Grenfell. \u201cLife safety is our key priority,\u201d a spokesperson said.",

      "body": "<p>Changes made to turnstile arrangements for the 1989 FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough stadium, where 96 people lost their lives in a crush, increased the risk of overcrowding outside the ground, an expert engineer has said.</p> <p>The jury at Preston crown court heard that at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, seven turnstiles were made available for the 10,100 Liverpool supporters with standing tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace. At the previous year\u2019s semi-final, played by the same two clubs, 13 turnstiles were used for the 10,100 supporters with standing tickets and 4,465 people with tickets for the West Stand seats above.</p> <p>John Cutlack, a structural engineer with 40 years\u2019 experience of working on sports grounds, told the court that this change meant that 2,257 more people with standing tickets, a 30% increase, had to go through the seven turnstiles A to G than in 1988. The change meant that it would take approximately two hours for the 10,100 people to get through the turnstiles, compared to an hour and a half at the 1988 match, he said.</p> <p>Graham Mackrell, Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s club secretary and safety officer at the time of the 1989 semi-final, is charged with failing to agree with police the change to the turnstile arrangements, as required by law in the club\u2019s safety certificate. He faces two further criminal charges of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by allegedly failing to ensure the number of turnstiles were sufficient to prevent unduly large crowds building up, and failing to draw up contingency plans to cope if that did happen.</p> <p>David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent who commanded that day, is standing trial alongside Mackrell, charged with gross negligence manslaughter in relation to the deaths.</p> <p>When asked by Richard Matthews QC, the lead barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service, what the effect of the turnstile changes was in 1989, Cutlack replied: \u201cInevitably, if people arrive within the last hour of the game starting, there would have been more people outside the turnstiles trying to get in than would have been the case in 1988.\u201d</p> <p>The jury has already been told that a large crowd did build up at the \u201cbottleneck\u201d outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles before the 3pm kick-off. Ultimately the police ordered a wide exit gate, C, to be opened to relieve that overcrowding and allow a large number of people through. Cutlack calculated that 2,603 people came through gate C on the first two occasions that it was opened. Many of those people then proceeded down a tunnel that led to the two central \u201cpens\u201d of the Leppings Lane terrace, where the lethal crush took place.</p> <p>Cutlack told the court that his calculation of the terrace\u2019s overall safe capacity, taking into account its division into pens and the layout of crush barriers, was a total of 5,426 people. That was 1,774 fewer people than the safe capacity of 7,200 allowed and stated on the club\u2019s official safety certificate, which had not been amended since the terrace was divided into pens.</p> <p>Cutlack calculated that according to accepted 1989 standards the safe capacity of pen three, where the majority of the 96 victims were killed, was 678. At 3:03pm, after the opening of gate C, there were more than double that number \u2013 1,403, according to Cutlack\u2019s calculation. Pressure of people caused one of the metal crush barriers, 124a, to collapse, partly caused by the layout of barriers that meant there was an unbroken seven-metre \u201csurge path\u201d from the barriers above. Cutlack agreed with Matthews that, from his viewing of the footage of the disaster, \u201ca large number of the fatalities were in front of that [collapsed] barrier\u201d.</p> <p>Cutlack told the court that although the Home Office\u2019s \u201cGreen Guide\u201d to safety at sports grounds did not have legal force, it was the only guide to stadium safety and was viewed by local authorities in particular \u201cpretty much as the bible\u201d. Changes introduced to the guide in 1986, after 56 people died in a fire at Bradford City\u2019s Valley Parade stadium, included defining the role that club management played in ground safety. Cutlack said the purpose of that was to make sure that a football club understood that, while it could rely on advice from professionals, the \u201cultimate responsibility for safety sat with the holder of the safety certificate\u201d.</p> <p>Mackrell and Duckenfield have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

He faces two further criminal charges of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by allegedly failing to ensure the number of turnstiles were sufficient to prevent unduly large crowds building up, and failing to draw up contingency plans to cope if that did happen. David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police chief superintendent who commanded that day, is standing trial alongside Mackrell, charged with gross negligence manslaughter in relation to the deaths. When asked by Richard Matthews QC, the lead barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service, what the effect of the turnstile changes was in 1989, Cutlack replied: \u201cInevitably, if people arrive within the last hour of the game starting, there would have been more people outside the turnstiles trying to get in than would have been the case in 1988.\u201d The jury has already been told that a large crowd did build up at the \u201cbottleneck\u201d outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles before the 3pm kick-off.

Cutlack calculated that according to accepted 1989 standards the safe capacity of pen three, where the majority of the 96 victims were killed, was 678. At 3:03pm, after the opening of gate C, there were more than double that number \u2013 1,403, according to Cutlack\u2019s calculation. Pressure of people caused one of the metal crush barriers, 124a, to collapse, partly caused by the layout of barriers that meant there was an unbroken seven-metre \u201csurge path\u201d from the barriers above. Cutlack agreed with Matthews that, from his viewing of the footage of the disaster, \u201ca large number of the fatalities were in front of that [collapsed] barrier\u201d. Cutlack told the court that although the Home Office\u2019s \u201cGreen Guide\u201d to safety at sports grounds did not have legal force, it was the only guide to stadium safety and was viewed by local authorities in particular \u201cpretty much as the bible\u201d. Changes introduced to the guide in 1986, after 56 people died in a fire at Bradford City\u2019s Valley Parade stadium, included defining the role that club management played in ground safety. Cutlack said the purpose of that was to make sure that a football club understood that, while it could rely on advice from professionals, the \u201cultimate responsibility for safety sat with the holder of the safety certificate\u201d. Mackrell and Duckenfield have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>Two articles on the same day \u2013 one by Jonathan Freedland, one by Ian Jack \u2013 provide usefully related perspectives. One is of the battle for the votes of MPs from England\u2019s post-industrial regions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/01/theresa-may-bribes-brexit-pain-mining-towns\" title=\"\">The mining town MPs should not be tempted by May</a>, 2 February), the other on the centuries-long background to the decline of these regions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/02/north-south-division-brexit-britain-delusion\" title=\"\">From north to south, the seeds of division date back centuries</a>).</p> <p>Mrs May is offering inducements to Labour MPs representing former mining communities in the hope of securing their Brexit support. While any such offers should be grabbed while they\u2019re going, they are not likely to go anywhere near to addressing decades-long neglect, or be maintained for the decades probably needed to sustain change.</p> <p>It would be illuminating to have an EU perspective. Ewan McGaughey reports that Germany spends around 1.3% of GDP on forms of state aid, compared with the UK\u2019s equivalent 0.5% (<a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/state-aid-rules-brexit/\" title=\"\">LSE British Politics and Policy</a>, 12 December). What proportion of this aid goes to industrially declining regions? How does the UK\u2019s regional investment compare with Germany\u2019s?</p> <p>Freedland is absolutely right when he says that \u201cthe remain camp should have been first and loudest\u201d in promising more regional support. However late in the day, remainers must forcibly proclaim the European argument for regional state aid before any final Brexit decision is made.<br><strong>June Greenwell</strong><br><em>Silverdale, Lancashire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland quotes Professor Rob Ford, who effectively debunks the notion that Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies will lose their seats if they don\u2019t appease leave voters. Despite the critical state the country is in, MPs continue to put parochial party interest before those of the country. Which is what got us into this mess in the first place. Parliament has failed in its attempts to wrest back control of the Brexit process from the doomed, partisan approach of the Conservative government.</p> <p>With 29 March looming and the inevitability of social upheaval, why wait? We need to take to the streets every day in mass protest, demonstrating the civil responsibility that our leaders have failed to do, in a final attempt to force them to get real: to postpone the implementation of article 50 and set up a people\u2019s assembly, the outcome of which will inform a subsequent referendum debate.<br><strong>Steve Wells</strong><br><em>Claygate, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/labour-not-responsible-brexit-tories\" title=\"\">It\u2019s absurd to blame Labour for the Tories\u2019 Brexit mess</a>, 31 January) is right. Unfortunately, Labour tarred themselves with the same brush in supporting Brexit in their manifesto.</p> <p>That is the real complaint against Labour, because it highlights the fact that there has been a vacuum in the pro-Europe camp for a leadership that could have made the case over the last two years for remaining in the EU.</p> <p>Such a leader would be pointing out the advantages of the EU at every moment, spearheading a drive to gather support and electrifying the opposition to bring a powerful counter-force to the Tories.</p> <p>Labour may not have the numbers, as Jones says, to make a difference, but the narrowness of the debate, much like the referendum, suggests that a well-managed campaign for staying in the EU might have changed the outlook as the leave promises evaporated.</p> <p>So while we can\u2019t blame Labour for causing the fiasco, it must take its share in the failure to provide a realistic and safe alternative \u2013 which right now is to stop Brexit.<br><strong>John Ellis</strong><br><em>Tavistock, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones says of a second referendum, \u201cthe numbers are not only not there for another vote, they are not even close\u201d. I have had the privilege of campaigning with Owen closely on a number of issues down the years. I cannot think of a single occasion when we decided to drop our campaign in advance because we calculated that there was no parliamentary majority for it.</p> <p>Why is Brexit different? The situation has changed rapidly since the 2017 general election. At this stage in the Brexit process it has become clear that no pragmatic exit that protects jobs and growth will satisfy the fanatical demands.</p> <p>Labour members understand this situation. They are desperate to elect a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn to carry through a radical programme. But they are also well aware Brexit puts that agenda at risk.</p> <p>At conference last year they made their position crystal clear. Utilising the limited democratic mechanisms that exist in the party, they won a commitment to campaigning for a public vote if they could not get a general election. The motion even warned the Tories \u201cthey should not be afraid to put that deal to the public\u201d if they believed it was a good deal for Britain.</p> <p>There are now reports of members leaving the party. Although the numbers leaving have been disputed, I have seen for myself that despondency has set in among parts of the membership and our voters. I urge all members to stay, but they need to be listened to.</p> <p>Owen understands more than anyone the power of hope and enthusiasm in politics. No one is going to get up at 6am to head to a marginal constituency to campaign for a \u201cpermanent customs union\u201d. Our members are looking for vision and narrative about a better world.</p> <p>With Brexit in crisis, Labour needs to present a socialist alternative. Committing to a new referendum where the British public get a chance to think again is just one part of this picture. But to renege on what the members have demanded would imperil the spirit and vitality of the Corbyn project. Surely, the party leadership must understand this? <br><strong>Luke Cooper </strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022 For too long, the focus of Mrs May and Mr Corbyn has been inwards to keep their respective parties from splintering, putting the short-term interest of party over country. Owen Jones does not admit to Corbyn\u2019s failure.</p> <p>In his attempt to disguise the failure of Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour to provide leadership on Brexit, Jones claims equivalence where there is none. Yvette Cooper pledged in 2017 not to \u201cblock Brexit\u201d simply for the sake of retaining the status quo. There is no breach of trust with her leave-voting constituents to stop a no-deal Brexit that could do immense harm to her own constituents. There is no moral equivalence between her stand and that of someone like Boris Johnson, who promised a painless Brexit and who now refuses to ask the electorate if they had in mind the terms of a Brexit which do not deliver what he promised, but which he now supports. There is no breach of trust with the electorate if the Labour leadership persuades Labour MPs to vote for a second referendum on the Brexit terms that are now emerging as acceptable to the government and the EU.<br><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br><em>Bangor, Gwynedd</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your list of 14 Labour MPs who supported the Conservatives on crucial votes on Wednesday (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/labour-mps-rebel-vote-down-yvette-cooper-no-deal-amendment\" title=\"\">Labour rebels vote against attempt to extend article 50</a>, 30 January) shows that most represent economically deprived constituencies.</p> <p>The leave campaign persuaded voters in these constituencies, falsely, that they should blame the EU and European immigrants for the problems they face, rather than neglect by successive British governments over too many years. A no-deal Brexit, likely to be followed by disruption of imports and emergency cuts in public investment and spending, will make their situation worse. Responsible MPs should look to their voters\u2019 long-term needs, not cower before the populist anger generated by a dishonest referendum campaign, led by rightwing ideologues.<br><strong>William Wallace</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 Few maintain that any form of Brexit will benefit our country, but we should be clear that women will suffer most: a <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Economic-Impact-of-Brexit-on-women-briefing-FINAL-1.pdf\" title=\"\">Fawcett Society and Women\u2019s Budget Group report</a> shows that women will be hit hardest by an economic downturn.</p> <p>The wider Brexit debate in the press is dominated by men (a 60-40 split on major news programmes) but we expect more from our party. A YouGov poll showed that 87% of Labour women back a second vote. At the 2018 Labour conference, the agreed position on a second referendum was that if the party could not get a general election, \u201call options remain on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. As this is policy, the leader and shadow cabinet should be at the forefront on this issue.</p> <p>Women are feeling increasingly alienated from the movement that could save the country from a disastrous Brexit. Labour has a responsibility to protect the rights and standard of living of all women living in the UK. We call on Jeremy Corbyn to be true to his word, to represent the women of the party, and let this democratic movement be led by its members. The only option now is to call for a referendum on Theresa May\u2019s deal and campaign in that referendum to remain in and reform the EU.</p> <p><strong>Councillor</strong> <strong>Octavia Holland</strong> <em>London borough of Lewisham,</em> <strong>Sarah Veale</strong> <em>Chair, Lewisham East constituency Labour party,</em> <strong>Fiona O\u2019Farrell</strong> <em>Vice-chair, Richmond Park CLP,</em> <strong>Gayle Roberts</strong> <em>Harrogate and Knaresborough CLP </em><strong>and 22 others</strong> <strong>Councillor</strong> <strong>Louise Krupski</strong> <em>London borough of Lewisham,</em> <strong>Liz McShane</strong>, Tottenham CLP, <strong>Councillor</strong> <strong>Amanda De Ryk</strong> <em>London borough of Lewisham,</em> <strong>Sarah Hayward</strong> <em>Former leader, London borough of Camden, </em><strong>Lizzie Worth</strong> <em>Streatham CLP; </em><strong>Anashua Davies</strong> <em>Secretary, Old Bexley and Sidcup CLP, </em><strong><em>C</em>ouncillor</strong> <strong>Eva Stamirowski</strong> <em>London borough of Lewisham, </em><strong>Jessica Leschnikoff</strong> <em>Maidstone and The Weald CLP,</em> <strong>Rosamund Cox</strong> <em>Women\u2019s officer, Lewisham East CLP,</em> <strong>Councillor</strong> <strong>Sophie Davies</strong> <em>London borough of Lewi</em>sham, <strong>Deborah Genders</strong> <em>Vice-chair, Richmond Park CLP</em><em>,</em> <strong>Laura Vogel</strong> <em>Women\u2019s officer, Bromley and Chislehurst CLP,</em> <strong>Eileen Means </strong><em>Council candidate, Bristol West CLP,</em> <strong>Councillor</strong> <strong>Peymana Assad</strong> <em>London borough of Harrow, </em><strong>Su McConnel</strong> <em>Chair, Monmouth CLP, </em><strong>Councillor</strong><strong> Sophie McGeevor</strong> <em>London borough of Lewisham, </em><strong>Catherine Fookes</strong> <em>W</em><em>elsh Assembly member candidate, Monmouth CLP,</em> <strong>Councillor Susan Wise</strong> <em>London Borough of Lewisham,</em> <strong>Leonora Headley</strong> <em>Witham CLP, </em><strong>Pauline Dall </strong><em>Vice-chair</em><em>, Lewisham East CLP,</em> <strong>Amanda Peters</strong> <em>Shipley CLP,</em> <strong>Laura Davies</strong> <em>Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire CLP</em><strong> </strong> </p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

However late in the day, remainers must forcibly proclaim the European argument for regional state aid before any final Brexit decision is made. June Greenwell Silverdale, Lancashire \u2022 Jonathan Freedland quotes Professor Rob Ford, who effectively debunks the notion that Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies will lose their seats if they don\u2019t appease leave voters. Despite the critical state the country is in, MPs continue to put parochial party interest before those of the country. Which is what got us into this mess in the first place. Parliament has failed in its attempts to wrest back control of the Brexit process from the doomed, partisan approach of the Conservative government. With 29 March looming and the inevitability of social upheaval, why wait? We need to take to the streets every day in mass protest, demonstrating the civil responsibility that our leaders have failed to do, in a final attempt to force them to get real: to postpone the implementation of article 50 and set up a people\u2019s assembly, the outcome of which will inform a subsequent referendum debate. Steve Wells Claygate, Surrey \u2022 Owen Jones (It\u2019s absurd to blame Labour for the Tories\u2019 Brexit mess, 31 January) is right. Unfortunately, Labour tarred themselves with the same brush in supporting Brexit in their manifesto. That is the real complaint against Labour, because it highlights the fact that there has been a vacuum in the pro-Europe camp for a leadership that could have made the case over the last two years for remaining in the EU. Such a leader would be pointing out the advantages of the EU at every moment, spearheading a drive to gather support and electrifying the opposition to bring a powerful counter-force to the Tories. Labour may not have the numbers, as Jones says, to make a difference, but the narrowness of the debate, much like the referendum, suggests that a well-managed campaign for staying in the EU might have changed the outlook as the leave promises evaporated. So while we can\u2019t blame Labour for causing the fiasco, it must take its share in the failure to provide a realistic and safe alternative \u2013 which right now is to stop Brexit. John Ellis Tavistock, Devon \u2022 Owen Jones says of a second referendum, \u201cthe numbers are not only not there for another vote, they are not even close\u201d. I have had the privilege of campaigning with Owen closely on a number of issues down the years. I cannot think of a single occasion when we decided to drop our campaign in advance because we calculated that there was no parliamentary majority for it. Why is Brexit different? The situation has changed rapidly since the 2017 general election. At this stage in the Brexit process it has become clear that no pragmatic exit that protects jobs and growth will satisfy the fanatical demands. Labour members understand this situation. They are desperate to elect a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn to carry through a radical programme. But they are also well aware Brexit puts that agenda at risk. At conference last year they made their position crystal clear. Utilising the limited democratic mechanisms that exist in the party, they won a commitment to campaigning for a public vote if they could not get a general election. The motion even warned the Tories \u201cthey should not be afraid to put that deal to the public\u201d if they believed it was a good deal for Britain. There are now reports of members leaving the party. Although the numbers leaving have been disputed, I have seen for myself that despondency has set in among parts of the membership and our voters. I urge all members to stay, but they need to be listened to. Owen understands more than anyone the power of hope and enthusiasm in politics. No one is going to get up at 6am to head to a marginal constituency to campaign for a \u201cpermanent customs union\u201d. Our members are looking for vision and narrative about a better world. With Brexit in crisis, Labour needs to present a socialist alternative. Committing to a new referendum where the British public get a chance to think again is just one part of this picture. But to renege on what the members have demanded would imperil the spirit and vitality of the Corbyn project. Surely, the party leadership must understand this? Luke Cooper London \u2022 For too long, the focus of Mrs May and Mr Corbyn has been inwards to keep their respective parties from splintering, putting the short-term interest of party over country. Owen Jones does not admit to Corbyn\u2019s failure. In his attempt to disguise the failure of Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour to provide leadership on Brexit, Jones claims equivalence where there is none. Yvette Cooper pledged in 2017 not to \u201cblock Brexit\u201d simply for the sake of retaining the status quo. There is no breach of trust with her leave-voting constituents to stop a no-deal Brexit that could do immense harm to her own constituents. There is no moral equivalence between her stand and that of someone like Boris Johnson, who promised a painless Brexit and who now refuses to ask the electorate if they had in mind the terms of a Brexit which do not deliver what he promised, but which he now supports. There is no breach of trust with the electorate if the Labour leadership persuades Labour MPs to vote for a second referendum on the Brexit terms that are now emerging as acceptable to the government and the EU. SP Chakravarty Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 Your list of 14 Labour MPs who supported the Conservatives on crucial votes on Wednesday (Labour rebels vote against attempt to extend article 50, 30 January) shows that most represent economically deprived constituencies. The leave campaign persuaded voters in these constituencies, falsely, that they should blame the EU and European immigrants for the problems they face, rather than neglect by successive British governments over too many years. A no-deal Brexit, likely to be followed by disruption of imports and emergency cuts in public investment and spending, will make their situation worse. Responsible MPs should look to their voters\u2019 long-term needs, not cower before the populist anger generated by a dishonest referendum campaign, led by rightwing ideologues. William Wallace Liberal Democrat, House of Lords \u2022 Few maintain that any form of Brexit will benefit our country, but we should be clear that women will suffer most: a Fawcett Society and Women\u2019s Budget Group report shows that women will be hit hardest by an economic downturn. The wider Brexit debate in the press is dominated by men (a 60-40 split on major news programmes) but we expect more from our party. A YouGov poll showed that 87% of Labour women back a second vote. At the 2018 Labour conference, the agreed position on a second referendum was that if the party could not get a general election, \u201call options remain on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. As this is policy, the leader and shadow cabinet should be at the forefront on this issue. Women are feeling increasingly alienated from the movement that could save the country from a disastrous Brexit. Labour has a responsibility to protect the rights and standard of living of all women living in the UK. We call on Jeremy Corbyn to be true to his word, to represent the women of the party, and let this democratic movement be led by its members. The only option now is to call for a referendum on Theresa May\u2019s deal and campaign in that referendum to remain in and reform the EU.

David Hopkins Director of community, Coin Street Community Builders \u2022 If a future historian writes about the Cameron-Clegg austerity coalition of 2010-15, they could do no better than to quote this sentence from Roger Pepworth\u2019s eloquent letter (Letters, 4 February) as its epitaph: \u201cI only know that the dreams that Sharron, a lovely child, had until her death, have perished in the wreckage of an austerity programme that has literally killed her and her like.\u201d Cameron, Clegg and Osborne have of course moved on and are, as the saying goes, \u201cdoing alright\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Less than four months after what was supposed to be a new beginning for fracking in England, when Cuadrilla resumed operations at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, it appears increasingly unlikely that there is a future for this industry in the UK at all. Minor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/01/minor-earthquakes-emerge-uk-major-fracking-threat-lancashire\" title=\"\">earthquakes rapidly halted fracking</a> at Preston New Road, and led to a row about whether the legal limit for underground seismic activity, set at 0.5-magnitude after earthquakes in 2011, is unrealistically low. Now Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemicals firm Ineos and the UK\u2019s richest man, has launched his own attack both on the 0.5 limit and on the planning system that has seen all three of Ineos\u2019s applications to frack rejected by local authorities \u2013 although two were later granted on appeal. The government\u2019s refusal to change the law in the industry\u2019s favour, he said, means that it is \u201cshutting down shale by the backdoor\u201d.</p> <p>Having watched the success of the shale gas industry in the US since 2000, Mr Ratcliffe and politicians including former chancellor George Osborne decided that fracking \u2013 which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals 2km underground at high pressure \u2013 should become a UK industry too. Senior Conservatives including the current energy minister, Claire Perry, agreed. They were wrong. The UK is unsuited to fracking, for political and geological reasons that have become clearer over the past few years, and all the money (Ineos alone has spent \u00a3150m) and effort expended on trying to foist a new and dirty industry on communities who do not want it has been thrown away.</p> <p>Fracking was always a bad idea, because of climate change. Cutting carbon emissions means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. To develop a new gas industry is to do the opposite, and arguments that shale gas is needed to \u201cbridge\u201d a gap in energy supply when existing nuclear power stations are decommissioned, and before they are replaced, are largely spurious. The idea that the UK\u2019s energy security is threatened is similarly unfounded. Unlike eastern European countries that rely on gas from Russia, our imported gas comes mostly from Norway. The government\u2019s most recent assessment concluded that supplies are resilient. Dramatic recent falls in the cost of renewables have greatly strengthened the case against fracking, as well as providing one of the few glimmers of hope in a darkening global climate picture.</p> <p>What happened, as the campaign against fracking gathered strength, is that the politics of energy and climate harmonised with local concerns around environment and democracy. In Lancashire, Derbyshire, West Sussex and South Yorkshire, activists mobilised because they didn\u2019t want the traffic, disruption, minor earthquakes and pollution they feared fracking would bring, and didn\u2019t regard the promised economic boost as sufficient compensation. Local politicians sided with them. A parallel situation played out in Scotland, where <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-scotland-ineos/scottish-government-wins-fracking-case-against-energy-giant-ineos-idUKKBN1JF1H8\" title=\"\">Ineos lost a case</a> it brought against the Holyrood government last year. And while it remains possible that the UK government will try to alter the planning system so that fracking is allowed under \u201cpermitted development\u201d rights, locking councils out of the process, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/two-directors-quit-fracking-firm-third-energy-amid-tory-rebellion-claims\" title=\"\">opposition of around 20 Conservative MPs</a> makes is unlikely that any such law could pass.</p> <p>Polls have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/16/uk-government-drops-fracking-question-from-public-attitude-tracker\" title=\"\">consistently shown</a> that fracking is unpopular. When three anti-fracking activists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/court-quashes-excessive-sentences-of-fracking-protesters\" title=\"\">freed from jail last year</a> they were greeted with cheers. The public were ahead of the government in realising that giving up on this industry makes sense.</p>",

Minor earthquakes rapidly halted fracking at Preston New Road, and led to a row about whether the legal limit for underground seismic activity, set at 0.5-magnitude after earthquakes in 2011, is unrealistically low. Now Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemicals firm Ineos and the UK\u2019s richest man, has launched his own attack both on the 0.5 limit and on the planning system that has seen all three of Ineos\u2019s applications to frack rejected by local authorities \u2013 although two were later granted on appeal. The government\u2019s refusal to change the law in the industry\u2019s favour, he said, means that it is \u201cshutting down shale by the backdoor\u201d. Having watched the success of the shale gas industry in the US since 2000, Mr Ratcliffe and politicians including former chancellor George Osborne decided that fracking \u2013 which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals 2km underground at high pressure \u2013 should become a UK industry too. Senior Conservatives including the current energy minister, Claire Perry, agreed. They were wrong. The UK is unsuited to fracking, for political and geological reasons that have become clearer over the past few years, and all the money (Ineos alone has spent \u00a3150m) and effort expended on trying to foist a new and dirty industry on communities who do not want it has been thrown away. Fracking was always a bad idea, because of climate change. Cutting carbon emissions means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. To develop a new gas industry is to do the opposite, and arguments that shale gas is needed to \u201cbridge\u201d a gap in energy supply when existing nuclear power stations are decommissioned, and before they are replaced, are largely spurious. The idea that the UK\u2019s energy security is threatened is similarly unfounded. Unlike eastern European countries that rely on gas from Russia, our imported gas comes mostly from Norway. The government\u2019s most recent assessment concluded that supplies are resilient. Dramatic recent falls in the cost of renewables have greatly strengthened the case against fracking, as well as providing one of the few glimmers of hope in a darkening global climate picture. What happened, as the campaign against fracking gathered strength, is that the politics of energy and climate harmonised with local concerns around environment and democracy. In Lancashire, Derbyshire, West Sussex and South Yorkshire, activists mobilised because they didn\u2019t want the traffic, disruption, minor earthquakes and pollution they feared fracking would bring, and didn\u2019t regard the promised economic boost as sufficient compensation. Local politicians sided with them. A parallel situation played out in Scotland, where Ineos lost a case it brought against the Holyrood government last year. And while it remains possible that the UK government will try to alter the planning system so that fracking is allowed under \u201cpermitted development\u201d rights, locking councils out of the process, the opposition of around 20 Conservative MPs makes is unlikely that any such law could pass. Polls have consistently shown that fracking is unpopular. When three anti-fracking activists were freed from jail last year they were greeted with cheers. The public were ahead of the government in realising that giving up on this industry makes sense.",

But in his article, explaining his support for the so-called Malthouse compromise, Rees-Mogg said that Brexiters had to be willing to give a little because otherwise there was a risk of remainers blocking Brexit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In my view, an extra 33 months of vassalage after 46 years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a no deal departure \u2014 and the reason is simple.</p> <p>Regardless of the folly of project fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.</p> <p>This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by 23 votes.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Rees-Mogg is now saying he would prefer to avoid a no-deal Brexit, because he thinks the prospect of that could lead to MPs voting to delay Brexit. That is quite a shift. Only two weeks ago, in his Bruges Group speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/23/brexit-latest-news-developments-pmqs-may-corbyn-wont-be-able-to-use-vote-next-week-to-stop-no-deal-liam-fox-claims-politics-live?page=with:block-5c487636e4b024f0efeaccd2#block-5c487636e4b024f0efeaccd2\">he suggested he was quite happy with the prospect of no deal.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c580b78e4b0d86c564387e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T10:25:04.954Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rees-Mogg plays down claims business needs certainty, saying 'business is all about uncertainty'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some lines from <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>\u2019s LBC phone-on.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, dismissed claims that the Nissan decision to abandon plans to produce its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factory reflected badly on Brexit.</strong> He told the programme:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as one can tell, Brexit is far from being the primary reason Nissan has made this decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rees-Mogg said that various reasons specific to the car industry explained the decision, including falling demand for diesel. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So Brexit is one of those what I might call BBC answers; all bad news is because of Brexit, and all good news is in spite of Brexit. All Nissan has said is that the uncertainty around Brexit and the future hasn\u2019t helped. That is not the main reason why they\u2019ve done this.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He played down claims that businesses need certainty - a key argument made at the moment by business leaders and MPs arguing for a softer Brexit.</strong> When it was put to him that uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future after Brexit was bad for business, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is, business is all about uncertainty ...</p> <p>There is no certainty in business. The whole art of business is trying to manage uncertainty. Investment decisions aren\u2019t made for certain facts. You can\u2019t be certain that anyone will buy your car when you have built it. All business is based on uncertainty, and managing uncertainty. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was opposed to using investment in leave-voting, Labour-supporting deprived areas as a possible means of getting Labour MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. </strong>The government has been talking to Labour MPs about possible investment in their communities, although it has dismissed claims that these payments would amount to bribes. Asked about the tactic, Rees-Mogg said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think pork barrel politics has a place in the UK ... I was a bit surprised by these stories. It is not how British government normally works ...</p> <p>I think to start giving lots of money in individual constituencies, as happens in the United States - it is commonplace in the United States; a congressman who didn\u2019t get some pork for his constituency would not be thought of as a very good congressman - is something we are best without in this country. </p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that the government has bought the support of the DUP with a commitment to spend \u00a31bn in Northern Ireland, Rees-Mogg said that \u201cthe DUP money was actually slightly less than it had got in the previous five years\u201d.</p> <p>In this context, it is worth pointing that government plans to increase spending in deprived areas after Brexit seem to be little more than a restatement of what was in <a href=\"https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/conservative-party-manifestos/Forward+Together+-+Our+Plan+for+a+Stronger+Britain+and+a+More+Prosperous....pdf\">the Conservative party\u2019s 2017 manifesto (pdf).</a> It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will use the structural fund money that comes back to the UK following Brexit to create a United Kingdom shared prosperity fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations.

It is the alternative arrangements working group, announced by Downing Street last night. Number 10 has named five Conservatives who will take part - the hardline Brexiters Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh and Owen Paterson, and the compromise-minded remainers Damian Green and Nicky Morgan - who will hold meetings today, tomorrow and Wednesday with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, at the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>The group will focus on trying to establish the viability of plans to use technology as means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, as an alternative to the backstop. It will develop ideas set out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/the-malthouse-compromise-everything-you-need-to-know-brexit-vote\">the so-called Malthouse compromise. </a>That in turn was based on ideas for the border set out in a paper published in September last year by the European Research Group, <a href=\"http://2mbg6fgb1kl380gtk22pbxgw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Border-between-Northern-Ireland-and-the-Republic-of-Ireland-3.pdf\">The Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland post-Brexit (pdf).</a></p> <p>There are two problems with this.</p> <p>First, we\u2019ve have been here before.

The cabinet working group failed to come up with ideas that would impress the EU.</p> <p>Second, the EU has restated its belief that new technology won\u2019t solve the problem.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said that the backstop is \u201cthe only operational solution\u201d to the Irish border issue. (See 5.50pm.) Other senior EU officials have also played down the prospect of Theresa May being offered significant changes to the backstop plan. Barnier\u2019s deputy, Sabine Weyand, said accepting an alternative to the backstop would be a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d (see 9.20am) and Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general, said that even if the EU were to offer the UK new assurances on the backstop, he did not think that would be enough to persuade MPs to back the deal. (See 1.26pm.) Greg Clark, the business secretary, has told MPs that Nissan will have to reapply for financial help it was promised in return for building Qashqai and X-Trail models at its Sunderland plant. He published correspondence saying the firm had been promised \u00a361m on that basis. But, in an oral statement to MPs, following Nissan\u2019s announcement that the X-Trail will not be built at the factory, he said: So, given yesterday\u2019s announcement, if the company seeks to participate in these industry funding schemes, as I hope and expect that it will, the company will submit new applications in the standard way and undergo a process of independent assessment. In response to a question from the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Clark revealed that just \u00a32.6m of the \u00a361m promised has already been paid. European countries including the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark have recognised Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela in a coordinated move made after a deadline for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to call presidential elections expired. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. And this is from Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, after his meeting with the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, says the decision not to build the X-Trail in Sunderland is a disappointment. She says the Clark letter to Nissan promised that the car industry would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by Brexit. But the company clearly does not believe those assurances any more, she says. She challenges Clark to rule out a no-deal Brexit. She says the Nissan announcement came just days after the EU\u2019s trade deal with Japan came into force. She says over time this will lead to tariffs on cars from Japan falling to zero. She suggests that \u201cmanaged decline\u201d is now the government\u2019s plan for the car industry. Clark says he is disappointed that the new jobs associated with the X-Trail will not come to Sunderland. But he is pleased the rest of the investment is going ahead. Greg Clark, the business secretary, is making his Nissan statement now. He says in July 2016 Nissan was about to announce that the Qashquai would be built elsewhere in Europe. He says, knowing what this would do to the Sunderland plant\u2019s long-term future, the government set out to persuade the company to change its mind. First, it stressed the measures in place to support the car in industry generally. The government eventually offered \u00a361m to help. Second, the government said it would help with the supply chain. Third, it offered to help with R&amp;D. In particularly, it is promoting self-drive cars. And, fourth, it said it would prioritise the needs to the automative industry in the Brexit talks. Clark says these offers were persuasive. Towards the end of the process Nissan said it would start producing the X-Trail at the plant too. He says that at the end of last week Nissan said that, while the rest of its planned investment would go ahead, the X-Trail would not be built there. That meant 714 extra jobs that could have been created have been lost. This is from Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister. The BBC\u2019s business editor, Simon Jack, has more evidence of the government making comments in 2016 about Nissan not being paid for its Sunderland investment which are hard to square with what we know now. (See 4.11pm.) This is from Matthew O\u2019Toole, who used to work on communications in Downing Street in the David Cameron era, on the David Trimble story. (See 4.38pm.) O\u2019Toole is right. In an essay in Britain and Public Opinion 2019 (pdf), published by the UK in a Changing Europe project last month, Jamie Pow points out that even DUP supporters in Northern Ireland don\u2019t support DUP policy on Brexit. A majority of them want a soft Brexit, even though the DUP has made it clear that it would be happy to see the UK leave both the single market and the customs union (ie, a hard Brexit, for the purposes of this survey). Turning back to Marin Selmayr for a moment, Mina Andreeva, the European commission\u2019s deputy chief spokeswoman has posted a tweet that seems intended to mollify Brexiters upset by the tone of his intervention earlier. She was responding to Fraser Nelson, editor of the pro-Brexit Spectator. Lord Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist party leader who won a Nobel peace prize for his role in the Good Friday agreement, has announced that he and others \u201care planning to take the government to court over the protocol on Northern Ireland - which includes the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d - as it breaches the terms of the Good Friday agreement.\u201d The announcement came in a three sentence press statement from Global Britain, a pro-Brexit thinktank. It said: The Nobel peace prize winner and architect of the Good Friday agreement plans to initiate judicial review proceedings to ensure that the protocol is removed from the withdrawal agreement. Lord Trimble says that alternative arrangements - as outlined in A Better Deal And A Better Future - should be put in place instead. A Better Deal and a Better Future is an alternative Brexit plan published last month by Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group. Global Britain has not given any more detail about Trimble\u2019s legal argument, and it is highly possible that this will turn out to be one of those legal challenges that will die an early death on its first encounter with a judge. UPDATE: It is also worth pointing out that Global Britain is one of the most doctrinaire of the pro-Brexit thinktanks. One of its founders was Lord Pearson of Rannoch, who was the Ukip leader who admitted during the 2010 election campaign that he had not read the party\u2019s manifesto. ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen sums up the Trimble legal argument quite well here. We now know that the government offered up to \u00a380m to Nissan in 2016 in the form of support, in return for a decision to build the Qashqhai and X-Trail models at Sunderland. Subsequently that got revised down to \u00a361m. (See 3.45pm.) But at the time Downing Street denied offering the company a special deal. Here is an extract from the story my colleague Rowena Mason wrote in October 2016. No 10 is refusing to disclose what state support has been given to Nissan to convince the car manufacturer to boost production at its Sunderland plant despite its worries about Brexit. Downing Street insisted there was no \u201csweetheart deal\u201d with the Japanese company, but acknowledged that Theresa May had given some assurances to the wider industry that it would be protected from the impact of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU ... No 10 refused to say what has been promised to the car industry or to say whether any public money was involved, although it signalled that it had not made any declaration to the EU about a proposal to offer state aid. \u201cThe assurances are that we will get the best possible deal from leaving the EU,\u201d May\u2019s deputy official spokesman said. \u201cThere was no special deal for Nissan.\u201d Thanks to ID499187 in the comments for prompting this line of enquiry. No doubt Greg Clark, the business secretary, will be pressed on this when he makes his Commons statement, probably at around 5pm. In 2016 the Commons Treasury committee, which was then chaired by the Conservative Andrew Tyrie, repeatedly tried to find out from the government whether the Greg Clark letter to Nissan, which at that point was confidential, contained any financial promises. The government repeatedly refused to say. (At the time there was speculation that there might have been a promise to ensure Nissan would not lose out if the UK left the customs union, leading to a loss in exports.) In a letter to Clark, Nicky Morgan, the current chair of the committee, has asked why the \u00a361m eventually offered to Nissan (see 3.45pm) was not disclosed at the time. She also calls for the publication of the full text of the letter, although that request is now redundant because the business department were publishing the text around the time Morgan was releasing her letter. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has released his letter to Nissan (pdf) partly in response to a long-standing request from the Commons business committee. He has published it today alongside a letter to Rachel Reeves, the committee chair. In his letter to Nissan in October 2016 Clark promised the company \u201ca package of support in areas such as skills, R&amp;D and innovation\u201d worth up to \u00a380m. That was contingent on the Qashqai and the X-Trail being built at Sunderland. But in his letter to Reeves Clark says that the company was actually offered \u00a361m in June 2018. The original link to the Greg Clark Nissan letter that I posted at 3.15pm was faulty, but I have now fixed it. Here is the full quote from Angela Merkel on Brexit today. (See 1.38pm.) She was speaking on a visit to Tokyo. We want to do everything to ensure that a no deal doesn\u2019t happen, because that would only heighten insecurity. We\u2019re happy that a majority in the British parliament feels the same. Now we have to figure out what to do. We\u2019re saying that the exit treaty took a long time to negotiate, so we don\u2019t want to re-open the exit treaty. That\u2019s not on the agenda. But we\u2019re still discussing the future mechanism. And in the future relationship, you can also address issues that are still being discussed - for example with the management of the border between Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK, and the Republic of Ireland and by extension the European Union. There are certainly possibilities to resolve this point - that is, guaranteeing the integrity of the single market, the unity of the single market, even if Northern Ireland isn\u2019t part of that, and on the other hand the desire to have as far as possible no controls at the Irish border. You have to be creative and listen to each other - such discussions can and must take place. We can now use the time to reach an agreement where beforehand agreement wasn\u2019t possible, if there\u2019s enough good will. But we have to hear from the UK - this is the decisive point - how they view this. Merkel says a Brexit deal can be agreed if people are \u201ccreative\u201d and if \u201cthere\u2019s enough good will\u201d. But she says the EU has to hear what the UK wants. She says the withdrawal treaty will not be re-opened. The business department has now published the full text (pdf) of the letter that Greg Clark, the business secretary, sent to Nissan in 2016 promising financial support in return for the X-Trail being built at Sunderland. Here is Jeremy Cliffe, the Economist\u2019s Charelemagne columnist, on the Martin Selmayr tweet quoted earlier. (See 1.26pm.) In 2016, after the Brexit vote, Nissan announced that it would be building Qashqai and X-Trail models at its factory in Sunderland. At the time it was revealed that the company had received assurances from the government, in the form of a letter from Greg Clark, the business secretary, but the precise nature of those assurances was never revealed because the letter was not published. The Nissan announcement at the weekend reversed part of what was promised by the company in 2016. And the Financial Times has now got hold of the Clark letter. As Peter Campbell reports (paywall), the government promised Nissan that its operations would not be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by Brexit. The government also promised the firm \u00a380m towards investment at the site, but the letter said that money was \u201ccontingent too on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant\u201d, the FT reports. The FT story goes on: The government made no specific promise on the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU \u2014 such as remaining in the bloc\u2019s customs union \u2014 but vowed to protect car manufacturers in the UK. They would be a \u201ccritical priority of our negotiations\u201d with the EU, the letter said. \u201cThe government fully recognises the significance of the EU markets to your presence in Sunderland,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cIt will be a critical priority of our negotiations to support UK car manufacturers, and ensure their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\u201d On the World at One John Whittingdale, the Brexiter former culture secretary and a member of the Commons Brexit committee, said that after the committee met Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general, he came away with the impression that the PM woud not secure meaningful change to the Brexit deal. He explained: Selmaryr told us what we have heard from others in the commission, that basically they regard the deal as having been finalised ... and they don\u2019t wish to reopen it. They did say that the political declaration is open for discussion in the future. But they said that they could not reopen the withdrawal agreement. They did talk about legal assurances, in the form of the letter that we have already had from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk. I have to say that, for those of us who couldn\u2019t support the withdrawal agreement, I certainly didn\u2019t hear anything that gave me great hope that the prime minister would come back with a change to the withdrawal agreement. I think what we have also made plain to [Selmayr is that] unless that happens, it is very unlikely that the House of Commons will agree to it. Whittingdale also said that he gave Selmayr a copy of the so-called Malthouse compromise and told him he thought it was the one version of the deal that might get through the Commons. Asked how Selmayr responded, Whittingdale said: \u201cHe is still of a view that the deal has been done and it is now up to the British parliament to ratify it.\u201d Whittingdale also said Selmayr was sceptical about extending article 50 if it was not clear what purpose extension would serve. He said: [Selmayr] made the fair point that there was no point extending article 50 if one did not know what we were seeking to do in the period of the extension. Whittingdale also said that the committee met Selmayr because, although Michel Barnier was the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, if the deal that Barnier negotiated fell through, Selmayr would then become the key person to deal with. But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has said that \u201cwith creativity\u201d a solution to the backstop problem could still be found. This is from Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general. Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, has welcomed Labour\u2019s commitment to the backstop. (See 1.11pm.) Speaking after meeting Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, at the Europa Hotel in Belfast, O\u2019Neill said: It was important today to put to Keir Starmer that we need to see clarity from the Labour party on the backstop. He did say in the meeting that the backstop is inevitable and that is the Labour position. It\u2019s their position because they understand the need to ensure there\u2019s no hard border on this island. O\u2019Neill said that it was important to hear from Starmer on this because in the past Labour had not been clear and consistent on the backstop. The party has argued in the past that there would be no need for one under its plan for Brexit because it would keep the UK in the customs union (even though that alone would not obviate the need for the backstop if Northern Ireland were outside the single market). O\u2019Neill said: The words [Starmer] used to ourselves in the meeting today were clearly that a backstop is inevitable - that is the Labour position in order to protect, or guard against a hard border and I can only say that that\u2019s what he\u2019s relayed to us. And Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has also said that attempts to find an alternative to the backstop will fail. Speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, he said: The prime minister and her team have spent over 12 months trying to find an alternative to the backstop. We have only got the backstop because they couldn\u2019t find an alternative. So, for her to go back now saying \u2018I don\u2019t want the backstop, I want an alternative\u2019 is to stand the last 12 months on its head. And I think that\u2019s what is causing the anxiety because nobody realistically thinks she\u2019s going to succeed in that objective. Starmer also said that Labour had \u201cconcerns\u201d about the backstop, but that it accepted there had to be one. And this is what Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told reporters after his committee\u2019s meeings with Martin Selmayr. (See 12.57pm.) He said the proposals in the so-called Malthouse compromise for alternatives to the backstop (see 9.20am) would not work. He explained: A lot of it to me, I have to say, personally, looks very familiar if you go back to last summer when people looked at technology and trusted traders and all of that, and a great deal of effort was put into examining those as a possible way forward. The conclusion that was reached I think on behalf of the British government and the European Union was that well, it\u2019s not going to work. And I personally, but others will have a different view, personally I don\u2019t see how it can work particularly in the very short amount of time that there is left. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming on the meeting the Commons Brexit committee had this morning with Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general. There are two urgent questions in the Commons today. That means the Greg Clark Nissa statement won\u2019t start until about 5pm. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Theresa May will visit Northern Ireland tomorrow where she will give a speech stressing the government\u2019s commitment to avoiding a hard border, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Greg Clark, the business secretary, will make a statement to MPs about Nissan after 3.30pm this afternoon. The spokesman refused to comment on a report in today\u2019s Times (paywall) saying the government is \u201cconsidering withdrawing a \u00a360 million package of support for Nissan after it broke a pledge to build the latest version of one of its sports utility vehicles in Britain\u201d. Clark would take questions on this during his statement, the spokesman said. May will hold a conference call today with business leaders from the European round table of industrialists. She will stress the importance of reaching a deal with the EU on Brexit, the spokesman said. The spokesman would not say if May would be travelling to Brussels later this week for talks with the EU about Brexit. The spokesman said that the alternative arrangements working group announced by Number 10 yesterday (see 9.20am), to consider alternatives to the backstop, would be looking at the issue \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. The government was taking the work seriously, he insisted, in response to questions about why five MPs in three days would be able to come up with a solution to the backstop issue that had eluded the best civil servants in London and Brussels for the last two years. The spokesman also said that, although the group\u2019s talks are only scheduled to last until Wednesday, they could go on beyond that. The spokesman refused to say whether May saw Wednesday 13 February, when she is due to make a statement to MPs about Brexit, as a deadline for the government to reach a new deal on the backstop. Asked what deadline the government was working to, the spokesman replied \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. These questions were partly triggered by what Greg Clark, the business secretary, told the Times at the end of last week. Clark said mid February as the effective deadline. He told the paper (paywall): An engineering employer said to me yesterday, \u2018Actually D-Day is much closer for us \u2014 it\u2019s the middle to the end of February if you are shipping to the Far East.\u2019 The reason for that is if you are sending a consignment of goods to Japan or South Korea, it\u2019s going to take six weeks for it to arrive. Both countries have free-trade agreements with the EU, which will fall if we have no deal. So you don\u2019t know whether the goods that you\u2019ve had to embark on the ocean, when they arrive there will be admitted and if so what tariffs are going to be paid. People say \u2018Things are always decided at the 59th minute of the 11th hour\u2019. But it\u2019s important to understand where \u2018the wire\u2019 is. The wire is not the 29th of March. The spokesman said that claims in the Sunday newspapers that the government was drawing up plans to evacuate the Queen from London in the event of disorder after a no-deal Brexit were \u201csimply not true\u201d. The spokesman also said that reports in the Sunday papers claiming that the government was drawing up plans for a general election on 6 June were \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d. The spokesman said the government was considering using sanctions against Venezuela to try to bring down the Maduro regime. May spoke about Venezuela to Pedro Sanchez, her Spanish opposite number, about this on Sunday, the spokesman said. He went on: Venezuelan people deserve a better future. They have suffered enough and the Maduro regime must end. It is time for free and fair elections. As the foreign secretary said this morning [see 9.51am], those who continue to violate the human rights of ordinary Venezuelans under an illegitimate regime will be called to account. We are looking at what further steps we can take to ensure peace and democracy in Venezuela, including through sanctions. The spokesman declined to say what form any sanctions might take. While the UK remains a member of the European Union any such actions would be implemented at an EU level. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. And there was one announcement. Theresa May will visit Northern Ireland tomorrow where she will give a speech stressing the government\u2019s commitment to avoiding a hard border, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. I will post more from the briefing soon. This is from the Conservative MP Anna Soubry. She seems to be encouraging pro-European ministers to resign if Theresa May does not soon rule out a no-deal Brexit. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. And while we\u2019re on the subject of Jacob Rees-Mogg (but not to the delight of everyone BTL, I see), it is worth pointing out that he was more interesting in what he said in an article in the Sun on Sunday yesterday than he was on LBC. Rees-Mogg and his ERG colleagues are normally seen as hardline absolutists. But in his article, explaining his support for the so-called Malthouse compromise, Rees-Mogg said that Brexiters had to be willing to give a little because otherwise there was a risk of remainers blocking Brexit. He said: In my view, an extra 33 months of vassalage after 46 years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a no deal departure \u2014 and the reason is simple. Regardless of the folly of project fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons. This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by 23 votes. So Rees-Mogg is now saying he would prefer to avoid a no-deal Brexit, because he thinks the prospect of that could lead to MPs voting to delay Brexit. That is quite a shift. Only two weeks ago, in his Bruges Group speech, he suggested he was quite happy with the prospect of no deal. Here are some lines from Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s LBC phone-on. Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, dismissed claims that the Nissan decision to abandon plans to produce its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factory reflected badly on Brexit. He told the programme: As far as one can tell, Brexit is far from being the primary reason Nissan has made this decision. Rees-Mogg said that various reasons specific to the car industry explained the decision, including falling demand for diesel. He went on: So Brexit is one of those what I might call BBC answers; all bad news is because of Brexit, and all good news is in spite of Brexit. All Nissan has said is that the uncertainty around Brexit and the future hasn\u2019t helped. That is not the main reason why they\u2019ve done this. He played down claims that businesses need certainty - a key argument made at the moment by business leaders and MPs arguing for a softer Brexit. When it was put to him that uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future after Brexit was bad for business, he replied: The truth is, business is all about uncertainty ... There is no certainty in business. The whole art of business is trying to manage uncertainty. Investment decisions aren\u2019t made for certain facts. You can\u2019t be certain that anyone will buy your car when you have built it. All business is based on uncertainty, and managing uncertainty. He said he was opposed to using investment in leave-voting, Labour-supporting deprived areas as a possible means of getting Labour MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The government has been talking to Labour MPs about possible investment in their communities, although it has dismissed claims that these payments would amount to bribes. Asked about the tactic, Rees-Mogg said: I don\u2019t think pork barrel politics has a place in the UK ... I was a bit surprised by these stories. It is not how British government normally works ... I think to start giving lots of money in individual constituencies, as happens in the United States - it is commonplace in the United States; a congressman who didn\u2019t get some pork for his constituency would not be thought of as a very good congressman - is something we are best without in this country. When it was put to him that the government has bought the support of the DUP with a commitment to spend \u00a31bn in Northern Ireland, Rees-Mogg said that \u201cthe DUP money was actually slightly less than it had got in the previous five years\u201d. In this context, it is worth pointing that government plans to increase spending in deprived areas after Brexit seem to be little more than a restatement of what was in the Conservative party\u2019s 2017 manifesto (pdf). It said: We will use the structural fund money that comes back to the UK following Brexit to create a United Kingdom shared prosperity fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations. The money that is spent will help deliver sustainable, inclusive growth based on our modern industrial strategy. We will consult widely on the design of the fund, including with the devolved administrations, local authorities, businesses and public bodies. The UK shared prosperity fund will be cheap to administer, low in bureaucracy and targeted where it is needed most. Rees-Mogg said that most Conservative MPs did not want an early election. They would be happy to wait until 2022, he said. Britain and other European allies have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has said. With 53 days to go until Brexit, and the EU and the UK still unable to agree a deal that will avoid the return of a hard border in Ireland, today a new body starts work charged with coming up with a solution. It is the alternative arrangements working group, announced by Downing Street last night. Number 10 has named five Conservatives who will take part - the hardline Brexiters Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh and Owen Paterson, and the compromise-minded remainers Damian Green and Nicky Morgan - who will hold meetings today, tomorrow and Wednesday with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, at the Cabinet Office. The group will focus on trying to establish the viability of plans to use technology as means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, as an alternative to the backstop. It will develop ideas set out in the so-called Malthouse compromise. That in turn was based on ideas for the border set out in a paper published in September last year by the European Research Group, The Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland post-Brexit (pdf). There are two problems with this. First, we\u2019ve have been here before. The alternative arrangements working group initiative sounds remarkably similar to one announced by Theresa May in May last year, when she set up two cabinet working groups to look at alternative, post-Brexit customs plans. One of the ideas on the table, \u201cmax fac\u201d or maximum facilitation, was quite similar to what the ERG is proposing. The cabinet working group failed to come up with ideas that would impress the EU. Second, the EU has restated its belief that new technology won\u2019t solve the problem. Yesterday afternoon Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, retweeted a BBC Reality Check article saying no technological solution would be available in the next few years. And here is an extract from the BBC article she commended. So could a future technological solution to the backstop work? \u201cTheoretically, I believe it could be done,\u201d said David Hening, director of the UK Trade Policy Project think tank. \u201cHowever, it would require huge amounts of trust and money. What happens if a lorry driver doesn\u2019t register? And in any event, it certainly couldn\u2019t be delivered in the next few years.\u201d This solution also doesn\u2019t get round the fact that EU law requires physical inspections of some products. So what about another \u201calternative\u201d - simply time limiting the backstop so that it automatically ends? This would defeat the whole purpose of the backstop, according to Katy Hayward, an expert in border studies, at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cWhat happens when that time limit expires? Time limiting the backstop pretty much kicks the can down the road and doesn\u2019t face up to the reality of what to do about the Irish border after the transition period,\u201d she said. And yesterday, on the Andrew Marr Show, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, also claimed that technology offered a solution to the border issue, provided the EU showed \u201ca bit of goodwill\u201d. He said: In my own department I\u2019ve got Border Force. And I asked Border Force months ago to advise me, to look at what alternative arrangements are possible, and they\u2019ve shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology. It\u2019s perfectly possible. The only thing that\u2019s missing is a bit of goodwill on the EU side. In a tweet a bit later, Weyand rubbished that claim too. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents the most hardline Tory Brexiters, hosts his LBC phone-in. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11.30am: The Commons Brexit committee visits Brussels. Among others, the committee will be meeting Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general. After 3.30pm: Greg Clark, the business secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about Nissan\u2019s decision not to build its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant. And at some point today Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will be meeting members of the new working group set up by Number 10 to consider the viability of the so-called Malthouse compromise, a Brexit proposal that includes plans to avoid a hard border in Ireland through technological solutions as an alternative to the backstop. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Police officers involved in the detention of Sean Rigg lied about their actions as part of a cover-up after he died in custody, a police misconduct hearing has head. Five Metropolitan police officers face charges of gross misconduct over the death of Rigg, a 40-year-old musician, who died after being restrained in 2008. Rigg was undergoing a mental health crisis when police were called and was behaving erratically, aiming karate kicks at passersby. But he was arrested him on the grounds he had stolen a passport, which turned out to be his, the hearing heard. The five officers who face the sack if found guilty are Sgt Paul White, PC Mark Harratt, PC Richard Glasson, PC Matthew Forward and PC Andrew Birks. Opening the case for the Met police, Gerard Boyle QC accused the officers of gross errors and four of them of lying to an inquest jury and investigators to hide the truth. Officers are also accused of holding Rigg in a prone position for seven minutes, an excessive period of time. Boyle said: \u201cIn an attempt to cover up their behaviour, Glasson, Harratt, Forward and White have lied to investigating officers and/or a jury.\u201d Boyle said when the officers first came across Rigg they failed to spot obvious signs he was having a mental health crisis and should have taken him to hospital and not into police custody. \u201cIt was obvious Mr Rigg must have been suffering from mental health problems and that he should\u2019ve been treated by the officers as a medical emergency. \u201cIt\u2019s simply staggering that the officers did not consider the role of mental health issues.\u201d Instead Rigg was taken in a police van to Brixton police station, south London, in what Boyle said was an \u201cegregious failure\u201d which was \u201cmore unforgivable\u201d when later he fell on the station floor and those around did not help him. White, who was the custody sergeant, was accused by Boyle of a \u201ccavalier and lackadaisical\u201d attitude having wrongly believed that Rigg, who was by now seriously ill, was feigning his condition or that it was caused by drugs. The start of the disciplinary tribunal was delayed for a fortnight after the five officers tried to have the hearing scrapped, claiming they could not get a fair hearing because a decade had passed since the death. The panel, chaired by the Met commander Julian Bennett, rejected their pleas on Friday but also castigated the police watchdog for its failings which caused long delays in the case. The first investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission exonerated the officers. But an inquest jury in 2012 found that police actions had contributed to Rigg\u2019s death, leading to the IPCC reviewing its first investigation, scrapping its findings and launching a reinvestigation, which led to the discipline charges. The IPCC was abolished and replaced in January 2018 by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which directed the Met to bring the discipline charges.

But protesters accused the council of cutting down healthy trees because they were more costly and difficult to maintain than young saplings.</p> <p>Crump said that his detention in 2016 left him feeling frightened and vulnerable, but vowed not to be put off from protesting in the future. \u201cThis is environmental vandalism and we need to stand up to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be put off by scare tactics and intimidation.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to clarify that the 17,500 trees that could be earmarked for removal equate to half of Sheffield\u2019s street trees, not half of the city\u2019s total number of trees.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners who were wrongfully detained while protesting against tree felling in Sheffield have been given a \u00a324,300 payout by South Yorkshire police. The seven protesters were arrested between November 2016 and February 2017 and detained for up to nine hours under an obscure trade union law that was incorrectly used, the police watchdog found last year. Protesters have accepted the payment, which came in an out-of-court settlement, but say they would rather have been given an apology. \u201cThis is about the right to peacefully protest. The [police] are very good at using taxpayers\u2019 money to get out of sticky situations instead of getting it right the first place. We just want an apology and an explanation,\u201d said Dr Simon Crump, one of the protesters who was arrested in 2016. The protesters are now pushing for an independent inquiry into the arrests, which they believe were an intimidation tactic to stop them from protesting. Their arrest and detention were deemed inappropriate following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The protesters were arrested \u201cfor the prevention of harm and injury\u201d under an obscure clause of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. In a statement, South Yorkshire police said: \u201cThe upheld appeals were not based on an error in law and rightly, no officers were found to have a case to answer for misconduct \u2026 No formal apology was requested as part of the civil claim.\u201d The arrests are the result of a row between protesters and Sheffield city council over a controversial tree-felling programme during which the council took out an injunction to prevent activists from taking direct action. The programme sought to cut down thousands of trees to replace them with saplings. Sheffield city council originally claimed only 5,000 trees were earmarked for removal, but secret documents later revealed it could be as many as 17,500 \u2013 half the city\u2019s street trees. The tree-felling was was halted last year after dozens of people were arrested and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, called the felling programme \u201cbonkers\u201d. The council said that its outsourcing company, Amey, hired through a \u00a32.2bn private finance initiative (PFI) contract, only felled dying, dead, or dangerous trees. But protesters accused the council of cutting down healthy trees because they were more costly and difficult to maintain than young saplings. Crump said that his detention in 2016 left him feeling frightened and vulnerable, but vowed not to be put off from protesting in the future. \u201cThis is environmental vandalism and we need to stand up to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be put off by scare tactics and intimidation.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to clarify that the 17,500 trees that could be earmarked for removal equate to half of Sheffield\u2019s street trees, not half of the city\u2019s total number of trees.",

He delights in designs that \u201cbombard the audience with information, whether that\u2019s sonic or physical or visual\u201d. This is a director who abhors theatre \u201cthat doesn\u2019t go beyond the cerebral\u201d, who has a short attention span (\u201cI can\u2019t sit at a desk for very long\u201d) and for whom theatre has to make itself felt.</p> <p>Essentially, Bennett is creating a contemporary Theatre of Cruelty, giving the visceral and ritualistic techniques that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/artaud\">Antonin Artaud</a> advocated 80 years earlier a pyro, DayGlo twist.

For Bennett, it\u2019s a case of form matching content. He doesn\u2019t take on many projects \u2013 one a year, occasionally two \u2013 and picks his plays selectively. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be vital,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m not drawn to plays set in drawing rooms about wealthy people squabbling over wine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dff7d83f87252565be1437bd0aca97e82562204e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dff7d83f87252565be1437bd0aca97e82562204e/0_198_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe and Will Kemp in Equus at the Gielgud theatre, London, in 2007, directed by Thea Sharrock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe and Will Kemp in Equus at the Gielgud theatre, London, in 2007, directed by Thea Sharrock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, every script he\u2019s done demonstrates \u201cthe potential for primal behaviour we all have \u2013 or should have \u2013 that\u2019s almost entirely extinguished\u201d.

But unlike the other scripts Bennett\u2019s picked up, Shaffer\u2019s play is almost half a century old \u2013 and a syllabus staple. \u201cI\u2019d never read it or seen it,\u201d the director admits. \u201cWhen I finally did, I was like: \u2018Woah.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Not only was it animalistic and, with actors playing horses, vividly theatrical, he found it richer and more resonant than expected. \u201cIt asks what causes someone to commit any act of extreme violence \u2013 whether that\u2019s blinding six horses or shooting lots of people.\u201d Shaffer offers no answers, but Bennett is determined not to see Alan as an aberration. Everyone, he believes, is capable of such brutality, and Equus is as much about its psychiatrist, Dr Dysart, as its patient. \u201cHe has his own crisis. Am I damaging these kids? Have I wasted my life putting on a shirt and tie to go to work every day?\u201d It is a play that questions the notion of normality itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c70ab1499788d876bcaf50b1675c1658d1d64204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c70ab1499788d876bcaf50b1675c1658d1d64204/113_264_4199_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Clifford (Ollie) and Sarah Middleton (Keaton) in Pomona by Alistair McDowall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Clifford and Sarah Middleton in Pomona by Alistair McDowall, directed by Ned Bennett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bennett\u2019s not keen on conventions \u2013 in theatre or in life. Having discovered directing at Manchester University, he teamed up with a pack of theatre-mad peers. They created their own work and forged their own practice, often rehearsing round the clock. One summer, they ran their own Edinburgh fringe venue, Johnny Miller Presents, staging kids\u2019 shows, comedy revues, student scripts by McDowall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/07/gundog-review-royal-court-london-vicky-featherstone-simon-longman\">Simon Longman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/22/rob-hayes-awkward-converations-edinburgh-festival\">Rob Hayes</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re all still really close,\u201d Bennett says.</p> <p>After graduating, a gang of them moved in together as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/24/the-high-price-of-cheap-living-how-the-property-guardianship-dream-soured\">property guardians</a>, living in empty office blocks around London on \u201cpigeon-feed\u201d rents. It gave them plenty of room to rehearse \u2013 \u201cenormous open-plan offices\u201d \u2013 in ways that would shape Bennett\u2019s directing style. \u201cEverything became much more physical,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe cycled around indoors and played laser gun games. Actors stayed over and slept in meeting rooms.\u201d There was room to run riot. \u201cI remember improvising a torture party for [Philip Ridley\u2019s] Mercury Fur when the owner walked in. We had permission, but still \u2026 Awkward.\u201d</p> <p>McDowall says behind the \u201cwham-bam productions\u201d, Bennett is very focused on actors. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sit behind a table taking notes. He\u2019s very involved. Actors either find that exhausting or they think he\u2019s the best director they\u2019ve worked with.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Equus rehearsals, that\u2019s the impression I get. Bennett treats it all as a game, chucking up exercise after exercise and prodding his company to think on their feet \u2013 physically and impulsively. \u201cIt\u2019s about respecting them as artists and co-creators,\u201d he explains afterwards. \u201cI love being in rehearsals. I just want to get up and muck about.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Equus is at <a href=\"http://www.stratfordeast.com/whats-on/all-shows/equus\">Theatre Royal Stratford East</a>, London, from 15 February to 23 March.

But unlike the other scripts Bennett\u2019s picked up, Shaffer\u2019s play is almost half a century old \u2013 and a syllabus staple. \u201cI\u2019d never read it or seen it,\u201d the director admits. \u201cWhen I finally did, I was like: \u2018Woah.\u2019\u201d Not only was it animalistic and, with actors playing horses, vividly theatrical, he found it richer and more resonant than expected. \u201cIt asks what causes someone to commit any act of extreme violence \u2013 whether that\u2019s blinding six horses or shooting lots of people.\u201d Shaffer offers no answers, but Bennett is determined not to see Alan as an aberration. Everyone, he believes, is capable of such brutality, and Equus is as much about its psychiatrist, Dr Dysart, as its patient. \u201cHe has his own crisis. Am I damaging these kids? Have I wasted my life putting on a shirt and tie to go to work every day?\u201d It is a play that questions the notion of normality itself. Bennett\u2019s not keen on conventions \u2013 in theatre or in life. Having discovered directing at Manchester University, he teamed up with a pack of theatre-mad peers. They created their own work and forged their own practice, often rehearsing round the clock. One summer, they ran their own Edinburgh fringe venue, Johnny Miller Presents, staging kids\u2019 shows, comedy revues, student scripts by McDowall, Simon Longman and Rob Hayes. \u201cWe\u2019re all still really close,\u201d Bennett says. After graduating, a gang of them moved in together as property guardians, living in empty office blocks around London on \u201cpigeon-feed\u201d rents. It gave them plenty of room to rehearse \u2013 \u201cenormous open-plan offices\u201d \u2013 in ways that would shape Bennett\u2019s directing style. \u201cEverything became much more physical,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe cycled around indoors and played laser gun games. Actors stayed over and slept in meeting rooms.\u201d There was room to run riot. \u201cI remember improvising a torture party for [Philip Ridley\u2019s] Mercury Fur when the owner walked in. We had permission, but still \u2026 Awkward.\u201d McDowall says behind the \u201cwham-bam productions\u201d, Bennett is very focused on actors. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sit behind a table taking notes. He\u2019s very involved. Actors either find that exhausting or they think he\u2019s the best director they\u2019ve worked with.\u201d Watching Equus rehearsals, that\u2019s the impression I get. Bennett treats it all as a game, chucking up exercise after exercise and prodding his company to think on their feet \u2013 physically and impulsively. \u201cIt\u2019s about respecting them as artists and co-creators,\u201d he explains afterwards. \u201cI love being in rehearsals. I just want to get up and muck about.\u201d Equus is at Theatre Royal Stratford East, London, from 15 February to 23 March. Then touring until 11 May.",

Authorship of the novel has been attributed to Oscar Wilde and members of his circle in the late 19th century. \u201cNowadays we are more used to erotica, and fiction in general, including gay characters and storylines, but in the past this was pretty shocking,\u201d said Smith. \u201cTeleny is one of the earliest works of male gay erotic fiction in English and it was particularly shocking at the time.\u201d Harris\u2019s Lists of Covent-Garden Ladies, meanwhile, is an 18th-century pocketbook directory of female sex workers in London that arranges its entries by name and address \u2013 \u201cMiss Sp\u2013nc\u2013r, No 35, Newman Street\u201d \u2013 and also includes information about the women\u2019s physical attributes: Miss Sp\u2014nc\u2014r \u201cis never so good a companion as when a little enlivened with the juice of the grape\u201d. Of a Miss Fr\u2013m, from Berwick Street, it advises \u201cshe is now about nineteen, of a fair complexion, with blue eyes \u2026 tall and elegantly made, with well-formed projecting bubbies, that will, without being obliged to stays, keep their original ground\u201d. Her \u201cparts below\u201d, it adds, \u201care very conveniently adapted to any size\u201d. \u201cAll of these works are pretty much written by men, for men. It\u2019s to be expected, but looking back, that\u2019s what is shocking, how male-dominated it is, the lack of female agency,\u201d said Smith. The Private Case collection has been accessible to the public through the British Library\u2019s rare books collection since the 1960s, but the digitisation project with Gale means the titles will now be available to a much wider audience, by subscription to libraries and higher education institutions, or for free at the library\u2019s reading rooms in London and Yorkshire. \u201cIt\u2019s the final push to making them completely accessible,\u201d said Smith. Adrian Edwards, head of printed heritage at the library, said the collection \u201coffers extraordinary insights into many facets of human sexuality over at least three centuries \u2026 By digitising this collection \u2026 we hope to make this collection visible and available as never before.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHold fast to dreams,\u201d wrote Harlem poet Langston Hughes. \u201cFor if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.\u201d His famous words will sit alongside a great deal of impactful art this Black History Month, all through February. Alongside the more blockbuster events (Black Panther will be screened free of charge at selected theatres), expect to find a Harlem renaissance-style speakeasy, vintage photos of a black sports icon and artworks by Jimi Hendrix. On the heels of the success of the Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum that just ended, here are seven must-see exhibits to catch through February. Crusader: Martin Luther King Jr Classic photos of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr are everywhere, but the lesser-known, more intimate moments are scarce. Some of these rare shots are on view at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, featuring shots of his travels across the world, on view until 6 April. From his trip to India, where he learned about non-violent resistance, to his trip to Norway to accept the Nobel peace prize, this exhibit marks the 60th anniversary of the first biography written about King, Crusader Without Violence by Lawrence D Reddick in 1959. The center is also hosting a pop-up exhibit to celebrate the 118th birthday of the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes. The lobby will turn into a Harlem speakeasy-style salon to celebrate the works of writers such as Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Canada Lee and Hilda Simms. Harlem Perspectives II Harlem has always been a hub of black art and culture and remains vital to this day. A selected number of local artists working uptown are featured in Harlem Perspectives II at Faction Art Projects. Showcasing artists who live and work above 110th Street in Manhattan, there are works by Elan Cadiz, who crafts family portraits from fabrics, to marble sculptures by Kennedy Yanko. There are also abstract paintings by Patrick Alston, who lives \u2013 and finds his inspiration \u2013 in the neighborhood. \u201cHarlem is an essential place for understanding the essence, resilience and brilliance of black culture,\u201d said Alston. \u201cBlack history month is a time to reflect on the significance of black achievements and there is no better place to understand this than through the mecca of black excellence that is Harlem.\u201d In the Dugout with Jackie Robinson: An Intimate Portrait of a Baseball Legend In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American major league baseball player. Robinson\u2019s legacy is remembered on the year of his 100th birthday at the Museum of the City of New York, which runs until 15 September. On view are rare photos of Robinson in the clubhouse with his team-mates and at home with his family. Whitney Donhauser, the director of the museum calls Robinson \u201ca true American icon\u201d. \u201cRobinson\u2019s trailblazing years as a Brooklyn Dodger captivated the country,\u201d she said, \u201cand these photographs offer an intimate glimpse of a defining period in American sports history.\u201d Black Refractions: Highlights from the Studio Museum in Harlem The Studio Museum in Harlem was founded in 1968 as a space for black artists to shine. Now, as the museum undergoes a renovation, slated to reopen in 2021, this touring exhibition, co-hosted by American Federation of Arts, will visit six venues across the US. It kicks off at the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco. As part of Harlem\u2019s prized art collection of African American art, a number of artists are brought to the spotlight, including Faith Ringgold, Kehinde Wiley and Juliana Huxtable. \u201cThe exhibition will add to an expanded view of American art history,\u201d said Pauline Willis, the director of the AFA. \u201cMany are not fully aware of the tremendous contributions artists of the African diaspora have made to American art.\u201d Jeff Donaldson The famed AfriCOBRA art movement co-founder Jeff Donaldson takes the spotlight at Kravets Wehby Gallery in New York, showing his intricate paintings, watercolors and collages from the 1960s through the late 1990s. Some of his most iconic works will be on view, including Donaldson\u2019s last painting, a portrait of three trombonists. A critical voice to the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, Donaldson created historic artworks such as Aunt Jemima and the Pillsbury Doughboy, a painting of a black woman being battered by a white police officer. Donaldson started this painting after the civil rights March on Washington in 1963. The exhibit opens 28 February. Night Coming Tenderly, Black The Chicago photographer Dawoud Bey has traced the Underground Railroad path to freedom in his latest exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. Night Coming Tenderly, Black is a series of black-and-white photos that follows the fugitive pathways from the south to Canada, which helped enslaved African Americans to freedom in the 19th century. \u201cAll across the globe, people are moving across the landscape in pursuit of freedom, an opportunity to live their lives in freedom,\u201d said Bey. \u201cTheir flight is as imperative as the flight of those enslaved and seeking their freedom during the antebellum era of the Underground Railroad.\u201d Bold As Love: Jimi Hendrix at Home Photos of the psychedelic rock star at home in the 1960s are on at the Northwest African American Museum in Seattle, which was Jimi Hendrix\u2019s hometown. A number of rare family photos are shown alongside artworks made by Hendrix and his personal artifacts, offering a window into his inner world. \u201cThere is always a need to document, support, elevate and recognize the contribution of African and African Americans to provide visibility, agency and a collective voice for a culture,\u201d said Hasaan Kirkland, the museum\u2019s curator. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture that does not always receive national, regional or local acknowledgement that leads to an outward societal measure of respect and revered significance of worth, purpose and magnitude in this society.\u201d",

Bowen also urged the government to bring on legislation giving effect to the recommendations \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d so changes could be in place before the federal election expected by May. Frydenberg said the government had agreed to overhaul conflicted remuneration for mortgage brokers, but noted it was important to proceed in stages, consistent with Hayne\u2019s recommendation, to ensure no adverse effects on competition. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is a give a big tick or a free-kick to the banks,\u201d the treasurer said. The government has agreed to prohibit for new loans the payment of trail commissions from lenders to mortgage brokers and aggregators from July 2020, and also require the value of upfront commissions be linked to the amount drawn-down by borrowers and not the overall loan amount. It will also ban campaign and volume-based commissions and payments, but the government has hesitated to endorse user-pays. Asked how quickly the government would move to legislate the Hayne recommendations it has agreed to implement, Frydenberg nominated immediate priorities, which included updating penalties, moving to set up the compensation scheme of last resort, and setting up a capability review into the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. But he hedged on the timing for the rest of the recommendations. \u201cWith respect to those other changes, we only have a few [parliamentary sitting] weeks left, obviously, a couple of weeks left, before we get into the budget sittings\u201d. Frydenberg said decisions about legislative priorities would be taken in due course. Hayne in his final report has foreshadowed potential prosecutions against all of the big banks, except Westpac, and was particularly scathing about executives of the National Australia Bank. Frydenberg declined to say whether heads should roll. \u201cI\u2019m not getting to comment on specific cases or individuals or indeed companies, but I will leave that to the boards and the shareholders to make their own decisions\u201d. While the banks are promising better conduct, brokers and financial planners have already pushed back against the compensation scheme of last resort. The Financial Services Council, an industry peak body, says it would not be possible unless \u201cthe underlying licensing system is strengthened to ensure licensees meet their obligations\u201d. The new Guardian Essential poll follows a negative blitz over the summer by the Morrison government about Labor\u2019s policies on negative gearing, capital gains tax and franking credits. The poll has the Coalition\u2019s primary vote on 38% and Labor\u2019s on 36%, and suggests the one-point tightening in the two-party preferred measure. Essential has changed its panel provider for the rolling survey from YourSource to Qualtrics. Peter Lewis, executive director of Essential says, the same methodology, weighting and quality control is being applied to the data provided. \u201cOur final poll of 2018 conducted by the YourSource panel found a two party preferred result of 53-47, and our first vote of 2019 using the Qualtrics panel also found a 53-47 vote,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThis week\u2019s poll shows a slight tightening, with one extended same 1,500 respondents [survey] finding a two party preferred result of 52-48\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s cheap, dirty petrol ranks among the worst of the OECD nations, yet the peak industry body representing Australian petrol refiners has rejected the criticism, saying the industry should be given until 2027 to adjust to stricter regulations. Paul Barrett, the chief executive of the Australian Institute of Petroleum, hit back at critics who have described Australian petrol as low quality thanks to its sulphur content. \u201cThere are a range of fuel parameters which determine the quality of fuel, not just the sulphur content of any fuel,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cAustralian fuel is very high quality fuel, and better than many countries for some key fuel parameters like MTBE [methyl tert-butyl ether] and olefins.\u201d There are currently 17m registered cars on Australian roads, the second biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution, according to the Climate Council. Collectively they produce almost the same emissions each year as Queensland\u2019s coal and gas-fired electricity supply. Other countries have looked to fuel quality as a first step in lowering the carbon dioxide emissions of cars and other road transport because it is easy to legislate, while also encouraging a transition to cleaner technologies such as electric vehicles. High octane, low sulphur fuels are the gold standard for vehicle manufacturers but the current unleaded petrol on the Australian market ranks among the worst of OECD nations on its sulphur content. A 2015 report by oil and gas consultants Stratas Advisors ranked 100 countries by the sulphur content of their fuels and found Australia landed at 66. Tony Weber, the CEO of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI), told the Senate select committee into electric vehicles that simply improving fuel quality would offer a \u201c3%-5%\u201d improvement on CO2 performance \u201covernight\u201d. \u201cAustralia has one of the lowest-quality fuels in the OECD,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThe vast majority of the 17 million fleet would get the improvement just from the change of fuel with no change to the vehicle.\u201d While the actual sulphur content in Australian fuels is lower than the regulated limit, current legislation allows for up to 150 parts per million for regular unleaded petrol and 50 parts per million for premium fuels. Dr Vlado Vivoda, a research fellow with the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland, said Australia\u2019s fuel had also stayed cheap, which meant the quality had not improved. \u201cFuel prices are low in comparison to other OECD countries,\u201d Vivoda said. \u201cIt is probably in the bottom three. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t encourage any kind of innovation or shift away from those fuels. If you\u2019ve got fuel prices that are a bit higher, alternatives start to become more cost competitive.\u201d Across the world, acceptable emissions levels for new petrol cars are regulated under the European Emission Standards. Currently best practice is represented by the stringent \u201cEuro 6\u201d regulations, which have been adopted by a number of Australia\u2019s major trading partners Australia\u2019s current standard is Euro 5. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions \u2013 which has been criticised over its inaction \u2013 was set up to address the issue of a transition and outlined three proposals in its Better Fuels for Cleaner Air 2018 discussion paper, which was released last year. Of these, one would give the refining industry until 2027 to do away with regular unleaded petrol even as stricter fuel efficiency standards were introduced. This plan was attacked last August by Toyota\u2019s head of sales and marketing, Sean Hanley, who criticised the introduction of stricter fuel efficiency standards without also ensuring the availability of cleaner fuels on which to run them. \u201cPut simply, we can\u2019t achieve first-world emissions without our first-world quality fuel,\u201d Hanley told media in Brisbane. But the head of Australian Institute of Petroleum said it would cost $979m to upgrade Australia\u2019s four remaining refineries to produce low-sulphur fuels, and would put them at risk of closing with a tougher deadline. Barrett said: \u201cWe can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s going to take us over five years to build the required equipment, and we have to accommodate all of the Australian refineries and their unique circumstances.\u201d While the industry has agreed to provide low-sulphur fuels by 2027 \u2013 around the time electric cars are projected to hit price parity with petrol engines \u2013 Barrett said the fuel was not needed to ensure the introduction of vehicles with the latest technology. \u201cThere are Euro 6 cars running around Australia now in the marketplace, operating on the current market fuel quality and are meeting the emissions standards,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been aware of any operability issues with these vehicles or any breaches of environmental standards.\u201d The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry\u2019s technical director, James Hurnall, disagreed. \u201cThe Euro 6 standard requires the vehicle to continue to meet emissions standards for 160,000 km,\u201d Hurnall said. \u201cCar markers know systems can deteriorate in service.

Each new single from Melbourne\u2019s G Flip reveals a new sonic template, and rather than being the whiskey-soaked lament that the title suggests, Drink Too Much is instead a bubbly dance anthem that would have been at home at London indie club nights in the early oughts.

A trill-heavy chorus, dramatic tempo shifts, and operatic wailings make this the perfect Eurovision entry, and \u2013 much like The Beatles\u2019 All You Need is Love, which debuted on a worldwide simulcast and was therefore deliberately crafted with simple language \u2013 its lyrics are almost an aside. It\u2019s also made for the big stage: as Miller-Heidke hits and holds an impossibly high note, and the entire song breaks into a stomping anthem, you can almost imagine the crowd cheering and raising to their feet.

It\u2019s becoming more and more impossible to deny Baker Boy\u2019s truly international appeal.

      "bodyText": "Stella Donnelly \u2013 Old Man For fans of: The Go-Betweens, Deborah Conway, San Cisco This is Australian music at its finest: lazy guitars that jangle out a warm melody, melting vocals, and more than a little menace. \u201cBoy if you touch her again, I\u2019ll tell your wife and kids about that time,\u201d Stella Donnelly threatens, and you can tell she means it. This song is a call to arms in a #MeToo world, where old men \u2013 men like the one Donnelly eviscerates \u2013 are finally getting their comeuppance. As the old broken order slowly falls apart, we\u2019ll be left with talented, smart women like Donnelly, taking no prisoners and leading the way. The future has never seemed brighter. For more: Donnelly is touring Australia in March before moving on to a series of dates in the northern hemisphere G Flip \u2013 Drink Too Much For fans of: Lily Allen, Passion Pit, Robyn Declaring a crush by unleashing their full name in the first line of a song is a gutsy move (particularly when they\u2019re engaged); so is admitting your last partner dumped you thanks to your drinking habits. Each new single from Melbourne\u2019s G Flip reveals a new sonic template, and rather than being the whiskey-soaked lament that the title suggests, Drink Too Much is instead a bubbly dance anthem that would have been at home at London indie club nights in the early oughts. While not exactly celebrating her overindulgence, G Flip expertly expresses the emptiness of \u201cchasing highs in strangers\u2019 eyes\u201d without wading into self-pity. Lament never sounded like so much fun. For more: G Flip is playing Laneway and Groovin\u2019 the Moo, with a national tour in May Kate Miller-Heidke \u2013 Zero Gravity For fans of: Kate Bush, Queen, Joanna Newsom Oh my! This is Kate Miller-Heidke\u2019s deliciously audacious entry into the geographically loose Eurovision song competition \u2013 she is one of 10 Australian artists duking it out on Saturday night, after which experts and viewers get to decide who we send \u2013 and somebody better duck out quickly to grab the medal polish. A trill-heavy chorus, dramatic tempo shifts, and operatic wailings make this the perfect Eurovision entry, and \u2013 much like The Beatles\u2019 All You Need is Love, which debuted on a worldwide simulcast and was therefore deliberately crafted with simple language \u2013 its lyrics are almost an aside. It\u2019s also made for the big stage: as Miller-Heidke hits and holds an impossibly high note, and the entire song breaks into a stomping anthem, you can almost imagine the crowd cheering and raising to their feet. I don\u2019t want to get too cocky, but if KMH is our representative, Australia has this year\u2019s Eurovision in the Glomesh bag. For more: KMH\u2019s last album was released back in 2017 Baker Boy \u2013 Cool As Hell For fans of: Anderson .Paak, Kendrick Lamar, Marvin Gaye Until Danzal Baker drops effortlessly into his native tongue, you could be mistaken for thinking that he\u2019s landed a guest verse from Kendrick Lamar, such is his uncanny resemblance to the hip-hop king. It\u2019s becoming more and more impossible to deny Baker Boy\u2019s truly international appeal. He is perhaps the most fully formed artist this country has produced in a long while, and it\u2019s been genuinely exciting to watch his career gain momentum over just five singles. On the day he released this single he was announced as Young Australian of the Year. No surprises there. For more: Baker Boy is taking to the stage at this year\u2019s Laneway festival Cub Sport \u2013 Party Pill For fans of: Imogen Heap, M83, Sade A bittersweet ode to teenage love \u2013 the type with anniversaries each month, open-mouth kisses, and plenty of important firsts. Dreamy, sexy, and with all the unbridled urgency of a John Hughes soundtrack, this might just be Cub Sport\u2019s best song yet. Octave harmonies pitch-shifted in both directions add an otherworldly feel to the track, while a clomping, stomping synth attempts to provide an anchor as the song soars into the heavens. A beautiful, sad, sweet masterstroke by one of Australia\u2019s finest. For more: Cub Sport are currently touring the UK and Europe; their self-titled new album has just come out and is charting madly Regurgitator\u2019s Pogogo Show \u2013 The Box For fans of: Fun Loving Criminals, the Beastie Boys, early \u2019Gurg What makes a children\u2019s album?

      "body": "<p>\u2018To get great clarity in the balls, you really need to blow them a lot,\u201d says Jeff Koons, with all the solemnity of a man explaining his tax returns. He gazes lovingly at his balls, which in this particular case are a row of stainless steel spheres suitably blown up to bear an astonishing resemblance to his most famous artistic muse: inflatable rubber toys. But given that Koons shot to notoriety with his 1991 series <a href=\"http://www.jeffkoons.com/artwork/made-in-heaven\">Made in Heaven</a> \u2013 in which he photographed himself and his then girlfriend Ilona Staller in pretty much every sexual position legal in the state of New York \u2013 this ball chat really could have gone another way.</p> <p>Koons, who looks like Pee Wee Herman and talks like <a href=\"https://www.misterrogers.org/\">Mister Rogers</a>, is taking me around his 10,000 square foot studio in Chelsea, New York. And if you think that sounds big, wait until you hear about his house: he, his wife Justine and their six children (Koons also has two older children from previous relationships) are about to move into their new fixer-upper, which is almost an entire block on the Upper East Side. Koons bought two mega mansions for a total of $35m and spent almost another $5m knocking them together.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2014/06/28/jeffrey-koons-gets-ok-to-build-mega-mansion/\">It must be nice to not only be an artist but to be your own Medici</a>,\u201d one of his disgruntled neighbours huffed to the New York Post, and after spending an afternoon with the man himself I can confirm that it does seem very nice indeed. While Koons strolls around in a quietly chic outfit of dark blue patterned shirt and blue trousers, young people in white coats skitter around doing what looks to me like most of the work: painting, sculpting, blowtorching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de972853863c428b3c1db4221f60ca567126fbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6de972853863c428b3c1db4221f60ca567126fbc/75_311_1763_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m still very, very proud of those\u2019 \u2026 Koons with ex-wife Ilona Staller in one of his Made in Heaven images.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m still very, very proud of those\u2019 \u2026 Koons with ex-wife Ilona Staller in one of his Made in Heaven images.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not on each piece labouring over it,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m overseeing each one tremendously.\u201d Without help, he explains, he \u201cwould be able to make only one sculpture every few years. It\u2019s about the gesture, that\u2019s where the art is. It\u2019s being able to work with people and to articulate ideas the same way you articulate your fingers.\u201d</p> <p>Koons, until very recently the world\u2019s most expensive living artist, has the calm, unruffled air that, in New York, is generally only found in the heavily medicated. But in him, it seems more like the zen of a man who has all but the licence to print money. His works sell for multimillions. Art collector Peter Brant bought one of my favourite pieces by Koons \u2013 <a href=\"https://observer.com/2012/05/koons-puppy-blooms-at-brant-estate/\">Puppy, a 40ft west highland terrier made out of flowers</a> \u2013 and spends $75,000 a year just maintaining it. \u201cKoons,\u201d read <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/05/age-of-jeff-koons.html\">one recent, and typical, critical assessment</a>, \u201chas made his name manufacturing toys for rich old boys.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Koons hates this kind of chat. \u201cThe rest of the world talks so much about money,\u201d he says, \u201cand one of the reasons is I think they feel uncomfortable talking about art. So if they\u2019re writing about art, and they don\u2019t really want to talk about art, then they talk about money \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u2018Whew! I didn\u2019t have to talk about art!\u2019\u201d To which it\u2019s tempting to respond: \u201cSure, Jeff, but it\u2019s kinda hard to see the art when it has a $58m price tag hanging off its neck.\u201d</p> <p>This was Koons\u2019s Balloon Dog (Orange) which in 2013 fetched what was then the highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist. But the day after our interview, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/19/david-hockney-painting-art-portrait-of-an-artist\">David Hockney\u2019s Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures)</a> was sold for $90m and Koons lost his title. Still, who cares about money? Koons\u2019s claim to think only about higher things would, however, be a little more credible if he didn\u2019t literally pink with excitement when we talk about <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-edward-hoppers-chop-suey-sells-919-million-christies-sale-ebsworth-estate\">the recent sale of the Edward Hopper painting Chop Suey</a>: \u201cNinety-one million dollars!

I loved that show, with its re-creations of giant inflatable toys made from stainless steel and ludicrous Popeye paintings. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/01/jeff-koons-searle-serpentine-review\">\u201cArt for people with short attention spans,\u201d</a> Adrian Searle wrote in the Guardian. Hi!) But was it fun? No question \u2013 and it\u2019s even more fun seeing those pieces and many more closeup in his studio.</p> <p>His famous inflatable pieces are so realistic that when I reach out to squeeze what looks like a blowup plastic seal and find myself touching cold hard steel instead, the sensory confusion makes me burst out laughing. Scattered through the maze-like rooms in the studio are re-creations of his giant \u201cporcelain\u201d figures, also made from stainless steel. One, an especially kitschy image of two deer rubbing their noses together, looks like the kind of thing a little girl would pick out for herself in an airport giftshop in the 1980s, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. \u201cI had that figurine when I was a child!\u201d I say in astonishment.</p> <p>Koons nods, as if he expected as much. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going for, that sense of familiarity, and you are open to it.

Alas, the city proved less than enthusiastic and high-profile Parisians, including film-maker Olivier Assayas, <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2018/02/23/french-arts-professionals-sign-op-ed-support-jeff-koonss-paris-memorial-victims-terrorist-attacks/\">wrote a spectacularly vicious open letter</a> criticising the \u201cinappropriateness\u201d of the gift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21df7d96e26929db749e4b0b8b3cdf7d747e4c16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21df7d96e26929db749e4b0b8b3cdf7d747e4c16/83_141_3148_4664/675.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Inappropriate\u2019 \u2026 Koons with his Bouquet of Tulips gift to Paris.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Inappropriate\u2019 \u2026 Koons with his Bouquet of Tulips gift to Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhile he may have been brilliant and inventive in the 1980s,\u201d they wrote, \u201cKoons has since become the emblem of an industrial, spectacular and speculative art \u2026 Koons\u2019s studio and dealers are hyper-luxury multinationals, and offering them such prominent visibility and recognition amounts to publicity or product placement.\u201d This controversy roared on until October when a compromise was reached: the work will be installed in front of the Petit Palais, instead of the originally planned and much more prominent position by the Palais de Tokyo.</p> <p>Surely this saga must have irked Koons? He makes a small smile that seems less like an expression of amusement and more like the donning of armour. \u201cI remember back in 1985, I made a show called Equilibrium.

      "bodyText": "\u2018To get great clarity in the balls, you really need to blow them a lot,\u201d says Jeff Koons, with all the solemnity of a man explaining his tax returns. He gazes lovingly at his balls, which in this particular case are a row of stainless steel spheres suitably blown up to bear an astonishing resemblance to his most famous artistic muse: inflatable rubber toys. But given that Koons shot to notoriety with his 1991 series Made in Heaven \u2013 in which he photographed himself and his then girlfriend Ilona Staller in pretty much every sexual position legal in the state of New York \u2013 this ball chat really could have gone another way. Koons, who looks like Pee Wee Herman and talks like Mister Rogers, is taking me around his 10,000 square foot studio in Chelsea, New York. And if you think that sounds big, wait until you hear about his house: he, his wife Justine and their six children (Koons also has two older children from previous relationships) are about to move into their new fixer-upper, which is almost an entire block on the Upper East Side. Koons bought two mega mansions for a total of $35m and spent almost another $5m knocking them together. \u201cIt must be nice to not only be an artist but to be your own Medici,\u201d one of his disgruntled neighbours huffed to the New York Post, and after spending an afternoon with the man himself I can confirm that it does seem very nice indeed. While Koons strolls around in a quietly chic outfit of dark blue patterned shirt and blue trousers, young people in white coats skitter around doing what looks to me like most of the work: painting, sculpting, blowtorching. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not on each piece labouring over it,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m overseeing each one tremendously.\u201d Without help, he explains, he \u201cwould be able to make only one sculpture every few years. It\u2019s about the gesture, that\u2019s where the art is. It\u2019s being able to work with people and to articulate ideas the same way you articulate your fingers.\u201d Koons, until very recently the world\u2019s most expensive living artist, has the calm, unruffled air that, in New York, is generally only found in the heavily medicated. But in him, it seems more like the zen of a man who has all but the licence to print money. His works sell for multimillions. Art collector Peter Brant bought one of my favourite pieces by Koons \u2013 Puppy, a 40ft west highland terrier made out of flowers \u2013 and spends $75,000 a year just maintaining it. \u201cKoons,\u201d read one recent, and typical, critical assessment, \u201chas made his name manufacturing toys for rich old boys.\u201d Of course, Koons hates this kind of chat. \u201cThe rest of the world talks so much about money,\u201d he says, \u201cand one of the reasons is I think they feel uncomfortable talking about art. So if they\u2019re writing about art, and they don\u2019t really want to talk about art, then they talk about money \u2013 and it\u2019s like, \u2018Whew! I didn\u2019t have to talk about art!\u2019\u201d To which it\u2019s tempting to respond: \u201cSure, Jeff, but it\u2019s kinda hard to see the art when it has a $58m price tag hanging off its neck.\u201d This was Koons\u2019s Balloon Dog (Orange) which in 2013 fetched what was then the highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist. But the day after our interview, David Hockney\u2019s Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures) was sold for $90m and Koons lost his title. Still, who cares about money? Koons\u2019s claim to think only about higher things would, however, be a little more credible if he didn\u2019t literally pink with excitement when we talk about the recent sale of the Edward Hopper painting Chop Suey: \u201cNinety-one million dollars! Wow!\u201d We\u2019re meeting because Koons is preparing for his first big show in the UK since his 2009 exhibition at the Serpentine in London. I loved that show, with its re-creations of giant inflatable toys made from stainless steel and ludicrous Popeye paintings. (\u201cArt for people with short attention spans,\u201d Adrian Searle wrote in the Guardian. Hi!) But was it fun? No question \u2013 and it\u2019s even more fun seeing those pieces and many more closeup in his studio. His famous inflatable pieces are so realistic that when I reach out to squeeze what looks like a blowup plastic seal and find myself touching cold hard steel instead, the sensory confusion makes me burst out laughing. Scattered through the maze-like rooms in the studio are re-creations of his giant \u201cporcelain\u201d figures, also made from stainless steel. One, an especially kitschy image of two deer rubbing their noses together, looks like the kind of thing a little girl would pick out for herself in an airport giftshop in the 1980s, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. \u201cI had that figurine when I was a child!\u201d I say in astonishment. Koons nods, as if he expected as much. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going for, that sense of familiarity, and you are open to it. The reason I work with readymades\u201d \u2013 meaning already existing objects \u2013 \u201cis to remove judgment and hierarchy. Every object is a metaphor for yourself.\u201d In what way? \u201cI try to make work to make you think everything is perfect in itself. It\u2019s all a metaphor.\u201d What this response may lack in explanation, it more than makes up for in brilliant deflection \u2013 and if there\u2019s one thing Koons is genuinely great at, it\u2019s deflecting criticism. In early 2018, he announced that he was giving one of his sculptures \u2013 Bouquet of Tulips, which depicts a giant hand grasping some 38ft-high balloon flowers \u2013 to Paris as \u201ca symbol of remembrance, optimism and healing\u201d after the terrorist attacks in 2015. Alas, the city proved less than enthusiastic and high-profile Parisians, including film-maker Olivier Assayas, wrote a spectacularly vicious open letter criticising the \u201cinappropriateness\u201d of the gift. \u201cWhile he may have been brilliant and inventive in the 1980s,\u201d they wrote, \u201cKoons has since become the emblem of an industrial, spectacular and speculative art \u2026 Koons\u2019s studio and dealers are hyper-luxury multinationals, and offering them such prominent visibility and recognition amounts to publicity or product placement.\u201d This controversy roared on until October when a compromise was reached: the work will be installed in front of the Petit Palais, instead of the originally planned and much more prominent position by the Palais de Tokyo. Surely this saga must have irked Koons? He makes a small smile that seems less like an expression of amusement and more like the donning of armour. \u201cI remember back in 1985, I made a show called Equilibrium. A review came out and it looked at it in not such a positive light. I was really surprised because my intentions were so good. I think I learned early on that people just take positions without knowing everything, and these things can gain a momentum.

Investors in QuadrigaCX, Canada\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, were unable to access their funds after its founder, Gerald Cotten, died last year. According to a court filing first reported by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news and events company, Jennifer Robertson, identified as Cotten\u2019s widow, said the exchange owes its customers roughly C$250m (US$190m) in cash and cryptocurrency held in its \u201ccold storage\u201d. \u201cQuadriga\u2019s inventory of cryptocurrency has become unavailable and some of it may be lost,\u201d Robertson wrote in the filing. Cotten, 30, died in India last December from complications from Crohn\u2019s disease, according to the company. He was in India \u201copening an orphanage to provide a home and safe refuge for children in need\u201d. The news followed a decision by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) to freeze $28m of assets held by Quadriga after saying it was unable to identify the real owners of the funds.

He added: \u201cIt\u2019s the Burgesses coming at parliament, it\u2019s the great reform bill, it\u2019s the bill of rights, it\u2019s Waterloo, it\u2019s Agincourt, it\u2019s Cr\u00e9cy.

      "bodyText": "A Conservative MP came under fire this weekend after invoking the second world war in a statement about the way the \u201cungrateful\u201d EU treats the UK on Twitter. Daniel Kawczynski, the representative for Shrewsbury, claimed Britain received no money from the Marshall plan, an American initiative agreed in 1948 to give $12bn to help rebuild western Europe. In reality, Britain received around 20% of the money, more than any other country. But Kawczynski, who has previously criticised Germany for unpaid war reparations despite the Foreign Office\u2019s decision to waiver the UK\u2019s right to compensation, isn\u2019t the first politician to have used war analogies to describe Brexit proceedings: Mark Francois Last week, the leave-backing MP for Rayleigh and Wickford utilised his father\u2019s second world war experiences to criticise the German CEO of Airbus during an impassioned live BBC interview. Before ripping up a letter penned by Tom Enders, who warned the aerospace giant could be forced to close its factories if we leave the EU without a deal, Francois said: \u201cMy father, Reginald Francois, was a D-Day veteran. He never submitted to bullying by any German and neither will his son.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg The high-profile chair of the Brexit-backing European Research Group and Conservative MP for North East Somerset is also disposed to referencing past British victories against EU countries. At a fringe event in October 2017, Rees-Mogg emphasised the importance of Brexit by declaring it as the \u201cMagna Carta\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s the Burgesses coming at parliament, it\u2019s the great reform bill, it\u2019s the bill of rights, it\u2019s Waterloo, it\u2019s Agincourt, it\u2019s Cr\u00e9cy. We win all of these things.\u201d After a member of the audience yelled \u201cTrafalgar!\u201d Rees-Mogg replied: \u201cAnd Trafalgar, absolutely.\u201d David Davis Comments by then Brexit secretary that if \u201cour civil service can cope with world war II it can easily cope with this\u201d, prompted Garry Graham, the deputy general secretary of Prospect, a trade union which represents civil servants, to point out a flaw in his logic. \u201cDavid Davis has sought to invoke the Blitz spirit in his argument that the civil service needs no more resources to deal with the challenges of Brexit,\u201d said Graham. \u201cBetween 1939 and 1944 the non-industrial civil service increased numbers by 404,000 \u2013 a figure greater than the current civil service.\u201d Andrew Adonis Though Remainers have deployed war rhetoric on a lesser scale, last December Adonis tweeted that Jeremy Corbyn should be \u201cmore Attlee please\u201d in terms of having the courage to back a People\u2019s Vote. \u201cWhen Attlee as Leader of the Opposition pulled the plug on Chamberlain &amp; appeasement in May 1940 &amp; installed Churchill \u2013 the situation which the crisis most resembles \u2013 he didn\u2019t look at opinion polls but acted on the best interests of the country,\u201d wrote Adonis. Boris Johnson Perhaps the most ill-considered war rhetoric was used by Johnson in May 2016, when he argued in a Telegraph interview that the EU were trying to create a superstate like Hitler had. \u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d said Johnson.",

      "bodyText": "British households have grown more pessimistic about the state of the economy and their own personal finances, according to official figures, amid rising debt levels and faster income growth for the richest in society. Pulling together an assessment of personal and economic wellbeing data for the first time, the Office for National Statistics said the benefits from parts of the British economy that were performing strongly were not being felt by all. Despite unemployment being at the lowest level since the mid-1970s and the return of real growth in household disposable income, measurements of personal wellbeing were in stagnation, while people\u2019s perception of the future were worsening. According to the ONS, household debt per head stood at 133% of income in the third quarter of 2018, reflecting how families have slipped further into the red to maintain their spending as living costs rise. Spending by UK households surged to a 13-year high in the year ending March 2018 as rising transport and housing costs, and higher food bills took their toll, according to official figures published last week. Glenn Everett, the head of inequalities at the ONS, said: \u201cDespite high levels of employment, rising incomes and spending across UK households, people are not reporting increases in their wellbeing. \u201cThis may be due to worries about rising debt repayments, which could be driving concerns about their future financial situation.\u201d The ONS also said that between 2011 and 2016 average income for the bottom fifth of households increased by 4.8%, while it rose at a faster rate of 6.7% for the richest fifth in Britain. It also found that households living in social-rented accommodation received 50% of their income from cash benefits, which have risen only slowly, while households that own their home outright receive a larger proportion of income from pensions, which have risen more strongly. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, argued that the data showed the \u201cunequal nature of the economy under the Tories\u201d. He said: \u201cThis should come as a wake-up call to a complacent and out-of-touch government recklessly heading towards a catastrophic no-deal Brexit while households are having to go into the red to get by.\u201d Household spending has risen since the middle of 2016, helped by all-time-high debt levels, although income levels have remained flat, the ONS said.

Three of the seven races currently have an odds-on favourite but there are some competitive contests elsewhere on the card including a handicap hurdle as the getting-out race which will set off \u201cbad each-way\u201d alerts across the betting industry if the current 16 runners all go to post. Silver Quay (4.45) might look a little short at around 9-4 given the numbers but there is not much depth to the contest and he was a convincing winner of a similar race over course and distance last time out. Having Bryony Frost on your side aboard her father Jimmy\u2019s runner is also a big plus. Touch Kick (4.15) is another course winner, albeit over hurdles, and won his seasonal debut at Hereford in November off a mark just 2lb lower than here. He could find a little more improvement for this step up to three miles. A \u00a319,000 conditions event is the feature event on the all-weather card at Wolverhampton and Oh This Is Us (5.55) could be up to giving away 3lb to his field. Richard Hannon\u2019s runner has not been to the track since a sub-par run in Italy in October but he won after a similar break last February and Ryan Moore\u2019s booking looks significant. Prerogative (6.25) and Hanakotoba (7.55) should both go well on the same card while Billyoakes (3.30) could be overpriced for the sprint handicap at Chelmsford.",

Researchers in Belgium found that people with depression had consistently low levels of bacteria known as Coprococcus and Dialister whether they took antidepressants or not. If the preliminary finding stands up to further scrutiny, it could pave the way for new treatments for mental health disorders based on probiotics that boost levels of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in the intestines. Jeroen Raes of the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and the Catholic University of Leuven drew on medical tests and GP records to look for links between depression, quality of life and microbes lurking in the faeces of more than 1,000 people enrolled in the Flemish Gut Flora Project. He found that two kinds of bugs, namely Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus, were both more common in people who claimed to enjoy a high mental quality of life. Meanwhile, those with depression had lower than average levels of Coprococcus and Dialister. The study reported in Nature Microbiology does not prove that gut microbes affect mental health.

Microbes that live outside the body, for example those found in soils, are not able to make the same kinds of neurotransmitters, Raes said, perhaps because they did not co-evolve with humans and learned to benefit from tapping into their host\u2019s nervous system. If low levels of the bacteria are to blame for at least some depression, it opens the door to probiotic treatments that boost their populations in the gut. But Raes said the connection has to be proved first. That will involve growing the bugs in the lab to see what substances they make, testing their effects in animals, and treating them with tailored probiotics. Only then could scientists consider human trials. In two separate reports, both published in Nature Biotechnology, scientists in China and a UK-Australian collaboration describe how they sequenced the DNA of more than 100 new species of gut microbes. The work amounts to the most comprehensive list of human gut bacteria to date. The vast catalogue of human gut bugs will help scientists to identify which bacteria are in patients\u2019 bodies and drive research into new treatments for conditions as broad as irritable bowel syndrome, allergies and obesity.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>IT\u2019S ONLY FEBRUARY, BUT ...</strong></h2> <p>There hasn\u2019t been this much talk about Liverpool\u2019s bottle since they kept winning the Milk Cup during the early 80s. But Ronnie Whelan can\u2019t save them now. Last weekend saw victories for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/tottenham-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">The Son Heung-min Team</a> at Wembley \u2013 now <em>there\u2019s</em> a player you can\u2019t do without \u2013 and Manchester City, who defeated Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">a queue of 10 people</a> waiting for a bus, daydreaming, whistling, checking their text messages, rolling a fag, absent-mindedly fiddling with the change in their pockets while scratching the back of their trousers, etc. It won\u2019t be long before Arsenal Fan TV is worth watching again, will it? Anyway, those results have heaped the pressure on J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side at the top of the Premier League, and Ronnie Whelan can\u2019t save them now.</p> <p>OK, so The Fiver isn\u2019t the best at sensing which way the wind is blowing. If we were, we\u2019d have gone to bed at 11.31pm on Sunday night, instead of staying up until 4am watching an insipid attacking meltdown by the LA Rams that made Arsenal\u2019s second-half performance at the Etihad look like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/nov/01/newsstory.sport4\">AS Adema\u2019s masterclass against SO l\u2019Emyrne</a>. But we don\u2019t think Liverpool are losing their heads just yet. After all, they were 0.00000001mm from scoring a game-changing opener in the defeat at City, while against Leicester on Wednesday there was no accounting for the random clacking of the two marbles inside Martin Atkinson\u2019s confused dome. These things happen in football, so you can\u2019t say they\u2019ve gone full 2014 already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/liverpool-premier-league-champions-league-klopp\">Liverpool will not prioritise league title over Champions League, says Klopp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then again, we sense they\u2019ll need to take all three points on offer at West Ham on Monday night, else people really will start to wonder. \u201cIf we win games, and hopefully we win a lot of games, we will see how people deal with it,\u201d said Klopp, attempting to swerve the subject but merely bringing everyone\u2019s attention to it instead. \u201cWe cannot talk week in, week out about the mindset because it will not change.\u201d To further demonstrate this studied insouciance, Klopp insisted his team will go full pelt for Big Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/liverpool-premier-league-champions-league-klopp\">as well as the league</a>, though that argument didn\u2019t thoroughly convince either, given he also announced more leg surgery for Joe Gomez. A blow which, going into the business end of the campaign, places an awful lot of faith in the steady form of Dejan Lovren. Oh Joe!</p> <p>Still, first things first, one thing at a time. Let\u2019s see if they can make a major nerve-settling statement against a Hammers side who will be without danger man Marko Arnau \u2026 ah, seems he might be back ahead of schedule, and raring to go!

Nothing missed his sharp attention: the greenwash of conventional farming labels, the toxicity of widely used weedkillers and the illusion of cheap food. Ed showed that farming could be done in a better way and still be profitable. Born in Oswestry, Shropshire, to Dorothy and David Goff, who were farmers and livestock dealers, he attended Oswestry school. He went to Keele University, Staffordshire, to study geography, graduating in 1966, then gained further qualifications from Walford Agricultural College and Lusaka University in Zambia. He stayed in Zambia for a time, volunteering as a teacher in agricultural science. In 1976, Ed took over the 150-acre family farm, supported by his first wife, Sheila. She died in 2011. He married Margaret Idoux in 2015. Ed was practical, demanding, emotional and caring. He recently told me how lucky he was to have been able to devote his life to what he loved best, working with his herd of Friesian cows. He is survived by Margaret.",

The sculpture is called The Mother and is a representation of her own mum. \u2022 Tracey Emin, A Fortnight of Tears is at White Cube Bermondsey from 6 February-7 April.",

A day after Trump said US soldiers in Iraq would be tasked with monitoring Iran, Barham Salih told reporters at a forum in Baghdad that the US military presence in the country was the result of a bilateral agreement with the specific goal of fighting terrorism. \u201cDon\u2019t overburden Iraq with your own issues,\u201d Salih said on Monday. \u201cThe US is a major power ... but do not pursue your own policy priorities, we live here.\u201d It was of \u201cfundamental interest\u201d for Iraq to have good relations with Iran and other neighbouring countries, Salih added. Combating Iranian influence in the region has emerged as the cornerstone of the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East policy. The US decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under former president Barack Obama, as well as new measures targeting Iran\u2019s oil, banking and shipping industries has left Baghdad caught in the middle of growing tensions between its two biggest allies. In an interview with CBS aired on Sunday evening Trump said Iraq was \u201cperfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,\u201d adding that Iran was a \u201creal problem\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep watching and we\u2019re going to keep seeing and if there\u2019s trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we\u2019re going to know it before they do.\u201d The fortune the US spent on the Ayn al-Assad airbase west of Ramadi must be used effectively and US troops must stay in the region to protect Israel, the president continued. Hassan Karim al-Kaabi, Iraq\u2019s deputy speaker of parliament, said Trump\u2019s latest comments were a \u201cblatant and overt violation of sovereignty and national will\u201d, according to local media. Trump also angered Iraqi politicians in December after a three-hour visit to troops at Ayn al-Assad over Christmas, which did not include meetings with the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, or any other officials. The US is reportedly in negotiations with Baghdad over redeploying some of the 2,000 special forces currently stationed in north-east Syria to American bases in Iraq, following Trump\u2019s surprise decision last December to withdraw from the country. US troops in Kurdish-held Syria \u2013 deployed in the fight against Isis \u2013 have also acted as a buffer between US-allied Kurdish militias and neighbouring Turkey \u2013 which has threatened a full-scale military offensive to dismantle Kurdish groups it says are a terrorist threat. Many analysts believe the decision will serve to strengthen Iran\u2019s presence in Syria, allowing Tehran greater access to oilfields in the north-east and unchecked freedom of movement for Iranian-backed forces in the border region with Iraq.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not normal, that it doesn\u2019t feel right, but Fernando Roig does the opposite of everyone else,\u201d Fernando Roig said \u2013 and this time at least the president of Villarreal wasn\u2019t wrong. Tuesday morning at the old orange grove they made their home and Luis Garc\u00eda was packing up after training, worried about the situation his team was in but satisfied with the session and sure they could survive, when his phone rang. \u201cThings have to change,\u201d he\u2019d said two days before, and things were about to change. Just not <em>that</em> much. And not how he hoped. Fernando Roig Jr was calling with bad news, a message from his dad: Villarreal\u2019s coach was now their ex-coach. And their ex-coach was now their new coach.</p> \n<p>Nineteenth, five points from safety, Villarreal sacked Garc\u00eda on Tuesday after 49 days in charge and replaced him with the man <em>h</em>e had replaced, the same manager they\u2019d sacked just 50 days before. When the players arrived on Wednesday, Bobby Ewing was in the shower and Javier Calleja was on the pitch.Considered not good enough on 10 December, they\u2019d decided that, actually, he was good enough on 30 January. Now it was time to move on, act like he\u2019d never been away, pretend the bit in between hadn\u2019t happened; to cling to the hope the mistake had been identified and rectified and lessons learned. Maybe Calleja had seen from the sofa what he hadn\u2019t seen from the bench. \u201cI\u2019ve watched every game,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/04/bayern-munich-stunned-as-luck-goes-same-way-as-aura-of-invincibility\">Bayern Munich stunned as luck goes same way as aura of invincibility | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He hadn\u2019t watched them win. Calleja had been sacked after a 3-2 defeat against Celta de Vigo on 8 December. It was their seventh defeat of the season, and they had won just three in the entire season. In charge since September 2017, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/dec/19/villarreal-liberated-under-fran-escriba-as-yellow-submarine-enjoys-calmer-waters\">took over from Fran Escrib\u00e1</a>, Calleja finished last season fifth but he was sacked with them 17th this term, having collected 14 points in 15 games. Six games later, though, relegation looked more, not less likely. Under Garc\u00eda, they picked up four points from a possible 18, and were second bottom, increasingly adrift. It was time for another change, to get back to what they know.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a personal decision,\u201d Roig Sr said; it was, some suggested, one Roig Jr, the club\u2019s CEO, didn\u2019t share. It was also one the players knew nothing about: they hadn\u2019t been consulted. And although he had been critical after last week\u2019s defeat against Valencia, insisting it was \u201cabout fucking time\u201d they put a \u201cfist on the desk\u201d, Garc\u00eda was convinced there was no particular reason to sack him, no trigger: no bust-up, no revolt, no irreversible decline. It\u2019s not like things had got dramatically worse under him, either: he\u2019d been brought in for a reason, after all. They\u2019d also been better than results suggested, he thought. Although dreadful against Valencia, they\u2019d lost just one of five before that. Mind you, they\u2019d not won any. In nine games across all competitions, Garc\u00eda won a solitary match.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9061f60d4b9a64ee3c215d195ef384542a1391e7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9061f60d4b9a64ee3c215d195ef384542a1391e7/1192_135_1294_777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javi Calleja has returned to Villarreal after being sacked in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javi Calleja has returned to Villarreal after being sacked in December.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David W \u010cern\u00fd/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So Villarreal went for their third manager of the season, who was also their first, and Garc\u00eda never got the chance to win another. Everyone else felt a little like Calleja had never been away. If the man sitting on the bench against Espanyol on Sunday looked familiar, it\u2019s because he was: he hadn\u2019t even had time to age a bit. The problem was that the result was too, and the way it happened \u2013 a 2-2 draw with Espanyol that was a portrait of Villarreal\u2019s season. Another day, another draw \u2013 that\u2019s ten10 now \u2013 and another round of ammunition unloaded on to their own foot.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an odd situation,\u201d Calleja said when he took over. \u201cBut I\u2019m back because of the players, the faith I have in them, the faith that we can get out of this. If not, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m also here for Villarreal: I won\u2019t leave people hanging and nor will I abandon ship. And I\u2019m here for Roig too: I can\u2019t fail him. If that happens, I will die with him. I will give my life to get us out of here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sunday provided more proof that it won\u2019t be easy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/17/why-villarreal-are-starting-to-get-that-sinking-feeling-again-la-liga-yellow-submarine\">Villarreal are in real trouble</a>. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. \u201cNo one can understand it,\u201d one player says. Their final positions over the last five years read: fifth, fourth, fourth, sixth, sixth \u2013 and, Calleja said \u201cyou don\u2019t lose that overnight\u201d. They have the sixth biggest budget in <em>primera</em> and a salary cap over \u20ac100m. In the summer, they spent \u20ac73m, including \u20ac50m on three strikers: Gerard Moreno, Toto Ekambi and Carlos Bacca. They are \u2013 here it comes \u2013 too good to go down. Only, they\u2019re not. They lost Rodrigo to Atl\u00e9tico and Bruno\u2019s been out for over a year. Moreno, Ekambi and Bacca have just eleven11 goals between them. Almost everyone is underperforming. And at the back they\u2019re embarrassingly weak.\u201cIncredible,\u201d oneanother player admits.</p> \n<p>Then there are the other doubts, hinted at by the change of coach, the attempt to turn back time. Doubts about what exactly it is they are, what they\u2019re trying to do and trying to be. \u201cTeams that are down there have to play a different way; we have to change,\u201d Garc\u00eda had said after the Valencia defeat. Goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo meanwhile demanded \u201c11 warriors\u201d, insisting: \u201cUntil we have that, we won\u2019t get out of there.\u201d But Villarreal don\u2019t have that; and, some inside the squad believe that if relegation is to be decided like that \u2013 \u201con bollocks and all that stuff\u201d \u2013 they will probably lose. Villarreal aren\u2019t built for fighting; they\u2019re built to play. If they are to do it, perhaps it would be better to do it their way, faithful to what they are.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a0e388da12700eed3bd87e369c4ac5b1877f0db\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a0e388da12700eed3bd87e369c4ac5b1877f0db/0_0_2835_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vicente Iborra celebrates after scoring in the game against Espanyol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vicente Iborra celebrates after scoring in the game against Espanyol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Domenech Castello/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem is that playing is proving hard too. The ball \u201cburns\u201d, one player says. As the pressure grows so the desire to receive it diminishes: few have the bravery to offer for it. Those who have it find fewer people to pass to, to play with. Good footballers become fearful ones. And so it spirals downwards, fatalism taking hold. How much can an old new coach change that when he is part of the decline too? When Roig announced Calleja\u2019s return, he insisted that here was a manager who knows the team, who has experience, and the hope is that he can help them re-find themselves, reinforce an identity, but his experience is as bad as theirs. And some wonder, how much authority can a manager have when six weeks ago his club sacked him?</p> \n<p>Some of Villarreal\u2019s issues are hard to identify. They\u2019re not <em>that</em> bad, only look at the table and they are. Players don\u2019t entirely know what\u2019s wrong. The failure has been systemic, physical, and mental, collective and individual. The misses and mistakes have been multiple, and with every error, every stroke of bad luck, it gets worse.The good things they do are gone in seconds, the risk of it being taken away never deserting them, nerves increasing. Garc\u00eda\u2019s time in charge had begun with a 2-2 draw against Huesca in which they conceded in the 94th minute; against Athletic they scored an own goal in a 1-1 draw; against Getafe, they conceded in the 89th minute. Only five teams have taken more shots or had more of the ball than them, but only two have a worse conversion rate and only two have allowed more shots.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/04/juventus-are-well-clear-in-serie-a-albeit-with-mounting-sense-of-concern\">Juventus are well clear in Serie A, albeit with mounting sense of concern | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe feel like we have to do so much to win games; our opponents don\u2019t need much to do us a lot of damage,\u201d Vicente Iborra said. And here\u2019s the thing: he didn\u2019t say that back then, he said that now. His said that on Sunday lunchtime, <em>after</em> Calleja\u2019s first game back, the same old manager living through the same old things, waking up one morning in the Cherry StreetTree Inn Bed and Breakfast, Punxsutawney, along with everyone else.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis parenthesis has been good for me to reflect, to self-analyse, see where I might\u2019ve gone wrong,\u201d Calleja said, and there was a new formation on Sunday, Villarreal shifting to three centre-backs, but in the end it wasn\u2019t just him that was familiar; the whole thing was. In the middle of midfield, Santi Cazorla dominated. Villarreal created chances. Espanyol, the team who\u2019d collected just three of the previous 30 points, couldn\u2019t get control. With 15 minutes to go, Calleja\u2019s team were 2-0 up, a goal each from Iborra and Cazorla. It was done, except that if they\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that it\u2019s never done. And, as the balance tilted, it happened again. Asenjo spilled a simple shot and Daniele Bonera, playing his first league game, scored an avoidable own goal. Then, with eight minutes left, Roberto Rosales bent in a brilliant equaliser.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092026135192444929\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Santi Cazorla delivers, Vicente Iborra finishes \ud83d\udc9b<br><br>Villarreal have the lead! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLiga?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLiga</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CNvYwOiMGB\">pic.twitter.com/CNvYwOiMGB</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092026135192444929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092039678667247616\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>Espanyol are back in it, and in bizarre fashion... <br><br>Villrreal's Daniele Bonera has followed up the free-kick into his own net \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/AFYkW3ttDy\">pic.twitter.com/AFYkW3ttDy</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092039678667247616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092040379296305154\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAL! | <br><br>WHAT A FINISH \ud83d\udcaf<br><br>Roberto Rosales has netted a beauty to pull Espanyol level against Villarreal! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLiga?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLiga</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/p7do0dKsOB\">pic.twitter.com/p7do0dKsOB</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092040379296305154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Garc\u00eda\u2019s first game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/17/why-villarreal-are-starting-to-get-that-sinking-feeling-again-la-liga-yellow-submarine\">had finished 2-2</a> against the worst team in Spain all season, a late goal denying them victory; Calleja\u2019s first game back had finished 2-2 against the worst team in Spain over the last 10 games, a late goal denying them victory.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI know it\u2019s not normal, that it doesn\u2019t feel right, but Fernando Roig does the opposite of everyone else,\u201d Fernando Roig said \u2013 and this time at least the president of Villarreal wasn\u2019t wrong. Tuesday morning at the old orange grove they made their home and Luis Garc\u00eda was packing up after training, worried about the situation his team was in but satisfied with the session and sure they could survive, when his phone rang. \u201cThings have to change,\u201d he\u2019d said two days before, and things were about to change. Just not that much. And not how he hoped. Fernando Roig Jr was calling with bad news, a message from his dad: Villarreal\u2019s coach was now their ex-coach. And their ex-coach was now their new coach. Nineteenth, five points from safety, Villarreal sacked Garc\u00eda on Tuesday after 49 days in charge and replaced him with the man he had replaced, the same manager they\u2019d sacked just 50 days before. When the players arrived on Wednesday, Bobby Ewing was in the shower and Javier Calleja was on the pitch.Considered not good enough on 10 December, they\u2019d decided that, actually, he was good enough on 30 January. Now it was time to move on, act like he\u2019d never been away, pretend the bit in between hadn\u2019t happened; to cling to the hope the mistake had been identified and rectified and lessons learned. Maybe Calleja had seen from the sofa what he hadn\u2019t seen from the bench. \u201cI\u2019ve watched every game,\u201d he said. He hadn\u2019t watched them win. Calleja had been sacked after a 3-2 defeat against Celta de Vigo on 8 December. It was their seventh defeat of the season, and they had won just three in the entire season. In charge since September 2017, when he took over from Fran Escrib\u00e1, Calleja finished last season fifth but he was sacked with them 17th this term, having collected 14 points in 15 games. Six games later, though, relegation looked more, not less likely. Under Garc\u00eda, they picked up four points from a possible 18, and were second bottom, increasingly adrift. It was time for another change, to get back to what they know. \u201cThis is a personal decision,\u201d Roig Sr said; it was, some suggested, one Roig Jr, the club\u2019s CEO, didn\u2019t share. It was also one the players knew nothing about: they hadn\u2019t been consulted. And although he had been critical after last week\u2019s defeat against Valencia, insisting it was \u201cabout fucking time\u201d they put a \u201cfist on the desk\u201d, Garc\u00eda was convinced there was no particular reason to sack him, no trigger: no bust-up, no revolt, no irreversible decline. It\u2019s not like things had got dramatically worse under him, either: he\u2019d been brought in for a reason, after all. They\u2019d also been better than results suggested, he thought. Although dreadful against Valencia, they\u2019d lost just one of five before that. Mind you, they\u2019d not won any. In nine games across all competitions, Garc\u00eda won a solitary match. So Villarreal went for their third manager of the season, who was also their first, and Garc\u00eda never got the chance to win another. Everyone else felt a little like Calleja had never been away. If the man sitting on the bench against Espanyol on Sunday looked familiar, it\u2019s because he was: he hadn\u2019t even had time to age a bit. The problem was that the result was too, and the way it happened \u2013 a 2-2 draw with Espanyol that was a portrait of Villarreal\u2019s season. Another day, another draw \u2013 that\u2019s ten10 now \u2013 and another round of ammunition unloaded on to their own foot. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd situation,\u201d Calleja said when he took over. \u201cBut I\u2019m back because of the players, the faith I have in them, the faith that we can get out of this. If not, I wouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m also here for Villarreal: I won\u2019t leave people hanging and nor will I abandon ship. And I\u2019m here for Roig too: I can\u2019t fail him. If that happens, I will die with him. I will give my life to get us out of here.\u201d Sunday provided more proof that it won\u2019t be easy. Villarreal are in real trouble. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. \u201cNo one can understand it,\u201d one player says. Their final positions over the last five years read: fifth, fourth, fourth, sixth, sixth \u2013 and, Calleja said \u201cyou don\u2019t lose that overnight\u201d. They have the sixth biggest budget in primera and a salary cap over \u20ac100m. In the summer, they spent \u20ac73m, including \u20ac50m on three strikers: Gerard Moreno, Toto Ekambi and Carlos Bacca. They are \u2013 here it comes \u2013 too good to go down. Only, they\u2019re not. They lost Rodrigo to Atl\u00e9tico and Bruno\u2019s been out for over a year. Moreno, Ekambi and Bacca have just eleven11 goals between them. Almost everyone is underperforming. And at the back they\u2019re embarrassingly weak.\u201cIncredible,\u201d oneanother player admits. Then there are the other doubts, hinted at by the change of coach, the attempt to turn back time. Doubts about what exactly it is they are, what they\u2019re trying to do and trying to be. \u201cTeams that are down there have to play a different way; we have to change,\u201d Garc\u00eda had said after the Valencia defeat. Goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo meanwhile demanded \u201c11 warriors\u201d, insisting: \u201cUntil we have that, we won\u2019t get out of there.\u201d But Villarreal don\u2019t have that; and, some inside the squad believe that if relegation is to be decided like that \u2013 \u201con bollocks and all that stuff\u201d \u2013 they will probably lose. Villarreal aren\u2019t built for fighting; they\u2019re built to play. If they are to do it, perhaps it would be better to do it their way, faithful to what they are. The problem is that playing is proving hard too. The ball \u201cburns\u201d, one player says. As the pressure grows so the desire to receive it diminishes: few have the bravery to offer for it. Those who have it find fewer people to pass to, to play with. Good footballers become fearful ones. And so it spirals downwards, fatalism taking hold. How much can an old new coach change that when he is part of the decline too? When Roig announced Calleja\u2019s return, he insisted that here was a manager who knows the team, who has experience, and the hope is that he can help them re-find themselves, reinforce an identity, but his experience is as bad as theirs. And some wonder, how much authority can a manager have when six weeks ago his club sacked him? Some of Villarreal\u2019s issues are hard to identify. They\u2019re not that bad, only look at the table and they are. Players don\u2019t entirely know what\u2019s wrong. The failure has been systemic, physical, and mental, collective and individual. The misses and mistakes have been multiple, and with every error, every stroke of bad luck, it gets worse.The good things they do are gone in seconds, the risk of it being taken away never deserting them, nerves increasing. Garc\u00eda\u2019s time in charge had begun with a 2-2 draw against Huesca in which they conceded in the 94th minute; against Athletic they scored an own goal in a 1-1 draw; against Getafe, they conceded in the 89th minute. Only five teams have taken more shots or had more of the ball than them, but only two have a worse conversion rate and only two have allowed more shots. \u201cWe feel like we have to do so much to win games; our opponents don\u2019t need much to do us a lot of damage,\u201d Vicente Iborra said. And here\u2019s the thing: he didn\u2019t say that back then, he said that now. His said that on Sunday lunchtime, after Calleja\u2019s first game back, the same old manager living through the same old things, waking up one morning in the Cherry StreetTree Inn Bed and Breakfast, Punxsutawney, along with everyone else. \u201cThis parenthesis has been good for me to reflect, to self-analyse, see where I might\u2019ve gone wrong,\u201d Calleja said, and there was a new formation on Sunday, Villarreal shifting to three centre-backs, but in the end it wasn\u2019t just him that was familiar; the whole thing was. In the middle of midfield, Santi Cazorla dominated. Villarreal created chances. Espanyol, the team who\u2019d collected just three of the previous 30 points, couldn\u2019t get control. With 15 minutes to go, Calleja\u2019s team were 2-0 up, a goal each from Iborra and Cazorla. It was done, except that if they\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that it\u2019s never done. And, as the balance tilted, it happened again. Asenjo spilled a simple shot and Daniele Bonera, playing his first league game, scored an avoidable own goal. Then, with eight minutes left, Roberto Rosales bent in a brilliant equaliser. Garc\u00eda\u2019s first game had finished 2-2 against the worst team in Spain all season, a late goal denying them victory; Calleja\u2019s first game back had finished 2-2 against the worst team in Spain over the last 10 games, a late goal denying them victory. Asked what now, Vicente Iborra shook his head: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cEventually, the day will arrive when we win,\u201d he sighed, but the days slip away, hope does too, and nothing changes, even when it does. Well, almost nothing. \u201cIf I was angry before, I\u2019m angrier now,\u201d Calleja said.",

      "body": "<p>Their lids gleam under the shop lights: bottles made of elegant black or vivid green glass stand alongside white tubes with bold, minimalist lettering. These beauty products make many claims: to \u201cdefy\u201d age, minimise pores, block pollution, plump skin. They promise radiance, illumination, hydration, brightening and perfecting. In many ways, they are no different from the beauty products that have come before them, except that they all claim to be somehow morally better, or cleaner. This is the new era of \u201cclean beauty\u201d \u2013 one that promises \u201cno nasties\u201d, and a \u201cchemical-free\u201d, \u201cnontoxic\u201d skincare regime. It is one that attempts to divide beauty products into good and bad, clean and dirty, toxic and nontoxic. But is there any scientific evidence for this? Do we really need to \u201cclean up\u201d the products we use on our faces? Are the products we may be using harmful \u2013 or is this just another way to sell us (often very expensive) creams that we don\u2019t need?</p> <p>There is certainly money to be made. Women in the UK are spending more than ever on facial skincare. According to the market research firm Mintel, 92% of us use a facial cleanser, 66% a day cream and 48% a night cream (up from 39% in 2017).

According to Guy: \u201cGiven that SLS is still found in many personal care products, this suggests that it is generally being used at sufficiently low levels that irritation is avoided.\u201d While SLS can be made from palm oil or coconut oil, its direct impact on the environment is relatively small as it quickly degrades.</p> <p>What about parabens? Read clean beauty blogs and you\u2019ll learn that they are \u201chormone disruptors\u201d, and have been linked to cancer. Holland &amp; Barrett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/what-is-clean-beauty/\" title=\"\">clean beauty</a> page says that \u201csome research suggests that [parabens] may disrupt the way our bodies work (although parabens haven\u2019t been directly linked to any serious health conditions)\u201d.</p> <p>Research in the area continues, but Cancer Research UK\u2019s website says that while parabens have similarities to oestrogen \u2013 high levels of which can increase the risk of certain cancers \u2013 they are far weaker and \u201cany effects are likely to be overwhelmed by natural oestrogen produced in our body, or similar chemicals found in our diet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK and the EU tightly regulate how chemicals are used in products, and this includes parabens,\u201d says Katie Patrick, a health information officer at Cancer Research UK. \u201cFor most chemicals, what\u2019s important is the dose we\u2019re exposed to. Most things have the potential to cause damage, but only at levels far higher than we\u2019d ever experience in cosmetics or day-to-day life.\u201d</p> <p>Gary Moss, a senior lecturer in pharmaceutics at Keele University, agrees, saying that the skin is very well evolved to keep things out. \u201cParabens can permeate the skin,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it is not just about <em>whether</em> things can get into and through the skin, and therefore into the body, but how <em>much of</em> it can penetrate the skin and at what rate.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Tiffany Masterson, the founder of Drunk Elephant, why she has cut out parabens, and she says: \u201cI don\u2019t think they are bad for you.\u201d So why ditch them? \u201cConsumers don\u2019t want them.\u201d And perhaps it really is that simple.

If you suffer from eczema or sensitive skin, you should avoid essential oils, but most people have nothing to worry about. The problem with blaming people\u2019s skin problems on the products they use is that it \u201ccompletely fails to take into account people\u2019s own hormones and genetics\u201d, she continues. \u201cAll I think that does is create guilt among people who can\u2019t afford to buy these products \u2013 that they are doing something wrong by not spending all this money on \u2018clean\u2019 healthcare, and that is why they have skin issues.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even \u2018clean\u2019 products have the ability to cause sensitivity and allergy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surely, the \u201ccleanest\u201d approach to cosmetics would be to not use any at all. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying that, instead of eating junk food, we just eat nothing,\u201d Masterson says. \u201cI think you need to nourish your skin, I think some skin needs oil and hydration. Younger skin doesn\u2019t need as much, but, importantly, as we mature, our skin cells don\u2019t turn over as rapidly. We can use help with chemical exfoliation, antioxidants are great, physical protection is necessary, you need to cleanse your skin because there is dirt in the environment \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Mahto takes a simpler approach. \u201cWe should all be washing our faces morning and evening,\u201d to remove dirt, she says, adding that as the weather gets colder it can become necessary to moisturise, while sunscreen is important if spending time outdoors in the summer. But she adds it is not necessary \u201cto layer 20 different products on in the morning\u201d.</p> <p>So how did we get here \u2013 to thinking that we need \u201ccleaner\u201d products to put on our faces? \u201cI think people are inherently scared of chemicals and chemical names that they don\u2019t understand, or they can\u2019t read on the backs of their products, and that has led to this kind of drive of: if it is \u2018clean\u2019 and it is \u2018natural\u2019, it is somehow better for you. And that is absolutely not the case,\u201d says Mahto, stressing that it is the concentration and dose of an ingredient that matter most. While \u201cclean beauty\u201d is not bad in itself, \u201cit\u2019s unnecessary\u201d, she says. \u201cIt creates and propagates a myth that \u2018chemicals\u2019 are bad and \u2018clean\u2019 is better or more virtuous.\u201d And this, in turn, leads to a move away from scientific fact. \u201cEven \u2018clean\u2019 products have the ability to cause sensitivity and allergy,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>It seems that when it comes to cutting out ingredients, it\u2019s really just about individual choice. David Colquhoun, a professor of pharmacology at University College London, has no patience for what he calls the cosmetic industry\u2019s \u201cmade-up slogans\u201d. \u201cBut if people have the money and wish to pay for it,\u201d he says, \u201cit is probably not going to harm them.\u201d</p>",

These beauty products make many claims: to \u201cdefy\u201d age, minimise pores, block pollution, plump skin. They promise radiance, illumination, hydration, brightening and perfecting. In many ways, they are no different from the beauty products that have come before them, except that they all claim to be somehow morally better, or cleaner. This is the new era of \u201cclean beauty\u201d \u2013 one that promises \u201cno nasties\u201d, and a \u201cchemical-free\u201d, \u201cnontoxic\u201d skincare regime. It is one that attempts to divide beauty products into good and bad, clean and dirty, toxic and nontoxic. But is there any scientific evidence for this? Do we really need to \u201cclean up\u201d the products we use on our faces? Are the products we may be using harmful \u2013 or is this just another way to sell us (often very expensive) creams that we don\u2019t need? There is certainly money to be made.

A terrific and exciting adventure/thriller story, there&#39;s atmosphere to spare here. Richard Hannay finds himself drawn into a web of conspiracy as Britain looms towards war, and is chased across the moorlands of Scotland and the streets of London in a race against time, a race that will culminate at the mysterious thirty-nine steps... I read a couple of reviews of this on goodreads that said it was &#34;slow&#34;.

The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families. Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900: A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China.

This could allow rivals to use a similar colour for its own chocolate, ending Cadbury\u2019s grip on purple.</p> <p><a href=\"https://gowlingwlg.com/en/people/alexandra-brodie/#panel-button1\"><strong>Alexandra Brodie,</strong> partner at law firm</a><strong><a href=\"https://gowlingwlg.com/en/people/alexandra-brodie/#panel-button1\"> Gowling WLG</a>, </strong>says Cadbury came unstuck because its trade mark was too broad (in the minds of judges anyway).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cadbury and the colour purple have been synonymous in the UK for decades (at least in this chocoholic\u2019s mind!). But, in December of last year the Court of Appeal found for Nestle and held that Cadbury\u2019s attempt to future-proof its trade mark holdings by broadening the description of the mark, registered since 1995, was invalid due to the wording being too broad.</p> <p>Reading the writing on the wall Cadbury, on 28 January 2019, surrendered its mark. Cadbury do still have other \u201cpurple \u201c marks on the register but they suffer from the same defect and so we doubt very much that Cadbury would try to assert them.</p> <p>What does this mean? Well, other chocolate makers can use purple for their chocolate offerings in a hue that is closer to Cadbury\u2019s traditional purple. Of course there have always been other purple chocolate brands such as Milka or Nestle\u2019s Quality Street. Cadbury could still try to enforce its rights in the Cadbury Purple relying on unregistered rights such as \u201cpassing off\u201d but it will be very difficult.</p> <p>The purple reign of Cadbury\u2019s would appear to be over. And whilst this might be the right outcome regarding trade mark law, this Dairy Milk consumer is rather sad.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c583ca8e4b0d86c56438a45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T13:28:13.537Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The UK stock market is just managing to hold onto its early gains, as the weaker pound give exporters a fillip.</strong></p> <p>Most European markets are in the red, though, following the drop in eurozone investor confidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7739103422b7fb0a00fdf6cd44818d54062a3bfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7739103422b7fb0a00fdf6cd44818d54062a3bfe/0_0_869_257/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets\" width=\"500\" height=\"148\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European stock markets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But generally, it\u2019s a quiet start to the new week.</p> <p>Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A minor decline for the pound, one that followed a 10 month low UK construction PMI (which itself comes after last Friday\u2019s troubling manufacturing equivalent), allowed the FTSE to hit a fresh 2 month high.

      "bodyText": "A quick recap: Britain\u2019s building sector has slipped to the brink of stagnation. Activity rose at the slowest pace in 10 months, according to the latest Construction PMI report. Many building firms reported that Brexit uncertainty was deterring clients from signing off on new projects, deterring them hiring more staff. Housebuilding and civil engineering both slowed, while commercial construction fell into a contraction. Eurozone investor confidence has also taken a Brexit knock. Morale is its lowest in four years, according to research group Sentix. Shares in Sony have slumped by 8% after it became the latest technology firm to cut its forecasts. Sony slashed its sales and profit forecasts, amid lower demand for smartphones and lower PlayStation sales. Ryanair\u2019s CEO Michael O\u2019Leary is shifting to a new \u2018group CEO\u2019 role, stepping back from day-to-day control of the budget airline. Shares in the firm have fallen almost 5% today, as it also posted a loss, warned that air fares may not rise this summer, and warned that No-Deal Brexit was a serious risk. Wall Street has opened quietly.... It\u2019s a blue day for Cadbury. The chocolate maker has given up a trade mark that protected the shade of purple - called Pantone 2865c - used to package its wares for decades. Cadbury took the move after losing a trademark case last month, when a court ruled the protection was too wide-ranging. This could allow rivals to use a similar colour for its own chocolate, ending Cadbury\u2019s grip on purple. Alexandra Brodie, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says Cadbury came unstuck because its trade mark was too broad (in the minds of judges anyway). Cadbury and the colour purple have been synonymous in the UK for decades (at least in this chocoholic\u2019s mind!). But, in December of last year the Court of Appeal found for Nestle and held that Cadbury\u2019s attempt to future-proof its trade mark holdings by broadening the description of the mark, registered since 1995, was invalid due to the wording being too broad. Reading the writing on the wall Cadbury, on 28 January 2019, surrendered its mark. Cadbury do still have other \u201cpurple \u201c marks on the register but they suffer from the same defect and so we doubt very much that Cadbury would try to assert them. What does this mean? Well, other chocolate makers can use purple for their chocolate offerings in a hue that is closer to Cadbury\u2019s traditional purple. Of course there have always been other purple chocolate brands such as Milka or Nestle\u2019s Quality Street. Cadbury could still try to enforce its rights in the Cadbury Purple relying on unregistered rights such as \u201cpassing off\u201d but it will be very difficult. The purple reign of Cadbury\u2019s would appear to be over. And whilst this might be the right outcome regarding trade mark law, this Dairy Milk consumer is rather sad. The UK stock market is just managing to hold onto its early gains, as the weaker pound give exporters a fillip. Most European markets are in the red, though, following the drop in eurozone investor confidence. But generally, it\u2019s a quiet start to the new week. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A minor decline for the pound, one that followed a 10 month low UK construction PMI (which itself comes after last Friday\u2019s troubling manufacturing equivalent), allowed the FTSE to hit a fresh 2 month high. Sterling dipped 0.1% against the dollar and the euro, a slip that translated to a 0.3%, 7040-grazing increase for the UK index. The Eurozone, which saw an unexpected drop in Sentix investor confidence, wasn\u2019t looking too well. The DAX lost 0.3%, forcing the German index back under 11150, while the CAC was down half a percent, a move that dragged it below 5000. Anxiety over Brexit is also wafting over the eurozone. Investor confidence in the single currency region has dropped lowest level since November 2014, according to research group Sentix. Its investor sentiment index for the euro zone slid to -3.7 in February, from -1.5 in January. That\u2019s the 6th monthly decline in a row, and much worse than the -0.6 expected by City analysts. Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner warned that Britain\u2019s looming exit from the EU was worrying business leaders, especially as they don\u2019t know what deal - if any - the UK will leave with. \u201cThe main reason for this development is increasingly likely to be Brexit, which is getting closer. Given the unclear political situation, businesses now have to grapple with contingency plans. The slump in construction growth underlines the need to urgently resolve Brexit, says the Federation of Small Businesses. FSB National Chairman Mike Cherry says small firms have plenty of problems to overcome, even without worrying about Brexit: \u201cSpiralling employment costs, skills shortages and a weak pound have made it increasingly tough for small construction firms to grow in recent years. \u201cToday\u2019s PMI brings into sharp relief the impact that political uncertainty is having on one of our most important sectors. \u201cSmall business confidence is at a seven-year low. Two-thirds of firms are not planning to increase investment and, with inward migration from the EU down, more than a third say lack of the right staff is holding them back. A lot of small construction firms rely heavily on mid-skilled employees from Europe. \u201cTo be less than 60 days out from Brexit day and still have no idea what business environment we\u2019ll be operating in on 30 March is completely debilitating. Politicians from all sides of the house must work together to end the impasse. \u201cCome the beginning of April, small construction firms will not only have Brexit to think about but also Making Tax Digital, rising pressure on wages, higher auto-enrolment contributions and further business rates hikes. It\u2019s a flashpoint that could threaten the futures of many.\u201d Today\u2019s disappointing UK construction PMI follows a weak manufacturing report on Friday, which showed growth at a three-month low despite a burst of Brexit stockpiling. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says those two reports suggest the UK economy got off to a poor start to 2019. Here\u2019s Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, on the UK construction slowdown: \u201cThe construction sector suffered its second monthly fall in a row down to 50.6, but scraped in just above the growth threshold of 50.0 which was an achievement in itself given the festive seasonal slowdown and the gloomy political and business backdrop. \u201cWith two months left until the UK leaves the EU and no clear deal in sight, confidence in the construction sector on several levels is in short supply. \u201cSmall residential building contractors, the lifeblood of the sector which have skin in the game on a personal level, are minding their costs carefully and are not committing to building new units until they are certain that they have sold the properties they have already finished. Max Jones, relationship director in Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking\u2019s infrastructure and construction team, reports that London-based builders are suffering particularly badly from Brexit jitters: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a pivotal year for the UK and Brexit is coming up more and more in conversations with construction clients, as they express concerns that projects are increasingly being affected by the uncertainty. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that this appears to be feeding through to the PMI reading. \u201cLondon feels particularly exposed, with evidence clients are holding off in the commercial sub-sector in particular until there is more clarity over the final terms of the agreement with the EU. While the suggestion is that regional cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh are more buoyant, it\u2019s not clear that there is enough activity to pick up the slack from the capital. Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at MHA MacIntyre Hudson, says larger construction companies are particularly at risk from Brexit, because of their greater dependence on European labour: \u201cThere\u2019s no getting away from construction\u2019s dependence on European workers and materials, and it\u2019s actually the larger companies with the biggest problem. \u201cSmaller regional firms tend to employ less European labour, and treat their subcontractors akin to regular employees. The larger the company, the more likely it is to bid for irregular contract work and to depend on European workers. As Brexit looms ever closer the labour supply looks likely to shrink, leaving the bigger companies in more difficulty than their smaller regional counterparts. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is particularly worried that UK builders are taking on fewer new staff. He says: The biggest shock came in the form of job creation which has managed to suffer the slings and arrows of Brexit highs and lows with solid hiring since the referendum result. Employment rose at the slowest rate since July 2016 and with optimism also in short supply, the sector only needs a small nudge to tip it closer to recession.\u201d According to Markit, UK housebuilding growth weakened to a 10-month low last month, while commercial construction actually contracted. Today\u2019s construction report is weaker than expected, says Andy Bruce of Reuters: Here\u2019s Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, on the sharp slowdown across UK building firms last month: \u201cUK construction growth shifted down a gear at the start of 2019, with weaker conditions signalled across all three main categories of activity. Commercial work declined for the first time in ten months as concerns about the domestic economic outlook continued to hold back activity. The latest survey also revealed a loss of momentum for house building and civil engineering, although these areas of the construction sector at least remained on a modest growth path. \u201cStaff recruitment slowed to a crawl in January, with construction firms reporting the softest rate of job creation since July 2016. Delays to client decision- making on new projects in response to Brexit uncertainty was cited as a key source of anxiety at the start of 2019. Difficulties converting opportunities to sales were reflected in a slowdown in total new business growth to its lowest since last May. Brexit anxiety is also deterring UK building firms from hiring new staff. According to Markit, employment growth across Britain\u2019s construction sector hit its lowest level since July 2016 (immediately after the EU referendum). Markit adds: New orders increased only marginally at the start of 2019, which contributed to the slowest expansion of employment numbers for two-and- a-half years. A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit uncertainty had led to hesitancy among clients and a corresponding slowdown in progress on new projects. Newsflash: Growth across Britain\u2019s building firms has hit a 10-month low, as Brexit anxiety hurts the sector. Data firm Markit has reported that its construction PMI, which tracks activity, fell to just 50.6 in January, down from 52.8 in December. That\u2019s much weaker than expected, and close to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It\u2019s the weakest reading since March 2018 (when bad weather made it hard for builders to work) A number of builders interviewed by Markit reported that Brexit uncertainty had created hesitancy among clients, who were unwilling to sign of on new projects. Markit says: All three categories of construction output recorded weaker trends than those reported in December. Residential work was the strongest performing area, although the latest expansion was only modest and the slowest seen since March 2018. Civil engineering activity increased marginally, with the rate of growth much softer than December\u2019s 19-month high More to follow It\u2019s another turbulent morning for Ryanair\u2019s investors. Shares in the budget airline have fallen 4%, after it posted a third-quarter loss of \u20ac19.6m and warned that the risk of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal is worryingly high. High-profile founder Michael O\u2019Leary is shifting to a new role of group chief executive, with a five-year contract - despite claiming last year that his wife wouldn\u2019t want him to stay on that long.... Over in the City, the UK\u2019s blue-chip stock index has nudged a new two-month high. The FTSE 100 has gained 21 points to 7040, its highest level since early December. Oil companies are leading the way, with Shell up 1.6% and BT up 1.1%, following a pick-up in oil prices. Shares are also benefiting from a small drop in sterling. The pound has lost 0.2% to $1.305, as traders watch the Brexit crisis play out. Sony isn\u2019t the only Japanese electronics giant suffering right now. Panasonic has just reported a 22% slump in third-quarter operating profit, and cut its sales and profit forecasts. It warned that demand for appliances and industrial kit in China has weakened - another signal that the US-China trade war is hurting. This helped to drag Panasonic\u2019s operating profits down to 97.6 billion yen ($889.05 million) for the October-December quarter, down from 120.1 billion yen a year ago, and much lower than expected. Sony is also smarting from another weak performance at its phone division. Its mobile division made an operating loss of 15.5 billion yen during the last three months, the fourth quarterly decline in a row. Bloomberg points out that Sony\u2019s camera chips business is also suffering from weaker global demand for smartphones. Operating profit in chips fell 23 percent to 46.5 billion yen. Guidance for the division is now lower, at 130 billion yen for the current fiscal year, from October\u2019s forecast of 140 billion yen. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, is worried about Sony\u2019s prospects. He told CNBC that today\u2019s 8% share price tumble shows thecompany\u2019s portfolio \u201cis in trouble, adding. [Sony] is in \u201chighly competitive areas with declining unit sales and margin. They have a bad hand and need to change ... their portfolio. Several analysts are concerned by the drop in PlayStation sales (to 8.1m over the crucial holiday quarter, from 9m in Q4 2017). Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Group, says Sony is having to spend more to promote its gaming console: \u201cStrong profits from game software were offset by higher promotional and marketing costs aimed at driving PS4 volumes. We are moving to the sidelines until we can better assess the risks in the Games segment.\u201d Amir Anvarzadeh, an analyst at Asymmetric Advisors, suspects Sony could be preparing to release a next-generation console - an expensive operation. \u201cThere is more downside as we believe slowing growth in its games division signals a very likely PS5 launch for next fiscal year and the ensuing costs that come with the launch of a new platform.\u201d Bloomberg has more details: Sony Sees Biggest Drop Since 2015 on Weaker PlayStation Business Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Sony\u2019s slogan, \u201cBe Moved\u201d, is inspired by the emotional impact of technology, and the power of smartphones, gaming devices, cameras and speakers. Unfortunately, the only thing being moved right now is Sony\u2019s share price, which is tumbling after the electronics giant became the latest tech company to warn that conditions are deteriorating. Sony spooked investors by cutting its sales outlook for the year, warning that demand for smartphones in Japan, Europe and East Asia was weaker than expected. It also warned that sales for its camera business will probably miss forecasts, due to disappointing demand. In another blow, profits at Sony\u2019s gaming business fell 14%. Sales of its flagship PlayStation 4 (PS4) gaming console dropped to 8.1 million units in the last quarter, down from 9 million a year ago. Although Sony insisted this was in line with forecasts, analysts are worried that the company\u2019s gaming division - a key source of profits - is cooling. As Leo Sun of The Motley Fool put it: \u201cInvestors are disappointed with Sony\u2019s declining operating profits at its core gaming division.\u201d Overall, Sony lowered its sales outlook for the current financial year (to March) to 8.5 trillion yen, from 8.7 trillion yen. Operating profit is expected to come in at 870 billion yen, compared with analysts\u2019 projections for 884 billion yen on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Traders hammered the sell button, sending Sony\u2019s shares down 8% today - the biggest fall since 2015. As one of the world\u2019s largest consumer electronics companies, Sony is an important bellwether of the global economy. Chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki certainly gave us reasons to worry. He warned that the smartphone market was suffering from a \u201charsh business environment\u201d, citing geopolitical tensions and China\u2019s slowing economy, adding: We cannot be too optimistic about the future since several macroeconomic and geopolitical risks have emerged since the second half of last year, including the smartphone market.\u201d Also coming up today World stock markets are making a slow start to the new week. After strong US jobs figures last Friday, investors are wondering whether the US economy is in stronger shape than expected. The FTSE 100 is expected to open flat, after ending last week at a two-month high of 7020 points. On the economics front, we get a health-check on Britain\u2019s building sector. Economists predict that Markit\u2019s monthly construction PMI will show slowing growth (dipping to 52.5 from 52.8).

His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories.

His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career.

McCullin revisits his own work over and over again, as he prints and reprints his images in his darkroom, repeatedly trying to tease the best from his negatives. His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories. The words \u201cnegatives\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d have rarely felt so freighted. Many of McCullin\u2019s photographs demand a long, strong look. Others we might want to swerve away from almost at the moment of recognition, only needing to see them once. They are already fixed in the developing fluid of the subconscious. Many of us of a certain age will have first encountered McCullin\u2019s photographs by chance through the 1960s and 70s, in the Observer, in the Sunday Times Magazine. Many have been stirring around in my head for most of my life, irreducible and unforgettable. McCullin\u2019s images brought the Vietnam war, starvation in Biafra, civil wars, post-colonial and nearer-to-home sectarian conflicts in Derry and Belfast, into our houses and into our heads in a way that television coverage never could. Sometimes McCullin had to walk away. Sometimes I had to walk away from certain images, too. After a few rooms, I had to take a break from the grieving and the corpses, the starving and the terrified. Our hunger for images may be insatiable, but it becomes hard to concentrate and to give each image, taken at who knows what cost, its due. There is a visceral quality to McCullin\u2019s photographs, in their analogue tonalities, the depth of their blacks and greys, the clarities and dimming of their whites, their strong and weak light, their focus, their attendance on the unconscionable. His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career. Conflict was always round the corner for McCullin, even growing up in low-ceilinged rooms and poverty in Finsbury Park. Down the road, a man shepherds a flock to an abattoir through a grim north London dawn. Where the homeless stood around reeking fires of rubbish in Spitalfields market half a century ago, they sleep in corporate doorways now. The wars continue. There is no end to the poverty, nor to the atrocities. Looking away is not an option. At Tate Britain, London, from 5 February to 6 May",

I saw the man who parked his car. He was thin and young. After 20 minutes it exploded. I was pushed to the wall. I thought I was dead. Smoke and dark dust shut my sight,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said the bombing targeted local administrators.</p> <p>The attacks came three weeks after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/16/kenyan-president-says-nairobi-attack-over-all-militants-killed-al-shabaab\">deadly assault by the group on a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi</a>, in neighbouring Kenya.</p> <p>The US embassy on Monday issued a warning to its citizens about an ongoing threat from Islamic extremists in the east African country.</p> <p>Yusuf Mohamed, the governor of Puntland\u2019s Bari region, told Reuters news agency that two men disguised as fishermen had shot Formosa as he was going to the port.</p> <p>He was killed \u201cin the fish market as he was going to Bossaso port this morning. The men armed with pistols hit him [with] several bullets in the head,\u201d Mohamed said.</p> <p>P&amp;O Ports said an employee had died and three others were injured in an \u201cincident\u201d, without giving further details. The company was cooperating with the Puntland authorities in its investigation, it said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DXBMediaOffice/status/1092355537419816961\">statement published on Twitter</a> by Dubai\u2019s government media office.</p> <p>The company paid $336m (\u00a3260m) in 2017 for the contract to extend and manage the Bossaso port. The deal was unpopular with some local residents, however, and there were protests.</p> <p>In a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, al-Shabaab accused the victim of being in Somalia illegally.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab released a statement through Radio Andalus taking credit for the assassination. The group said it previously issued warnings that the Dubai-based company was \u201cillegally taking Somali natural resources\u201d.</p> <p>Omar Yasin, a 43-year-old fisherman, was in the market to sell his fish when the shooting took place.</p> <p>\u201cThey were two young men,\u201d Yasin said. \u201cThey were in the market since 6am this morning\u2026 . One man approached him [Formosa] and shot five times. I saw Formosa heavily bleeding and lying on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cSoon there was gunfire exchange between the attackers and the security guard. One attacker was shot dead but the other one escaped.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which is an official affiliate of al-Qaida, has been waging a war for more than a decade to overthrow Somalia\u2019s western-backed central government and install its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam\u2019s sharia law.</p> <p>The organisation is present primarily in rural areas in the south and centre of Somalia, and the north has been considered relatively safe.

      "bodyText": "Islamic militants in Somalia have shot dead a senior manager running the port of Bossaso in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, and a car bomb has killed at least 11 in Mogadishu. The assassination of Paul Anthony Formosa, a Maltese citizen who worked for the Dubai government-owned P&amp;O Ports, and the bombing in the capital, were both claimed by the extremist group al-Shabaab extremist group. The killing will be a setback to attempts to attract investment to the unstable, poverty-hit and violent country, and will highlight the continuing threat from the insurgents. Hours after the shooting in Bossaso, at least 11 people died in a car bomb explosion in the capital. Capt Mohamed Hussein, a police official, said at least nine people were also injured in the blast on Monday near a mall close to Mogadishu\u2019s local government offices, in the city\u2019s Hamar Weyne district. Mohamed Hussein Aliye, a 31-year-old shopkeeper, was serving customers when the car exploded. \u201cIt was a normal day for us. I saw the man who parked his car. He was thin and young. After 20 minutes it exploded. I was pushed to the wall. I thought I was dead. Smoke and dark dust shut my sight,\u201d he said. Al-Shabaab said the bombing targeted local administrators. The attacks came three weeks after a deadly assault by the group on a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya. The US embassy on Monday issued a warning to its citizens about an ongoing threat from Islamic extremists in the east African country. Yusuf Mohamed, the governor of Puntland\u2019s Bari region, told Reuters news agency that two men disguised as fishermen had shot Formosa as he was going to the port. He was killed \u201cin the fish market as he was going to Bossaso port this morning. The men armed with pistols hit him [with] several bullets in the head,\u201d Mohamed said. P&amp;O Ports said an employee had died and three others were injured in an \u201cincident\u201d, without giving further details. The company was cooperating with the Puntland authorities in its investigation, it said in a statement published on Twitter by Dubai\u2019s government media office. The company paid $336m (\u00a3260m) in 2017 for the contract to extend and manage the Bossaso port. The deal was unpopular with some local residents, however, and there were protests. In a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, al-Shabaab accused the victim of being in Somalia illegally. Al-Shabaab released a statement through Radio Andalus taking credit for the assassination. The group said it previously issued warnings that the Dubai-based company was \u201cillegally taking Somali natural resources\u201d. Omar Yasin, a 43-year-old fisherman, was in the market to sell his fish when the shooting took place. \u201cThey were two young men,\u201d Yasin said. \u201cThey were in the market since 6am this morning\u2026 . One man approached him [Formosa] and shot five times. I saw Formosa heavily bleeding and lying on the ground. \u201cSoon there was gunfire exchange between the attackers and the security guard. One attacker was shot dead but the other one escaped.\u201d Al-Shabaab, which is an official affiliate of al-Qaida, has been waging a war for more than a decade to overthrow Somalia\u2019s western-backed central government and install its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam\u2019s sharia law. The organisation is present primarily in rural areas in the south and centre of Somalia, and the north has been considered relatively safe. Middle Eastern powers, Turkey and other countries have engaged in fierce competition for strategic sites and investment on the Somalia coast in recent years. The US has stepped up airstrikes against al-Shabaab in Somalia since Donald Trump took office, carrying out at least 47 strikes last year. Some have targeted top leaders or key financial officials. Al-Shabaab funds its operations through an extensive network of \u201ctaxation\u201d and extortion. Last year, more than 300 militants were killed in airstrikes launched by US forces. A further attack \u2013 the 10th this year \u2013 killed 13 al-Shabaab militants, US officials said. A statement by the US army\u2019s Africa Command said the airstrike targeted al-Shabaab fighters in the vicinity of Gandarshe, Lower Shabelle region, within the war-torn country. Al-Shabaab has previously used Gandarshe, 30 miles south-west of Mogadishu, as a staging area for attacks including vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices that threaten the capital and its residents, a statement said. On 15-16 December, six US airstrikes killed 62 al-Shabaab militants near Gandarshe, who were preparing for an attack on a Somali government military base in the region, and a US airstrike killed 24 militants in neighbouring Hiran region on 30 January. In October, the US said an airstrike killed about 60 fighters near the al-Shabaab-controlled community of Harardhere in Mudug province in central Somalia. Research by the Mogadishu-based Hiiraan Institute suggests, however, that the organisation has largely adapted to the new threat and that the use of air power alone is likely to be insufficient to defeat the group, which has been fighting to impose an extreme version of Islamic law on Somalia for more than a decade. Civilian casualties blamed on the US have been a factor in al-Shabaab recruitment. Experts said one possible motive for the Nairobi attack was to send a strong message that the organisation was still active and capable of long-range terrorist operations, despite a series of US airstrikes that have inflicted heavy casualties. Al-Shabaab, which is an affiliate of al-Qaida, was responsible for an bloody assault on a mall in the Kenyan capital in 2013. The group has also conducted a series of assaults on military installations in the unstable east African country, though it has sustained significant casualties. Somalia was recently declared the most corrupt country in the world by Transparency International, the international campaign group.",

      "bodyText": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has hit back at the \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d decision of a succession of European countries to recognise his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as interim president, as Venezuela enters what many observers believe could be a critical week in its fast-escalating political crisis. Addressing a military rally in the northern state of Aragua, Maduro said he was the target of a \u201cgringo\u201d plot to overthrow the Bolivarian revolution he had inherited from his political mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, after his death in 2013. \u201cI, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, the legitimate and constitutional president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, swear \u2026 that I will defend with my very own life this homeland of Venezuela,\u201d he vowed. \u201cWe will never, ever hand over our country \u2026 The people will never surrender.\u201d Speaking after EU nations including Britain, Germany, Portugal and Spain, said they were throwing their weight behind his challenger, Maduro said his country was facing a historic test. Rejecting calls for fresh presidential elections, he said: \u201cI will carry on governing, together with the people, for the six years I have the right to govern for.\u201d On Monday 11 of 14 members of the Lima Group, a coalition of Latin American nations and Canada, also released a statement recognising Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader. Maduro reserved particular venom for Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who was among the first to announce that his country was turning its back on \u201cMaduro\u2019s regime\u201d. \u201cSpain\u2019s cowardly government has taken a disastrous decision \u2026 and I say to se\u00f1or Pedro S\u00e1nchez, God doesn\u2019t want this, but if one day a coup comes to pass, if one day a gringo military intervention comes to pass, your hands \u2026 will be covered in blood just as the hands of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar [Spanish PM from 1996 to 2004] were covered in blood in the Iraq war. \u201cHistory will remember you as a dummy who put himself at the service of the \u2026 interventionist policies of Donald Trump. \u201cDo we accept being given ultimatums in Venezuela?\u201d Maduro bellowed. \u201cNo,\u201d the crowd shouted back. \u201cWe are nobody\u2019s tramps \u2026 Do you want to transform our homeland into a colony of tramps? Do you want to see our homeland turned into a colony of slaves and tramps?\u201d he asked. Maduro also accused Trump \u2013 who on Sunday repeated that military action was an option \u2013 of being obsessed with invading Venezuela. \u201cHe thinks that we can be intimidated. No \u2026 What is the causa belli that Donald Trump has to declare a military war on Venezuela. What is the cause? Is it oil? Is it iron? Is it aluminium? Is it gold or diamonds? Is it gas? Water? What is the cause?\u201d Maduro asked. Venezuela\u2019s embattled leader also had ominous words for members of Venezuela\u2019s newly emboldened opposition, accusing them of selling their souls to \u201cthe imperialist devil\u201d. Venezuela now needed to react like a skilled boxer, winding its opponent with a series of powerful blows: \u201cLeft, right, left, left, left, right, left. With both hands,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cLet\u2019s knock out \u2026 the traitors, the coup-mongers and those who call for a gringo intervention in Venezuela,\u201d he added, to loud applause. \u201c[We] will defend our homeland with our own lives if necessary,\u201d Maduro told supporters who had gathered to celebrate the 27th anniversary of the failed 1992 coup that catapulted Ch\u00e1vez to fame. Maduro\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said the European governments had \u201conce again yielded to the US government strategy,\u201d and warned that Venezuela would \u201crevise\u201d its relations with countries which recognized Guaid\u00f3. \u201cThese governments are taking the side of the most extreme segment of the Venezuelan right, which \u2013 acting under the direction of Washington \u2013 is desperately seeking to take political power,\u201d he said in a statement. In an interview broadcast by Italy\u2019s SkyTG24 television on Monday, Maduro said he had written to the pope asking for him to mediate. \u201cI told him that I serve Christ\u2019s cause and in this spirit I asked for his help, in a process of facilitating and strengthening dialogue,\u201d he told the station. \u201cI ask the pope to put in his best effort, his will, to help on the path of dialogue. I hope to receive a positive response,\u201d he said. The pope is currently on a visit to the United Arab Emirates and is due to return to Rome on Tuesday.",

      "body": "<p>Nine points clear at the top of Serie A, Juventus are on the cusp of a crisis. Well, that\u2019s what the papers say. Even La Repubblica, typically a sober voice in Italian sports coverage, applied the \u2018c\u2019 word to the <em>Bianconeri</em> on Sunday\u2019s front page.</p> \n<p>Hyperbole? Certainly. But Juventus had conceded six times in the space of four days. A 3-0 defeat to Atalanta in the Coppa Italia was followed by a 3-3 draw at home to Parma in Serie A. Worse, they let a two-goal lead slip inside the last 20 minutes against the <em>Ducali</em>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/04/bayern-munich-stunned-as-luck-goes-same-way-as-aura-of-invincibility\">Bayern Munich stunned as luck goes same way as aura of invincibility | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There were mitigating circumstances. Giorgio Chiellini limped out of the Atalanta match with a calf strain, while fellow centre-backs Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli were already out injured. Juventus\u2019s matchday squad to face Parma was their first since 2011 not to feature any of the famous BBC. (Though, you don\u2019t have to go back quite so far to find a game when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adz77/status/1091645874097278977\">none of them got on the pitch</a>.)</p> \n<p>The sale of Mehdi Benatia to Al-Duhail trimmed the champions\u2019 options further. Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres was selected to start alongside Daniele Rugani at centre-back. The Uruguayan only rejoined Juventus on loan last week after the best part of three years away, during which he played sporadically for Southampton, Verona and Lazio.</p> \n<p>C\u00e1ceres looked as rusty as you might expect. It ought not to have mattered. Juventus had this game in hand by the 62nd minute, when Rugani volleyed home their second goal at the back post after Cristiano Ronaldo flicked on Mario Mandzukic\u2019s cross from the left. The Portuguese forward had opened the scoring midway through the first half.</p> \n<p>Parma, with less than 30% possession, were having a hard time getting on the ball, let alone creating chances. But in the 64th minute, Juraj Kucka was given all the time he wanted to swing a cross in from deep on the left. Antonino Barill\u00e0 met it with a thumping header beyond Mattia Perin. Several Juventus players were exposed on the goal, but most glaringly Sami Khedira \u2013 too slow to track Barill\u00e0\u2019s run \u2013 and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo \u2013 too lazy to offer support. Still, the league leaders had a quick response: Ronaldo rising to meet a Mandzukic cross moments later, restoring their advantage at 3-1. There was little sense of jeopardy here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And perhaps that was the problem. For a team that had lost so emphatically in midweek, Juventus were inexcusably presumptuous. Rugani ought to have been marking Gervinho far more tightly in the 74th minute, when the Ivorian darted to the front post and met another Kucka cross with a heel flick that deflected off the defender and snuck in at the near post.</p> \n<p>The worst was yet to come. Two minutes into injury-time, Juventus had Mario Mandzukic in possession down by his own corner flag. If he had simply booted the ball into touch, they likely would have been fine. Inexplicably, he chose to pivot and chip a pass back towards teammates on the edge of the box.</p> \n<p>The ball deflected off one opponent and fell to another \u2013 Luca Siligardi \u2013 who volleyed it on for Roberto Inglese. He resisted a weak challenge from Rugani and squared for Gervinho, whose close-range shot Perin could only palm on to the underside of the bar. It bounced down across the line for an improbable equaliser.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092408087225532417\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99 |<br><br>Gervinho to the rescue! \ud83d\ude4c<br><br>The former Arsenal man was on hand to score the goals that earned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ParmaCalcio_en?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ParmaCalcio_en</a> a point away at Juventus \ud83d\udd25<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SerieA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SerieA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/43C5hBuaag\">pic.twitter.com/43C5hBuaag</a></p>\u2014 Eleven Sports (@ElevenSports_UK) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1092408087225532417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 4, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Never in Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s tenure had Juventus conceded six goals in the space of two games. You could say that they were unlucky on Saturday, an unfamiliar defence punished severely for its missteps. Leonardo Spinazzola, making his first league start for Juventus, played as a wing-back for his former club, Atalanta, but was thrown in here on the left of a back four. Khedira also hit the woodwork twice at the other end.</p> \n<p>And yet these results have not come out of nowhere. It feels like an absurd thing to say of a team that has dropped just six points in 22 Serie A games, but Juventus have not been playing well for some time.</p> \n<p>They should have lost to Lazio in their previous league match, when they failed to record a first-half shot for the first time since Opta started tracking such data in 2004-05. Narrow wins over Torino and Inter before Christmas were decided by individual moments \u2013 Simone Zaza\u2019s reckless backpass and Roberto Gagliardini\u2019s shot against a post \u2013 more than any manifest superiority. Only Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s individual talent had rescued a point in the league fixture at Atalanta.</p> \n<p>Not even he could save them on Wednesday, when Atalanta simply played them off the park. The Bergamo club are in fine fettle at present, but Juventus have not lost by such a margin to any domestic rival since Allegri took charge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA/status/1091312713467191296\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Atalanta's Zapata sends holders Juventus crashing out of Coppa!<br>Watch all the goals here!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AtalantaJuve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AtalantaJuve</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoppaItalia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoppaItalia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lx7wRd3CQI\">pic.twitter.com/lx7wRd3CQI</a></p>\u2014 Lega Serie A (@SerieA) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA/status/1091312713467191296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 1, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Injuries and suspensions are a part of this picture. It is not only in defence that Juventus have been short-staffed. Miralem Pjanic missed the game against Lazio, and Emre Can was catastrophically poor as his replacement. Mandzukic was sorely missed \u2013 by Ronaldo especially \u2013 during the five games that he missed with a muscle strain before returning on Saturday.</p> \n<p>A team with Juventus\u2019s resources, however, cannot expect much sympathy. Paulo Dybala and Alex Sandro were among the unused substitutes this weekend.</p> \n<p>Taken in isolation, the draw with Parma is no catastrophe. Juventus are hardly in danger of losing first place as things stand. The crisis talk in papers such as La Repubblica relates not to Serie A, but the club\u2019s ambitions of winning the Champions League.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be7eeaa082a8d16ddef4357397839c8ab2240cb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7eeaa082a8d16ddef4357397839c8ab2240cb1/0_0_3351_2230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniele Rugani of Juventus scores against Parma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniele Rugani of Juventus scores against Parma.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierpaolo Piciucco/Action Plus via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The club\u2019s president, Andrea Agnelli, was unabashed in telling players before this season began that their ambition ought to be to win every competition that they participated in. Defeat to Atalanta means that they have already failed. This will be the first time under Allegri that Juventus fail to win a domestic double.</p> \n<p>A Champions League last-16 clash with Atl\u00e9tico looms larger than ever on the horizon. There is not truly a crisis in Turin, but with neither of Bonucci or Barzagli expected to make it back in time for the first leg, there is at least a mounting sense of concern.</p> \n<figure

      "bodyText": "Nine points clear at the top of Serie A, Juventus are on the cusp of a crisis. Well, that\u2019s what the papers say. Even La Repubblica, typically a sober voice in Italian sports coverage, applied the \u2018c\u2019 word to the Bianconeri on Sunday\u2019s front page. Hyperbole? Certainly. But Juventus had conceded six times in the space of four days. A 3-0 defeat to Atalanta in the Coppa Italia was followed by a 3-3 draw at home to Parma in Serie A. Worse, they let a two-goal lead slip inside the last 20 minutes against the Ducali. There were mitigating circumstances. Giorgio Chiellini limped out of the Atalanta match with a calf strain, while fellow centre-backs Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli were already out injured. Juventus\u2019s matchday squad to face Parma was their first since 2011 not to feature any of the famous BBC. (Though, you don\u2019t have to go back quite so far to find a game when none of them got on the pitch.) The sale of Mehdi Benatia to Al-Duhail trimmed the champions\u2019 options further. Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres was selected to start alongside Daniele Rugani at centre-back. The Uruguayan only rejoined Juventus on loan last week after the best part of three years away, during which he played sporadically for Southampton, Verona and Lazio. C\u00e1ceres looked as rusty as you might expect. It ought not to have mattered. Juventus had this game in hand by the 62nd minute, when Rugani volleyed home their second goal at the back post after Cristiano Ronaldo flicked on Mario Mandzukic\u2019s cross from the left. The Portuguese forward had opened the scoring midway through the first half. Parma, with less than 30% possession, were having a hard time getting on the ball, let alone creating chances. But in the 64th minute, Juraj Kucka was given all the time he wanted to swing a cross in from deep on the left. Antonino Barill\u00e0 met it with a thumping header beyond Mattia Perin. Several Juventus players were exposed on the goal, but most glaringly Sami Khedira \u2013 too slow to track Barill\u00e0\u2019s run \u2013 and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo \u2013 too lazy to offer support. Still, the league leaders had a quick response: Ronaldo rising to meet a Mandzukic cross moments later, restoring their advantage at 3-1. There was little sense of jeopardy here. And perhaps that was the problem. For a team that had lost so emphatically in midweek, Juventus were inexcusably presumptuous. Rugani ought to have been marking Gervinho far more tightly in the 74th minute, when the Ivorian darted to the front post and met another Kucka cross with a heel flick that deflected off the defender and snuck in at the near post. The worst was yet to come. Two minutes into injury-time, Juventus had Mario Mandzukic in possession down by his own corner flag. If he had simply booted the ball into touch, they likely would have been fine. Inexplicably, he chose to pivot and chip a pass back towards teammates on the edge of the box. The ball deflected off one opponent and fell to another \u2013 Luca Siligardi \u2013 who volleyed it on for Roberto Inglese. He resisted a weak challenge from Rugani and squared for Gervinho, whose close-range shot Perin could only palm on to the underside of the bar. It bounced down across the line for an improbable equaliser. Never in Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s tenure had Juventus conceded six goals in the space of two games. You could say that they were unlucky on Saturday, an unfamiliar defence punished severely for its missteps. Leonardo Spinazzola, making his first league start for Juventus, played as a wing-back for his former club, Atalanta, but was thrown in here on the left of a back four. Khedira also hit the woodwork twice at the other end. And yet these results have not come out of nowhere. It feels like an absurd thing to say of a team that has dropped just six points in 22 Serie A games, but Juventus have not been playing well for some time. They should have lost to Lazio in their previous league match, when they failed to record a first-half shot for the first time since Opta started tracking such data in 2004-05. Narrow wins over Torino and Inter before Christmas were decided by individual moments \u2013 Simone Zaza\u2019s reckless backpass and Roberto Gagliardini\u2019s shot against a post \u2013 more than any manifest superiority. Only Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s individual talent had rescued a point in the league fixture at Atalanta. Not even he could save them on Wednesday, when Atalanta simply played them off the park. The Bergamo club are in fine fettle at present, but Juventus have not lost by such a margin to any domestic rival since Allegri took charge. Injuries and suspensions are a part of this picture. It is not only in defence that Juventus have been short-staffed. Miralem Pjanic missed the game against Lazio, and Emre Can was catastrophically poor as his replacement. Mandzukic was sorely missed \u2013 by Ronaldo especially \u2013 during the five games that he missed with a muscle strain before returning on Saturday. A team with Juventus\u2019s resources, however, cannot expect much sympathy. Paulo Dybala and Alex Sandro were among the unused substitutes this weekend. Taken in isolation, the draw with Parma is no catastrophe. Juventus are hardly in danger of losing first place as things stand. The crisis talk in papers such as La Repubblica relates not to Serie A, but the club\u2019s ambitions of winning the Champions League. The club\u2019s president, Andrea Agnelli, was unabashed in telling players before this season began that their ambition ought to be to win every competition that they participated in. Defeat to Atalanta means that they have already failed. This will be the first time under Allegri that Juventus fail to win a domestic double. A Champions League last-16 clash with Atl\u00e9tico looms larger than ever on the horizon. There is not truly a crisis in Turin, but with neither of Bonucci or Barzagli expected to make it back in time for the first leg, there is at least a mounting sense of concern.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s richest person has launched an attack on the government\u2019s fracking rules, accusing ministers of policies that will cause an \u201cenergy crisis\u201d and \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to the economy. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemicals firm Ineos, pledged four years ago to start a UK fracking revolution but the company has been bogged down in planning battles and is yet to drill or frack a single well. The businessman, who is worth \u00a321bn, accused the government of taking an unworkable and unhelpful position on seismicity and planning rules. \u201cThey are playing politics with the future of the country. We have a non-existent energy strategy and are heading towards an energy crisis that will do long term and irreparable damage to the economy and the government needs to decide whether they are finally going to put the country first and develop a workable UK onshore gas industry,\u201d said Ratcliffe, who is leaving the UK for tax-free Monaco. Labour said the intervention \u201csmacked of desperation\u201d and was made by a \u201cfracking corporation who knows that time is up\u201d. \u201cThe government can no longer get away with overpromising to industry and allowing earthquakes against the wishes of local communities,\u201d said shadow energy minister, Alan Whitehead. Ineos, which owns significant exploration rights in the UK, said it wants the limit at which fracking operations must be paused to be raised, from its current level of 0.5 magnitude. It said the ceiling should be a \u201csensible\u201d level but did not specify what that would be. Cuadrilla, the only shale gas company to have fracked in the UK, had to repeatedly halt fracking at its site near Blackpool last year, as its operations triggered minor earthquakes above the regulatory threshold. Geologists have said the limit could safely be raised to 1.5 magnitude, above most of the mild tremors Cuadrilla caused. But the energy minister, Claire Perry, told the Guardian last month that she had no plans to review the rules. She has previously said only a \u201cfoolish politician\u201d would do so. In a statement issued on Monday, Ineos attacked the government for setting the limit at 0.5, which it called \u201ca level that has no sound basis in science and betrays a total lack of understanding of the shale extraction process\u201d. The firm pointed to other countries that have much more relaxed rules on seismicity and fracking. But the UK government has repeatedly said that one of the virtues of a UK shale gas industry is that it would be tightly and robustly regulated. Tom Pickering, chief operating officer of Ineos Shale, said he \u201cwould not speculate\u201d on whether the company would scrap its fracking plans if seismic rules are not reviewed. But he said: \u201cWhat we are saying is the time is now. We really do need to get clarity.\u201d The company has spent more than \u00a3150m on shale gas plans so far, and its fracking arm employs has 10 staff. Ineos claimed the government was \u201cshutting down shale by the back door\u201d and branded the planning regime \u201carchaic, glacially slow, inordinately expensive and virtually unworkable\u201d. Ministers have already rewritten planning rules to speed up shale gas applications and have proposed a second batch of reforms to make it easier for shale companies to drill exploratory wells. However, all three Ineos shale gas sites were rejected by local authorities. Two of those \u2013 one in South Yorkshire and one in Derbyshire \u2013 have since been approved after the firm appealed. The company is appealing over a third, at Woodsetts in South Yorkshire. Ineos argued the UK had chosen to bet \u201cthe future of our manufacturing industry on windmills and imported gas from countries which are potentially unstable\u201d. A government risk assessment last week concluded that UK gas supplies were \u201cresilient to all but the most unlikely combination of high demand and supply disruption\u201d. Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cToday\u2019s outburst feels like a final desperate plea from an unwanted, struggling industry. Jim Ratcliffe is right that the UK needs a new energy policy, but one that\u2019s based on energy-saving and renewables, not fracking and more fossil fuels.\u201d",

We wanted to portray the simple humanity of Johnny\u2019s journey and show that his radical politics were not born out of ideology but from seeing poverty and oppression first-hand. Johnny had become determined to campaign for equality when he witnessed the huge gap between rich and poor while sleeping rough in 1930s London.

Part comedy, part drama, all high-camp insanity, Housewives\u2019 pilot episode was watched by 21 million people. Fans wanted to be Eva Longoria\u2019s character Gabrielle Solis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/08/desperate-housewives-getting-desperate\">Bree Van Der Kamp</a> was a gay icon, and it might have happened on TV more than 14 years ago, but ask any devotee about the first time sexy gardener John (Jesse Metcalfe) took his shirt off to mow Gabrielle\u2019s lawn and they\u2019ll probably be able to describe the scene with creepy intensity.</p> <p>While early seasons of the show dealt with the domestic dramas of Bree, Susan, Gabrielle and Lynette \u2013 their failing marriages, out-of-control kids, love-life rivalries \u2013 the series became increasingly outlandish. But the show\u2019s real Jump the Shark moment happened in series five. After four series of rowing, sex and affairs with their gardener, their surrogate, the town\u2019s mayor, Nicollette Sheridan and then each other, Gabrielle and Carlos Solis finally got back together. Only for Carlos to go blind after being hit on the head by a flying fencepost during the tornado that destroyed the lane. The final episodes of series four revolved around Carlos lying to Gaby that his sight would come back, all the while hiding the fact that it wouldn\u2019t and he\u2019d be blind for ever.</p> <p>When the show returned the next year, however, set after a five-year jump into the future, it turns out time was, in fact, a great healer, and the entire blindness storyline had done a huge U-turn. Carlos\u2019s sight could be restored, against all odds! He could see again! A medical miracle!</p> <p>After that, despite the time jump actually making the show slightly more interesting for a few episodes, everything went downhill. As Carlos regained his sight, it became clear that the show had run out of original ideas. Each season would feature a mysterious new resident moving to Wisteria Lane and a LOT of murders. Like, way too many. Why weren\u2019t the local police suspicious that this unremarkable road suddenly became a hotspot for explosions, car crashes and suicides? </p> <p>Now transformed from a glossy US drama into a budget telenovela, we saw babies swapped at birth, a plane crash that killed off three major characters, Nicollette Sheridan\u2019s character Edie getting electrocuted to death and a serial strangler terrorising the street. By the time the series was killed off (creator Marc Cherry wanted to end it with season seven, but it actually limped along for eight) sexy gardener John had returned not once but THREE times. Less flogging a dead horse of an idea, more shagging a dead corpse of a storyline, each shirtless episode only served to remind fans how good series one was, and how bad the show had become.</p> <p>Desperate Housewives\u2019 legacy still lives on \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/24/real-housewives-of-anywhere-what-does-the-series-say-about-the-cities\">Real Housewives</a> franchise now has 19 spin-offs, including Athens, Vancouver and Hungary \u2013 but the show itself isn\u2019t even on Netflix. Maybe it\u2019s kinder for fans to remember it at its series one best: topless and mowing the lawn.</p>",

As Carlos regained his sight, it became clear that the show had run out of original ideas. Each season would feature a mysterious new resident moving to Wisteria Lane and a LOT of murders. Like, way too many. Why weren\u2019t the local police suspicious that this unremarkable road suddenly became a hotspot for explosions, car crashes and suicides? Now transformed from a glossy US drama into a budget telenovela, we saw babies swapped at birth, a plane crash that killed off three major characters, Nicollette Sheridan\u2019s character Edie getting electrocuted to death and a serial strangler terrorising the street. By the time the series was killed off (creator Marc Cherry wanted to end it with season seven, but it actually limped along for eight) sexy gardener John had returned not once but THREE times. Less flogging a dead horse of an idea, more shagging a dead corpse of a storyline, each shirtless episode only served to remind fans how good series one was, and how bad the show had become. Desperate Housewives\u2019 legacy still lives on \u2013 the Real Housewives franchise now has 19 spin-offs, including Athens, Vancouver and Hungary \u2013 but the show itself isn\u2019t even on Netflix. Maybe it\u2019s kinder for fans to remember it at its series one best: topless and mowing the lawn.",

      "bodyText": "A number of Conservative MPs have praised the work of a new UK rightwing youth pressure group that is said to have links to far-right conspiracy theorists, and has in the US been accused of anti-Islam views and connections to racism. On Sunday, MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel tweeted supportive messages for Turning Point UK, the offshoot of a controversial organisation established in the US. The UK outpost is headed by George Farmer, a Conservative donor and son of a Tory peer, who has been pictured (below second left) socialising with Paul Joseph Watson (second right), a senior editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars, and frequently retweets him. Watson has also praised Turning Point. Infowars has argued the 7 July 2005 attacks in London and the 2012 Sandy Hook primary school massacre were faked. Its founder, Alex Jones, is being sued by bereaved Sandy Hook parents. UK Jewish groups have previously criticised Ukip for allying with Watson and Infowars over concerns and allegations that the website also spreads antisemitic conspiracy theories. Farmer called Jeremy Corbyn \u201cJew-hating Jeremy\u201d. Other messages called the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a \u201cGrade A twat\u201d and a \u201cvirtue signalling cuck\u201d, and called two US Democratic politicians \u201cretards\u201d. The newly launched Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left-leaning, and seeks to fight against \u201csocialism, racism and identity politics\u201d, among other issues. It has no connection to the long-established UK addiction charity Turning Point. A spokeswoman for the charity said it was \u201creviewing all options in order to protect is name and limit confusion\u201d. Several Conservative MPs have approvingly retweeted the group\u2019s initial message. \u201cThis could be huge,\u201d said Steve Baker. Patel, a former international development secretary, said: \u201cA new generation standing up for political &amp; economic freedoms &amp; Conservative values &amp; beliefs. Fantastic!\u201d Another MP, Bernard Jenkin, said: \u201cThis is the future\u201d; while Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThe left has no monopoly on the \u2018young\u2019.\u201d Among other people to praise the establishment of Turning Point UK was For Britain, the anti-Islam party set up by the former Ukip leadership contender Anne Marie Waters, which said it hoped to support the group. Turning Point UK is a spin-off from a US youth campaign that advocates free markets and small government, loudly supporting Donald Trump and campaigning on free speech issues. The latter topic has seen Turning Point USA set up a website called Professor Watchlist. This is billed as a way to stop academics from discriminating against Trump-supporting students but has been criticised as intimidating. Turning Point USA vehemently insists it is inclusive, but has prompted concern about alleged links to racists, and anti-Islam messages. Farmer, whose father is Michael Farmer, a multimillionaire financier and longtime Tory donor, has also given money to the party, and attended fundraising events. Turning Point UK and Farmer were contacted for comment. This article was amended on 14 February 2019.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Pierce Brosnan, actor</strong></h2> <p>The first film I saw when I came to London as a boy was <a href=\"https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)\">Goldfinger</a>, which starred Sean Connery as 007. In Ireland, I had been brought up on a diet of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3uAQ4-3PM0\">Old Mother Riley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary\">Norman Wisdom</a>, so it was a bedazzling moment, seeing this lady covered in gold paint. I ended up getting a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/features/why-james-bonds-aston-martin-db5-remains-the-ultimate-toy/\">toy car with an ejector seat</a>, but I didn\u2019t have any aspirations to be James Bond. The character who really captured my imagination was <a href=\"https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Oddjob_(Harold_Sakata)\">Oddjob</a>, Goldfinger\u2019s bowler-hatted henchman.</p> <p>I was originally offered the role of 007 for <a href=\"https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Daylights_(film)\">The Living Daylights</a>. I\u2019d done all the photos with the iconic gun pose and my late wife and I were about to toast our new life with a bottle of Cristal when my agent called and said: \u201cIt\u2019s fallen through.\u201d It was because I couldn\u2019t get out of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Steele\">Remington Steele</a>. The role went to <a href=\"https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/James_Bond_(Timothy_Dalton)\">Timothy Dalton</a> instead but, by the mid-90s, the franchise had been dormant for six years because of a rights dispute. I heard rumblings that the part was available, but ignored them because I didn\u2019t want to put myself back in that emotional vortex. Then I met the producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli and, a week later, they called and said: \u201cYou\u2019re in.\u201d</p> <p>The sceptics were out in full: the world felt there was no need for another James Bond. So the challenge was enormous. I didn\u2019t want to get caught between what Sean and Roger had done. Yet, at the end of the day, my take was a little bit of what both had brought to the role. I leant towards Sean\u2019s style, but I couldn\u2019t deny Roger because GoldenEye was in the tongue-in-cheek style people had become used to.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cizwTk6bDY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4cizwTk6bDY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018You can still depend on one man\u2019 \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cizwTk6bDY\">watch the trailer for GoldenEye.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was a demanding role, physically and emotionally. I did a lot of wirework and fight sequences. They created a padded cell for <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5onvs9\">the fight in the bathhouse with </a>Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), so we could go at it pretty hard. The most arduous fight was the one with Sean Bean, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HFkF8904Uw\">on the ladder over the giant radio telescope</a> at the end. He and I spent six weeks constructing the sequence, working on it during our lunch breaks and at the end of the day with a stunt coordinator. But carrying myself as Bond was as much a mental as a physical thing. You have to hold the stage. You go in to win, full tilt to the finish line.</p> <p>GoldenEye\u2019s success was a great relief. I was prepared for the attention. Once you have that brand, you\u2019re stamped as a Bond. It was a great irony playing a British cultural icon as an Irishman. I had a quiet chuckle to myself.</p> <h2><strong>Martin Campbell, director</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s exciting breaking in a new Bond. I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig\">Daniel Craig</a>\u2019s first one, too. You\u2019ve got something to work with. The producers had been checking other people out just in case. I think they may have looked at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melgibson\">Mel Gibson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ralphfiennes\">Ralph Fiennes</a>. But it was obvious Pierce was the right person. You couldn\u2019t get a better-looking Bond. Put him in a tuxedo and it\u2019s game over, mate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The guy on the crane crossed himself before the stuntman jumped 700ft</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was budgeted at $55m, which is ludicrously little by today\u2019s standards. I think United Artists had doubts about how the audience would respond after the big gap since the last film. The press had been asking if Bond was still relevant. We decided we had to address this, so we introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/judi-dench\">Judi Dench</a> as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEujAIjTldk\">M, and had her call him a sexist, misogynist dinosaur</a>. The girls, too, were very independent \u2013 in the past, they always hung on to Bond\u2019s coat-tails. I loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4wNA2UmQHc\">Famke Janssen\u2019s orgasmic thigh-crushing</a> as Xenia Onatopp.</p> <p>With Bond, we used to say: \u201cWhat\u2019s never been done before action-wise?\u201d It\u2019s quite difficult after 16 films. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSvuHSqqGSw\">GoldenEye\u2019s bungee jump</a> off a dam at the start was my idea.

      "bodyText": "Pierce Brosnan, actor The first film I saw when I came to London as a boy was Goldfinger, which starred Sean Connery as 007. In Ireland, I had been brought up on a diet of Old Mother Riley and Norman Wisdom, so it was a bedazzling moment, seeing this lady covered in gold paint. I ended up getting a toy car with an ejector seat, but I didn\u2019t have any aspirations to be James Bond. The character who really captured my imagination was Oddjob, Goldfinger\u2019s bowler-hatted henchman. I was originally offered the role of 007 for The Living Daylights. I\u2019d done all the photos with the iconic gun pose and my late wife and I were about to toast our new life with a bottle of Cristal when my agent called and said: \u201cIt\u2019s fallen through.\u201d It was because I couldn\u2019t get out of Remington Steele. The role went to Timothy Dalton instead but, by the mid-90s, the franchise had been dormant for six years because of a rights dispute. I heard rumblings that the part was available, but ignored them because I didn\u2019t want to put myself back in that emotional vortex. Then I met the producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli and, a week later, they called and said: \u201cYou\u2019re in.\u201d The sceptics were out in full: the world felt there was no need for another James Bond. So the challenge was enormous. I didn\u2019t want to get caught between what Sean and Roger had done. Yet, at the end of the day, my take was a little bit of what both had brought to the role. I leant towards Sean\u2019s style, but I couldn\u2019t deny Roger because GoldenEye was in the tongue-in-cheek style people had become used to. It was a demanding role, physically and emotionally. I did a lot of wirework and fight sequences. They created a padded cell for the fight in the bathhouse with Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), so we could go at it pretty hard. The most arduous fight was the one with Sean Bean, on the ladder over the giant radio telescope at the end. He and I spent six weeks constructing the sequence, working on it during our lunch breaks and at the end of the day with a stunt coordinator. But carrying myself as Bond was as much a mental as a physical thing. You have to hold the stage. You go in to win, full tilt to the finish line. GoldenEye\u2019s success was a great relief. I was prepared for the attention. Once you have that brand, you\u2019re stamped as a Bond. It was a great irony playing a British cultural icon as an Irishman. I had a quiet chuckle to myself. Martin Campbell, director It\u2019s exciting breaking in a new Bond. I did Daniel Craig\u2019s first one, too. You\u2019ve got something to work with. The producers had been checking other people out just in case. I think they may have looked at Mel Gibson and Ralph Fiennes. But it was obvious Pierce was the right person. You couldn\u2019t get a better-looking Bond. Put him in a tuxedo and it\u2019s game over, mate. It was budgeted at $55m, which is ludicrously little by today\u2019s standards. I think United Artists had doubts about how the audience would respond after the big gap since the last film. The press had been asking if Bond was still relevant. We decided we had to address this, so we introduced Judi Dench as M, and had her call him a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. The girls, too, were very independent \u2013 in the past, they always hung on to Bond\u2019s coat-tails. I loved Famke Janssen\u2019s orgasmic thigh-crushing as Xenia Onatopp. With Bond, we used to say: \u201cWhat\u2019s never been done before action-wise?\u201d It\u2019s quite difficult after 16 films. GoldenEye\u2019s bungee jump off a dam at the start was my idea. We used the Contra dam in Switzerland, which is bloody terrifying. There was no digital manipulation: the stuntman Wayne Michaels just did the 700ft jump. As they were doing the countdown, he saw the guy on the crane crossing himself. He did it perfectly the first time. I guess he didn\u2019t want to do a second. We were getting very tight on budget by the time we got to the tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg, so we built replica streets in the studios at Leavesden. We had three or four Soviet battle tanks, T-55s, the proverbial unstoppable force. You just let the bloody thing go and it knocks anything down.

      "body": "<p>In 1985 the poet Tom Leonard, who has died aged 74, won the Saltire prize for Scottish Book of the Year with Intimate Voices, a selection of poems and other works, either in Glasgow dialect or in English, from the previous two decades.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards it was banned from schools and libraries in the central region of Scotland, the chair of the education committee commenting: \u201cThere are some harmful words in it, and I\u2019m not talking about bloody. Sometimes the naked truth has to be clothed.\u201d</p> <p>He had in mind, for instance, the sense of exclusion and defiance expressed in Good Style, one of Six Glasgow Poems (1969). It pointed to how the written version of the language he spoke was not considered a suitable medium for poetry:</p> <p><em>helluva hard tay read theez init</em><br><em>stull</em><br><em>if yi canny unnirston thim jiss clear aff then</em><br><em>gawn</em><br><em>get tay fuck ootma road</em><br><em>ahmaz goodiz thi lota yiz so ah um</em><br><em> </em></p> <p><em>ah no whit ahm dayn</em><br><em>tellnyi</em><br><em>jiss try enny a yir fly patir wi me</em><br><em>stick thi bootnyi good style</em><br><em>so ah wull</em><br><br>Some teachers and critics derided Tom\u2019s poems for being in bad English, others for being in bad Scots. The Six O\u2019Clock News (from Unrelated Incidents, 1976) confronts the assumption that words would not ring true in a register of Glasgow speech, whereas they do in Received Pronunciation: \u201cthis is thi / six a clock / news thi / man said n / thi reason / a talk wia / BBC accent / iz coz yi / widny wahnt / mi ti talk / aboot thi / trooth wia / voice lik / wanna yoo / scruff.\u201d </p> <p>From 2000 it was a GCSE set work in England and Wales, but Tom resisted giving permission for the Scottish exam board to use it because they wanted to frame it as part of a debate about Scots language, thereby removing it from its wider political context. In poems, essays, sound-pieces, cartoons and anthologies, Tom exposed how politics functioned in language and language in politics.</p> <p>Born in Glasgow, during an electricity blackout, Tom was the son of Thomas Leonard, a train driver from Dublin, and his wife, Mary (nee Mulgrew), who was Scottish-Irish. The family moved soon after his birth to a new council estate in the Pollok area of Glasgow.</p> <p>From an early age he read constantly, and most Saturdays from soon after 8am he could be found waiting for Pollok library to open. When he had exhausted the books of interest there he took the bus to other libraries. By the age of 16 Tom had read all the Dickens he could find. While his sister and older brothers listened to rock and pop on Radio Luxembourg, he argued for time on the family wireless to hear classical music on the Third Programme.</p> <p>The door to other Englishes was thrown open for him when he came upon an early nudge towards Glasgow dialect, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/29/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ian Hamilton Finlay</a>\u2019s Glasgow Beasts, an a Burd Haw, an Inseks, an, Aw, a Fush (1961).

There he and writers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/01/obituary-tom-mcgrath-poet\" title=\"\">Tom McGrath</a>, Alan Spence and Aonghas MacNeacail, as well as the musician Allan Tall, formed a loose grouping called the Other People.</p> <p>When Tom became editor of GUM, the Glasgow University magazine, the printer refused to print his writing \u201cbecause of the gutter language\u201d. Xeroxing the poems on a student union photocopying machine, he inserted them individually into every single copy. This was the first appearance of Six Glasgow Poems.</p> <p>The poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/07/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Philip Hobsbaum</a> taught at the university, and on Sunday nights invited writers to his flat.

Her father said he would produce a book of Tom\u2019s work, a promise that resulted in Poems (1973). Tom graduated in English and Scottish literature and began the research that in 1993 resulted in Places of the Mind, a biography of James Thomson, author of the long poem The City of Dreadful Night.</p> <p>While writer in residence for Renfrew district libraries, Tom compiled Radical Renfrew: Poetry from the French Revolution to the First World War (1990), bringing back into print more than 60 poets from the west of Scotland.</p> <p>He held writer posts at the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, and at Bell College of Technology (now part of the University of West Scotland). From 2001 to 2009 he was professor of creative writing at Glasgow.</p> <p>From 1984 I edited the Edinburgh Review and published his work quite regularly for six years.

      "bodyText": "In 1985 the poet Tom Leonard, who has died aged 74, won the Saltire prize for Scottish Book of the Year with Intimate Voices, a selection of poems and other works, either in Glasgow dialect or in English, from the previous two decades. Shortly afterwards it was banned from schools and libraries in the central region of Scotland, the chair of the education committee commenting: \u201cThere are some harmful words in it, and I\u2019m not talking about bloody. Sometimes the naked truth has to be clothed.\u201d He had in mind, for instance, the sense of exclusion and defiance expressed in Good Style, one of Six Glasgow Poems (1969). It pointed to how the written version of the language he spoke was not considered a suitable medium for poetry: helluva hard tay read theez init stull if yi canny unnirston thim jiss clear aff then gawn get tay fuck ootma road ahmaz goodiz thi lota yiz so ah um ah no whit ahm dayn tellnyi jiss try enny a yir fly patir wi me stick thi bootnyi good style so ah wull Some teachers and critics derided Tom\u2019s poems for being in bad English, others for being in bad Scots. The Six O\u2019Clock News (from Unrelated Incidents, 1976) confronts the assumption that words would not ring true in a register of Glasgow speech, whereas they do in Received Pronunciation: \u201cthis is thi / six a clock / news thi / man said n / thi reason / a talk wia / BBC accent / iz coz yi / widny wahnt / mi ti talk / aboot thi / trooth wia / voice lik / wanna yoo / scruff.\u201d From 2000 it was a GCSE set work in England and Wales, but Tom resisted giving permission for the Scottish exam board to use it because they wanted to frame it as part of a debate about Scots language, thereby removing it from its wider political context. In poems, essays, sound-pieces, cartoons and anthologies, Tom exposed how politics functioned in language and language in politics. Born in Glasgow, during an electricity blackout, Tom was the son of Thomas Leonard, a train driver from Dublin, and his wife, Mary (nee Mulgrew), who was Scottish-Irish. The family moved soon after his birth to a new council estate in the Pollok area of Glasgow. From an early age he read constantly, and most Saturdays from soon after 8am he could be found waiting for Pollok library to open. When he had exhausted the books of interest there he took the bus to other libraries. By the age of 16 Tom had read all the Dickens he could find. While his sister and older brothers listened to rock and pop on Radio Luxembourg, he argued for time on the family wireless to hear classical music on the Third Programme. The door to other Englishes was thrown open for him when he came upon an early nudge towards Glasgow dialect, Ian Hamilton Finlay\u2019s Glasgow Beasts, an a Burd Haw, an Inseks, an, Aw, a Fush (1961). At the same time Donald Allen\u2019s The New American Poetry, 1945-60 introduced him to Robert Creeley, Paul Blackburn and others whose work cut loose from Standard English. From Lourdes secondary school, in 1967 he went to Glasgow University, leaving after a couple of years. There he and writers including Tom McGrath, Alan Spence and Aonghas MacNeacail, as well as the musician Allan Tall, formed a loose grouping called the Other People. When Tom became editor of GUM, the Glasgow University magazine, the printer refused to print his writing \u201cbecause of the gutter language\u201d. Xeroxing the poems on a student union photocopying machine, he inserted them individually into every single copy. This was the first appearance of Six Glasgow Poems. The poet Philip Hobsbaum taught at the university, and on Sunday nights invited writers to his flat. There Tom met Alasdair Gray, James Kelman and Liz Lochhead. In 1971 Tom married Sonya O\u2019Brien, a teacher who later became a jeweller, and whose family had a printing business in Dublin. Her father said he would produce a book of Tom\u2019s work, a promise that resulted in Poems (1973). Tom graduated in English and Scottish literature and began the research that in 1993 resulted in Places of the Mind, a biography of James Thomson, author of the long poem The City of Dreadful Night. While writer in residence for Renfrew district libraries, Tom compiled Radical Renfrew: Poetry from the French Revolution to the First World War (1990), bringing back into print more than 60 poets from the west of Scotland. He held writer posts at the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, and at Bell College of Technology (now part of the University of West Scotland). From 2001 to 2009 he was professor of creative writing at Glasgow. From 1984 I edited the Edinburgh Review and published his work quite regularly for six years. He offered me the 17 poems of what was published in book form in 1990 as Nora\u2019s Place, exploring the consciousness of a woman as she goes about her life thinking, despairing, food shopping, daydreaming, self-engulfing and being.

      "body": "<p>The myth of Bayern-Dusel has endured in German football for more than four decades \u2013 the concept of the perennial luck that pushes even the below-elite teams representing the <em>Rekordmeister</em> over the hump. It\u2019s become such a Bundesliga clich\u00e9 that Bastian Schweinsteiger reflected on one late winner in the closing stages of 2009-10 under Louis van Gaal as Bayern-Dusel being \u201cback again\u201d with a grin on his face.</p> \n<p>One wondered on Saturday afternoon if, in 2019, the concept of the luck of a behemoth is as possible as it once was. Bayern Munich were sticking to their script \u2013 the script of modern German football \u2013 as half-time approached at Bayer Leverkusen. They already led through Leon Goretzka\u2019s latest goal and shortly after the home side\u2019s teenage star Kai Havertz limped off, Robert Lewandowski looked to have put them two up, deftly flicking the ball wide of Lukas Hradecky and into the corner of the net from Kingsley Coman\u2019s pass, the culmination of a razor-sharp move.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/liverpool-premier-league-champions-league-klopp\">Liverpool will not prioritise league title over Champions League, says Klopp</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The assistant\u2019s flag, however, was up, much to Lewandowski\u2019s incredulity and to Bayern\u2019s, with Niko Kova\u010d grumbling that VAR officials confirming the call \u201cmust have had the centimetre measure out\u201d. It recalled the moment when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used a press conference a few days after Real Madrid\u2019s 2011 Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona to ridicule Pep Guardiola for being \u201ca man who criticises the referee when he makes good decisions\u201d.</p> \n<p>To repeat that barb about Kova\u010d would be as wilfully deliberate a misunderstanding as Mourinho was making all those years over Barcelona. His lament didn\u2019t even go as far as suggesting that calling a player for a fractional offside might be against the spirit of the law. It was simply an observation that it had been tight. When the tight calls aren\u2019t going Bayern\u2019s way, the concept of Dusel of any sort seems a little antiquated, just as their aura of invincibility has become this season.</p> \n<p>It all fell to bits after the break, beginning when Leon Bailey swerved a magnificent free-kick past Sven Ulreich \u2013 playing after Manuel Neuer injured his hand \u2013 for an equaliser, which was also the Jamaican\u2019s first goal since the second game of the season. The tide turned, and Kevin Volland put the hosts in front before Lucas Alario rounded it off in the closing minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those last two goals in particular exposed the holes in Bayern\u2019s game that had been papered over in recent games, with Leverkusen\u2019s counter-attacks (which promise to be a key element of the newly-inaugurated Peter Bosz era) just too fast for the visitors during a second half in which they faded and looked ponderous, as they often have this term. It was the fifth time already this season that Bayern have dropped points after taking the lead and this one, after a run of seven straight league victories leading into it, was probably the most shocking. There had been the feeling of a corner being turned, but that sentiment dissipated in the course of a visceral half-hour from the hosts.</p> \n<p>It was, as S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Sebastian Fischer wrote: \u201cAn indication of insufficient tactical flexibility for the highest level.\u201d Kova\u010d acknowledged as much after the match. Which was \u201cgood, because he\u2019s responsible for analysis\u201d, continued Fischer, \u201cbut bad, because as a coach he\u2019s also responsible for the tactics. He\u2019s a coach, mind you, who stands for defensive stability\u201d.</p> \n<p>Kova\u010d\u2019s moves over the winter break were supposed to cement that, with his confirmation of Niklas S\u00fcle as the team\u2019s No 1 centre-half, and with Mats Hummels and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng fighting it out to partner him \u2013 Hummels has won the vote so far in 2019. Here, he represented Bayern\u2019s unevenness, which has become the shadow hanging over their season. On Saturday Hummels often looked his best self on the ball; elegant, ambitious, a cut above. Off it \u2013 sometimes after giving it away himself \u2013 he looked uncertain of his position, and even lost. Leverkusen knew exactly how to take advantage.</p> \n<p>\u201cGoing forward, our team has great qualities,\u201d argued Kova\u010d, \u201cbut we have to shut up shop. Everyone knows the championship is won at the back.\u201d Some would argue that therein lies the problem, with a coach who is thinking of being cautious rather than daring. Then again, if those principles were followed more closely, it\u2019s difficult to argue that Bayern wouldn\u2019t be in a better position.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/goal/status/1092369029098921984\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 Bayern Munich \ud83d\ude33<br><br>Things started so well for the champions...<br><br>But they're now seven points behind Borussia Dortmund \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea <a href=\"https://t.co/paMIPZzVk7\">pic.twitter.com/paMIPZzVk7</a></p>\u2014 Goal (@goal) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goal/status/1092369029098921984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 4, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The club\u2019s former midfielder Didi Hamann took aim at Lewandowski on Sunday night\u2019s edition of Sky90, arguing that the star centre-forward \u201cis becoming a problem for Bayern\u201d. Certainly, if Kova\u010d wants his team to defend from the front then Lewandowski is short-changing him. He is not the only one, with Thomas M\u00fcller and James Rodr\u00edguez substituted in the second half and looking glum about it. That Lewandowski is still in Bavaria, having openly coveted a move to Real Madrid, might be taken as an admission of shortcoming, but he looks short of the all-round game which would propel him back into those sort of conversations.</p> \n<p>Maybe a rebuild around him would make the difference. That is firmly on the Bayern agenda, though the plan to freshen the squad this winter didn\u2019t come to fruition, with Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez staying at Atl\u00e9tico for now and Benjamin Pavard still at Stuttgart until summer. One can\u2019t hope for more than a period of adaptation from Alphonso Davies.</p> \n<p>Yet it means for now that the squad is limited, certainly in terms of variety, with Sandro Wagner moving to China last week \u2013 not that Kova\u010d was keen on picking him anyway. Borussia Dortmund failed to land a knockout blow this weekend, and Bayern still have their hopes alive. With Leverkusen exposing them like this, though, concern is beginning to turn to what Liverpool might do to a team still incapable of producing 90 minutes of energy and focus, when the Champions League restarts.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Dortmund, then, extended their lead to seven points despite letting a lead slip \u2013 and failing to take a host of chances to restore it \u2013 in an entertaining draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Marco Reus, who opened the scoring before Luka Jovi\u0107 levelled, was the chief culprit. Goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki grudgingly called Bayern\u2019s stumble \u201ca small consolation\u201d, though cameras preferred to focus on Axel Witsel struggling to supress a grin as the score from Leverkusen popped up on the big screen.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach are up to second after chiselling out a 2-0 win at Schalke with late goals by Christoph Kramer and Florian Neuhaus, the second being an extraordinary piece of work, the result of 62 passes over two minutes and 45 seconds of possession.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "The myth of Bayern-Dusel has endured in German football for more than four decades \u2013 the concept of the perennial luck that pushes even the below-elite teams representing the Rekordmeister over the hump. It\u2019s become such a Bundesliga clich\u00e9 that Bastian Schweinsteiger reflected on one late winner in the closing stages of 2009-10 under Louis van Gaal as Bayern-Dusel being \u201cback again\u201d with a grin on his face. One wondered on Saturday afternoon if, in 2019, the concept of the luck of a behemoth is as possible as it once was. Bayern Munich were sticking to their script \u2013 the script of modern German football \u2013 as half-time approached at Bayer Leverkusen. They already led through Leon Goretzka\u2019s latest goal and shortly after the home side\u2019s teenage star Kai Havertz limped off, Robert Lewandowski looked to have put them two up, deftly flicking the ball wide of Lukas Hradecky and into the corner of the net from Kingsley Coman\u2019s pass, the culmination of a razor-sharp move. The assistant\u2019s flag, however, was up, much to Lewandowski\u2019s incredulity and to Bayern\u2019s, with Niko Kova\u010d grumbling that VAR officials confirming the call \u201cmust have had the centimetre measure out\u201d. It recalled the moment when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used a press conference a few days after Real Madrid\u2019s 2011 Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona to ridicule Pep Guardiola for being \u201ca man who criticises the referee when he makes good decisions\u201d. To repeat that barb about Kova\u010d would be as wilfully deliberate a misunderstanding as Mourinho was making all those years over Barcelona. His lament didn\u2019t even go as far as suggesting that calling a player for a fractional offside might be against the spirit of the law. It was simply an observation that it had been tight. When the tight calls aren\u2019t going Bayern\u2019s way, the concept of Dusel of any sort seems a little antiquated, just as their aura of invincibility has become this season. It all fell to bits after the break, beginning when Leon Bailey swerved a magnificent free-kick past Sven Ulreich \u2013 playing after Manuel Neuer injured his hand \u2013 for an equaliser, which was also the Jamaican\u2019s first goal since the second game of the season. The tide turned, and Kevin Volland put the hosts in front before Lucas Alario rounded it off in the closing minutes. Those last two goals in particular exposed the holes in Bayern\u2019s game that had been papered over in recent games, with Leverkusen\u2019s counter-attacks (which promise to be a key element of the newly-inaugurated Peter Bosz era) just too fast for the visitors during a second half in which they faded and looked ponderous, as they often have this term. It was the fifth time already this season that Bayern have dropped points after taking the lead and this one, after a run of seven straight league victories leading into it, was probably the most shocking. There had been the feeling of a corner being turned, but that sentiment dissipated in the course of a visceral half-hour from the hosts. It was, as S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Sebastian Fischer wrote: \u201cAn indication of insufficient tactical flexibility for the highest level.\u201d Kova\u010d acknowledged as much after the match. Which was \u201cgood, because he\u2019s responsible for analysis\u201d, continued Fischer, \u201cbut bad, because as a coach he\u2019s also responsible for the tactics. He\u2019s a coach, mind you, who stands for defensive stability\u201d. Kova\u010d\u2019s moves over the winter break were supposed to cement that, with his confirmation of Niklas S\u00fcle as the team\u2019s No 1 centre-half, and with Mats Hummels and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng fighting it out to partner him \u2013 Hummels has won the vote so far in 2019. Here, he represented Bayern\u2019s unevenness, which has become the shadow hanging over their season. On Saturday Hummels often looked his best self on the ball; elegant, ambitious, a cut above. Off it \u2013 sometimes after giving it away himself \u2013 he looked uncertain of his position, and even lost. Leverkusen knew exactly how to take advantage. \u201cGoing forward, our team has great qualities,\u201d argued Kova\u010d, \u201cbut we have to shut up shop. Everyone knows the championship is won at the back.\u201d Some would argue that therein lies the problem, with a coach who is thinking of being cautious rather than daring. Then again, if those principles were followed more closely, it\u2019s difficult to argue that Bayern wouldn\u2019t be in a better position. The club\u2019s former midfielder Didi Hamann took aim at Lewandowski on Sunday night\u2019s edition of Sky90, arguing that the star centre-forward \u201cis becoming a problem for Bayern\u201d. Certainly, if Kova\u010d wants his team to defend from the front then Lewandowski is short-changing him. He is not the only one, with Thomas M\u00fcller and James Rodr\u00edguez substituted in the second half and looking glum about it. That Lewandowski is still in Bavaria, having openly coveted a move to Real Madrid, might be taken as an admission of shortcoming, but he looks short of the all-round game which would propel him back into those sort of conversations. Maybe a rebuild around him would make the difference. That is firmly on the Bayern agenda, though the plan to freshen the squad this winter didn\u2019t come to fruition, with Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez staying at Atl\u00e9tico for now and Benjamin Pavard still at Stuttgart until summer. One can\u2019t hope for more than a period of adaptation from Alphonso Davies. Yet it means for now that the squad is limited, certainly in terms of variety, with Sandro Wagner moving to China last week \u2013 not that Kova\u010d was keen on picking him anyway. Borussia Dortmund failed to land a knockout blow this weekend, and Bayern still have their hopes alive. With Leverkusen exposing them like this, though, concern is beginning to turn to what Liverpool might do to a team still incapable of producing 90 minutes of energy and focus, when the Champions League restarts. Talking points \u2022 Dortmund, then, extended their lead to seven points despite letting a lead slip \u2013 and failing to take a host of chances to restore it \u2013 in an entertaining draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Marco Reus, who opened the scoring before Luka Jovi\u0107 levelled, was the chief culprit. Goalkeeper Roman B\u00fcrki grudgingly called Bayern\u2019s stumble \u201ca small consolation\u201d, though cameras preferred to focus on Axel Witsel struggling to supress a grin as the score from Leverkusen popped up on the big screen. \u2022 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach are up to second after chiselling out a 2-0 win at Schalke with late goals by Christoph Kramer and Florian Neuhaus, the second being an extraordinary piece of work, the result of 62 passes over two minutes and 45 seconds of possession. \u2022 At the bottom there was relief for Augsburg \u2013 and new assistant coach Jens Lehmann \u2013 with Alfred Finnbogason\u2019s hat-trick rolling over Mainz and giving them breathing space at the bottom.",

Whether addressing her 12 years in men\u2019s football, the multiple ways of playing 4-3-3 or 3-5-2 or the lessons she learned during qualifying campaigns for one European Championship and two World Cups for Northern Ireland, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/09/michael-oneill-interview-northern-ireland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">she worked as an analyst</a> for Michael O\u2019Neill, Fallon is riveting company.</p> \n<p>\u201cJohn Caulfield is Cork\u2019s manager,\u201d she explains. \u201cHis assistant is John Cotter, while Liam Kearney and I are first-team coaches. This is my sixth season at Cork, looking after opposition analysis, and I\u2019ve kept this role while moving into first-team coaching.

Yet it needed Cork\u2019s open-minded approach to help Fallon break the gender barrier. Only 20% of coaches in women\u2019s football are female. In men\u2019s football, isolated female coaches are sometimes asked if they offer oral sex as well as tactical insights or, in the case of Imke W\u00fcbbenhorst, if she should wear a siren so her players can pull on their shorts before she enters the dressing room.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6348d90-c5f0-4534-b60e-f854b063e199\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Two other women working as coaches in men\u2019s sport</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Natasha Orchard-Smith (Arlesey Town, head coach)</b><br> The former Tottenham Ladies player took charge of Arlesey Town, who play in the Spartan South Midlands Premier Division, at the start of the season.

The lads don\u2019t make any exceptions for me. I don\u2019t make any for them. I\u2019m just a football coach.\u201d Yet Fallon has made history as the only female coach working in men\u2019s professional football in Ireland.

He was the only male midwife in Ireland and I was the only female professional football coach.\u201d Fallon has a 17-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son and, as she yearns for more change in gender perceptions, she smiles. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there. Being female hasn\u2019t prevented me from getting where I am now. Has it been tougher than if I had been male? Probably. You have to know more than you might need \u2013 because you stand out as female. But, once people see you as just a coach, it becomes normal. I have my challenging days but very little beats winning or seeing the lads lift a trophy. I feel ready for whatever comes my way.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><br>The pope\u2019s representative in Britain, archbishop Edward Adams, has been accused of \u201ccowering behind his diplomatic immunity\u201d for not providing crucial evidence to the child sexual abuse inquiry.</p> <p>David Enright, a prominent lawyer representing victims of abuse in Catholic schools, has written to Theresa May, urging the prime minister to expel Adams, who is the papal nuncio, the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic representative in the UK, if he does not cooperate.</p> <p>Enright, a solicitor with the London law firm Howe and Co, raised the question of the archbishop\u2019s position after the inquiry was told on Monday that the senior cleric had been slow to respond to repeated requests to hand over documents about mistreatment of children at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict\u2019s school in west London.</p> <p>Riel Karmy-Jones QC, counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), confirmed that a series of letters had been sent to Adams since November.</p> <p>Prof Alexis Jay, chair of the IICSA, has powers to call evidence, including enforcing imprisonment of those who defy a request. The dispute between church and state, however, is complicated because the archbishop is also a diplomat.</p> <p>Karmy-Jones said: \u201cAs part of the investigation, the solicitor to the inquiry has written to to the apostolic nuncio to request that he provide a statement in connection with these investigations. The apostolic nuncio is covered by diplomatic immunity.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry\u2019s request was for a \u201cvoluntary statement\u201d covering a number of areas about the handling of complaints about Catholic schools in England and Wales and specifically relating to investigations at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict\u2019s school.</p> <p>\u201cThe inquiry received confirmation that its request was being carefully considered,\u201d Karmy-Jones said. \u201c\u2026.

      "bodyText": "The pope\u2019s representative in Britain, archbishop Edward Adams, has been accused of \u201ccowering behind his diplomatic immunity\u201d for not providing crucial evidence to the child sexual abuse inquiry. David Enright, a prominent lawyer representing victims of abuse in Catholic schools, has written to Theresa May, urging the prime minister to expel Adams, who is the papal nuncio, the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic representative in the UK, if he does not cooperate. Enright, a solicitor with the London law firm Howe and Co, raised the question of the archbishop\u2019s position after the inquiry was told on Monday that the senior cleric had been slow to respond to repeated requests to hand over documents about mistreatment of children at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict\u2019s school in west London. Riel Karmy-Jones QC, counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), confirmed that a series of letters had been sent to Adams since November. Prof Alexis Jay, chair of the IICSA, has powers to call evidence, including enforcing imprisonment of those who defy a request. The dispute between church and state, however, is complicated because the archbishop is also a diplomat. Karmy-Jones said: \u201cAs part of the investigation, the solicitor to the inquiry has written to to the apostolic nuncio to request that he provide a statement in connection with these investigations. The apostolic nuncio is covered by diplomatic immunity.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s request was for a \u201cvoluntary statement\u201d covering a number of areas about the handling of complaints about Catholic schools in England and Wales and specifically relating to investigations at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict\u2019s school. \u201cThe inquiry received confirmation that its request was being carefully considered,\u201d Karmy-Jones said. \u201c\u2026. [But] despite a number of further requests for updates the inquiry has not yet received a statement or any substantive responses to its correspondence.\u201d In his opening statement, Enright said: \u201cRather than answer [the inquiry\u2019s] requests for evidence, the nuncio, secreted in his papal residence in Wimbledon, first hid behind his diplomatic status and then simply refused to even acknowledge the repeated and ever more urgent letters.\u201d It showed a \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d for the inquiry, he suggested. \u201cThe penalty for failing to comply with a notice from the chair [of the inquiry] is up to 51 weeks imprisonment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe papal nuncio needs to know that he has only three options: offer up the evidence, face criminal prosecutions or face expulsion from the UK.\u201d He told the chair: \u201cDo not be deterred by concerns that archbishop Adams may cower behind his diplomatic immunity in order to deny you vital evidence on child abuse and to evade the force of British law.\u201d The papal nuncio\u2019s office had been involved in handling complaints about abuse at St Benedict\u2019s and other Catholic schools, the inquiry was told, and had also conducted investigations into the school. In his letter to the prime minister, Enright said the evidence sought \u201crelates to the nuncio\u2019s records of, and handling of, allegations of child sex abuse, including in relation to two convicted clerical child sex offenders [Andrew Soper and David Pearce]. \u201cHowever, it appears, that due to the diplomatic immunity enjoyed by the Holy See, the inquiry may be powerless to compel the nuncio to provide that evidence.

If emissions are not cut, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92288-1_7\">the loss soars to two-thirds</a>, the report found.</p> <p>The glaciers are a critical water store for the 250 million people who live in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region, and 1.65 billion people rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the climate crisis you haven\u2019t heard of,\u201d said Philippus Wester of the <a href=\"http://www.icimod.org/\">International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development</a> (Icimod), who led the report. \u201cIn the best of possible worlds, if we get really ambitious [in tackling climate change], even then we will lose one-third of the glaciers and be in trouble. That for us was the shocking finding.\u201d</p> <p>Wester said that, despite being far more populous, the HKH region had received less attention than other places, such as low-lying island states and the Arctic, that are also highly vulnerable to global warming.</p> <p>Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cThis is a landmark piece of work focused on a region that is a hotspot for climate change impacts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/glaciers-zip/giv-3902uG21WrLfuGYZ/\" data-alt=\"Even strong climate change action leaves significant melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/glaciers-zip/giv-3902uG21WrLfuGYZ/\">Even strong climate change action leaves significant melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains</a> </figure>  <p>The new report, requested by the eight nations the mountains span, is intended to change that. More than 200 scientists worked on the report over five years, with another 125 experts peer reviewing their work. Until recently the impact of climate change on the ice in the HKH region was uncertain, said Wester. \u201cBut we really do know enough now to take action, and action is urgently needed,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The HKH region runs from Afghanistan to Myanmar and is the planet\u2019s \u201cthird pole\u201d, harbouring more ice than anywhere outside Arctic and Antarctica. Limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires cutting emissions to zero by 2050. This is felt to be extremely optimistic by many but still sees a third of the ice lost, according to the report. If the global rise is 2C, half of the glaciers are projected to melt away by 2100.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, about 15% of the ice in the HKH region has disappeared as temperatures have risen. But the HKH range is 3,500km long and the impact of warming is variable. Some glaciers in Afghanistan and Pakistan are stable and a few are even gaining ice, most probably due to increased cloud cover that shields the sun and changed winds that bring more snow. But even these will start melting with future warming, Wester said.</p> <p>The melting glaciers will increase river flows through to 2050 to 2060, he said, pushing up the risk of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_lake_outburst_flood\">high-altitude lakes bursting their banks</a> and engulfing communities. But from the 2060s, river flows will go into decline. The Indus and central Asian rivers will be most affected. \u201cThose areas will be hard hit,\u201d said Wester.</p> <p>Lower flows will cut the power from the hydrodams that generate much of the region\u2019s electricity. But the most serious impact will be on farmers in the foothills and downstream. They rely on predictable water supplies to grow the crops that feed the nations in the mountains\u2019 shadows.</p> <p>But the changes to spring melting already appear to be causing the pre-monsoon river flow to fall just when farmers are planting their crops. Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. \u201cOne-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/hindu-kush-glacier-zip/giv-3902WJIGkI5slaD0/\" data-alt=\"Hindu Kush Himalaya range\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/hindu-kush-glacier-zip/giv-3902WJIGkI5slaD0/\">Hindu Kush Himalaya range</a> </figure>  <p>The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes.</p> <p>Political tensions between neighbouring nations such as India and Pakistan could add to the difficulties. \u201cThere are rocky times ahead for the region. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflict among the region\u2019s countries could easily flare up,\u201d said Eklabya Sharma, the deputy director general of Icimod.</p> <p>Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the report, said it is \u201ca substantial piece of work\u201d that takes due note of the uncertainties resulting from the limited snowfall and ice measurements in the high mountains.</p> <p>He said glaciers currently provide an essential buffering role as their meltwater flows into the rivers during the summer, which is when water is in greatest demand downstream and periodic droughts have the deadliest impacts on populations. \u201cTake the ice away and those people are exposed to serious water stress and the consequences of that are local, regional and potentially global, in terms of conflict and migration,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At least a third of the huge ice fields in Asia\u2019s towering mountain chain are doomed to melt due to climate change, according to a landmark report, with serious consequences for almost 2 billion people. Even if carbon emissions are dramatically and rapidly cut and succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5C, 36% of the glaciers along in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range will have gone by 2100. If emissions are not cut, the loss soars to two-thirds, the report found. The glaciers are a critical water store for the 250 million people who live in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region, and 1.65 billion people rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations. \u201cThis is the climate crisis you haven\u2019t heard of,\u201d said Philippus Wester of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (Icimod), who led the report. \u201cIn the best of possible worlds, if we get really ambitious [in tackling climate change], even then we will lose one-third of the glaciers and be in trouble. That for us was the shocking finding.\u201d Wester said that, despite being far more populous, the HKH region had received less attention than other places, such as low-lying island states and the Arctic, that are also highly vulnerable to global warming. Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cThis is a landmark piece of work focused on a region that is a hotspot for climate change impacts.\u201d The new report, requested by the eight nations the mountains span, is intended to change that. More than 200 scientists worked on the report over five years, with another 125 experts peer reviewing their work. Until recently the impact of climate change on the ice in the HKH region was uncertain, said Wester. \u201cBut we really do know enough now to take action, and action is urgently needed,\u201d he added. The HKH region runs from Afghanistan to Myanmar and is the planet\u2019s \u201cthird pole\u201d, harbouring more ice than anywhere outside Arctic and Antarctica. Limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires cutting emissions to zero by 2050. This is felt to be extremely optimistic by many but still sees a third of the ice lost, according to the report. If the global rise is 2C, half of the glaciers are projected to melt away by 2100. Since the 1970s, about 15% of the ice in the HKH region has disappeared as temperatures have risen. But the HKH range is 3,500km long and the impact of warming is variable. Some glaciers in Afghanistan and Pakistan are stable and a few are even gaining ice, most probably due to increased cloud cover that shields the sun and changed winds that bring more snow. But even these will start melting with future warming, Wester said. The melting glaciers will increase river flows through to 2050 to 2060, he said, pushing up the risk of high-altitude lakes bursting their banks and engulfing communities. But from the 2060s, river flows will go into decline. The Indus and central Asian rivers will be most affected. \u201cThose areas will be hard hit,\u201d said Wester. Lower flows will cut the power from the hydrodams that generate much of the region\u2019s electricity. But the most serious impact will be on farmers in the foothills and downstream. They rely on predictable water supplies to grow the crops that feed the nations in the mountains\u2019 shadows. But the changes to spring melting already appear to be causing the pre-monsoon river flow to fall just when farmers are planting their crops. Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. \u201cOne-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years,\u201d he said. The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes. Political tensions between neighbouring nations such as India and Pakistan could add to the difficulties. \u201cThere are rocky times ahead for the region. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflict among the region\u2019s countries could easily flare up,\u201d said Eklabya Sharma, the deputy director general of Icimod. Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the report, said it is \u201ca substantial piece of work\u201d that takes due note of the uncertainties resulting from the limited snowfall and ice measurements in the high mountains. He said glaciers currently provide an essential buffering role as their meltwater flows into the rivers during the summer, which is when water is in greatest demand downstream and periodic droughts have the deadliest impacts on populations. \u201cTake the ice away and those people are exposed to serious water stress and the consequences of that are local, regional and potentially global, in terms of conflict and migration,\u201d he said.",

Neither my husband nor I had heard of the condition before, but we knew very quickly our lives were about to change for ever from that moment. Of all of the stats thrown at you when you hear the diagnosis, one sticks out more than any other: Luis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/26/tim-wotton-book-cystic-fibrosis-how-have-i-cheated-death\" title=\"\">life expectancy</a> was 38, my age at the time. We would most likely outlive our baby boy.</p> <p>Luis is eight years old now and, though parts of our routine will be recognisable to every parent, he has a life of many challenges. It starts in the morning with a medical regime that takes up to two and half hours. Every day he takes 22 tablets, three nebulisers, two inhalers, nasal sprays and lots of supplements. The condition means he struggles to put on any weight, so we need to keep a constant eye on his eating \u2013 to ensure he gets much more than the recommended calorie intake for children of his age. He\u2019ll have physio sessions, too, and be surrounded constantly by adults worrying if he\u2019s OK. Then, before bed, he\u2019ll have another hour and a half of his medical regime. Those are the good days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/03/nhs-cystic-fibrosis-drug-orkambi-vertex\">Help NHS obtain cystic fibrosis drug, ministers urged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a bad day, Luis will end up in hospital. A cough or cold will have turned serious. His lung function will plummet. He\u2019ll be off school for weeks, missing not just classes but birthdays and time spent with friends \u2013 the little things that make being eight years old so much fun. Or it might be like last week when he had a stomach bug and was reduced to skin and bones as his weak body shed the tiny amount of weight he\u2019d been able to put on previously. The cause of those days varies, but the worry is always the same \u2013 could this bad day lead to his last day?</p> <p>With our lives being punctuated by such worry, it\u2019s no wonder that news of an effective treatment to cystic fibrosis meant so much. A drug called Orkambi, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients, from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation causing the disease (called the <a href=\"https://www.cff.org/What-is-CF/Genetics/Types-of-CFTR-Mutations/\" title=\"\">F508del mutation</a>). Orkambi can slow progression of the disease, improve lung capacity and reduce the frequency and severity of lung infections. For Luis it would be life-changing.

      "bodyText": "Luis was three weeks old when we found out he had cystic fibrosis. Neither my husband nor I had heard of the condition before, but we knew very quickly our lives were about to change for ever from that moment. Of all of the stats thrown at you when you hear the diagnosis, one sticks out more than any other: Luis\u2019s life expectancy was 38, my age at the time. We would most likely outlive our baby boy. Luis is eight years old now and, though parts of our routine will be recognisable to every parent, he has a life of many challenges. It starts in the morning with a medical regime that takes up to two and half hours. Every day he takes 22 tablets, three nebulisers, two inhalers, nasal sprays and lots of supplements. The condition means he struggles to put on any weight, so we need to keep a constant eye on his eating \u2013 to ensure he gets much more than the recommended calorie intake for children of his age. He\u2019ll have physio sessions, too, and be surrounded constantly by adults worrying if he\u2019s OK. Then, before bed, he\u2019ll have another hour and a half of his medical regime. Those are the good days. On a bad day, Luis will end up in hospital. A cough or cold will have turned serious. His lung function will plummet. He\u2019ll be off school for weeks, missing not just classes but birthdays and time spent with friends \u2013 the little things that make being eight years old so much fun. Or it might be like last week when he had a stomach bug and was reduced to skin and bones as his weak body shed the tiny amount of weight he\u2019d been able to put on previously. The cause of those days varies, but the worry is always the same \u2013 could this bad day lead to his last day? With our lives being punctuated by such worry, it\u2019s no wonder that news of an effective treatment to cystic fibrosis meant so much. A drug called Orkambi, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients, from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation causing the disease (called the F508del mutation). Orkambi can slow progression of the disease, improve lung capacity and reduce the frequency and severity of lung infections. For Luis it would be life-changing. Orkambi is the first of a series of drugs that are being developed, with forthcoming ones expected to be even more effective. But there\u2019s a snag. Though the drug is available and on the market, the NHS can\u2019t afford it. Of course, a health service that\u2019s already under extreme financial strain will always have difficult choices to make \u2013 but when the drug company is charging an exorbitant \u00a3105,000 per year for a drug taken every day for life, it\u2019s no surprise that the NHS isn\u2019t able to pay. After three years of fruitless negotiations, Orkambi is still not available for cystic fibrosis patients in the UK. The situation is unbearable, but it\u2019s not intractable. Vertex has the ability to charge as much as it wants because it has a patent on Orkambi that grants it a 20-year monopoly, free from competition. But its intellectual property rights are not absolute, with national and international law recognising that those very rights need to be balanced against patients\u2019 right to health. The World Trade Organization\u2019s rules provide legal safeguards that are supposed to ensure public health is not sacrificed at the expense of the profits of the owners of intellectual property rights. One such safeguard is for when patent monopolies prevent access to a medicine, governments are able to issue compulsory or government-use licences, known in UK law as crown use licences. Dr Andrew Hill from the University of Liverpool estimates that, under one of these licences, an identical but affordable copy of Orkambi could be bought for less than \u00a35,000 per patient per year.

Dr Hill has discovered that the drug is easy to manufacture, with dozens of companies around the world producing the chemicals for use in research.

Rams defeated 13-3 in lowest scoring Super Bowl ever One Super Bowl record was broken and another tied on Sunday night as the New England Patriots won their sixth NFL championship in 18 years under Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, equalling a record that took the Pittsburgh Steelers almost twice as long to set. It was, however, the lowest scoring Super Bowl game in history, the Patriots defeating the LA Rams 13-3 with an unlovely defensive masterclass. \u201cI\u2019ll take any ugly win over a pretty loss,\u201d said Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who was named the game\u2019s MVP. Half-time show. A shirtless Adam Levine led Maroon 5 through a forgettable half-time performance, after Rihanna, Cardi B and Jay-Z all reportedly turned down the opportunity in protest at the NFL\u2019s treatment of Colin Kaepernick. Big news. The Washington Post honoured the murdered journalists Marie Colvin and Jamal Khashoggi in its first Super Bowl ad, voiced by Tom Hanks. Venezuela crisis: EU countries recognise Guaid\u00f3 as president France, Spain, Sweden and the UK have recognised the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s interim president. The co-ordinated announcement came after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro failed to meet an EU deadline to call fresh, credible elections as his country slides further into crisis. Guaid\u00f3 has also urged China to drop its support for Maduro, who refused to rule out the possibility of civil war in a TV interview on Sunday. The next Vietnam? Maduro warned that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency would be \u201cstained with blood\u201d if the US pursued what he described as a \u201cdirty\u201d imperialist conspiracy to unseat him. El Salvador election: anti-graft candidate wins in landslide Nayib Bukele, who ran for the presidency of El Salvador with a promise to crack down on corruption, has won a landslide victory that puts an end to two-party dominance in a country plagued by gang violence and graft. With more than 50% of the votes, the former mayor of San Salvador avoids a March run-off election. A former member of the leftist ruling party, Bukele now leads a small conservative grouping, the Grand Alliance for National Unity, whose initials \u2013 Gana \u2013 mean \u201cwin\u201d in Spanish. Crime wave. Almost 67,000 Salvadorans are thought to belong to gangs, causing a crime wave that has forced many to flee the country\u2019s violence and seek refuge in the US and elsewhere. Big dairy pushes fattier milks into US schools The trade war with China has cost American dairy farmers an estimated $1.5bn in tariffs, but the Trump administration has nonetheless been working to appease dairy industry lobbyists, reports Jessica Glenza. That includes rolling back school nutrition rules to allow fattier chocolate and strawberry milks to be sold to roughly 31 million children in school cafeterias.

The US agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, tweeted in defence of the change, saying: \u201cNutritious school meals don\u2019t do anyone any good if kids just throw them into the trash.\u201d Crib sheet Five people have died after a small plane crashed into a house in southern California, killing the pilot and four occupants of the home in Yorba Linda, near Los Angeles. The former Democratic governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffehas said his successor, Ralph Northam, will \u201cput Virginia first\u201d and resign following the release of a racist photograph from his 1984 college yearbook. Musicians in Indonesia are in uproar over a government proposal to outlaw \u201cnegative influences from foreign cultures\u201d, an apparent reaction to the perceived immorality of some non-Indonesian pop stars. The new age author Marianne Williamson, who calls herself a \u201cbitch for God\u201d and is best known as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s spiritual adviser, has announced she will seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Listen to Today in Focus: My father voted for a far-right populist Hungary\u2019s far-right nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has spearheaded a populist surge in Europe. The Guardian\u2019s John Domokos examines Orb\u00e1n\u2019s appeal to Hungarian voters, including his own father. Must-reads Why the \u2018likability\u2019 question pursues female 2020 candidates A record number of Democratic women will seek the presidency in 2020, including senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. They\u2019ve all endured the old question about their \u201clikability\u201d, but this time the sexist media coverage is being called out, writes Sabrina Siddiqui. Nathan Phillips wants to talk about Covington When the Native American elder Nathan Phillips came face-to-face with a Maga hat-wearing teenager at the Lincoln Memorial, they both became national figures overnight. Phillips tells his story to Julian Brave NoiseCat. How people in high-pressure jobs cope with stress A neurosurgeon, a business magnate, a Spice Girl \u2026 the Guardian\u2019s Joe Stone asked 12 successful people, including Richard Branson and Mel C, how they deal with the inevitable stress of their high-pressure jobs. Can Joshua Tree recover from the shutdown? The recent government shutdown left Joshua Tree national park at the mercy of vandals and other inconsiderate visitors, who did damage that one former park superintendent said would take 300 years to undo.

      "bodyText": "One thing alone could save the Maduro regime in Venezuela. That is western intervention. Nothing unites a country like a sovereign enemy on its borders. Venezuelans may hate their president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but they also hate the US. China may be exasperated, but it is Maduro\u2019s ally, and would have to help him if the US attacked. So the US, and everyone else, should leave Venezuela alone. Unintended consequences of outside intervention scream down the ages. Only Donald Trump seems deaf. Those who know and love Venezuela have watched the 20 years of Ch\u00e1vez-Maduro with pain. Never has a rich oil economy, in the east or the west, been so completely raped by a kleptocracy masquerading as an ideology. Never has socialism been so tested to destruction. It is no one else\u2019s fault. Venezuela has had ample aid from Russia and China. It was a (relatively) peaceful and prosperous country before Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He and his successor wrecked it. That they should have been backed by Lenin\u2019s \u201cuseful idiots\u201d in Britain\u2019s Labour party is stupefying. Now those Venezuelans who have not fled the chaos are facing the dreadful moment of having to topple their own government. This primarily means persuading their army to help them.

In a previous century, bulbs were Scilly\u2019s heavy industry. The temperate climate of England\u2019s largest archipelago, off the south-west tip of Cornwall, enabled islanders to grow them in time for Christmas, and whisk them to markets in Covent Garden and Birmingham. Globalisation has blown away this industry; only a couple of people still grow flowers on St Martin\u2019s. But the crop has escaped its fields and grows all over, flowering on moors and overlooking the white sandy coves of Great and Little Bay.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always loved spring \u2013 who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 and it happens earlier and in a more supercharged fashion on Scilly than anywhere else in Britain.</p> <p>St Mary\u2019s is the big island, Tresco is the touristy one, and Bryher is the one that discerning <em>Observer</em> readers usually rave about.

After a rather rough ferry crossing from Penzance, we were decanted into a little boat at St Mary\u2019s scenic stone harbour. Crossing the calm, turquoise waters between the islands, we arrived at the stone jetty of St Martin\u2019s and were greeted by Viv Jackson, our host, in an old red Massey Ferguson tractor. Viv drove us at a brisk island pace (10mph) on the main road (a narrow, rutted lane) to our chalet, a simple but modern two-bedroom cabin with glorious views west over the archipelago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0804d58dfaeb23269bc86b1638d258d1820998d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0804d58dfaeb23269bc86b1638d258d1820998d2/89_0_2427_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick\u2019s daughters play with the sheep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick\u2019s daughters play with the sheep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We passed a wooden shed that is the post office/shop and another shed that is the coastguard/fire station.

It took me a while to realise the island\u2019s simplicity \u2013 no marinas, golf courses or lavish bungalows \u2013 is because it is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Prince Charles has saved St Martin\u2019s from over-commercialism, but some islanders grumble they can\u2019t do what they like with their homes.</p> <p>Holidaymakers may be unsettled to find that there is very little to do on St Martin\u2019s. I found this profoundly liberating. Each day, I held up my forefinger to discover the wind direction. Then we chose the most sheltered of St Martin\u2019s many beaches and coves.</p> <p>Here we let our small children run far freer than at home.

      "bodyText": "Golden Mary, Scilly White, Sunrise, Golden Spur, Emperor, Empress, Cheerfulness, Magnificence, Soleil d\u2019Or. There is poetry in the names of daffodil and narcissi varieties sprouting from all corners of St Martin\u2019s. This tiny island, barely two miles long and mostly less than half a mile wide, is filled with flowers in spring. The strong scent of narcissi wafts over the lanes, and the hedgerows and fields burst with dainty pink lilies, enormous tree lupins, purple agapanthus and creamy three-cornered leek. Even the rubbish tip is festooned with bluebells and daffodils. The flowers are rather like smoke rising from a long-abandoned factory. In a previous century, bulbs were Scilly\u2019s heavy industry. The temperate climate of England\u2019s largest archipelago, off the south-west tip of Cornwall, enabled islanders to grow them in time for Christmas, and whisk them to markets in Covent Garden and Birmingham. Globalisation has blown away this industry; only a couple of people still grow flowers on St Martin\u2019s. But the crop has escaped its fields and grows all over, flowering on moors and overlooking the white sandy coves of Great and Little Bay. I\u2019ve always loved spring \u2013 who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 and it happens earlier and in a more supercharged fashion on Scilly than anywhere else in Britain. St Mary\u2019s is the big island, Tresco is the touristy one, and Bryher is the one that discerning Observer readers usually rave about. But I took my family (wife Lisa, twins Milly and Esme, and Ted, then aged four and two) to St Martin\u2019s because the most eastern of the inhabited islands is less acclaimed. Romantic mainlanders have long been tantalised by the distant sight of Scilly from Land\u2019s End, \u201can eternal stone armada of over a hundred ships, aloofly anchored off England\u201d, as John Fowles put it. \u201cMute, enticing, forever just out of reach.\u201d In reality, Scilly is a small archipelago struggling to make its way in the modern world, permanently obscured by forecasters\u2019 bottoms on the weather map. Nevertheless, there is a unique magic about arriving on a small island. After a rather rough ferry crossing from Penzance, we were decanted into a little boat at St Mary\u2019s scenic stone harbour. Crossing the calm, turquoise waters between the islands, we arrived at the stone jetty of St Martin\u2019s and were greeted by Viv Jackson, our host, in an old red Massey Ferguson tractor. Viv drove us at a brisk island pace (10mph) on the main road (a narrow, rutted lane) to our chalet, a simple but modern two-bedroom cabin with glorious views west over the archipelago. We passed a wooden shed that is the post office/shop and another shed that is the coastguard/fire station. The fire engine is a tractor. The green hedges are called \u201cfences\u201d. They have been planted against the old stone walls, which are called \u201chedges\u201d. In one field, an old man in yellow oilskins is bent over a row of daffodils, an image which could be from any time in the last two centuries. St Martin\u2019s is absurdly dinky but not twee. There were scruffy barns and piles of old lobster pots, and roadside crates of eggs and flowers with honesty boxes beside them. It took me a while to realise the island\u2019s simplicity \u2013 no marinas, golf courses or lavish bungalows \u2013 is because it is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Prince Charles has saved St Martin\u2019s from over-commercialism, but some islanders grumble they can\u2019t do what they like with their homes. Holidaymakers may be unsettled to find that there is very little to do on St Martin\u2019s. I found this profoundly liberating. Each day, I held up my forefinger to discover the wind direction. Then we chose the most sheltered of St Martin\u2019s many beaches and coves. Here we let our small children run far freer than at home. They loved speeding over the hill, out of sight, and pottering to the shop for an ice-cream each day. We drank in the island\u2019s pub, ate at its excellent, popular chippy, sat in the sheltered gardens of its cafe, and gossiped with other visitors and locals. There\u2019s fishing, too. One day, we took the little ferry over to Tresco. This island is devoted to the business of tourism and bustles with well-heeled families exclaiming loudly as they whizz around on hired bikes.

His interest in tattooing was sparked when a friend gave him a tattoo machine for his 19th birthday. \u201cI learned to do it by trial and error,\u201d he says, and laughs. \u201cI was lucky to have friends who let me practise on their bodies.\u201d He is now one of the best-known tattoo artists in Tehran, with more than 55,000 followers on Instagram. Among his clients are famous Iranian musicians and actors. They don\u2019t come for roses or tribal patterns, but for Aflaki\u2019s unique designs, which are often inspired by the character of his clients. \u201cIt\u2019s my art that\u2019s important to me and nothing else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many other things that are not allowed in Iran, like graffiti, rock music and hip-hop. But in spite of that, many Iranians dedicate their lives to them. We all knew the situation when we started and we have come to terms with it. I don\u2019t complain about it.\u201d He adds: \u201cA tattoo functions as an \u2018identity maker\u2019. It\u2019s a way to create a unique personality. I think that\u2019s important for young people in a country like Iran.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

The former park superintendent Curt Sauer made headlines when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/28/joshua-tree-national-park-damage-government-shutdown\">said it could take \u201c300 years\u201d for the park to recover</a>.</p> <p>A visit to the park this week found a sense of normality returning.

The park typically sees about 3 million visitors a year, but local residents say the shutdown has affected business \u2013 Purdy\u2019s was down 20% in January, while Peck had people cancelling hikes.</p> <p>On the trails, a hiker approached a ranger to ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the damage?\u201d and was pleased to hear that most of it had already been cleaned up.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really happy to be back at work,\u201d said the ranger, who asked not to be named because he hadn\u2019t been authorized to talk to the media. \u201cIt was just getting depressing as the shutdown dragged on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52fcc9df492fa2a1aef41bb1724391015fe042ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52fcc9df492fa2a1aef41bb1724391015fe042ea/0_0_1999_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Freshly etched graffiti on an artifact along the Wall Street Mill trail.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshly etched graffiti on an artifact along the Wall Street Mill trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Francis Peters/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peck says he saw a lot of people taking advantage of the park being understaffed during the shutdown. Instead of hundreds of rangers educating and helping people, there were only a handful of law enforcement personnel. As he guided visitors up hiking trails, he saw people hiking on trails with their dogs, flying drones, parking anywhere and even bringing speakers on hikes with them \u2013 all banned activities that would usually be stopped by a ranger at trailheads.</p> <p>Purdy, meanwhile, says she saw people parking up to five cars at campsites that allowed only two cars, and saw evidence of people creating their own campsites, using Joshua trees and other materials to build fires.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the shutdown, people were giving themselves more leeway to get flexible with their morals,\u201d Peck explains. \u201cPeople should treat the park as a living museum: look but don\u2019t touch, and definitely don\u2019t take anything.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the problems, off-road driving did the most damage to the 800,000-acre park, says Andrew Munoz, a supervisory public affairs officer with the National Park Service. \u201cIn desert park environments, a single tire track can break through the fragile microbiotic crust and cause significant scarring and damage,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile it is unlikely the effects will last for as long as 300 years, the damage is long term.\u201d For example, the tracks left by Gen George Patton on the desert training grounds in 1942 are still visible in the park today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/trump-white-house-oregon-shutdown-national-forest-service\">Oregon governor's husband cleans park bathroom \u2013 and sends Trump the bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The park service has already started remediating the track impacts, by raking them out, ideally when the soil is moist. The recovery process can be accelerated by mixing chunks of cryptobiotic crust and mixing it in with the affected soil.

      "bodyText": "As Ethan Peck\u2019s boots crunch through the desert sands, he stops to point out tracks on the side of the trail: not coyote or other wildlife, but dog prints. \u201cIt\u2019s just sad that people would do this,\u201d says Peck, who owns Joshua Tree Adventures and has lived in the area for seven years. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to hike with your dog [off-leash] in any national park.\u201d The 35-day US government shutdown may be over for now, but it has brought stress to the fragile desert ecosystem of Joshua Tree national park and the tight-knit community that surrounds it. The former park superintendent Curt Sauer made headlines when he said it could take \u201c300 years\u201d for the park to recover. A visit to the park this week found a sense of normality returning. Rangers are back, and outward signs of destruction were few. But subtle signs of trouble were easy to spot with a trained eye: Peck points out dog prints. Tire tracks off the established roads. Fresh graffiti on a second-world-war-era water drum. The park service reports that people drove between 10 and 24 miles off-road over the fragile desert soil, and built 108 illegal fire rings. Someone drove into a Joshua tree and knocked it down at a campground. Many people posted photos on Instagram of themselves climbing, hugging or decorating Joshua trees. Three hundred years may seem like a long time, but the balance of a desert ecosystem sits on a razor edge. Dogs pose a threat to protected bighorn sheep, says Peck, and while Joshua trees look hearty, they actually have shallow root systems that depend on a delicate brew of micro-organisms \u2013 a mix of fungi, algae and bacteria \u2013 that can take centuries to repair. \u201cDesert soils are a very strange beast,\u201d says Sabra Purdy, a longtime Joshua Tree resident and park guide. \u201cWhen sand gets pulverized by a vehicle, you\u2019re not only running over vegetation, but you are damaging the ability of the soil to regenerate.\u201d \u2018A living museum\u2019 On a bright but cloudy Thursday in the park, only a handful of cars were lined up at the entrance kiosk. The park typically sees about 3 million visitors a year, but local residents say the shutdown has affected business \u2013 Purdy\u2019s was down 20% in January, while Peck had people cancelling hikes. On the trails, a hiker approached a ranger to ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the damage?\u201d and was pleased to hear that most of it had already been cleaned up. \u201cWe\u2019re really happy to be back at work,\u201d said the ranger, who asked not to be named because he hadn\u2019t been authorized to talk to the media. \u201cIt was just getting depressing as the shutdown dragged on.\u201d Peck says he saw a lot of people taking advantage of the park being understaffed during the shutdown. Instead of hundreds of rangers educating and helping people, there were only a handful of law enforcement personnel. As he guided visitors up hiking trails, he saw people hiking on trails with their dogs, flying drones, parking anywhere and even bringing speakers on hikes with them \u2013 all banned activities that would usually be stopped by a ranger at trailheads. Purdy, meanwhile, says she saw people parking up to five cars at campsites that allowed only two cars, and saw evidence of people creating their own campsites, using Joshua trees and other materials to build fires. \u201cDuring the shutdown, people were giving themselves more leeway to get flexible with their morals,\u201d Peck explains. \u201cPeople should treat the park as a living museum: look but don\u2019t touch, and definitely don\u2019t take anything.\u201d Of all the problems, off-road driving did the most damage to the 800,000-acre park, says Andrew Munoz, a supervisory public affairs officer with the National Park Service. \u201cIn desert park environments, a single tire track can break through the fragile microbiotic crust and cause significant scarring and damage,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile it is unlikely the effects will last for as long as 300 years, the damage is long term.\u201d For example, the tracks left by Gen George Patton on the desert training grounds in 1942 are still visible in the park today. The park service has already started remediating the track impacts, by raking them out, ideally when the soil is moist. The recovery process can be accelerated by mixing chunks of cryptobiotic crust and mixing it in with the affected soil. Munoz says resource managers at Joshua Tree have used this process to deal with approximately 20 miles of vehicle tracks in the park so far. The park has become something of a poster child for shutdown damage, but experts say the events have raised awareness of the burden that a shutdown places on the park system as a whole. \u201cIn part, awareness of a shutdown\u2019s impact on parks is heightened because parks are perceived as relatively immune to partisanship,\u201d says Michelle Sullivan Govani, a doctoral candidate at Arizona State University who studies national parks. \u201cAmerica\u2019s public lands are often upheld as shining trophies of democracy at work.\u201d \u201cEven if we disagree about how to use them or manage them, the public generally agrees that parks should exist and be open to all,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo it stands out when parks get dragged into a nasty political battle that results in their degradation.\u201d Fears of another shutdown Local volunteers were vital in keeping the park in order while federal workers were furloughed. On Christmas Eve, with the shutdown in full swing, Purdy and her husband purchased $150 worth of toilet paper and cleaning supplies and headed into the park. Over the following weeks they joined others \u2013 sometimes up to 60 people at a time \u2013 to clean and sweep bathrooms, restock toilet paper and haul out trash.

It also served as an introduction to the ritual internal trial that would take place whenever a feast of football \u2013 World Cup or the Euros \u2013 clashed with exams. Back then, this just felt like a cruel coincidence, a random act decided by the wicked football gods. Over time, however, I\u2019d hear more pupils and parents lament this biennial collision and wondered if it had to be like this.</p> <p>Anyone who has ever revised for exams has struggled with the battle to retain focus. That task is made dramatically harder when attempted in the midst of international football tournaments \u2013 the ultimate monsters of distraction.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272718302330?dgcid=coauthor#bb0165\" title=\"\">Fascinating new research</a> from respected academics Robert Metcalfe, Simon Burgess and Steven Proud brings home quite how important this is. They compare GCSE results in the 2000s for all teenagers in England in tournament years compared to football-free ones. They find that pupils do significantly worse during tournament years: across all pupils the chances of achieving the key benchmark of five good GCSEs fell by 12%. Girls, as well as boys, do worse (though the latter are hit harder).</p> <p>But this overall dip in results is dwarfed when the researchers zoom in on particular groups. The chances of white working-class boys \u2013 who already massively underperform other groups \u2013 reaching the bar of five good GCSEs fell by 28% during tournament years. Black Caribbean boys experienced a similar decline. Given the study covered years that predated the rise of mass social media, if anything it might understate the effect today.</p> <p>These are huge effects and their consequences will last a lifetime. Securing five good GCSEs raises the likelihood of progressing with learning and gives a strong boost to future earnings. Debating the impact of football on exams may sound fun, but the findings are incredibly serious.</p> <p>Step back and we can see that this study pinpoints the confluence of several national characteristics. Our obsession with football is hardly unique, but surely we have got it as bad as any country. And when it comes to putting our teenagers through high-stakes exams at 16, again, we are not alone but we are something of an outlier. When these two traits collide in June every second year another of our national features \u2013 rampant educational inequality \u2013 is made far worse.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, of course, that there will always be extraneous and disparate events to distract revising teenagers. Most of the time there will be little we can do. But the epic scale and total predictability of international football tournaments is different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/21/no-other-european-country-tests-at-16-scrap-gcses\">No other European country tests children at 16: let\u2019s scrap pointless GCSEs | Sandra Leaton Gray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Say, for instance, we nudged forward the start of the school year by a week and squeezed a week between Easter and the commencement of the summer exam season so as to dodge the worst of the tests v football car-crash. This would doubtless cause some disruption for schools: all change comes with a cost. But we must compare this with the exceptionally high social and economic price of sticking with the status quo. Given that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2022\" title=\"\">2022 World Cup in Qatar</a> will take place in the autumn, we have a one-off four-year window of opportunity (after the Euros next summer) to debate this and get it right.</p> <p>Looking back, I was never going to pass my RE O-level. The die had been cast long before a ball was kicked in Mexico 86. But it\u2019s now clear that every second year tens of thousands of young people \u2013 especially disadvantaged boys \u2013 do worse in their GCSEs than their peers who happen to be a year older or younger for no reason other than the arbitrary clash of tournaments and tests. Now that we know this, the question is whether we opt to do anything about it.</p> <p>\u2022 Gavin Kelly is chief executive of the Resolution Trust and chair of the Living Wage Commission</p>",

As a football obsessive I had long known that the World Cup in Mexico in 1986 \u2013 with England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all playing \u2013 was going to clash with the O-level exam season. But I hadn\u2019t really reckoned with how much stronger the lure of Gary Lineker and co would be when the alternative was RE revision. Given the footballing delights on display \u2013 whether Diego Maradona\u2019s \u201cgoal of the century\u201d or the drama of the Brazil v France penalty shootout \u2013 it was a one-sided contest for my attention. Mexico 1986 didn\u2019t just provide me with my first real taste of the intense footballing joy that comes before the inevitable heartbreak. It also served as an introduction to the ritual internal trial that would take place whenever a feast of football \u2013 World Cup or the Euros \u2013 clashed with exams. Back then, this just felt like a cruel coincidence, a random act decided by the wicked football gods. Over time, however, I\u2019d hear more pupils and parents lament this biennial collision and wondered if it had to be like this. Anyone who has ever revised for exams has struggled with the battle to retain focus. That task is made dramatically harder when attempted in the midst of international football tournaments \u2013 the ultimate monsters of distraction. Fascinating new research from respected academics Robert Metcalfe, Simon Burgess and Steven Proud brings home quite how important this is. They compare GCSE results in the 2000s for all teenagers in England in tournament years compared to football-free ones. They find that pupils do significantly worse during tournament years: across all pupils the chances of achieving the key benchmark of five good GCSEs fell by 12%. Girls, as well as boys, do worse (though the latter are hit harder). But this overall dip in results is dwarfed when the researchers zoom in on particular groups. The chances of white working-class boys \u2013 who already massively underperform other groups \u2013 reaching the bar of five good GCSEs fell by 28% during tournament years. Black Caribbean boys experienced a similar decline. Given the study covered years that predated the rise of mass social media, if anything it might understate the effect today. These are huge effects and their consequences will last a lifetime. Securing five good GCSEs raises the likelihood of progressing with learning and gives a strong boost to future earnings. Debating the impact of football on exams may sound fun, but the findings are incredibly serious. Step back and we can see that this study pinpoints the confluence of several national characteristics. Our obsession with football is hardly unique, but surely we have got it as bad as any country. And when it comes to putting our teenagers through high-stakes exams at 16, again, we are not alone but we are something of an outlier. When these two traits collide in June every second year another of our national features \u2013 rampant educational inequality \u2013 is made far worse. It\u2019s true, of course, that there will always be extraneous and disparate events to distract revising teenagers. Most of the time there will be little we can do. But the epic scale and total predictability of international football tournaments is different. Say, for instance, we nudged forward the start of the school year by a week and squeezed a week between Easter and the commencement of the summer exam season so as to dodge the worst of the tests v football car-crash. This would doubtless cause some disruption for schools: all change comes with a cost. But we must compare this with the exceptionally high social and economic price of sticking with the status quo. Given that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will take place in the autumn, we have a one-off four-year window of opportunity (after the Euros next summer) to debate this and get it right. Looking back, I was never going to pass my RE O-level. The die had been cast long before a ball was kicked in Mexico 86. But it\u2019s now clear that every second year tens of thousands of young people \u2013 especially disadvantaged boys \u2013 do worse in their GCSEs than their peers who happen to be a year older or younger for no reason other than the arbitrary clash of tournaments and tests. Now that we know this, the question is whether we opt to do anything about it. \u2022 Gavin Kelly is chief executive of the Resolution Trust and chair of the Living Wage Commission",

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Liverpool will attack the Premier League and Champions League with the same intensity this month as the pursuit of a first league title for 29 years will not divert focus from the season\u2019s other main goal. The Premier League leaders can restore the five-point point gap over Manchester City on Monday when they visit struggling West Ham. Their quest for a sixth European Cup then resumes on 19 February when Bayern Munich visit Anfield in the last 16 of the Champions League. Early elimination from both domestic cup competitions has eased Liverpool\u2019s schedule for the run-in, not that their manager wished it that way, but Klopp maintains the club\u2019s longing for the Premier League title will not hinder efforts to go one step further in this season\u2019s Champions League. \u201cWe will try [to go for both], for sure,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cThat is what we tried last year. There was the discussion this year when people said we should focus only on the league so now we are still in the Champions League and I am quite happy about it. We have a very difficult game yet listening to some people it seems we are already through because \u2018It\u2019s only Bayern Munich\u2019. Have you looked at the team they have or how they are in shape now after the winter break? \u201cWe will be ready for the Champions League and a very, very tough game. This is the Champions League \u2013 one game and then two weeks before we play them again. We always play the league and the Champions League is then a little sweet in between and we will go for it with all we have. That is normal.\u201d Liverpool travel to West Ham with continued injury problems in defence, although James Milner is available after suspension to deputise at right-back. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez remain on the sidelines through injury and it was confirmed on Sunday that Dejan Lovren will miss out with a recurrence of a hamstring problem. Captain Jordan Henderson, who filled in at full-back in the 1-1 draw with Leicester City, has been unable to train fully recently due to a calf injury. On Monday Liverpool announced that Gomez is to have surgery to help his recovery from a fracture to his lower left leg. No return date has been stated but the club said it was likely Gomez would play again this season. \u201cHe is too valuable to take any risk with, both for our present and future, so we get this procedure done and he comes back when he\u2019s ready,\u201d Klopp told Liverpool\u2019s website. Klopp believes his leaders have demonstrated their willingness to fight for every point and that spirit will be essential to ending Liverpool\u2019s desperate wait for a 19th league championship. The Liverpool manager added: \u201cAfter the Leicester game I heard the words from [Claude] Puel that they deserved more. I don\u2019t know where he got that from to be honest but it\u2019s all good, he is entitled to his view. It was an absolutely normal game and we drew. That happens, it will happen again this season. Probably. We are still in the race and if we dropped points or whatever, then it\u2019s still a point against Leicester. Let\u2019s carry on again. \u201cBut the next game is difficult again and then comes Bournemouth, who beat Chelsea 4-0 and not because Chelsea made them presents. So that\u2019s the season. If you want to finish the season now then leave. Come back in May and we play another one. We cannot change that. We cannot talk week in, week out about the mindset because it will not change. \u201cIf we win games, and hopefully we win a lot of games, we will see how people deal with it. But it\u2019s part of the game, part of the business that these decisions are made late April or May. Until then, you have to gain points and gain points and get as much as possible and then we will see where we are when the decision will be made.\u201d",

A record 13.4 gigawatts of clean energy contracts were signed last year, <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/corporate-clean-energy-buying-surged-new-record-2018/\">according to BloombergNEF</a>.</p> <p>The lagoon\u2019s backers also believe its prospects will be boosted by adding floating solar panels to the lagoon, ramping up the amount of electricity it generates. UK water companies have already used floating solar power on reservoirs in Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/worlds-biggest-floating-solar-farm-power-up-outside-london\">near Heathrow</a> and elsewhere.</p> <p>The addition of solar should increase the Swansea lagoon\u2019s annual energy output by more than a third, up from 572 gigawatt hours, enough to power about 150,000 homes, to about 770GWh.</p> <p>Chris Nutt, the business development manager at Tidal Power, said: \u201cIt is becoming widely understood that there is a huge hole left in our long-term energy demands and after the latest cancellation of expected new nuclear capacity our choices if anything have become simpler \u2013 saturate the UK coastline with offshore wind or invest in groundbreaking solutions like Swansea Bay.\u201d</p> <p>The company is sounding out big energy users, including leading brands in the professional services, telecoms, media, manufacturing, services and utilities sectors.</p> <p>Mark Bailey, the director of planning and development at Cardiff airport, said: \u201cThe tidal lagoon project \u2026 could be a game changer for the Welsh economy.\u201d</p> <p>The plan is to secure enough signed PPAs by the end of the year to enable a final investment decision in early 2020, with construction starting shortly afterwards. If that timetable were met, the project would be generating power in 2024 or 2025.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Going ahead without subsidies would be a rarity for a new power station in the UK, almost all of which rely on some form of government contract or subsidy before being greenlit.</p> <p>Advocates of the project have said the predictability of the tides could be useful as nuclear falters and variable sources such as solar and wind power grow.

      "bodyText": "The backers of a pioneering project to harness energy from the tides off the Welsh coast have rebooted the scheme and believe they can build it without the help of government. With the recent failure of two major nuclear projects, attention has turned to alternatives to fill the low-carbon power gap, with developers of windfarms and small nuclear plants among those vying for government support. Now the firm behind the proposed Swansea tidal lagoon, for which ministers rejected subsidies last year on the grounds it was too costly, has said it believes the project can work without government money and be built within six years. Swansea-based Tidal Power plc said several major companies were interested in buying the low-carbon electricity generated by the tide flowing through turbines in a concrete wall along Swansea bay. Property company Land Securities, Cardiff airport and developer Berkeley Group are among those to have expressed an interest in signing a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the lagoon. Such PPA deals are typically used by big energy users as a way of hedging against future power price rises, or burnishing green credentials by buying from renewable sources. A record 13.4 gigawatts of clean energy contracts were signed last year, according to BloombergNEF. The lagoon\u2019s backers also believe its prospects will be boosted by adding floating solar panels to the lagoon, ramping up the amount of electricity it generates. UK water companies have already used floating solar power on reservoirs in Manchester, near Heathrow and elsewhere. The addition of solar should increase the Swansea lagoon\u2019s annual energy output by more than a third, up from 572 gigawatt hours, enough to power about 150,000 homes, to about 770GWh. Chris Nutt, the business development manager at Tidal Power, said: \u201cIt is becoming widely understood that there is a huge hole left in our long-term energy demands and after the latest cancellation of expected new nuclear capacity our choices if anything have become simpler \u2013 saturate the UK coastline with offshore wind or invest in groundbreaking solutions like Swansea Bay.\u201d The company is sounding out big energy users, including leading brands in the professional services, telecoms, media, manufacturing, services and utilities sectors. Mark Bailey, the director of planning and development at Cardiff airport, said: \u201cThe tidal lagoon project \u2026 could be a game changer for the Welsh economy.\u201d The plan is to secure enough signed PPAs by the end of the year to enable a final investment decision in early 2020, with construction starting shortly afterwards. If that timetable were met, the project would be generating power in 2024 or 2025. Going ahead without subsidies would be a rarity for a new power station in the UK, almost all of which rely on some form of government contract or subsidy before being greenlit. Advocates of the project have said the predictability of the tides could be useful as nuclear falters and variable sources such as solar and wind power grow. But government has been sceptical. The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament recently: \u201cNo one is more enthusiastic than I about innovation and new technologies, but the truth is that the costs of the proposed [Swansea] project were three times that of Hinkley Point C, and a full programme [of several lagoons] would make a tiny contribution to our energy supply for a much greater cost.\u201d",

Her fourth single shows a sharper side to the rising reggae star than her softer, previous tracks. The dubbed-out horns subtly amplify the threats she suggests in her lyrics: to blow away the competition (\u201cSay dem badder dan me so me kill dem and study dem anatomy\u201d), and for Jamaicans to rise up against economic hardship at their expense (\u201cand one people we forming \u2019cause the disparity alarming\u201d).

      "body": "<p>A few years ago Sir Alex Ferguson accused David Luiz of \u201crolling about like a dying swan\u201d to get one of his players sent off. But the Chelsea defender clearly wasn\u2019t hamming it up at Bournemouth last week when a Josh King piledriver nearly took his head off. As Luiz toppled to the ground, TV commentators suggested he had been \u201cabsolutely poleaxed\u201d and \u201ckayoed\u201d. Yet, incredibly, after a quick once-over he was back in action. As the NFL player <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjwatt/status/1090706380628127745\" title=\"\">JJ Watt dryly noted</a>: \u201cKnocked out cold, then back playing like a champ 45 seconds later. I guess the concussion protocols are a bit different across the pond.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/rugby-union-obsession-bulk-speed-skill-pat-lambie\">The Breakdown | Rugby union\u2019s obsession with bulk over speed and skill must be reversed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And elsewhere, too. Last month the UAE defender Fares Juma Al Saadi was knocked out after a sickening clash of heads with Australia\u2019s Mathew Leckie in an Asian Cup quarter-final. It was so bad that Juma left the pitch on a stretcher with his neck in a brace. Yet, miraculously, a few minutes later with the UAE 1-0 up in added time, he groggily returned. Four days later he was back for the UAE\u2019s semi-final against Qatar \u2013 a decision that led the players\u2019 union, Fifpro, to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FIFPro/status/1090258144117157890\" title=\"\">question publicly </a>whether Fifa\u2019s return to play protocol was followed.</p> <p>They were not the only ones with concerns. When I spoke to Dr Eric Nauman, who studies the impact of collisions on the brain in high school soccer and American football players, he was flabbergasted that both men had returned so quickly. As he pointed out, the symptoms of head injuries can take time to develop. \u201cAnd with all the other research out there, it should be patently obvious not to put somebody right back in like that,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Juma\u2019s case was even more worrying, said Nauman, because of the dangers of second-impact syndrome \u2013 which occurs when the brain swells rapidly after a person suffers a second concussion before symptoms from an earlier one have subsided, risking long-term damage. \u201cIt looked like Juma took two impacts almost simultaneously and one was head-to-head,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe fact he was knocked out puts him at serious risk, especially if the brain gets hit again \u2013 even if it is just from heading a goal kick or a keeper\u2019s punt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4358e2d8cd79fc647c048cba6688fb8ace875864\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4358e2d8cd79fc647c048cba6688fb8ace875864/0_0_4751_3355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mathew Leckie of Australia and Fares Juma Al Saadi of United Arab Emirates receive treatment in their Asian Cup match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mathew Leckie of Australia and Fares Juma Al Saadi of United Arab Emirates receive treatment in their Asian Cup match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both incidents reinforced something we already knew: when it comes to head injuries football\u2019s rules are not fit for purpose. As things stand, doctors have three minutes to assess a concussion, far less than the 10 needed to do a thorough head injury assessment. And yet a fix would be frustratingly easy to implement \u2013 all the game would have to do is allow replacement substitutes for suspected concussion cases, as in rugby union. However, last year the chairman of Fifa\u2019s medical committee, Michel D\u2019Hooghe, came out against it, fearing that teams might exploit it for tactical reasons. Perhaps they would. Yet better that, surely, than incentivising players to put team success over their own health?</p> <p>Some might believe we should trust athletes to know enough about concussion these days to understand when they are OK to play on.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago Sir Alex Ferguson accused David Luiz of \u201crolling about like a dying swan\u201d to get one of his players sent off. But the Chelsea defender clearly wasn\u2019t hamming it up at Bournemouth last week when a Josh King piledriver nearly took his head off. As Luiz toppled to the ground, TV commentators suggested he had been \u201cabsolutely poleaxed\u201d and \u201ckayoed\u201d. Yet, incredibly, after a quick once-over he was back in action. As the NFL player JJ Watt dryly noted: \u201cKnocked out cold, then back playing like a champ 45 seconds later. I guess the concussion protocols are a bit different across the pond.\u201d And elsewhere, too. Last month the UAE defender Fares Juma Al Saadi was knocked out after a sickening clash of heads with Australia\u2019s Mathew Leckie in an Asian Cup quarter-final. It was so bad that Juma left the pitch on a stretcher with his neck in a brace. Yet, miraculously, a few minutes later with the UAE 1-0 up in added time, he groggily returned. Four days later he was back for the UAE\u2019s semi-final against Qatar \u2013 a decision that led the players\u2019 union, Fifpro, to question publicly whether Fifa\u2019s return to play protocol was followed. They were not the only ones with concerns. When I spoke to Dr Eric Nauman, who studies the impact of collisions on the brain in high school soccer and American football players, he was flabbergasted that both men had returned so quickly. As he pointed out, the symptoms of head injuries can take time to develop. \u201cAnd with all the other research out there, it should be patently obvious not to put somebody right back in like that,\u201d he added. Juma\u2019s case was even more worrying, said Nauman, because of the dangers of second-impact syndrome \u2013 which occurs when the brain swells rapidly after a person suffers a second concussion before symptoms from an earlier one have subsided, risking long-term damage. \u201cIt looked like Juma took two impacts almost simultaneously and one was head-to-head,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe fact he was knocked out puts him at serious risk, especially if the brain gets hit again \u2013 even if it is just from heading a goal kick or a keeper\u2019s punt.\u201d Both incidents reinforced something we already knew: when it comes to head injuries football\u2019s rules are not fit for purpose. As things stand, doctors have three minutes to assess a concussion, far less than the 10 needed to do a thorough head injury assessment. And yet a fix would be frustratingly easy to implement \u2013 all the game would have to do is allow replacement substitutes for suspected concussion cases, as in rugby union. However, last year the chairman of Fifa\u2019s medical committee, Michel D\u2019Hooghe, came out against it, fearing that teams might exploit it for tactical reasons. Perhaps they would. Yet better that, surely, than incentivising players to put team success over their own health? Some might believe we should trust athletes to know enough about concussion these days to understand when they are OK to play on. New research, however, does not bear this out. A study published in December, based on interviews with 257 professional boxers, mixed martial artists and martial artists in Nevada, found that only 43% said they understood the symptoms of concussion either \u2018very well\u2019 or \u2018extremely well\u2019. Meanwhile 63% admitted their knowledge of the long-term effects of multiple concussions was non-existent, scant or basic \u2013 a worryingly high number given the dangers of CTE, the brain condition associated with repeated blows to the head, are increasingly well known. More alarmingly the research, published in the Physician and Sportsmedicine, also found that around 40% of fighters reported returning to training or competition the same day they felt a concussion was sustained. Why? The main reasons given were a love of fighting, their career aspirations and a desire to win \u2013 a jumble of factors that might sound coherent in the heat of battle, but rather less so when long-term brain damage kicks in. Such blase attitudes are not uncommon. A study of 829 retired NFL players, published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine last year, found that just over 50% did not inform medical staff of a sports-related concussion during their professional careers.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia is detaining female activists in cruel and inhumane conditions that meet the threshold of torture under both international and Saudi law, a cross-party panel of three British MPs has found. The conclusions indicate growing unease among western allies over alleged rights abuses under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto leader, who is already facing opprobrium over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. The ad hoc panel had sought access to eight jailed women to assess their welfare, but received no response from the Saudi ambassador Prince Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz. The panel includes Crispin Blunt, the former Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee and one of the staunchest defenders of the Gulf monarchies. It was thought his background might lead to cooperation from the kingdom, which protects its justice system from scrutiny. The panel\u2019s report concludes that the detainees \u2013 female activists arrested last spring \u2013 had been subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, including sleep deprivation, assault, threats to life and solitary confinement. Theeir treatment is likely to amount to torture and if they are not provided with urgent access to medical assistance they are at risk of developing long-term health conditions, the report says. Culpability rests not only with direct perpetrators but also those who are responsible for or acquiesce to it, it says. \u201cThe Saudi authorities at the highest levels could, in principle, be responsible for the crime of torture.\u201d The detained activists were strong supporters of women\u2019s right to drive \u2013 a demand to which the Saudi government acceded last year, but seems determined to ascribe solely to the leadership of Prince Mohammed. On their arrest, the women were labelled as traitors in the official Saudi press, and there have been persistent reports of maltreatment. They have been accused of suspicious contact with foreign entities. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, says it does not have political prisoners and denies torture allegations. Officials have said monitoring of activists is needed to ensure social stability. The county\u2019s human rights commission has the power to investigate allegations of maltreatment, but its work is viewed sceptically by most independent rights groups. Blunt said: \u201cThe Saudi women activist detainees have been treated so badly as to sustain an international investigation for torture. Denied proper access to medical care, legal advice or visits from their families, their solitary confinement and mistreatment are severe enough to meet the international definition of torture. \u201cSaudi Arabia stands on the brink.

Agnes Callamard\u2019s team was not granted access to the three-storey consulate building in which Khashoggi was killed by a team of operatives sent from Riyadh, nor was it allowed to interview Saudi officials. It is understood Callamard listened to audio recordings of the dissident journalist\u2019s death, which Turkey has also shared with the CIA director, Gina Haspel, the UK, Canada, Germany and France. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, demanded answers from the kingdom in a television interview on Sunday night, and criticised the US for not taking a stronger stance over Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u201cI cannot understand America\u2019s silence when such a horrific attack took place, and even after members of the CIA listened to the recordings we provided,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. \u201cWe want everything to be clarified because this is not an ordinary killing, it is an atrocity, there is a murder.\u201d Riyadh arrested 22 people in connection with Khashoggi\u2019s death, which the kingdom maintains was carried out without the knowledge of the crown prince.

Yet incentive, bonus and commission schemes throughout the financial services industry have measured sales and profit, but not compliance with the law and proper standards. Incentives have been offered, and rewards have been paid, regardless of whether the sale was made, or profit derived, in accordance with law. Rewards have been paid regardless of whether the person rewarded <em>should </em>have done what they did. </p> \n  <p>Second, entities and individuals acted in the ways they did because they could. Entities set the terms on which they would deal, consumers often had little detailed knowledge or understanding of the transaction and consumers had next to no power to negotiate the terms. At most, a consumer could choose from an array of products offered by an entity, or by that entity and others, and the consumer was often not able to make a well-informed choice between them. There was a marked imbalance of power and knowledge between those providing the product or service and those acquiring it. </p> \n  <p>Third, consumers often dealt with a financial services entity through an intermediary. The client might assume that the person standing between the client and the entity that would provide a financial service or product acted for the client and in the client\u2019s interests.

Providing a service to customers was relegated to second place. Sales became all important. Those who dealt with customers became sellers. And the confusion extended well beyond the frontline service staff. Advisers became sellers and sellers became advisers.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Not only that, but Hayne found those who broke the law were not held to account.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMisconduct will be deterred only if entities believe that misconduct will be detected, denounced and justly punished. Misconduct, especially misconduct that yields profit, is not deterred by requiring those who are found to have done wrong to do no more than pay compensation. And wrongdoing is not denounced by issuing a media release. The Australian community expects, and is entitled to expect, that if an entity breaks the law and causes damage to customers, it will compensate those affected customers. But the community also expects that financial entities that break the law be held to account.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>As an overview, on page 157 of the first volume of the report, Hayne says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It would be for prosecuting authorities to determine how charges would be framed. One way may be to fix upon one or more events of \u2018taking\u2019 by the entity. </p> \n   <p>But however the charges are framed, it may be expected that the prosecution would seek to lead evidence that the particular takings charged were made as part of an established system and were not matters of accident. If the taking of fees was objectively dishonest, the question becomes as I have indicated: on what basis <em>on the evidence </em>would it be argued that a jury should entertain a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that it was acting dishonestly by taking payment for a service that it did not provide?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T05:57:02.438Z\">at 5.57am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57d1d1e4b0c3e1fbdbd9f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T05:49:37.979Z\">5.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>is making a statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Today the government is releasing the final report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. It\u2019s a scathing assessment of conduct driven by greed and behaviour that was in breach of existing law and fell well below community expectations.</p> \n   <p>The price paid by our community for this misconduct is immense. And goes beyond just the financial. There have been broken businesses, and the emotional stress and personal pain has broken lives. In disbelief, the nation has heard evidence prepared, presented before the commission of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for no service, companies misleading and obstructing regulators, the charging of dead people, the sale knowingly of worthless insurance policies, and who could forget the appalling audio recording of a young man with downs syndrome subject to high pressure sales tactics resulting in the purchase of a financial product that he clearly did not want, need, or understand. </p> \n   <p>This is why the community\u2019s trust in our financial institutions has been lost and this is why it must be restored.</p> \n   <p> From today, the banking sector must change and change forever. In Commissioner Hayne\u2019s own words, \u201cThere can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and their boards and their senior management.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The undeniable fact, Commissioner Hayne said, \u201cis it is those that are engaged in misconduct that are responsible for what they did and the consequences that followed\u201d. This has resulted in the commissioner making more than 20 referrals to Asic and Apra, covering a range of misconduct from fees for no service, to best interest duty breaches and misleading and deceptive conduct. My message to the financial sector today is that this misconduct must end. And you must put the interests of consumers first. Consumers must be treated fairly.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T07:23:01.577Z\">at 7.23am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57d17ee4b0d86c56438677\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T05:45:52.285Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sorry \u2013 we had some technical problems. We are back.</p> \n  <p>The report, is, in a word, scathing. SCATHING. Of the industry, of the regulators, of the environment in which it was allowed to flourish. And it is not over yet.</p> \n  <p>I know you will have been sweating on this all day. So here is the very quick version of what is in those thousands of pages.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Bankers are not named and shamed, </strong>but Kenneth Hayne lays out the potential for more than 20 prosecutions involving the major banks, at the discretion of the regulators, some which could be criminal, some civil, and some both.<br></li> \n   <li>Of the 24 referrals for \u201cfurther action\u201d, <strong>all the major banks are listed, except Westpac.</strong><br></li> \n   <li>The <strong>regulators stay as they are, but are on notice </strong>to do better when it comes to enforcement. If Asic doesn\u2019t pick up its game and prosecute more often, not just settle out of plain sight, there is room to make it just an investigative body and hand prosecuting powers to something else.</li> \n   <li>The report points the way <strong>to an end to practices like conflicted renumeration </strong>\u2013 you can\u2019t advise for a client and get rewarded by a bank/financial service for providing that client at the same time, for instance. That seems like a pretty big no brainer, but it has taken a royal commission to get here.</li> \n   <li>There will be a <strong>compensation scheme of last resort, funded by the banks.</strong> The government is working up legislation on that now. All the banks will have to pay, because it is part of their licence. For those who belonged to entities that have gone belly up, you\u2019ll also be covered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That is the super short version of the 76 recommendations. </p> \n  <p>I know you want to know who will be prosecuted. We can\u2019t say who, because we don\u2019t know. We can just take from the case studies which were presented, where Hayne has outlined cases from what he heard during the commission:</p> \n  <p>We didn\u2019t have access to the relevant laws in the lock-up and, honestly, it would take a lawyer to look at the acts and determine which were civil and which were criminal.</p> \n  <p>But <strong>Hayne has recommended the regulators look over at least 24 cases, including:</strong></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Five involving the Commonwealth Bank of Australia<br></li> \n   <li>Three involving Colonial First State<br></li> \n   <li>Three involving Allianz<br></li> \n   <li>Two involving ANZ<br></li> \n   <li>Two involving National Australia Bank<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>For potential further action. The commissioner has recommended Asic look at least 10 case studies, and Apra, at least 12.</p> \n  <p>There is a lot more to go through, but that is the helicopter view of the three volumes and thousands of pages. But it\u2019s not over yet \u2013 we are about to smack you in the face with three hours of intense study.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T05:56:23.262Z\">at 5.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57d0fce4b072f2ace1c6e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T05:44:34.802Z\">5.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hayne slams banking culture</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Kenneth Hayne\u2019s report has laid the blame for the misconduct directly at the feet of senior banking executives.</p> \n  <p>This is a key quote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and those who managed and controlled those entities: their boards and senior management.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s it. The banking royal commission wraps up in time for the next election and both the banks, and regulators can breath a sigh of relief, because no individuals have been named for criminal or civil charges, and the regulator can stay, largely as it is. But that is not where this story ends, and I think we all know that. The government now has to deal with the fallout \u2013 from the sector, from those disappointed with where the recommendations stopped, and from its own 16-month denial of the need for the commission itself. \u201cLabor failed to do it when it was in power\u201d is already running out of steam. People are going to expect that to be addressed, and addressed soon. Scott Morrison hasn\u2019t been heard on the report as yet. That will probably change tomorrow. Given the flooding situation in Queensland, and his appearance in Tasmania today, after that state\u2019s bushfires, he is going to be busy. Parliament resumes for the first time this year next week. None of these issues are going away soon. Thank you so much for joining us for this special edition of politics live, and for sticking with us as I wrestled with the internet connection immediately after the lock-up. If it helps, I have aged about 10 years in that delay getting the first posts up. A massive thank you to Katharine Murphy who is still toiling away at her keyboard and to Chris Knaus for stepping in today to help and the rest of the Guardian brains trust for keeping it all ticking over and cleaning up my typos, of which, as you can all attest, there are many. Check back over the next couple of days for more news on this, and everything else Australian politics, and Mike Bowers and I, along with the whole team, will be back with you bright and early on the blog, on 11 February. As always, take care of you. What have we learned? Well, the report wasn\u2019t as strong as some had hoped. But it did point out some pretty massive failures. Of the 76 recommendations, the government has pretty much accepted all of them. The user pays mortgage broker one has some caveats around it, but the rest are not that difficult to implement. No charges. As yet. But the commission has pointed out at least 24 cases where the regulator should have another look, particularly around the fees for no service scandal. That takes in all the major banks, except Westpac. There has been pushback against the compensation scheme of last resort from the financial services council \u2013 that is the government\u2019s plan to have the banks cover compensation for clients of other financial businesses which have gone belly up. The government can force the banks to do that, as part of their licence, but expect some \u2018consultation\u2019 on that. The Australian Banking Association says the report has been a wake up call and changes are already happening. Legislation will be introduced soon. But it has to be really soon to be passed before the next election. Labor views the recommendations as \u201ca beginning\u201d but has not ruled out going further, if elected. The rest of the interview are things we have already heard. The recommendations will be looked at, and \u201cacted\u201d on. Asic knows it needs to pick up its enforcement game and has acknowledged that already. Economy is strong, yadda, yadda, yadda. Is a snap election an option? No, says Josh Frydenberg. Straight off the bat \u2013 should the Coalition apologise for opposing the royal commission for so long? Look, we can debate for hours, Leigh, about what Labor failed to do when they were in [power]\u201d But what about the Coalition? When we first came into office we initiated David Murray\u2019s financial systems inquiry \u2013 a very significant inquiry that looked at the financial system and the recommendations of which we\u2019ve been implementing since. We\u2019ve adopted a number of important reforms that have been endorsed, not just by Commissioner Hayne today, but by previous reports including by the Productivity Commission into centre superannuation. But what about the government\u2019s opposition to the royal commission? Well, we did call the royal commission and today we\u2019ve responded to it. Yes, but you were dragged to it. And today we have said we\u2019re taking action on all 76 recommendations. These are recommendations that will have far-reaching consequences across the financial system, including putting in place the banking executive accountability regime, not just within banks which we initiated, but with an insurance and superannuation companies, ensuring trustees of superannuation funds actually face penalties for breaching of their duties. Putting in place a new disciplinary body that deals with financial advisers. There\u2019s a whole series of recommendations that Commissioner Hayne has handed down which we have adopted today. SIIIIGGGGHHHHHHH We are just waiting for the Treasurer to appear on 7.30. That should be happening very soon Wayne Swan is another who thinks the report could have gone further: The transcript from the Chris Bowen presser has landed \u2013 it was in Sydney, so I didn\u2019t get to hear all of it in the madness of that first couple of hours outside the report embargo lifting, but the main takeaways seem to be: The Labor party accepts in principle all the recommendations in Commissioner Hayne\u2019s report. We would have a Treasury taskforce to work with a Shorten Labor government on implementing the recommendations. We would consult broadly on implementation details with all affected parties; the financial sector, the victims groups and consumer groups. We would consult widely about implementing the report\u2019s recommendations but we accept in principle each and different recommendation in Commissioner Hayne\u2019s report. In fact we regard this report as being the minimum of action that should be taken to improve Australia\u2019s banking and financial services sector. On the recommendation the government has given a \u201cmaybe\u201d to (user pays in terms of mortgage broking): Well they haven\u2019t adopted the recommendation. I mean they\u2019ve got weasel words in there. We adopt the full recommendations in principle. We\u2019ll sit down with all affected parties and talk about the implementation details, timeline et cetera but we accept the recommendations. The government simply cannot say that they\u2019ve accepted the recommendations. They simply cannot. I mean they resisted this royal commission every step of the way and now we have the royal commission report and they\u2019ve got weasel words in there about various recommendations including that one. And on bipartisanship for legislation: Well clearly there is legislation \u2013 clearly some of this legislation could and should be implemented as a matter of urgency. If it\u2019s not we\u2019ll have to wait for an election and all the relevant post-election processes which are inevitable and would lead to delay. If the parliament was sitting more between now and May we might get more passed. Josh Frydenberg is the 7.30 guest this evening. Anyone want to take bets on how often \u201cLabor\u2019s failures\u201d gets trotted out? The Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive, Matt Comyn, has also released a statement: We are working through the royal commission\u2019s final report and the 76 recommendations. Commissioner Hayne has called out the clear need for change. The government has announced a comprehensive set of measures in response and we will work through the impact of these over the next few days. We note that the commissioner has concluded that a number of matters regarding the group\u2019s conduct, including in relation to superannuation, warrant further investigation by relevant regulators and we will cooperate fully with these investigations. We will update the market as appropriate, noting that we will release our half year results on Wednesday. The royal commission has been a thorough and valuable process for everyone \u2013 bank customers, financial services institutions, regulators and policy makers. It has highlighted failings both in our business and across the wider financial services industry. As challenging as the royal commission process has been, CBA will be a better bank as a result. We are addressing past failings, implementing important changes and improving our processes to ensure we remain focused on what is best for our customers. We are implementing stronger policies and processes, including a new code of conduct. There is still much work ahead to earn back trust, but we are determined to restore broad respect and support for the important role that a major financial institution like CBA has to play in our economy and community. Over the coming months, we will accelerate our work towards becoming a simpler, better bank. It is our No 1 priority. The Financial Services Union though, is not impressed: The FSC does have some other thoughts, which doesn\u2019t quite embrace all the recommendations though: There are number of recommendations and Government proposals which require further consideration and discussion with government and regulators. These include: \u2022 An industry funded Compensation Scheme of Last Resort (Rec 7.1) This will only work if the underlying licensing system is strengthened to ensure licensees meet their obligations. It is critical that priority be given to addressing these issues before setting up a compensation scheme of last resort; We support stronger professional indemnity and capital requirements for licensees. These should be in place before any further consideration of a compensation scheme of last resort. If this is not done it may even encourage inadequate products and services coming into the market that lead to poor consumer outcomes. \u2022 Extension of the Bear regime to all Apra regulated financial services institutions and extending it to non-prudentially regulated financial services firms (rec 6.6). While we agree with the Commission that there should be appropriate consultation, we would like to see how Beat works for ADIs in practice before we consider any extension to the existing regime. \u201cThe FSC will continue to consider the report in the coming days.\u201d The Financial Services Council is the latest to respond: \u201cFinancial services is Australia\u2019s largest industry sector, employing 450,000 people and managing almost $3 trillion of consumers\u2019 savings. \u201cIt must be free of misaligned incentives, mismanagement and poor governance, and focused solely on protecting the savings and growing the wealth of all Australians. Our financial services system must also be efficient and competitive. \u201cWith the release of the final report and the Government\u2019s response, we can now move even faster to repair the sector\u2019s damaged reputation and ensure that consumers are able to trust each and every one of the people, products and services in our sector. \u201cToday all of us have an opportunity to rebuild the trusted relationship and the ties between financial services and the community that were once a bedrock of Australian life. \u201cWe acknowledge it will take significant time and effort, and cultural change to effect thorough reform. \u201cNow we need to get on with the task of strengthening Australia\u2019s financial services industry for the future so that we never end up in this situation again.\u201d The FSC strongly endorses the following recommendations, including: \u2022 A person should be defaulted once into a superannuation account (rec 3.5) \u2022 Retention of the twin peaks regulatory model (rec 6.1) \u2022 Greater clarity around the co-regulation of superannuation by APRA and ASIC (rec 6.3) \u2022 Industry wide reference checking of financial advisers (recs 2.7); and \u2022 Regular reporting of serious compliance concerns to ASIC. \u2022 Entities having a stronger focus on culture and governance (recs 5.6, 5.7) And, finally, Apra acknowledges it too needs to do better in terms of enforcement: The royal commission also concluded that Apra needs to adopt a stronger stance in relation to its enforcement activities. As previously announced, Apra is reviewing its enforcement strategy with the assistance of an independent expert panel. This review has a wide scope that includes consideration of when to hold individuals to account (including under the BEAR), when it would be appropriate to take enforcement action to achieve general and specific deterrence in appropriate cases, and Apra\u2019s governance and other related arrangements in relation to enforcement decisions. The report will be completed at the end of March 2019 and published shortly thereafter. Mr Byres also said: \u201cAlthough the commission has assigned some important new responsibilities to Apra, our primary responsibility remains the safety and stability of the financial system, to protect the financial well-being of the Australian community. Apra is the only regulator with a primary focus on ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system. \u201cIt is therefore important to reiterate that Australia\u2019s financial system remains fundamentally sound. While there are areas where the financial sector clearly needs to make significant changes and improvements, the soundness and stability of the financial system has never been called into question by the royal commission.\u201d More from Apra: The commission highlighted, in particular, the central role that Apra\u2019s work on governance, culture and remuneration will play in underpinning better behavioural standards and stronger accountability in the financial system, and recommends Apra do more in this area. Apra has acknowledged the importance of this, and will continue to build expertise and capacity devoted to these issues. More broadly, the commission\u2019s full suite of recommendations provide a significant opportunity to substantially improve the financial system in Australia. Apra looks forward to working with the government, Treasury, Asic and other relevant parties on the many recommendations that will require legislative change and cross-agency coordination to implement. In particular, Apra is committed to ensuring the shared responsibilities between Apra and Asic work effectively and efficiently, for the benefit of the community. The commission made comments and observations on the conduct of a number of Apra regulated entities, including specific matters that have been referred for possible enforcement action. After the commission\u2019s interim report, Apra established a royal commission enforcement cases steering committee, which has been reviewing evidence as it has come to light and, where necessary, undertaking additional enquiries and investigations. Apra will consider whether this work needs to be broadened in light of the final report, and continue to liaise with Asic, and other relevant agencies, to address promptly the matters identified. Apra chairman Wayne Byres said: The commission\u2019s final report is a considered and fair assessment of failings in the financial system and a helpful roadmap for reform. The commission\u2019s recommendations are wide-ranging; within them, the commission has identified a number of areas where Apra\u2019s prudential and supervisory framework can and should be strengthened. Many of these improvements are already in train, and Apra is committed to delivering on them. Apra appreciates the commission\u2019s acknowledgment that increasing the intensity of supervision will require additional resources. Apra welcomes the government\u2019s recognition that the recommendations and referrals will require Apra to increase the breadth and depth of its supervision, and that Apra will need to be appropriately resourced to do so. In that regard, the upcoming capability review will be important to ensure Apra is well equipped and resourced into the future to both balance a number of priorities and address the full range of issues within its mandate. Apra has also responded: The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) acknowledges the release today of the final report of the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. The royal commission has identified significant failings in the manner in which the financial system treats consumers. The commission emphasised that \u2018there can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and those who managed and controlled those entities\u2019. However, the commission has also identified a range of areas where the regulation and supervision of financial institutions must be strengthened. Apra will review the recommendations in the Report in the coming days and issue a more detailed response to those recommendations relevant to Apra shortly. Overall, Apra is pleased that many of the recommendations made within the report, and supported by the government, are consistent with submissions Apra made to the commission. This includes: the preservation of the \u2018twin peaks\u2019 regulatory architecture, and Apra\u2019s current mandate; a broadening of the Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) to other industries; and a strengthening and realignment of regulatory powers by the Parliament to provide a greater role for Asic in superannuation. Asic has released its official response to the report: Asic today welcomed the final report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry and acknowledged its important work. ASIC will consider the report carefully, particularly its recommendations on regulatory and enforcement practices. These recommendations, and the government\u2019s response, will inform Asic\u2019s priorities and strategic direction moving forward. The Royal Commission report identified Asic\u2019s enforcement culture as the focus of change needed at Asic. This focus accords with Asic\u2019s change agenda, that has included the adoption of our \u2018why not litigate?\u2019 enforcement stance, the initiation of our Internal Enforcement Review and the enhancement of our governance structures. Asic notes the serious matters referred by the Royal Commission of possible breaches of financial services laws. Consideration of these matters will be prioritised. Asic does not, as a general policy, comment on actual or potential investigations. Asic looks forward to working with the Parliament, the Government, Apra and other regulators to implement the reform agenda to ensure a fair, strong and efficient financial system for all Australians. In coming weeks, Asic will release an update. This will outline the actions Asic has already under way and the further steps it will implement moving forward to continue to strengthen our governance, culture and practices, and realign our enforcement and regulatory priorities. Now that it\u2019s a little less insane, if you haven\u2019t found the whole report as yet, you can find it here The Business Council of Australia have also responded: \u201cCommissioner Hayne\u2019s common-sense but far reaching recommendations deal with the core issues of misconduct. Commissioner Hayne has done an excellent job and has recognised the many changes our financial services sector and regulators have already made ahead of this final report,\u201d Jennifer Westacott said in a statement. \u201cOur financial services sector is incredibly important to our way of life. Australians cannot be subjected to a system where they cannot access a loan to buy a new home or set-up or expand businesses that provide jobs. Millions of Australians also have their retirement savings invested in banks. \u201cWe look forward to working with political leaders and the community to ensure Australia\u2019s financial system is stronger and restoring trust in a sector which has helped to deliver a record 27 years of economic growth. \u201cIt is time to rule a line in the sand and start fixing the real problems and poor behaviour that have been identified by the royal commission. \u201cThe business community is ready to work to effectively develop and implement necessary changes in the direction recommended by Commissioner Hayne.\u201d But the BCA also wants to make sure that loans are not overly impacted: \u201cAs the government has done in its response, it is important to make sure any changes are carefully considered in order to ensure credit remains available to Australians and competition is strengthened to ensure consumers get the best deal. \u201cThis means changes should be staged with appropriate consultation and reviewed to make sure consumers are better off. \u201cWe welcome Commissioner Hayne\u2019s recommendation on business culture and governance and believe every business should take his advice to implement the proper steps to assess, identify and deal with any problems. \u201cEffective regulation and well-resourced regulators are critical to the financial sector and Commissioner Hayne identifies some important improvements, in particular simplifying existing laws, clarifying the responsibilities of Asic and Apra and strengthening their accountability. \u201cWe look forward to working closely with government and regulators to ensure that Australia\u2019s financial system emerges from the royal commission not just better regulated and recommitted to cultural change but that it remains a strong part of the Australian economy and serves the interests of every Australian.\u201d The National Australia Bank has become the first (that I have seen) of the banks to respond in a statement to the ASX: National Australia Bank notes the release today of the final report of the royal commission into the banking, superannuation and financial services industry and the federal government\u2019s response. NAB will now review the report, which contains 76 recommendations, and the government\u2019s response to fully understand the implications for the NAB Group. We will provide further updates as appropriate. Chris Bowen (shorter): This is the royal commission that Scott Morrison did not want you to see. This is the report that Scott Morrison never wanted delivered. Today is the day that Scott Morrison and his entire government should hang their head in shame that they voted 26 times to avoid this report ever seeing the light of day. This is a dark day for Australia\u2019s banks and financial institutions. Banks and financial institutions should work on an ethical basis. They should be strong. They should be profitable. They should be robust. They should be, above all, ethical. This is a sobering report. It\u2019s a report that is long overdue. The Labor party accepts, in principle, all the recommendations in Commissioner Hayne\u2019s report. As some of you have pointed out, there is not a lot of time for the government to legislate any changes before the next election. The first sitting fortnight begins next week. Then there are no sittings until early April, when the budget will be called, after which, Scott Morrison will call the election. And then, it is caretaker mode and well, nothing happens then. The ABC tracked down Shayne Elliott, the boss of ANZ \u2013 selling copies of the Big Issue on the streets of Melbourne. That\u2019s the magazine which aims to support those who are homeless, or disadvantaged. So there is Elliott, with his yellow vest and Big Issue hat on, telling the cameras he is just there to sell copies of the magazine. I\u2018m actually here selling he Big Issue. That\u2019s why I\u2019m out here today. We\u2019re going to try and sell a record. Last year, we sold 55 copies. I think we\u2019ll try for a bigger number today.\u201d He doesn\u2019t take any questions on the commission\u2019s final report. Further to those conflict of interests, it doesn\u2019t make sense to Kenneth Hayne that so much of the finance industry relies on commissions that are based on a pretty easily identified conflict - are you acting for the client \u2013 you and me and our financial needs, or the banking industry \u2013 ie, yourself and whether or not you get paid for delivering a client. That\u2019s been one of the major issues Hayne identified, that so much of the industry was based on people getting paid, or bonuses, to provide clients to a certain service, rather than serve the client. Rewarding misconduct is wrong. Yet incentive, bonus and commission schemes throughout the financial services industry have measured sales and profit, but not compliance with the law and proper standards. Incentives have been offered, and rewards have been paid, regardless of whether the sale was made, or profit derived, in accordance with law. Rewards have been paid regardless of whether the person rewarded should have done what they did. Second, entities and individuals acted in the ways they did because they could. Entities set the terms on which they would deal, consumers often had little detailed knowledge or understanding of the transaction and consumers had next to no power to negotiate the terms. At most, a consumer could choose from an array of products offered by an entity, or by that entity and others, and the consumer was often not able to make a well-informed choice between them. There was a marked imbalance of power and knowledge between those providing the product or service and those acquiring it. Third, consumers often dealt with a financial services entity through an intermediary. The client might assume that the person standing between the client and the entity that would provide a financial service or product acted for the client and in the client\u2019s interests. But, in many cases, the intermediary is paid by, and may act in the interests of, the provider of the service or product. Or, if the intermediary does not act for the provider, the intermediary may act only in the interests of the intermediary. That includes mortgage brokers, which the government has says it will look at: The Government agrees to address conflicted remuneration for mortgage brokers. The Government recognises the importance of competition in the home lending sector and will proceed carefully and in stages, consistent with the recommendation, with reforms to ensure that the changes do not adversely impact consumers\u2019 access to lenders and competition in the home lending market. The next biggest take away \u2013 Hayne thinks the industry needs a complete overhaul. No surprise there \u2013 the interim report pointed to that late last year. He has identified \u201csix norms of conduct\u201d The law must be applied and its application enforced Industry codes should be approved under statute and breach of key promises made to customers in the codes should be a breach of statute No financial product should be \u2018hawked\u2019 to retail clients Intermediaries should act only on behalf of, and in the interests of, the party who pays the intermediary Exceptions to the ban on conflicted renumeration should be eliminated Culture and government practices (including renumeration arrangements both in the industry generally and in individuals entities, must focus on non-financial risk, as well as financial risk He recommends an overhaul of corporate governance and culture as well: All financial services entities should, as often as reasonably possible, take proper steps to: assess the entity\u2019s culture and its governance; identify any problems with that culture and governance; deal with those problems; and determine whether the changes it has made have been effective. Tl;dr stop being so greedy and do your job. What now for Asic? The Australian Securities and Investment Commission gets a particularly strong knuckle rap, for its enforcement activities. Or, more accurately, its reluctance in using its enforcement powers. Hayne rules out transferring Asic\u2019s powers to the ACCC. But he doesn\u2019t rule out turning Asic into a purely investigative body if it doesn\u2019t get its act together. That would work in much the same way as the relationship between the police and the department of public prosecutions. Police gather a brief of evidence, and the DPP decides whether or not to prosecute. Hayne doesn\u2019t say that needs to happen for Asic, but he makes his \u201cyet\u201d very loud and clear, if Asic doesn\u2019t follow through in changing the culture around its enforcement activities. \u201cAlthough I do not now recommend the establishment of a specialist civil enforcement agency, Asic\u2019s progress in reforming its enforcement function should be closely monitored. If, over the coming years, it becomes apparent that Asic is not sufficiently enforcing the laws within its remit, or if the size of its remit comes at the expense of its litigation capability, further consideration should be given to developing a specialist agency of the type I have described.\u201d Hayne has written to Asic about entities he believes may have contravened section 1041G of the corporations act. He says Asic is still looking at the issues he has raised, and he doesn\u2019t name the entities he pointed to as examples. But he says: Section 1041G prohibits engaging in dishonest conduct in relation to a financial product or financial service. On its face, taking money for nothing is dishonest conduct. If the conduct in issue was a contravention of section 1041G, it is that section that best captures and conveys the criminality. There is no doubt that money was taken from clients. Nor is there any basis for doubting that, when taken, the taker did not intend to return it to the client. If there was no adviser linked to the client, the money taken was applied by the taker to its own use. If the client had died, and the taker had been told and had recorded that the client had died, there could be no ongoing service given and the taker\u2019s records showed that there could be none given. I consider that it is open to the jury to conclude, beyond reasonable doubt that in either of the cases described, the taker, in the course of its carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, engaged in conduct in relation to a financial service that was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people and that the conduct was known by the taker to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people. Hayne\u2019s recommendations are that Asic: takes, as its starting point, the question of whether a court should determine the consequences of a contravention; recognises that infringement notices should principally be used in respect of administrative failings by entities, will rarely be appropriate for provisions that require an evaluative judgment and, beyond purely administrative failings, will rarely be an appropriate enforcement tool where the infringing party is a large corporation; recognises the relevance and importance of general and specific deterrence in deciding whether to accept an enforceable undertaking and the utility in obtaining admissions in enforceable undertakings; and separates, as much as possible, enforcement staff from non-enforcement related contact with regulated entities. So it is a yes to the 76 recommendations, or at least 75.5 \u2013 there is a maybe over the user pays recommendation for mortgage brokers For those who haven\u2019t seen it, Katharine Murphy has filed her first take analysis of the report: Yes, the Morrison government has said meekly, to everything the banking royal commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, has recommended. In political terms, it\u2019s blindingly obvious why. A federal election is in sight. The Coalition is vulnerable on this issue, having spent years obstructing a deeply necessary inquiry that unearthed a trove of malfeasance \u2013 case studies that still beggar belief. Scott Morrison at one point opined rashly that calls for a royal commission into the banking sector (after a string of scandals that, in the end, proved the tip of the iceberg) were a \u201cpopulist whinge\u201d. Clare O\u2019Neil, Chris Bowen and Bill Shorten have also issued Labor\u2019s official joint statement: The final report of the banking royal commission uncovers unconscionable, corrupt and potentially criminal behaviour in the banking and financial services sector. This is a dark day for Australian banking, and a terrible indictment on the greed in the industry. We pay tribute to the victims of banking misconduct, the whistleblowers and the advocates for making this day happen. We acknowledge it has been a long journey for individuals, families, small businesses and farmers. The Royal Commission would not have happened without you. We will have a better, stronger and fairer banking system for all Australians because of you. The final report is a comprehensive blueprint to clean up the industry, restore Australians\u2019 trust in their banks, and put the interests of consumers first. The Royal Commission\u2019s report shows that on too many occasions, the pursuit of profit was put ahead of people, ethics and the law. Scott Morrison and the Liberals should be condemned for voting against the Banking Royal Commission 26 times. Mr Morrison called the Royal Commission \u201cregrettable\u201d, a \u201cpopulist whinge\u201d, delayed action for more than 600 days, and wants to give the big banks a $17 billion handout. The Liberals have shown they cannot be trusted to clean up the banks. They are too out of touch and only stand up for the top end of town. Unlike the government, the opposition accepts in-principle all of the recommendations in the report. We will now give full and proper consideration to all the findings and recommendations through our usual processes. On our initial reading of the government\u2019s response, we are concerned that on too many issues, the government does not accept the royal commission\u2019s recommendation, does not propose adequate action, or delays action. There are several recommendations that require legislation to improve our banking system and ensure Australians aren\u2019t ripped off, but Scott Morrison\u2019s part-time parliament makes it very difficult to take immediate action to clean up the banks. The Liberals tried to stop this royal commission from happening. They cannot be allowed to go soft on the banks, or go slow on implementing the reforms. As Commissioner Hayne says in his final report: The financial services industry is too important to the economy of the nation to allow what has happened in the past to continue or to happen again. As well as giving in-principle support to the recommendations of the royal commission, a Shorten Labor government will: Crack down on corporate crime by increasing jail terms and financial penalties; Protect and reward whistleblowers through a Whistleblower Protection Authority and a Whistleblower Rewards Scheme; and Fund a dedicated special prosecutor to bring corporate criminals to justice. Labor offers its sincere thanks to Commissioner Hayne and his dedicated team for their extraordinary efforts over the last 12 months. John Williams, the Nationals senator who was instrumental in getting the government to change its mind on a banking royal commission, tells Sky he is surprised there is no criminal charges. As yet. \u201cI think Asic has no excuse for not doing their job better,\u201d Wacka says. \u201cI am a bit surprised they weren\u2019t called out [more].\u201d Just to recap: No charges have been recommended but the commission has recommended the regulator look at at least 24 cases through the prism of legislation, including criminal legislation, particularly around fees for no service. Which isn\u2019t to say criminal charges aren\u2019t coming, they just aren\u2019t coming yet. Apra and Asic remain intact \u2013 for now. The government says it is taking \u201caction\u201d on the 76 recommendations \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean that everything Kenneth Hayne says is necessary will occur. And we don\u2019t know yet how far the government will go, what the timing is, or whether it will agree with all of the points. The treasurer and prime minister have issued their official joint statement: Today, the government releases its response to the landmark Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The government has agreed to take action on all 76 recommendations contained in the royal commission\u2019s Final Report and, in a number of important areas, is going further. Commissioner Hayne\u2019s recommendations and the Government\u2019s response advance the interests of consumers in four key ways: \u00b7 Strengthen and expand protections for consumers, small business, rural and remote communities. \u00b7 Raise accountability and governance standards. \u00b7 Enhance the effectiveness of regulators. \u00b7 Provide for remediation for those harmed by misconduct. In outlining its response to the royal commission, the government\u2019s principal focus is on restoring trust in our financial system and delivering better consumer outcomes, while maintaining the flow of credit and continuing to promote competition. Today, the government is announcing it is taking further action by: \u00b7 Establishing for the first time a compensation scheme of last resort and expanding the remit of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) so that they can award compensation for successful claims going back 10 years, consistent with the period examined by the Royal Commission. \u00b7 Compensating those individuals who had a prior unpaid determination in their favour by the predecessor bodies of Afca, which will see almost 300 consumers finally receive compensation totalling around $30 million as a consequence of prior misconduct. \u00b7 Extending the jurisdiction of the federal court to cover corporate criminal misconduct, which will expedite cases that are considered by state courts and commonly take over two years to be heard. \u00b7 Commencing a capability review of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra) to be led by Graeme Samuel AC and conducting further capability reviews every four years. The government is confident that the actions announced today will put in place the necessary legislative framework, providing regulators with the power and resources to hold those who abuse our trust to account. The Coalition government, through both its actions to date and its response today, is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring a financial system that is working for all Australians and is one they can trust. The government would like to thank Commissioner Hayne for the outstanding manner in which he has conducted the royal commission and express its gratitude for the tireless work of those involved. We also wish to acknowledge all of those individuals who provided submissions and came forward to give evidence. While Anna Bligh works through the \u201cbanks are really sorry\u201d statement, let\u2019s head back to what Kenneth Hayne had to say about the evidence he heard from the banking executives. As would be expected, each of these witnesses gave evidence suggesting that their respective entities or agencies had its own distinctive understanding of, and response to, the events considered in and issues raised by the commission. Most professed to having learned from what had happened and proffered their ideas about causes and responses. But the nature and extent of their engagement with the issues differed rather more markedly than I had expected. It seemed to me that there remain elements of unwillingness to recognise, and to accept responsibility for, poor conduct of the kinds examined in this inquiry. Unwillingness to recognise and to accept responsibility for misconduct explains the prolonged and repeated failures by large entities to make breach reports required by the law. That same unwillingness explains the prolonged negotiation with the regulator about what should be done in response to misconduct, whether by compensating affected customers or altering defective practices and processes.\u201d He was particularly unimpressed with the National Australia Bank: NAB also stands apart from the other three major banks. Having heard from both the CEO, Mr [Andrew] Thorburn, and the chair, Dr [Ken] Henry, I am not as confident as I would wish to be that the lessons of the past have been learned. More particularly, I was not persuaded that NAB is willing to accept the necessary responsibility for deciding, for itself, what is the right thing to do, and then having its staff act accordingly. I thought it telling that Dr Henry seemed unwilling to accept any criticism of how the board had dealt with some issues. I thought it telling that Mr Thorburn treated all issues of fees for no service as nothing more than carelessness combined with system deficiencies when the total amount to be repaid by NAB and NULIS on this account is likely to be more than $100 million. I thought it telling that in the very week that NAB\u2019s CEO and chair were to give evidence before the commission, one of its staff should be emailing bankers urging them to sell at least five mortgages each before Christmas. Overall, my fear \u2013 that there may be a wide gap between the public face NAB seeks to show and what it does in practice \u2013 remains. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Former Queensland premier Anna Bligh, who is head of the Australian Banking Association says the banks have accepted the recommendations. This royal commission has put the entire banking sector under the microscope. Its final report lays bare how banks have too often failed their customers and let down the Australian people. Banks understand that these failures have caused deep hurt, suffering and heartache for far too many customers and they\u2019re sorry for the pain they have caused. Importantly, banks accept full responsibilities for these failings and they know that they must now change to ensure that this never happens again. Banks are determined to learn the lessons, to fix the problems, and to make it right. Australians expect better from their banks and, more than that, they deserve better. Today\u2019s report contains some very tough medicine for banks, including potential court cases. With 76 recommendations, it represents a huge overhaul and top-to-bottom reform of banking and finance in this country. It will make changes to what financial services and products can be offered, how staff are paid, what sort of penalties there\u2019ll be for wrongdoing. There\u2019ll be new offences for a range of activities and, importantly, new rights for customers. The industry is determined to get on with the job of fixing the problem. To that end, it has already formed a special taskforce to begin the work that will be needed to get this job done. The industry sees this report as a roadmap. It is a roadmap to drive the change that is needed to earn back the trust of the Australian people. Today is an opportunity for banks to reset their relationship with their customers and with the Australian people, and banks are determined not to miss that opportunity. I can understand in the circumstances that many people may be cynical about whether banks will change. To those people, I would say, Don\u2019t judge banks by their words. Judge them by their actions in the coming weeks, the coming months, as they implement this report.\u201d Shadow treasurer Christopher Bowen says a Labor government would adopt all of the recommendations. All of them. He is making that point, because there is one recommendation in particular, 1.3 - that the borrower not the lender should pay the mortgage the fee. The government is saying, in a nutshell \u2018we have to be careful because of competition\u2019, so they are taking a look, around it, but haven\u2019t put in any timing. Bowen says Labor would implement what Hayne wants, which is that it is implemented fairly quickly. The Consumer Action Law Centre, which has represented vulnerable banking victims, said it is disappointed the royal commission didn\u2019t do more to clamp down on irresponsible lending. Chief executive Gerard Brody said no real improvements were suggested to consumer remedies for irresponsible lending. \u201cThere has been very poor compliance with responsible lending laws, and a failure of lenders to assess an applicant\u2019s financial position to ensure repayments don\u2019t cause hardship,\u201d Brody said. \u201cInstead, many lenders use automated processes and rely on benchmarks of household expenditure, which may not accord with reality. \u201cIf there were better remedies for consumers subject to irresponsible lending\u2013 including debt waiver \u2013 this would provide an important compliance incentive.\u201d Brody otherwise welcomes the government\u2019s pledge to act on Hayne\u2019s 76 recommendations. \u201cExtending these important new laws to credit and other financial products means there will be no loopholes \u2013 Asic will now have the power to act where financial products are designed to harm consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are too many exemptions and loopholes in our consumer protection laws \u2013 the harm uncovered over the last year by the royal commission vividly demonstrates why law reform is required.\u201d Asked again about putting off the royal commission for so long, Frydenberg says: Like I said, when Labor was last in office, they did nothing when they had major financial collapses on their watch. Asked again, and well, you get the idea: We can debate for hours Labor\u2019s failures when they were last in opposition. It has been the coalition, it has been the coalition that has commissioned the royal commission and the coalition today is announcing the recommendations. Does Josh Frydenberg believe the government should have opposed the royal commission, 26 times, and for almost a year and a half, given what has come from it? Well, we could debate for hours the failures when Labor was last in office, not forgetting that ... and I recall Bill Shorten saying how fantastic the sector was when he was the minister for the sector. But he didn\u2019t call a royal commission or take action to bring these big banks to account. He didn\u2019t put in place new standards which we have announced today, and have been doing since the financial systems inquiry was initiated by this government when we first came into power in 2013. I\u2019m focused on the future, and the future is now going to be brighter for 25 million Australians when they\u2019re dealing with their financial institutions. Because the set of recommendations from Commissioner Hayne will ensure a higher standard of conduct, will ensure better outcomes in superannuation, insurance, in financial advice and in banking. I think the regulators have also got the message and that termedity we may have seen in the past will be replaced with a front foot approach. Choice also wants the superannuation recommends implemented pretty quickly, in particular: The end to duplicate superannuation accounts, which have taken $50,000 from the retirement savings of the average person (Rec 3.5) A civil penalty regime for funds that breach their best interest duty to members (Rec 3.7) Making it easier for consumers to understand the default life insurance that is provided in MySuper funds, through legislating definitions and terms that apply to all products life insurance products (Rec 4.13) But it also doesn\u2019t see it as the end on super issues. Xavier O\u2019Halloran says: \u201cThe Royal Commission report is not the final word on superannuation. With only one round of hearings, the Royal Commission could look at very few aspects of the system. The Productivity Commission\u2019s three-year review went much deeper and wider. If we are going to address the biggest problem in superannuation, that of poor fund performance, we need to improve the default system as a whole.\u201d Consumer group Choice has weighed in with its response to the report. From its statement: \u201cCommissioner Hayne makes it clear: the laws that govern the banking system have not been up to the job,\u201d says Choice chief executive Alan Kirkland. \u201cSimple community expectations \u2013 that financial institutions should act honestly and in their customers best interests \u2013 have been undermined by decades of industry lobbying, resulting in laws that are riddled with carveouts and exceptions. This has to end. \u201cThis represents a key turning point for the industry and its lobby groups: will they pretend to accept the recommendations then lobby to undermine them behind closed doors, as they have with every other major reform? Or will they realise that if they want to win back community trust, this time they need to act with integrity? \u201cThe report is also a damning indictment of industry self-regulation. For too long, we have allowed banks to write and enforce their own rules. This means that the rules are weak and the consequences for breaking them are non-existent.\u201d Choice wants put in place: The end to weak self-regulation through industry codes that can be breached with no consequences (Rec 4.9) A ban on hawking financial products to unsuspecting consumers\u2014especially insurance and superannuation (Recs 3.4 &amp; 4.1) A ban on the payment of commissions to mortgage brokers and financial advisers\u2014so it is clear that they act for the person seeking advice, and nobody else (Rec 1.3) An obligation that mortgage brokers act in the best interests of the person seeking a loan (Rec 1.2) An end to hidden fees for financial advice (Recs 2.1 &amp; 2.4) A compensation scheme, funded by industry, to make sure that when consumers are found to deserve compensation it is paid (Rec 7.1) Back to the report. A lot of Kenneth Hayne\u2019s report, and where, reading between the lines, a lot of the cases he has referred for another look \u2013 code to the regulator to look at cases with potential prosecution in mind \u2013 involve the fees for no service scandal. That is where financial services charged clients on-going fees for services they did not receive, or in some cases, were charged after they had died. The report points out, that between them, AMP, ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac \u201cwill pay customers of their advice licensees or their superannuation funds compensation totalling $850 million or more, for taking money as payment for services that were not provided\u201d. In his report, Hayne takes particular umbrage at the claims the fees for no service just kinda happened, that the money just sort of \u2018fell into the pocket\u2019 of the banks, because of poor IT infrastructure and legacy system issues. \u201cThe amounts of money that just \u2018fell into the pocket\u2019 of so many large and sophisticated financial entities, the number of times it happened, and the many years over which it happened, show that it cannot be swept aside as no more than bumbling incompetence or product of poor computer systems,\u201d Hayne says. Hayne points out that most of Asic\u2019s work on this has been focussed on remediation, rather than enforcement, before the royal commission was established. \u201c\u2026Asic and the relevant entities approached the fees for no service conduct, as if it called, at most, for the entity to repay what it had taken, together with some some compensation for the client not having had the use of the money. That is, the conduct was treated as if it was no more than a series of inadvertent slips brought about by some want of care in record keeping. \u201cIt is necessary to keep steadily in mind that entities took money (a lot of money) from their customers for nothing. The conduct was so widespread that seeing it as no more than careless must be challenged.\u201d Hayne names section 1041G of the Corporations act and Section 1311(1) of that same act in his response, which covers \u201cthe licensee, in the course of carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, engaged in dishonest conduct in relation to a financial product or financial service\u201d. Asic, to date, Hayne says, \u201cappears not to have considered the application of the criminal law in connection to fees for no service until a witness giving evidence to the Commission was asked whether she had thought that taking money to which there was no entitlement raised a question of the criminal law.\u201d And he reaches the final point \u2013 compensation: For the first time, the government is establishing a compensation scheme of last resort. We will expand the remit of the Australian financial complaints authority, known as Afca, so they can award compensation for successful claims going back a decade. And this is consistent with the period examined by the royal commission. Afca, which today can make binding determinations on industry, of up to $500,000 for individuals, $1m for small businesses and $2m for agribusinesses, will now administer this compensation scheme of last resort. Let me be clear \u2013 personal responsibility for financial decisions rests with those who make them. However, consumers and small businesses who suffer harm as a result of misconduct will now have access to redress. The government will also compensate those individuals who had a prior unpaid determination in their favour by the predecessor bodies of Afca. These people were never paid. Because the institutions responsible were unable to pay. This will see almost 300 consumers finally receive compensation totalling around $30m as a consequence of prior misconduct. Compensating this cohort of people was supported by the Ramsey review and also endorsed by commissioner Hayne. Implementation of the government\u2019s response will be led by a treasury financial services implementation taskforce. Frydenberg moves on to the regulators, which commissioner Hayne found, in the treasurer\u2019s words \u201cwanting\u201d: But he has also recognised that they are taking action to change. The government has recently appointed a new chair and two deputy chairs of Asic. And we have committed $170m in additional funding for our regulators and our agencies, equipping them for the task ahead. We will work with our regulators to ensure that they are appropriately resourced to meet all the challenges that they face. The government accepts Commissioner Hayne\u2019s recommendation to establish a new 3-person oversight body for Asic and Apra, that will monitor their performance and effectiveness and report to government. Capability reviews of our regulators are also be conducted every four years, with the government announcing today that Graham Samuel will lead a capability review of Apra and this will commence shortly. With respect to superannuation, the regulatory roles and powers of Asic and Apra will be clarified with respect to Asic becoming the primary conduct regulator. The government today is also announcing that we will extend the jurisdiction of the federal court to cover corporate criminal misconduct. This will expedite cases that are currently heard before state courts and commonly take over two years to be heard. The treasurer continues: Second, enhancing accountability. Consumers rightly expect that they be treated fairly and, when they\u2019re not, that the culprits are held to account. This is why from the first of July last year the government put in place the bank executive accountability regime, otherwise known as Bear. It holds executives personally responsible for conduct that occurs on their watch. And this includes sanctions, such as changes to remuneration, or even disqualification. Commissioner Hayne has recommended that Bear be extended to insurance and superannuation, and that Asic should have joint responsibility with Apra for the oversight of the Bear. With respect to superannuation, Commissioner Hayne also recommends that both trustees and directors be subject to civil penalties for breaches of their duties. The government currently has legislation before the parliament extending for the first time these penalties to directors, and we\u2019ll now amend the legislation to include trustees. A new system of discipline for financial advisors will also be put in place. With stronger industry reference checking, greater reporting of serious compliance concerns, and a new single disciplinary body, with which all advisors must be registered. In his speech, Josh Frydenberg describes it as: The government is taking action on all 76 of Commissioner Hayne\u2019s recommendations. First, in terms of enhancing consumer protections, we\u2019re doing the following - with regards to mortgage brokers, we are putting in place a best interest duty, banning trailing commissions and volume based bonuses on new loans from the first of July 2020. In terms of moving to a borrower pays remuneration structure, there will be a review in three years of the implications of doing so, bearing in mind that the Productivity Commission, the Murray and the Sedgwick reviews all raised concerns about the effects on competition of a change to a borrower pays model. We are ending the grandfathering of conflicted remuneration for financial advisors, effective from the first of January2021. In terms of superannuation, we will ensure fund members only have one account. For new members entering the system, a recommendation that mirrors the Productivity Commission\u2019s report into superannuation. We are prohibiting the deduction of advice fees from MySuper accounts. Hawking for superannuation and insurance will be prohibited. Preventing some of the most disturbing stories the royal commission heard of vulnerable people being sold on an unsolicited basis policies that they didn\u2019t need. Changes will also be made to the sale of add-on insurance, so that their sale is separated by a period of time from the sale of the original product. For example, today people are being sold a mobile phone and at the same time are being sold basic screen cover insurance which can cost more than the actual replacement of the screen itself. There will also be major changes to how the banks deal with distressed agricultural loans. This will include a new national farm debt mediation scheme. A requirement that banks do not charge default interest on agricultural loans where a drought or national disaster has been declared. The valuation of agricultural land will need to be independently determined from the lending processes. Banks will be required to ensure distressed farm loans are managed by people experienced in agriculture. And receivers are only to be appointed as a remedy of last resort. We\u2019ll bring you a bit more detail in just a moment, but the overview is: requiring mortgage brokers to act in the best interests of borrowers; removing conflicts of interest between brokers and consumers by banning trail commissions and other inappropriate forms of lender-paid commissions on new loans from 1 July 2020 with a further review in three years on the implications of removing upfront commissions and moving to a borrower pays remuneration structure; ending the grandfathering of the conflicted remuneration provisions effective from 1 January 2021 and, in addition to the Royal Commission\u2019s recommendation, requiring that any grandfathered conflicted remuneration at this date be rebated to clients; ensuring superannuation fund members only have one default account (for new members entering the system); protecting vulnerable consumers through clarifying and strengthening the unsolicited selling (antihawking) provisions, including for superannuation and insurance products; prohibiting the deduction of any advice fees (other than intrafund advice) from MySuper accounts; supporting the expansion of the definition of small business in the Banking Code; establishing a comprehensive national scheme for farm debt mediation; supporting the elimination of default interest on loans in areas impacted by natural disasters; supporting the appointment of receivers or any other form of external administrator only as a remedy of last resort; and supporting more inclusive practices for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. The royal commission has also put industry on notice that it must step up and improve how it deals with distressed agricultural loans. The treasurer is still talking, but let\u2019s take a look at what else was in the report: Basically, it all boils down to greed. As Hayne says: \u201cThe conduct in issue was driven not only by the relevant entity\u2019s pursuit of profit, but also by individuals\u2019 pursuit of gain, whether in the form of remuneration for the individual or profit for the individual\u2019s business. Providing a service to customers was relegated to second place. Sales became all important. Those who dealt with customers became sellers. And the confusion extended well beyond the frontline service staff. Advisers became sellers and sellers became advisers.\u201d Not only that, but Hayne found those who broke the law were not held to account. \u201cMisconduct will be deterred only if entities believe that misconduct will be detected, denounced and justly punished. Misconduct, especially misconduct that yields profit, is not deterred by requiring those who are found to have done wrong to do no more than pay compensation. And wrongdoing is not denounced by issuing a media release. The Australian community expects, and is entitled to expect, that if an entity breaks the law and causes damage to customers, it will compensate those affected customers. But the community also expects that financial entities that break the law be held to account.\u201d As an overview, on page 157 of the first volume of the report, Hayne says: It would be for prosecuting authorities to determine how charges would be framed. One way may be to fix upon one or more events of \u2018taking\u2019 by the entity. But however the charges are framed, it may be expected that the prosecution would seek to lead evidence that the particular takings charged were made as part of an established system and were not matters of accident. If the taking of fees was objectively dishonest, the question becomes as I have indicated: on what basis on the evidence would it be argued that a jury should entertain a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that it was acting dishonestly by taking payment for a service that it did not provide? Josh Frydenberg is making a statement: Today the government is releasing the final report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. It\u2019s a scathing assessment of conduct driven by greed and behaviour that was in breach of existing law and fell well below community expectations. The price paid by our community for this misconduct is immense. And goes beyond just the financial. There have been broken businesses, and the emotional stress and personal pain has broken lives. In disbelief, the nation has heard evidence prepared, presented before the commission of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for no service, companies misleading and obstructing regulators, the charging of dead people, the sale knowingly of worthless insurance policies, and who could forget the appalling audio recording of a young man with downs syndrome subject to high pressure sales tactics resulting in the purchase of a financial product that he clearly did not want, need, or understand. This is why the community\u2019s trust in our financial institutions has been lost and this is why it must be restored. From today, the banking sector must change and change forever. In Commissioner Hayne\u2019s own words, \u201cThere can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and their boards and their senior management.\u201d The undeniable fact, Commissioner Hayne said, \u201cis it is those that are engaged in misconduct that are responsible for what they did and the consequences that followed\u201d. This has resulted in the commissioner making more than 20 referrals to Asic and Apra, covering a range of misconduct from fees for no service, to best interest duty breaches and misleading and deceptive conduct. My message to the financial sector today is that this misconduct must end. And you must put the interests of consumers first. Consumers must be treated fairly.\u201d Sorry \u2013 we had some technical problems. We are back. The report, is, in a word, scathing. SCATHING. Of the industry, of the regulators, of the environment in which it was allowed to flourish. And it is not over yet. I know you will have been sweating on this all day. So here is the very quick version of what is in those thousands of pages. Bankers are not named and shamed, but Kenneth Hayne lays out the potential for more than 20 prosecutions involving the major banks, at the discretion of the regulators, some which could be criminal, some civil, and some both. Of the 24 referrals for \u201cfurther action\u201d, all the major banks are listed, except Westpac. The regulators stay as they are, but are on notice to do better when it comes to enforcement. If Asic doesn\u2019t pick up its game and prosecute more often, not just settle out of plain sight, there is room to make it just an investigative body and hand prosecuting powers to something else. The report points the way to an end to practices like conflicted renumeration \u2013 you can\u2019t advise for a client and get rewarded by a bank/financial service for providing that client at the same time, for instance. That seems like a pretty big no brainer, but it has taken a royal commission to get here. There will be a compensation scheme of last resort, funded by the banks. The government is working up legislation on that now. All the banks will have to pay, because it is part of their licence. For those who belonged to entities that have gone belly up, you\u2019ll also be covered. That is the super short version of the 76 recommendations. I know you want to know who will be prosecuted. We can\u2019t say who, because we don\u2019t know. We can just take from the case studies which were presented, where Hayne has outlined cases from what he heard during the commission: We didn\u2019t have access to the relevant laws in the lock-up and, honestly, it would take a lawyer to look at the acts and determine which were civil and which were criminal. But Hayne has recommended the regulators look over at least 24 cases, including: Five involving the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Three involving Colonial First State Three involving Allianz Two involving ANZ Two involving National Australia Bank For potential further action. The commissioner has recommended Asic look at least 10 case studies, and Apra, at least 12. There is a lot more to go through, but that is the helicopter view of the three volumes and thousands of pages. But it\u2019s not over yet \u2013 we are about to smack you in the face with three hours of intense study. Kenneth Hayne\u2019s report has laid the blame for the misconduct directly at the feet of senior banking executives. This is a key quote: There can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and those who managed and controlled those entities: their boards and senior management. Nothing that is said in this report should be understood as diminishing that responsibility. Hayne also used the report to slam Australia\u2019s financial regulators as \u201cineffective\u201d, proposing what he described as a \u201cradical\u201d shake-up of Asic and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra). Our reporter in Canberra Christopher Knaus has just filed these pars on the report: Many of Australia\u2019s biggest banks could face criminal prosecution over the shocking fee-for-no-service scandal as part of a sweeping response to the royal commission\u2019s damning final report. The much-anticipated report of commissioner Kenneth Hayne will precipitate widespread changes in the financial sector, designed to beef up regulators, compensate victims, overhaul banking remuneration, end the unlawful and excessive charging of fees, encourage cultural reform, and better protect vulnerable and disadvantaged customers. The government has immediately agreed to act on all 76 of Hayne\u2019s recommendations, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, conceded that \u201cfrom today the sector must change, and change forever\u201d. He promised to set up an industry-funded compensation scheme of last resort to help victims of banking misconduct. Just in case you haven\u2019t watched this video today, here\u2019s another moment to see Josh Frydenberg\u2019s excruciating photo op with Kenneth Hayne on Friday. Ouch. We\u2019re waiting for trading on the ASX to be wound up for the day before releasing the details of the commission\u2019s report. This is to make sure that Hayne\u2019s findings do not have an instant and potentially explosive impact on the shares of our leading banks. We should be ready to go in about five minutes. The first opportunity for trading will now be at 10am tomorrow. Bank shares have risen today, indicating that investors think that the worst is over for the big four banks and the market has already factored in the bad news into the price. We are a few minutes out from being let out of this room and going live with the findings. Reactions will come through thick and fast and we\u2019ll bring you all of those as they come. The government has had this report since Friday \u2013 you may remember the awkward photo opportunity between Josh Frydenberg and Kenneth Hayne \u2013 so we would expect to have seen some of the government\u2019s immediate response as part of this report. The banks have tried to get in early with their own mea culpa. From Katharine Murphy\u2019s report: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know the recommendations in the report, we do know this is an opportunity to reset the industry and to make things better for our customers,\u201d Anna Bligh said. I don\u2019t think that is going to cut it. Part of the issue for the government is they stood against the royal commission for so long. As Labor points out often, and accurately, Scott Morrison voted against the commission 26 times. When the government, under the then leader, Malcolm Turnbull, finally announced a commission, following internal pressure from Nationals MPs, including John Williams, Morrison described it as \u201cregrettable but necessary\u201d. The nature of political events means the national economic interest is now served by taking what I describe as a regrettable but necessary action. Politics is doing damage to our banking and financial system, and we are taking control as a government to protect the strength of our banking system through a properly constituted inquiry on these terms of reference. Rather than the alternatives as presented in other\u2019s commissions of inquiry proposals that would be subject to the vagaries of politics, which would do harm and already has to date. Given what we already know from the inquiry, that reluctance to hold it, it is going to hurt. Good afternoon and welcome to this special edition of politics live on the release of the final banking royal commission report. The doors of the Canberra lock-up open at 4pm, so we will be able to bring you all the findings very soon. It has been a long, long road to this point. Commissioner Kenneth Hayne does not have the power to award compensation or charge anyone but he can make recommendations for both. That is what everyone in the banking industry \u2013 and the government \u2013 is bracing for. Will there be charges recommended? Does the commissioner believe compensation is necessary? We already know some of Hayne\u2019s thoughts \u2013 they were made clear in the interim report he released late last year. That report included this: \u201cThe banks have gone to the edge of what is permitted, and too often beyond that limit, in pursuit of profit. And they have gone beyond the limit because they can and because they profit from the misconduct this is described in this report.\u201d In short, greed led to misconduct. Since that report was released, the regulators and government policy has been reviewed by the commission. Neither came off well. We\u2019ll bring you all the details as soon as the embargo lifts. You have Katharine Murphy, Chris Knaus and I in the lock-up, with analysis coming from Greg Jericho very soon. Strap in \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a long and bumpy afternoon.",

      "body": "<p>Your boss ominously requests an urgent meeting, your taxi is inching towards the airport with minutes to spare before your flight, or your football team have been granted a potentially game-winning penalty in the 91st minute. Your heart pounds, your stomach lurches, your hands turn clammy: the effects of stress are visceral and instantaneous.</p> <p>When faced with a perceived threat, the body\u2019s fight or flight system triggers in a well-choreographed sequence that has evolved over millions of years. \u201cWe\u2019re here because our ancestors were so brave and could survive through times of terrible stress and threat,\u201d says Carmen Sandi, who leads a behavioural genetics laboratory in Switzerland. \u201cThe problem nowadays is that we\u2019re activating this ancient survival response in a job interview.\u201d</p> <p>In the modern world, where life-threatening situations are encountered rarely, stress itself has become the spectre. Last year, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/three-in-four-britons-felt-overwhelmed-by-stress-survey-reveals\" title=\"\">largest survey on the impact of stress</a>, three in four Britons reported being so stressed that they had felt overwhelmed or unable to cope at least once over the last year. Studies across populations have linked extreme and chronic stress with <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/stress-heart-disease-risk\" title=\"\">heart disease</a>, diabetes and mental health problems including <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/stress-depression#1\" title=\"\">depression</a>. What is it doing to our bodies?</p> <h2>Adrenaline rush</h2> <p>The moment we perceive a threat, the brain\u2019s alarm system, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/18/neuroscientist-hannah-critchlow-cambridge-consciousness-funny-word\" title=\"\">region called the hypothalamus</a>, issues a series of commands designed to prepare us for fight or flight. Among the first to receive the alarm signal are the adrenal glands, which sit like little hats on top of the kidneys. Within seconds, they begin to pump out adrenaline, causing our heart and breathing to speed up and triggering the release of huge amounts of glucose from our liver.</p> <p>Blood is shunted away from the digestive system towards our arms and legs and the muscles around our small intestine contract, creating the feeling of a knot or fluttering in our stomach. For reasons that are not entirely understood \u2013 possibly the body\u2019s way of trying to remove any harmful toxins \u2013 adrenaline loosens the bowel muscles, meaning that acute stress can leave us racing for the bathroom. Another unwelcome side-effect is sweat, which is more sudden and smells worse than the kind produced during exercise or in hot weather. While exercise sweat comes from the eccrine glands and contains mostly water, adrenaline activates the apocrine glands in the armpits, which release a milky-looking substance containing fats and proteins, fuelling bacteria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Another unwelcome side-effect is sweat, which is more sudden and smells worse than the kind produced during exercise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adrenaline also prompts a massive mobilisation of immune cells, which travel from the spleen and bone marrow where they are stored, into the bloodstream. \u201cThere\u2019s an evolutionary theory that in the past social stress was often a predictor of trauma or violence,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/revolution-in-our-understaning-of-depression-will-be-life-transforming\" title=\"\">Ed Bullmore</a>, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, who is exploring the link between stress and the immune system. \u201cWhen I\u2019m standing up doing a public presentation, my [subconscious] looks at all these people staring at me and says \u2018Maybe they\u2019re going to attack\u2019 \u2013 so my immune system ramps up in advance.\u201d</p> <p>While adrenaline floods the body within seconds, a second stress hormone, called cortisol, seeps into the bloodstream more gradually, peaking after 20-30 minutes. Cortisol changes the metabolism of cells, how cells function and alters the activity of DNA. In the brain, cortisol binds to neurons, altering normal thought processes including the way stressful events are recorded in our memories. Neuroscientists think the influence of cortisol could explain why our memories of traumatic or highly emotional events are often exceptionally vivid.</p> <h2>Is stress always bad?</h2> <p>Research suggests that some stress exposure is crucial for developing the resilience that allows us to cope with unexpected and challenging situations in the future. A <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00010/full\" title=\"\">2013 review</a> entitled \u201cUnderstanding resilience\u201d draws parallels with the way exposure to germs boosts the immune system, concluding: \u201cStress inoculation is a form of immunity against later stressors, much in the same way that vaccines induce immunity against disease.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian Wells, a professor of clinical and experimental psychopathology at the University of Manchester, agrees. He is concerned that the negative effects of stress are sometimes exaggerated and that an \u201cepidemic of stress phobia\u201d is turning situations that ought to be challenging or even exhilarating into something altogether more traumatic.</p> <p>\u201cThe pursuit of a stress-free life is not healthy,\u201d says Wells. \u201cStress is like exercise. It\u2019s pretty uncomfortable at the time, but you build stamina and strength.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The pursuit of a stress-free life is not healthy. It is like exercise. It\u2019s uncomfortable, but you build stamina</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This view is backed by recent research showing that the way we think about stress can also determine its effects. In one study, a group of volunteers were given a series of anxiety-inducing tasks: singing karaoke (sober, in a laboratory setting), giving a speech and completing a difficult maths problem. Participants were split into three groups, who were instructed to say \u201cI am excited\u201d, \u201cI am calm\u201d or \u201cI am anxious\u201d before each task. Those who reframed their stress as excitement performed significantly better on all the tasks. For someone weighing up whether to apply for a job or take part in a race, say, the findings are an encouraging reminder that risks can open up rewarding opportunities. But it may not help with many other sources of stress \u2013 facing discrimination at work or caring for a parent with Alzheimer\u2019s, for example.</p> <h2>Can burn out make you ill?</h2> <p>There is growing evidence that when stress is extreme or unrelenting the health consequences can be significant. Stress increases blood pressure and temporarily makes the blood stickier and more likely to clot, meaning that, over prolonged periods, it can raise the risk of heart disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89c13fb5b7cf235f70ad7a14d41177a9de5a7aca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c13fb5b7cf235f70ad7a14d41177a9de5a7aca/25_3_962_1202/800.jpg\" alt=\"illo by chris clarke\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrenaline: prepares you for fight-or-flight</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Chris Clarke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists are also investigating the link between stress and type 2 diabetes. The possibility of a link has been speculated about for centuries, with the 17th-century <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Willis\" title=\"\">English physician, Thomas Willis</a>, attributing the condition to \u201csadness, long sorrow \u2026 and disorders of the animal spirits\u201d. Recent studies have confirmed the connection; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10396483\" title=\"\">Japanese men working excessive overtime</a> were more likely to become diabetic, for instance. However, it it not yet clear whether stress itself, or other lifestyle factors such as diet, lack of exercise and drinking alcohol, are to blame.Under normal circumstances, the stress response is designed to be self-limiting: a momentary surge of biological activity that quickly dissipates. This relies on a precisely choreographed sequence of hormone levels rising and falling by the right amount in the right order. Adrenaline triggers the release of immune cells, while cortisol, which lags behind, dampens down immune activity, bringing the body back to baseline. When people are relentlessly exposed to stress, though, this complex and finely balanced sequence can start to go awry.</p> <p>One study, involving teachers who were either happy with their job or \u201cburnt out\u201d, found that the burnt out group had higher levels of inflammation, a sign that the immune system is being placed under strain. Similar findings have been made in people who are long-term caregivers and in those who had suffered serious trauma as children.</p> <p>Bullmore believes that stress may leave an imprint on the immune system comparable to that left by an infectious disease, something he calls the \u201cinflammatory memory of stress\u201d. The theory is intriguing as it ties in with the recent discovery that inflammation in the body can have negative effects on mental health. It also challenges the traditional belief that the brain is sealed off from the rest of the body by what is known as the blood-brain barrier. Increasingly, scientists are showing links between mental and physical health. \u201cThe biggest single risk factor for depression is stress,\u201d says Bullmore. Understanding better this connection could open up new opportunities for treatments targeting immune activity and could even make it possible to intervene before depression occurs in people at risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9fe5b17aede79569bcc7cbc4588a7b30b209b27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe5b17aede79569bcc7cbc4588a7b30b209b27a/1_0_2150_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of cortisol, a fight-or-flight hormone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cortisol: surges at time of stress</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Chris Clarke/Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>It\u2019s personal</strong></h2> <p>Scientists are also discovering that not everyone responds to stress in the same way. Sex hormones interact with stress hormones, which could explain why stress appears to manifest itself differently in men and women. Scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that after prolonged stress, the brains of male and female rats began to rewire in subtly different ways. In female animals, neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the brain\u2019s control centre, grew more connections to the amygdala, a brain region linked to emotion. However, in the male animals these connections did not change, while links to other brain areas became less functional.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/29/early-risers-less-likely-to-develop-mental-health-problems\">Early risers 'less likely to develop mental health problems'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists are still trying to work out how such changes in brain circuitry affect how we feel and behave. Men are more likely to take it out through antisocial behaviour such as substance abuse whereas women are more likely to have a depressive episode,\u201d says Bruce McEwan, a professor of neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller who led the experiment in rats.</p> <p>A person\u2019s genetic makeup also helps explain why some of us thrive on stress while for others it can be the trigger for a devastating mental illness. Natalie Matosin, a neuroscientist at the University of Wollongong, Australia, is investigating the cumulative effects of stress over a lifetime, based on physical and chemical clues left behind in brain tissue. She examines slivers of postmortem brain samples under the microscope, comparing the brains of healthy donors with those of people who were diagnosed with PTSD or depression. \u201cI\u2019ll look at how the quantity, shape of brain cells have changed,\u201d she says. \u201cOther times I\u2019ll get just a couple of granules of tissue and look at the composition of proteins that make it up.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most startling discoveries focused on a gene called FKBP5, that is activated by circulating cortisol. Matosin and colleagues discovered that in people carrying a certain variant of this gene, the gene was switched on far more readily, amplifying the effect of cortisol as it courses through the body. \u201cIf you express too much of the gene it\u2019s bad because it means you can\u2019t switch off the stress response,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t switch off the stress response over an extended period of time, it can have an impact on the way your brain functions.\u201d</p> <p>People who carry the risk gene tend to have higher levels of cortisol and are also more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder after being exposed to very stressful circumstances. Like others in the field, Matosin hopes that it will one day be possible to identify those who are most vulnerable to stress and provide more effective treatments. \u201cThere are so many reasons that can cause psychiatric disorders and part of the reason we don\u2019t have good treatments for them is that at the moment we\u2019re just guessing,\u201d says Matosin.</p> <p>Stress is unavoidable and according to scientists the quest for a stress-free existence is likely to be futile. However, an emerging scientific understanding of stress could in future help protect us from its very darkest side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bbf56fd8b66efd6e5c35962a1bc35fb4fec4149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bbf56fd8b66efd6e5c35962a1bc35fb4fec4149/0_0_810_1012/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris clarke nanadrenaline\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noradrenaline: influences blood pressure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Chris Clarke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Meet the hormones \u2013 what happens during the fight-or-flight response?</h2> <p><strong>Cortisol: </strong><em>Formula: C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>5</sub></em></p> <p>Surges during times of stress, helping to increase the body\u2019s metabolism of glucose, control blood pressure and reduce inflammation.

      "bodyText": "Your boss ominously requests an urgent meeting, your taxi is inching towards the airport with minutes to spare before your flight, or your football team have been granted a potentially game-winning penalty in the 91st minute. Your heart pounds, your stomach lurches, your hands turn clammy: the effects of stress are visceral and instantaneous. When faced with a perceived threat, the body\u2019s fight or flight system triggers in a well-choreographed sequence that has evolved over millions of years. \u201cWe\u2019re here because our ancestors were so brave and could survive through times of terrible stress and threat,\u201d says Carmen Sandi, who leads a behavioural genetics laboratory in Switzerland. \u201cThe problem nowadays is that we\u2019re activating this ancient survival response in a job interview.\u201d In the modern world, where life-threatening situations are encountered rarely, stress itself has become the spectre. Last year, in the largest survey on the impact of stress, three in four Britons reported being so stressed that they had felt overwhelmed or unable to cope at least once over the last year. Studies across populations have linked extreme and chronic stress with heart disease, diabetes and mental health problems including depression. What is it doing to our bodies? Adrenaline rush The moment we perceive a threat, the brain\u2019s alarm system, a region called the hypothalamus, issues a series of commands designed to prepare us for fight or flight. Among the first to receive the alarm signal are the adrenal glands, which sit like little hats on top of the kidneys. Within seconds, they begin to pump out adrenaline, causing our heart and breathing to speed up and triggering the release of huge amounts of glucose from our liver. Blood is shunted away from the digestive system towards our arms and legs and the muscles around our small intestine contract, creating the feeling of a knot or fluttering in our stomach. For reasons that are not entirely understood \u2013 possibly the body\u2019s way of trying to remove any harmful toxins \u2013 adrenaline loosens the bowel muscles, meaning that acute stress can leave us racing for the bathroom. Another unwelcome side-effect is sweat, which is more sudden and smells worse than the kind produced during exercise or in hot weather. While exercise sweat comes from the eccrine glands and contains mostly water, adrenaline activates the apocrine glands in the armpits, which release a milky-looking substance containing fats and proteins, fuelling bacteria. Adrenaline also prompts a massive mobilisation of immune cells, which travel from the spleen and bone marrow where they are stored, into the bloodstream. \u201cThere\u2019s an evolutionary theory that in the past social stress was often a predictor of trauma or violence,\u201d says Ed Bullmore, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, who is exploring the link between stress and the immune system. \u201cWhen I\u2019m standing up doing a public presentation, my [subconscious] looks at all these people staring at me and says \u2018Maybe they\u2019re going to attack\u2019 \u2013 so my immune system ramps up in advance.\u201d While adrenaline floods the body within seconds, a second stress hormone, called cortisol, seeps into the bloodstream more gradually, peaking after 20-30 minutes. Cortisol changes the metabolism of cells, how cells function and alters the activity of DNA. In the brain, cortisol binds to neurons, altering normal thought processes including the way stressful events are recorded in our memories. Neuroscientists think the influence of cortisol could explain why our memories of traumatic or highly emotional events are often exceptionally vivid. Is stress always bad? Research suggests that some stress exposure is crucial for developing the resilience that allows us to cope with unexpected and challenging situations in the future. A 2013 review entitled \u201cUnderstanding resilience\u201d draws parallels with the way exposure to germs boosts the immune system, concluding: \u201cStress inoculation is a form of immunity against later stressors, much in the same way that vaccines induce immunity against disease.\u201d Adrian Wells, a professor of clinical and experimental psychopathology at the University of Manchester, agrees. He is concerned that the negative effects of stress are sometimes exaggerated and that an \u201cepidemic of stress phobia\u201d is turning situations that ought to be challenging or even exhilarating into something altogether more traumatic. \u201cThe pursuit of a stress-free life is not healthy,\u201d says Wells. \u201cStress is like exercise. It\u2019s pretty uncomfortable at the time, but you build stamina and strength.\u201d This view is backed by recent research showing that the way we think about stress can also determine its effects. In one study, a group of volunteers were given a series of anxiety-inducing tasks: singing karaoke (sober, in a laboratory setting), giving a speech and completing a difficult maths problem. Participants were split into three groups, who were instructed to say \u201cI am excited\u201d, \u201cI am calm\u201d or \u201cI am anxious\u201d before each task. Those who reframed their stress as excitement performed significantly better on all the tasks. For someone weighing up whether to apply for a job or take part in a race, say, the findings are an encouraging reminder that risks can open up rewarding opportunities. But it may not help with many other sources of stress \u2013 facing discrimination at work or caring for a parent with Alzheimer\u2019s, for example. Can burn out make you ill? There is growing evidence that when stress is extreme or unrelenting the health consequences can be significant. Stress increases blood pressure and temporarily makes the blood stickier and more likely to clot, meaning that, over prolonged periods, it can raise the risk of heart disease. Scientists are also investigating the link between stress and type 2 diabetes. The possibility of a link has been speculated about for centuries, with the 17th-century English physician, Thomas Willis, attributing the condition to \u201csadness, long sorrow \u2026 and disorders of the animal spirits\u201d. Recent studies have confirmed the connection; Japanese men working excessive overtime were more likely to become diabetic, for instance. However, it it not yet clear whether stress itself, or other lifestyle factors such as diet, lack of exercise and drinking alcohol, are to blame.Under normal circumstances, the stress response is designed to be self-limiting: a momentary surge of biological activity that quickly dissipates. This relies on a precisely choreographed sequence of hormone levels rising and falling by the right amount in the right order. Adrenaline triggers the release of immune cells, while cortisol, which lags behind, dampens down immune activity, bringing the body back to baseline. When people are relentlessly exposed to stress, though, this complex and finely balanced sequence can start to go awry. One study, involving teachers who were either happy with their job or \u201cburnt out\u201d, found that the burnt out group had higher levels of inflammation, a sign that the immune system is being placed under strain. Similar findings have been made in people who are long-term caregivers and in those who had suffered serious trauma as children. Bullmore believes that stress may leave an imprint on the immune system comparable to that left by an infectious disease, something he calls the \u201cinflammatory memory of stress\u201d. The theory is intriguing as it ties in with the recent discovery that inflammation in the body can have negative effects on mental health. It also challenges the traditional belief that the brain is sealed off from the rest of the body by what is known as the blood-brain barrier. Increasingly, scientists are showing links between mental and physical health. \u201cThe biggest single risk factor for depression is stress,\u201d says Bullmore. Understanding better this connection could open up new opportunities for treatments targeting immune activity and could even make it possible to intervene before depression occurs in people at risk. It\u2019s personal Scientists are also discovering that not everyone responds to stress in the same way. Sex hormones interact with stress hormones, which could explain why stress appears to manifest itself differently in men and women. Scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that after prolonged stress, the brains of male and female rats began to rewire in subtly different ways. In female animals, neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the brain\u2019s control centre, grew more connections to the amygdala, a brain region linked to emotion. However, in the male animals these connections did not change, while links to other brain areas became less functional. Scientists are still trying to work out how such changes in brain circuitry affect how we feel and behave. Men are more likely to take it out through antisocial behaviour such as substance abuse whereas women are more likely to have a depressive episode,\u201d says Bruce McEwan, a professor of neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller who led the experiment in rats. A person\u2019s genetic makeup also helps explain why some of us thrive on stress while for others it can be the trigger for a devastating mental illness. Natalie Matosin, a neuroscientist at the University of Wollongong, Australia, is investigating the cumulative effects of stress over a lifetime, based on physical and chemical clues left behind in brain tissue. She examines slivers of postmortem brain samples under the microscope, comparing the brains of healthy donors with those of people who were diagnosed with PTSD or depression. \u201cI\u2019ll look at how the quantity, shape of brain cells have changed,\u201d she says. \u201cOther times I\u2019ll get just a couple of granules of tissue and look at the composition of proteins that make it up.\u201d One of the most startling discoveries focused on a gene called FKBP5, that is activated by circulating cortisol. Matosin and colleagues discovered that in people carrying a certain variant of this gene, the gene was switched on far more readily, amplifying the effect of cortisol as it courses through the body. \u201cIf you express too much of the gene it\u2019s bad because it means you can\u2019t switch off the stress response,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t switch off the stress response over an extended period of time, it can have an impact on the way your brain functions.\u201d People who carry the risk gene tend to have higher levels of cortisol and are also more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder after being exposed to very stressful circumstances. Like others in the field, Matosin hopes that it will one day be possible to identify those who are most vulnerable to stress and provide more effective treatments. \u201cThere are so many reasons that can cause psychiatric disorders and part of the reason we don\u2019t have good treatments for them is that at the moment we\u2019re just guessing,\u201d says Matosin. Stress is unavoidable and according to scientists the quest for a stress-free existence is likely to be futile. However, an emerging scientific understanding of stress could in future help protect us from its very darkest side. Meet the hormones \u2013 what happens during the fight-or-flight response? Cortisol: Formula: C21H30O5 Surges during times of stress, helping to increase the body\u2019s metabolism of glucose, control blood pressure and reduce inflammation. After a stressful experience, levels should reduce. However, when people are continually under stress, the body\u2019s balance can be derailed. Continually high levels have been linked to anxiety and depression. On the upside, light exercise and even laughter have been shown to reduce cortisol. Adrenaline: Formula: C9H13NO3 Causes the heart to start pumping rapidly and air passages to dilate (providing muscles with oxygen). It also reduces the body\u2019s ability to feel pain, which is why people can be oblivious to an injury until after danger has passed. But if levels are continually elevated, studies suggest this could become detrimental, particularly to cardiac health. Noradrenaline: Formula: C8H11NO3 Chemically very similar to adrenaline, and does much of the same job but with more of an influence on blood pressure. Levels in the body follow a circadian cycle, being lowest during sleep and rising in the morning. During stressful situations, it acts in the brain to make us feel more alert and to enhance our ability to form memories.",

      "body": "<p>You\u2019ll probably remember reading somewhere that the deepest human fear \u2013 more profound even than death or waking up in bed with the 45th president of the United States of America \u2013 is the fear of public speaking. That\u2019s nonsense, of course, to be bracketed with other factoids such as the seven spiders we\u2019re all supposed to eat in our sleep, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/29/science.research\" title=\"\">impossibility </a>of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/04/flight-of-the-bumblebee-survey-finds-individual-personalities\" title=\"\">bumblebee flight</a>. The most recent Chapman University Survey on American Fears last year found public speaking at No 52, well behind sharks (41), death (48) and Obamacare (33). That\u2019s the science.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no question that for most of us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/21/art-of-speaking-up-for-yourself\" title=\"\">public speaking</a> is a fear. A big one. It\u2019s one that may not loom front and centre in our lives, since we will have arranged our lives, most of us, to avoid precisely the danger of having to stand up and talk in front of an audience. But when the time comes \u2013 our offspring get married, we win an Oscar or we represent ourselves in a murder trial \u2013 it will tend to scare the living daylights out of us. Ordinarily articulate people develop stammers, clasp and unclasp sweaty palms, cling to lecterns like figures in G\u00e9ricault\u2019s <em>The Raft of the Medusa</em>, read laborious jokes culled from the internet scrawled on trembling sheets of creased A4, or drink so much red wine beforehand we have to be physically returned to our seats.</p> <p>And, as any public speaker knows, the business of presenting to a large audience is a confidence trick: that is, a speaker who seems to be at ease will put their audience at ease. A speaker with a look of sick terror and a tremor in his or her voice will communicate his or her own baleful vibes of unease to the audience, and enter a vicious circle. A bad joke put over with confidence will get a laugh. A good joke put over apologetically will die on its arse. You need only look at the state of current political discourse as we enter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/18/brexit-endgame-what-happens-next\" title=\"\">the (latest) Brexit endgame</a>. When Theresa May is speaking, or at least trying to speak, a kind of common sense, her unease at the podium makes her sound faltering and unpersuasive; whereas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson can speak any amount of bluster</a> and flapdoodle and his confident delivery means that very many audiences will go along with him.</p> <p>Accordingly, in this age in which, supposedly, face-to-face communication is being digitised out of existence, we\u2019re seeing an efflorescence of books that propose to tell us how to go about speaking in public with confidence. The business sections of bookshops are bulging with how-tos on pitching, presenting and PowerPointing, and there are any number of snappy books on how to make a best man\u2019s speech or an acceptable after-dinner turn. Take \u201cpitch coach\u201d Michael Parker, who followed up <em>It\u2019s Not What You Say, It\u2019s the Way You Say It! </em>with <em>Unaccustomed as I Am ... The Wedding Speech Made Easy</em>. Or <em>So Here I Am: Speeches by Great Women to Empower and Inspire </em>by Anna Russell and Camila Pinheiro, out this week. Or Jay Heinrichs, whose <em>Thank You for</em> <em>Arguing</em> was followed up by the more niche <em>How to Argue With a Cat</em>. Or Graham Davies\u2019s <em>The Presentation Coach: Bare Knuckle Brilliance for Every Presenter </em>... They come not as single spies.</p> <p>And \u2013 of course \u2013 everyone now wants to be able to direct you to the TedX talk they gave in some forlorn bingo hall. There are guides for that, too. TED\u2019s founder Chris Anderson has produced <em>The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking</em>, which (oddly from the author of <em>Free: The Future of a Radical Price</em>) costs \u00a39.99. And Carmine Gallo is all over TED like white on rice, with <em>Talk Like TED: The</em><em> 9 Public Speaking Secrets of the World\u2019s Top Minds</em> and its follow-up <em>The Storyteller\u2019s Secret: How TED Speakers and Inspirational Leaders Turn Their Passion into Performance</em>. There\u2019s even, for Pete\u2019s sake, a book called <em>How to Design TED-worthy Presentation Slides</em>.</p> <p>Personally, I have a soft spot for the advice on offer in Gyles Brandreth\u2019s 1983 <em>The Complete Public Speaker</em>, belonging as it does to a gentler age in which cufflinks and lecterns rather than wireless head-mics and PowerPoints were the things to worry about. Its author has the distinction of holding the Guinness world record for the longest after-dinner speech of all time, and the distinction was hard won: on his first attempt he tied with a rival, recording in his diary: \u201cI am going to have to share a world record with Nicholas Parsons. Of course I\u2019m effing angry.\u201d Brandreth has not left it there. He and his barrister son Benet now sell an online public speaking course through the Gravy for the Brain website.</p> <p>Many if not all of these authors tend to offer a lucrative sideline in seminars, courses, consultancies, masterclasses and one-to-one coaching \u2013 courses eagerly subscribed to by the corporate development departments of large firms as well as by individuals. Advice to those who have to speak in public \u2013 be it to a board meeting or the meeting of a boardgames society \u2013 is a vast industry. And as the list of sample publications I\u2019ve quoted above makes clear, public speaking has mostly been a boys\u2019 game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bda67dc4421185714d45c95181a46f64b3e6f320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bda67dc4421185714d45c95181a46f64b3e6f320/0_0_3544_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson delivers a speech in Rocester, Staffordshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson delivers a speech in Rocester, Staffordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the comedian, broadcaster and journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/06/in-praise-of-loud-women-the-joy-and-power-of-being-noisy-and-female\" title=\"\">Viv Groskop</a>\u2019s <em>How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking</em>, which came out in November, is a relatively rare bird, in that it sets out to offer speaking advice drawn from female experience (\u201cBe More Oprah\u201d; \u201cBe More Michelle\u201d; \u201cBe More JK\u201d; \u201cBe More Chimamanda\u201d and so on) and with a tilt to a female audience. Groskop is reluctant to make broad generalisations about any differences in the way women may need to approach a podium, but \u201csince it\u2019s only really in the last 20 years or so that women have had something like an equal chance to speak in public\u201d, generations of patriarchy may mean that \u201cwomen maybe need to work harder than men to feel really comfortable in yourself so that you can transmit that comfort to the audience\u201d.</p> <p>I should say that the idea of a how-to guide for aspiring orators is not exactly a new one. Cicero\u2019s <em>De Oratore</em>, <em>Ad Herennium</em> (for a long time attributed to Cicero but not by him) and Quintilian\u2019s <em>Institutes of Oratory </em>are all as much manuals as they are works of analysis. Rhetoric, as Aristotle noted, is a <em>techne</em>: it can be taught. Indeed, ever since democracy got going and the Athenian nobles realised that property alone was no longer enough to guarantee power \u2013 that oratory mattered \u2013 there have been private tutors (<em>sophistiae</em>) and speechwriters (<em>logographoi</em>) offering to help the monied but tongue-tied to find their voices.</p> <p>As all these authorities realised, a well-written speech is easier to deliver than a dully written one, and a well-structured speech is easier for speaker and audience to remember than a rambling shambles. The tricks of style the ancients identified still work. <em>Anaphora</em> \u2013 repeating a word or phrase at the beginning of successive sentences or paragraphs \u2013 gives a speech force and momentum. The <em>tricolon</em> \u2013 grouping things into three, as in \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d \u2013 remains a staple of modern oratory. Likewise <em>antithesis</em> \u2013 contrasting one thing with another \u2013 gives you the chance to define the shape of an argument (all the better if you use it to finesse the inconvenient fact that there might in fact be two or more options). And nothing makes a speaker sound focused and businesslike like <em>enumeratio</em>: reeling out a numbered list of points, like the Spanish Inquisition in the<em> Monty Python</em> sketch. May even tried it in her doomed speech closing the Brexit debate \u2013 though by that time her goose was cooked in any case.</p> <p>And, accordingly, the advice on the whole does not much change \u2013 the history of oratory handbooks over two millennia is a history of old Aristotelian wine in new bottles \u2013 but in a way it\u2019s having advice at all that makes the difference. As Graham Davies, a former barrister who has given presentation coaching and speech-polishing tips to many senior politicians, says: \u201cOne of the things that people find frightening about public speaking is not having a process to prepare. I give people a process. Speaking is a matter of two things: deciding what to say, and saying it. And you can break that process down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d9b8e0691102ad3e96bec8543e49d3ac3fee034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d9b8e0691102ad3e96bec8543e49d3ac3fee034/207_85_2155_3458/623.jpg\" alt=\"Viv Groskop: \u2018It\u2019s only really in the last 20 years or so that women have had something like an equal chance to speak in public.\u2019\" width=\"623\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viv Groskop: \u2018It\u2019s only really in the last 20 years or so that women have had something like an equal chance to speak in public.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Ullathorne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That old wine includes knowing your audience, seeking to project authenticity, using relatable narratives and humanising examples, and giving a speech a robust structure with a grabby opening and a memorable payoff. But things have also changed since Cicero\u2019s day. Any speaker is nowadays addressing any number of potential audiences outside the range of his or her unamplified voice. And a speech can live for ever in digital form, meaning that tone and decorum need to be thought about hard. </p> <p>Sometimes, but not always, the internet is the intended audience. The TED Talk \u2013 precision engineered to be shared on social media, and at 18 minutes well geared to a modern attention span (\u201clong enough to be serious and short enough to hold people\u2019s attention\u201d in Anderson\u2019s formulation) \u2013 certainly has been a driver of recent interest in the orator\u2019s art. Groskop points, too, to YouTube and Instagram Stories as examples of how public speaking is \u201cgetting into our lives\u201d in a way it never has before. She speculates that \u201cthere\u2019s something going on to do with people\u2019s hunger for community and for face-to-face communication in an age when face-to-face communication is less and less common\u201d.</p> <p>We also have an arsenal of technological fixes unavailable to the ancients. We can write our speeches down and edit them on the page. We don\u2019t have to memorise them \u2013 we have index cards and autocues. The autocue can be a great help, but you need to learn to use it as if it isn\u2019t there. Davies says that in the Cameron era, Tory conference speeches used to have a wraparound plasma screen all the way around the middle balcony of the Birmingham conference centre, so that the speaker could look anywhere in the crowd and still see a text. Austerity brought back \u201cthe cheap version\u201d (three TV-style autocues at 10, 12 and two o\u2019clock) and, as speakers jerked their heads from one to the other, the oratory suffered.</p> <p>Davies takes issue with some of the old-fashioned advice about public speaking, such as the suggestion to speak more slowly than feels comfortable: \u201cIn 2018, in attention-deficit Britain, the ear can take in words faster than the mouth can deliver them.\u201d He says you\u2019re trying to hit \u201cintense dinner party speed\u201d and counsels \u201cmachine-gun bursts\u201d, with \u201cpauses to reload\u201d. Gallo seems to back this up, noting that the most successful TED talks average a very brisk 190 words per minute.</p> <p>Much store is set by body language, and rightly: an open posture and confident stance project a very different sense of a speaker than a hunched or cowed look. But we shouldn\u2019t overestimate it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/interviews-body-language\" title=\"\">Albert Mehrabian</a>\u2019s celebrated 1967 studies on nonverbal communication are frequently misunderstood or misquoted to the effect that \u201cyour words account for only 7% of your effect on an audience\u201d. Simply put, that\u2019s bollocks: the Mehrabian material applied to short expressions to do with feelings rather than long speeches about the world.</p> <p>Likewise, as Groskop points out, some have taken too far the suggestive (if contested) research publicised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2017/sep/13/the-power-pose-is-dead-heres-how-to-really-stand-strong\" title=\"\">Amy Cuddy,</a> showing that if before you take the stage you spend two or three minutes power-posing in private (stand like Wonder Woman or Usain Bolt and hold the pose), your stress hormones will fall and your testosterone levels will rise. Misunderstanding Cuddy may, she suggests, have given us the so-called Tory Power Pose. You\u2019re supposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/sajid-javid-tory-power-stance\" title=\"\">do it in private, Sajid</a>.</p> <p>But there\u2019s an emphasis in that \u2013 in the positive feedback loop of confidence that public speaking requires \u2013 which perhaps chimes with some of its current appeal. \u201cI think,\u201d Groskop says, \u201cthat some of the popularity of public speaking now has come out of the self-help movement. People are saying: \u2018You mean I don\u2019t need to be scared of this? There\u2019s something I can do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to Groskop, \u201cA lot of people told me I should have called my book <em>How to Stop Feeling Shit About Yourself.</em> Because most people do feel shit about themselves when they think about speaking in public. And that\u2019s tragic: because they probably have something really interesting to say.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How to hold a crowd</strong></h2> <p><strong>Be confident </strong>Speaking is a confidence trick: if you\u2019re comfortable, so will be the audience, and vice versa. You want to project what Viv Groskop calls \u201chappy high status\u201d. Know your audience, know your speech and know (if possible) the space in which you\u2019re to speak. What Groskop calls \u201cexposure\u201d (AKA speaking again and again in public) is the only way to get real confidence, but practising in private is a start. And five minutes of Wonder Woman beforehand can\u2019t hurt either.</p> <p><strong>Be authentic </strong>\u201cSo often, people go to the podium and, for all sorts of reasons, pretend to be something they are not,\u201d says Simon Lancaster (author of <em>Speechwriting: The Expert Guide</em>). \u201cPeople are wise to this bullshit. Just be yourself (which sounds easier than it really is).\u201d That means being the best version of yourself. Speak with notes (advised) or without them if you\u2019re super-confident. But reading the entire speech from a sheet of paper kills the spontaneity (\u201cReaders can\u2019t be leaders\u201d).</p> <p><strong>Be appropriate </strong>Knowing your audience has always been the key to successful oratory. If you\u2019re hoping to persuade, gauge not only the audience\u2019s starting position but where you\u2019re hoping to \u2013 and can realistically expect to \u2013 move them to; and the arguments most likely to appeal to them.</p> <p><strong>Be brief </strong>You\u2019re competing against every smartphone in the audience. That means grabbing the attention fast, which is perhaps why opening with: \u201cI want to tell you a story ...\u201d has become a TED talk cliche. However you do it \u2013 a joke, a startling fact, a narrative hook \u2013 you need to do what Graham Davies calls \u201csharpening the spear\u201d. And three clear strong points in support of your argument will fare better than 14 vague, weak ones.</p> <p><strong>Be smart with the technology </strong>Use a lectern to hold your notes, not as a bulletproof screen between you and the audience. Pretend it isn\u2019t there. The average PowerPoint slide, says Carmine Gallo, has 40 words on it. That\u2019s far too many. <strong>One TED talk with 7m views was 25 slides in before they hit 40 words in total.</strong></p> <p><strong>Be sober </strong>A drunk audience (or at least a slightly drunk one) is a boon to a speaker. The formula doesn\u2019t work so well in reverse. As Davies points out: \u201cWhen Roger Federer walks on to the Centre Court at Wimbledon, he hasn\u2019t had a couple of swift ones.\u201d But a large glass of the red infuriator in the speaker\u2019s eyeline can be a powerful incentive to brevity.</p> <p>... and (did we mention?) <strong>Be prepared</strong> \u201cTo sound really impromptu,\u201d Davies says, \u201crehearse like hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-talkin-to-me-9781788163187.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">You Talkin\u2019 to Me?: Rhetoric from Aristotle to Obama</a></em> <em>by Sam Leith is published by Profile.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "You\u2019ll probably remember reading somewhere that the deepest human fear \u2013 more profound even than death or waking up in bed with the 45th president of the United States of America \u2013 is the fear of public speaking. That\u2019s nonsense, of course, to be bracketed with other factoids such as the seven spiders we\u2019re all supposed to eat in our sleep, or the impossibility of bumblebee flight. The most recent Chapman University Survey on American Fears last year found public speaking at No 52, well behind sharks (41), death (48) and Obamacare (33). That\u2019s the science. But there\u2019s no question that for most of us, public speaking is a fear. A big one. It\u2019s one that may not loom front and centre in our lives, since we will have arranged our lives, most of us, to avoid precisely the danger of having to stand up and talk in front of an audience. But when the time comes \u2013 our offspring get married, we win an Oscar or we represent ourselves in a murder trial \u2013 it will tend to scare the living daylights out of us. Ordinarily articulate people develop stammers, clasp and unclasp sweaty palms, cling to lecterns like figures in G\u00e9ricault\u2019s The Raft of the Medusa, read laborious jokes culled from the internet scrawled on trembling sheets of creased A4, or drink so much red wine beforehand we have to be physically returned to our seats. And, as any public speaker knows, the business of presenting to a large audience is a confidence trick: that is, a speaker who seems to be at ease will put their audience at ease. A speaker with a look of sick terror and a tremor in his or her voice will communicate his or her own baleful vibes of unease to the audience, and enter a vicious circle. A bad joke put over with confidence will get a laugh. A good joke put over apologetically will die on its arse. You need only look at the state of current political discourse as we enter the (latest) Brexit endgame. When Theresa May is speaking, or at least trying to speak, a kind of common sense, her unease at the podium makes her sound faltering and unpersuasive; whereas Boris Johnson can speak any amount of bluster and flapdoodle and his confident delivery means that very many audiences will go along with him. Accordingly, in this age in which, supposedly, face-to-face communication is being digitised out of existence, we\u2019re seeing an efflorescence of books that propose to tell us how to go about speaking in public with confidence. The business sections of bookshops are bulging with how-tos on pitching, presenting and PowerPointing, and there are any number of snappy books on how to make a best man\u2019s speech or an acceptable after-dinner turn. Take \u201cpitch coach\u201d Michael Parker, who followed up It\u2019s Not What You Say, It\u2019s the Way You Say It! with Unaccustomed as I Am ... The Wedding Speech Made Easy. Or So Here I Am: Speeches by Great Women to Empower and Inspire by Anna Russell and Camila Pinheiro, out this week. Or Jay Heinrichs, whose Thank You for Arguing was followed up by the more niche How to Argue With a Cat. Or Graham Davies\u2019s The Presentation Coach: Bare Knuckle Brilliance for Every Presenter ... They come not as single spies. And \u2013 of course \u2013 everyone now wants to be able to direct you to the TedX talk they gave in some forlorn bingo hall. There are guides for that, too. TED\u2019s founder Chris Anderson has produced The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking, which (oddly from the author of Free: The Future of a Radical Price) costs \u00a39.99. And Carmine Gallo is all over TED like white on rice, with Talk Like TED: The 9 Public Speaking Secrets of the World\u2019s Top Minds and its follow-up The Storyteller\u2019s Secret: How TED Speakers and Inspirational Leaders Turn Their Passion into Performance. There\u2019s even, for Pete\u2019s sake, a book called How to Design TED-worthy Presentation Slides. Personally, I have a soft spot for the advice on offer in Gyles Brandreth\u2019s 1983 The Complete Public Speaker, belonging as it does to a gentler age in which cufflinks and lecterns rather than wireless head-mics and PowerPoints were the things to worry about. Its author has the distinction of holding the Guinness world record for the longest after-dinner speech of all time, and the distinction was hard won: on his first attempt he tied with a rival, recording in his diary: \u201cI am going to have to share a world record with Nicholas Parsons. Of course I\u2019m effing angry.\u201d Brandreth has not left it there. He and his barrister son Benet now sell an online public speaking course through the Gravy for the Brain website. Many if not all of these authors tend to offer a lucrative sideline in seminars, courses, consultancies, masterclasses and one-to-one coaching \u2013 courses eagerly subscribed to by the corporate development departments of large firms as well as by individuals. Advice to those who have to speak in public \u2013 be it to a board meeting or the meeting of a boardgames society \u2013 is a vast industry. And as the list of sample publications I\u2019ve quoted above makes clear, public speaking has mostly been a boys\u2019 game. So the comedian, broadcaster and journalist Viv Groskop\u2019s How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking, which came out in November, is a relatively rare bird, in that it sets out to offer speaking advice drawn from female experience (\u201cBe More Oprah\u201d; \u201cBe More Michelle\u201d; \u201cBe More JK\u201d; \u201cBe More Chimamanda\u201d and so on) and with a tilt to a female audience. Groskop is reluctant to make broad generalisations about any differences in the way women may need to approach a podium, but \u201csince it\u2019s only really in the last 20 years or so that women have had something like an equal chance to speak in public\u201d, generations of patriarchy may mean that \u201cwomen maybe need to work harder than men to feel really comfortable in yourself so that you can transmit that comfort to the audience\u201d. I should say that the idea of a how-to guide for aspiring orators is not exactly a new one. Cicero\u2019s De Oratore, Ad Herennium (for a long time attributed to Cicero but not by him) and Quintilian\u2019s Institutes of Oratory are all as much manuals as they are works of analysis. Rhetoric, as Aristotle noted, is a techne: it can be taught. Indeed, ever since democracy got going and the Athenian nobles realised that property alone was no longer enough to guarantee power \u2013 that oratory mattered \u2013 there have been private tutors (sophistiae) and speechwriters (logographoi) offering to help the monied but tongue-tied to find their voices. As all these authorities realised, a well-written speech is easier to deliver than a dully written one, and a well-structured speech is easier for speaker and audience to remember than a rambling shambles. The tricks of style the ancients identified still work. Anaphora \u2013 repeating a word or phrase at the beginning of successive sentences or paragraphs \u2013 gives a speech force and momentum. The tricolon \u2013 grouping things into three, as in \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d \u2013 remains a staple of modern oratory. Likewise antithesis \u2013 contrasting one thing with another \u2013 gives you the chance to define the shape of an argument (all the better if you use it to finesse the inconvenient fact that there might in fact be two or more options). And nothing makes a speaker sound focused and businesslike like enumeratio: reeling out a numbered list of points, like the Spanish Inquisition in the Monty Python sketch. May even tried it in her doomed speech closing the Brexit debate \u2013 though by that time her goose was cooked in any case. And, accordingly, the advice on the whole does not much change \u2013 the history of oratory handbooks over two millennia is a history of old Aristotelian wine in new bottles \u2013 but in a way it\u2019s having advice at all that makes the difference. As Graham Davies, a former barrister who has given presentation coaching and speech-polishing tips to many senior politicians, says: \u201cOne of the things that people find frightening about public speaking is not having a process to prepare. I give people a process. Speaking is a matter of two things: deciding what to say, and saying it. And you can break that process down.\u201d That old wine includes knowing your audience, seeking to project authenticity, using relatable narratives and humanising examples, and giving a speech a robust structure with a grabby opening and a memorable payoff. But things have also changed since Cicero\u2019s day. Any speaker is nowadays addressing any number of potential audiences outside the range of his or her unamplified voice. And a speech can live for ever in digital form, meaning that tone and decorum need to be thought about hard. Sometimes, but not always, the internet is the intended audience. The TED Talk \u2013 precision engineered to be shared on social media, and at 18 minutes well geared to a modern attention span (\u201clong enough to be serious and short enough to hold people\u2019s attention\u201d in Anderson\u2019s formulation) \u2013 certainly has been a driver of recent interest in the orator\u2019s art. Groskop points, too, to YouTube and Instagram Stories as examples of how public speaking is \u201cgetting into our lives\u201d in a way it never has before. She speculates that \u201cthere\u2019s something going on to do with people\u2019s hunger for community and for face-to-face communication in an age when face-to-face communication is less and less common\u201d. We also have an arsenal of technological fixes unavailable to the ancients. We can write our speeches down and edit them on the page. We don\u2019t have to memorise them \u2013 we have index cards and autocues. The autocue can be a great help, but you need to learn to use it as if it isn\u2019t there. Davies says that in the Cameron era, Tory conference speeches used to have a wraparound plasma screen all the way around the middle balcony of the Birmingham conference centre, so that the speaker could look anywhere in the crowd and still see a text. Austerity brought back \u201cthe cheap version\u201d (three TV-style autocues at 10, 12 and two o\u2019clock) and, as speakers jerked their heads from one to the other, the oratory suffered. Davies takes issue with some of the old-fashioned advice about public speaking, such as the suggestion to speak more slowly than feels comfortable: \u201cIn 2018, in attention-deficit Britain, the ear can take in words faster than the mouth can deliver them.\u201d He says you\u2019re trying to hit \u201cintense dinner party speed\u201d and counsels \u201cmachine-gun bursts\u201d, with \u201cpauses to reload\u201d. Gallo seems to back this up, noting that the most successful TED talks average a very brisk 190 words per minute. Much store is set by body language, and rightly: an open posture and confident stance project a very different sense of a speaker than a hunched or cowed look. But we shouldn\u2019t overestimate it. Albert Mehrabian\u2019s celebrated 1967 studies on nonverbal communication are frequently misunderstood or misquoted to the effect that \u201cyour words account for only 7% of your effect on an audience\u201d. Simply put, that\u2019s bollocks: the Mehrabian material applied to short expressions to do with feelings rather than long speeches about the world. Likewise, as Groskop points out, some have taken too far the suggestive (if contested) research publicised by Amy Cuddy, showing that if before you take the stage you spend two or three minutes power-posing in private (stand like Wonder Woman or Usain Bolt and hold the pose), your stress hormones will fall and your testosterone levels will rise. Misunderstanding Cuddy may, she suggests, have given us the so-called Tory Power Pose. You\u2019re supposed to do it in private, Sajid. But there\u2019s an emphasis in that \u2013 in the positive feedback loop of confidence that public speaking requires \u2013 which perhaps chimes with some of its current appeal. \u201cI think,\u201d Groskop says, \u201cthat some of the popularity of public speaking now has come out of the self-help movement. People are saying: \u2018You mean I don\u2019t need to be scared of this? There\u2019s something I can do?\u2019\u201d According to Groskop, \u201cA lot of people told me I should have called my book How to Stop Feeling Shit About Yourself. Because most people do feel shit about themselves when they think about speaking in public. And that\u2019s tragic: because they probably have something really interesting to say.\u201d How to hold a crowd Be confident Speaking is a confidence trick: if you\u2019re comfortable, so will be the audience, and vice versa.

At times City looked sloppy against Arsenal but Ag\u00fcero made the difference, repeatedly finding himself in the crucial position to jab the ball home with any available limb. All of City\u2019s attacking midfielders know where the Argentinian wants to be once they break into the area and Ag\u00fcero\u2019s improved fitness under Pep Guardiola helps him get there. Superior fitness was one of the things that made the difference as Arsenal wilted while Ag\u00fcero and City thrived.

For the third time since Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r took over, the pair directly combined for a United goal, with Pogba\u2019s delightful pitching-wedge pass against Leicester picking out Rashford\u2019s run in behind Harry Maguire and Ben Chilwell. Rashford\u2019s reaction after dispatching a low shot under Kasper Schmeichel \u2013 he instantly turned to acknowledge Pogba \u2013 said a lot about the relationship they have struck up on the pitch since Solskj\u00e6r was appointed. The two of them look liberated under Solskj\u00e6r and are arguably the most influential figures in United\u2019s turnaround since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho departed. Both players have scored six times in 10 games and Pogba also has five assists. \u201cGood players make each other better,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Leicester City 0-1 Manchester United</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/feb/03/the-dozen-this-weekends-best-premier-league-photos-in-pictures\">The Dozen: this weekend's best Premier League photos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Don\u2019t write off Tottenham</h2> \n<p>If people would only stop speculating about Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s future they could instead focus on his present: with Manchester City and Liverpool showing not only fallibility under pressure, Tottenham cannot yet be discounted from the title race. In their last three league games, they have beaten Fulham with a 93rd-minute goal, Watford with 80th and 87th-minute goals and Newcastle with an 83rd-minute goal, and the confidence inspired by such a run cannot be overstated \u2013 all the more so given the absence of Dele Alli and Harry Kane. If Spurs can maintain form until their fit and fresh return, they may yet spring a surprise \u2013 but only if Pochettino can devise a strategy for beating their direct competitors, both of whom have his team\u2019s number in head-to-head meetings. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/tottenham-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6236bc87510e47828e5505f109e3986a58172e86\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6236bc87510e47828e5505f109e3986a58172e86/0_7_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Son Heung-min scores against Newcastle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Son Heung-min scores against Newcastle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Higua\u00edn and Hazard lift Sarri\u2019s spirits</h2> \n<p>It is dangerous to read too much into a saunter past Huddersfield, but Maurizio Sarri will have seen encouraging evidence in periods of Chelsea\u2019s play. He cited Mateo Kovacic\u2019s involvement as Jorginho\u2019s replacement late on, a player \u201cclose to Jorginho in moving the ball very fast, one touch\u201d. He reintegrated Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the Premier League side after his latest bout of back trouble. And, above all, there were indications of understanding between Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. That pair provided four of the goals and combined 21 times. They appeared to be on the same wavelength. Games against Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur this month will test that relationship but Chelsea may now have an attacking partnership to inflict damage on the best. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/chelsea-huddersfield-town-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 5-0 Huddersfield</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"67ff9c22-8df6-42f5-a6b2-bd1e35924a7c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Monday 4 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b><br>Premier League: </b>West Ham v Liverpool <i>8pm</i>&nbsp;(Sky Sports Premier League&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Tuesday 5 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>FA Cup fourth round replay:</b> Newport County v Middlesbrough <i>7.45pm</i> (BT Sport 2)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Wednesday 6 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>WSL Continental Cup semi-final:</b> Chelsea Women v Manchester City Women <i>7.30pm&nbsp; (</i>FA WSL Facebook)</p>\n    <p><b>Scottish Premiership:&nbsp;</b>Aberdeen v Rangers <i>7.45pm </i>(Sky Sports Football&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)</p>\n    <p><b>FA Cup fourth round replay:&nbsp;</b>West Bromwich Albion v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion <i>8.05pm</i> (BBC One)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Thursday 7 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>FA WSL Continental Cup semi-final:</b> Arsenal Women v Manchester City Women <i>7.30pm </i>(BT Sport 1)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Friday 8 February </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Championship:</b>&nbsp;Aston Villa v Sheffield United <i>7.45pm </i>(Sky Sports Football&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Saturday 9 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Premier League:</b> Fulham v Manchester United <i>12.30pm </i>(Sky Sports Premier League&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)</p>\n    <p><b>Scottish FA Cup fifth round:&nbsp;</b>Kilmarnock v Rangers <i>5.15pm </i>(Premier 1)</p>\n    <p><b>Championship:&nbsp;</b>Stoke City v West Bromwich Albion <i>5.30pm</i> (Sky Sports Football)</p>\n    <p><b>Premier League:&nbsp;</b>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Burnley <i>5.30pm </i>(BT Sport 1)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Sunday 10 February</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Championship:</b> Norwich City v Ipswich Town <i>12pm </i>(Sky Sports Football&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)</p>\n    <p><b>Premier League:&nbsp;</b>Tottenham Hotspur v Leicester City <i>1.30pm </i>(Sky Sports Premier League&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event)</p>\n    <p><b>Scottish FA Cup fifth round:&nbsp;</b>Celtic v St Johnstone <i>1.30pm</i> (Premier 1)</p>\n    <p><b>Women's Super League:&nbsp;</b>Manchester City Women v Chelsea Women <i>2pm </i>(BT Sport 1)</p>\n    <p><b>Scottish FA Cup fifth round:&nbsp;</b>Aberdeen v Queen of the South <i>3.30pm </i>(BBC One Scotland)</p>\n    <p><b>Premier League:&nbsp;</b>Manchester City v Chelsea <i>4pm </i>(Sky Sports Premier League&nbsp;/&nbsp;Sky Sports Main Event )</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Almir\u00f3n sees size of creative challenge</h2> \n<p>Newcastle played well in their 1-0 defeat at Tottenham. They kept their 5-4-1 shape, compressed the space, made it hard for the home side and threatened three times on the counterattack. It was a typical Rafael Ben\u00edtez performance in which he tried to optimise the attributes of the players at his disposal. But as the manager himself noted, his team had to be better on the ball. The dearth of creativity in central midfield was plain. This is where Miguel Almir\u00f3n comes in. The \u00a321m club-record signing from Atlanta United missed the game because his visa had not come through and, when he makes his debut at Wolves next week, there will be pressure on him to lift the aesthetic. But the attacking midfielder has not played since 8 December while the difference between the MLS and Premier League is seismic. Almir\u00f3n cannot be expected to transform things overnight. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/tottenham-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Task of saving Fulham looks beyond Ranieri</h2> \n<p>While winning the league with Leicester City meant Claudio Ranieri arrived at Craven Cottage with a reputation as a miracle worker, Fulham have seen little evidence of the Italian\u2019s supposed magical powers since appointing him in November. The side with the worst defensive record in the Premier League are just as naive at the back, brittle in midfield and wayward in attack as they were under Slavisa Jokanovic, who can be forgiven for feeling smug as he watches Ranieri struggle to perform wonders with a weird mess of a squad. Jokanovic\u2019s successor has picked up 12 points from his first 13 games and Fulham, the only team in the division without an away win, looked like they were waiting to be relegated during their defeat by Crystal Palace. With confidence ebbing away, consecutive home games against Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool are unlikely to lift the mood. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/crystal-palace-fulham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 2-0 Fulham</a></em></p> \n<h2>7) Wolves give Everton a footballing lesson</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/everton-marco-silva-players-consistent-premier-league\">Marco Silva says under-performing Everton players need self-motivation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Wolves gave Everton a beating and Evertonians many reasons for envy on Saturday. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s players were organised, committed, spirited and dangerous: everything Marco Silva\u2019s side were not as they slipped to a sixth defeat in nine Premier League games. In Conor Coady they possessed a defensive strength and discipline that was in stark contrast to the performance of Michael Keane. In Jo\u00e3o Moutinho they had the purpose and invention the home midfield failed to deliver but it was in attack where Everton, 19 months after the sale of Romelu Lukaku, were totally eclipsed by the quality of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. The Mexico striker led the line superbly and claimed his fourth goal in three games. His work-rate and contribution put the efforts of all of Everton\u2019s offensive players \u2013 Theo Walcott, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Cenk Tosun \u2013 to shame. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/everton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 1-3 Wolves</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65771fb3e28071b08079a0a7c6803b0e5c6628a9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65771fb3e28071b08079a0a7c6803b0e5c6628a9/362_501_6786_4072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conor Coady (c) was outstanding for Wolves as they beat Everton 3-1 at Goodison Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conor Coady (c) was outstanding for Wolves as they beat Everton 3-1 at Goodison Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Bagnall - AMA/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8) Hughton needs to stop the slide</h2> \n<p>Chris Hughton may not be looking over his shoulder just yet but a fifth consecutive game without a win has seen his Brighton side drop perilously close to the relegation dogfight. Cardiff\u2019s victory means the Seagulls are only five points clear of trouble and having picked up only six points from their last 10 league games, the manager will be eager to stop the slide. They will have an immediate opportunity to do that on Saturday against Burnley after Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup replay with West Brom, although Hughton will be wary of Sean Dyche\u2019s side given their recent revival that has seen them clamber away from danger. Brighton have three more points than at this stage last season, when they ended up 15th, and should be confident of beating that position given they have home games against Huddersfield, Cardiff, Southampton, Bournemouth and Newcastle still to come. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/brighton-hove-albion-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 0-0 Watford</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/liverpool-premier-league-champions-league-klopp\">Liverpool will not prioritise league title over Champions League, says Klopp</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>9) Dyche looks forward to VAR</h2> \n<p>\u201cNext season we\u2019ll have VAR, and that should be a help,\u201d Sean Dyche said after his side were finally awarded a penalty on a day they should have had two. After waiting since April 2017 the Burnley manager was relieved to be able to claim a point in stoppage time but understandably exasperated by the penalty Ashley Barnes was refused in the first half. What left him even more aghast was the fact Barnes was booked for simulation when he had clearly been knocked over by the goalkeeper. So clearly, in fact, that Anthony Taylor was probably the only person at Turf Moor who thought Barnes was trying to cheat. \u201cA terrible decision,\u201d Alan Shearer said on MOTD. Will VAR be of assistance? If referees are going to need replays to help with such judgment calls the games next season could be both long and unedifying. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/02/burnley-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 1-1 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Howe searches for consistency</h2> \n<p>That Dominic Solanke had only one touch in the opposition box on his Bournemouth debut underlined a miserable weekend for Eddie Howe\u2019s side. Solanke, a \u00a319m signing from Liverpool last month, failed to impress in a team performance bereft of any zip, with Bournemouth badly missing the injured Callum Wilson and David Brooks, who is set to miss a month. They were off-colour in Cardiff, nowhere near meeting the benchmark they set after humbling Chelsea. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really good runs and performances where we have looked like the real deal and then a performance when we fell away from that,\u201d said Howe, whose side have lost five of their past eight games. \u201cIs it because the players are not good enough? No. So it can only be a mentality issue and that is something we have got to solve very quickly.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

      "bodyText": "1) Ag\u00fcero makes the difference Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hat-trick, scored from a collective distance of 10 yards, was not achieved by accident but thanks to his instincts and endurance. At times City looked sloppy against Arsenal but Ag\u00fcero made the difference, repeatedly finding himself in the crucial position to jab the ball home with any available limb. All of City\u2019s attacking midfielders know where the Argentinian wants to be once they break into the area and Ag\u00fcero\u2019s improved fitness under Pep Guardiola helps him get there. Superior fitness was one of the things that made the difference as Arsenal wilted while Ag\u00fcero and City thrived. The striker is definitely working harder under the Catalan than his predecessors and his increased stamina is bringing rewards. He will need every last ounce of energy for the rest of the season as he is still irreplaceable. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 3-1 Arsenal 2) Pogba-Rashford combination lifts United Now and again players strike up an understanding that seems almost telepathic, and it seems that way with Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford at the moment. For the third time since Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r took over, the pair directly combined for a United goal, with Pogba\u2019s delightful pitching-wedge pass against Leicester picking out Rashford\u2019s run in behind Harry Maguire and Ben Chilwell. Rashford\u2019s reaction after dispatching a low shot under Kasper Schmeichel \u2013 he instantly turned to acknowledge Pogba \u2013 said a lot about the relationship they have struck up on the pitch since Solskj\u00e6r was appointed. The two of them look liberated under Solskj\u00e6r and are arguably the most influential figures in United\u2019s turnaround since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho departed. Both players have scored six times in 10 games and Pogba also has five assists. \u201cGood players make each other better,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. Stuart James \u2022 Match report: Leicester City 0-1 Manchester United 3) Don\u2019t write off Tottenham If people would only stop speculating about Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s future they could instead focus on his present: with Manchester City and Liverpool showing not only fallibility under pressure, Tottenham cannot yet be discounted from the title race. In their last three league games, they have beaten Fulham with a 93rd-minute goal, Watford with 80th and 87th-minute goals and Newcastle with an 83rd-minute goal, and the confidence inspired by such a run cannot be overstated \u2013 all the more so given the absence of Dele Alli and Harry Kane. If Spurs can maintain form until their fit and fresh return, they may yet spring a surprise \u2013 but only if Pochettino can devise a strategy for beating their direct competitors, both of whom have his team\u2019s number in head-to-head meetings. Daniel Harris \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle 4) Higua\u00edn and Hazard lift Sarri\u2019s spirits It is dangerous to read too much into a saunter past Huddersfield, but Maurizio Sarri will have seen encouraging evidence in periods of Chelsea\u2019s play. He cited Mateo Kovacic\u2019s involvement as Jorginho\u2019s replacement late on, a player \u201cclose to Jorginho in moving the ball very fast, one touch\u201d. He reintegrated Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the Premier League side after his latest bout of back trouble. And, above all, there were indications of understanding between Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. That pair provided four of the goals and combined 21 times. They appeared to be on the same wavelength. Games against Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur this month will test that relationship but Chelsea may now have an attacking partnership to inflict damage on the best. Dominic Fifield \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 5-0 Huddersfield 5) Almir\u00f3n sees size of creative challenge Newcastle played well in their 1-0 defeat at Tottenham. They kept their 5-4-1 shape, compressed the space, made it hard for the home side and threatened three times on the counterattack. It was a typical Rafael Ben\u00edtez performance in which he tried to optimise the attributes of the players at his disposal. But as the manager himself noted, his team had to be better on the ball. The dearth of creativity in central midfield was plain. This is where Miguel Almir\u00f3n comes in. The \u00a321m club-record signing from Atlanta United missed the game because his visa had not come through and, when he makes his debut at Wolves next week, there will be pressure on him to lift the aesthetic. But the attacking midfielder has not played since 8 December while the difference between the MLS and Premier League is seismic. Almir\u00f3n cannot be expected to transform things overnight. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Newcastle 6) Task of saving Fulham looks beyond Ranieri While winning the league with Leicester City meant Claudio Ranieri arrived at Craven Cottage with a reputation as a miracle worker, Fulham have seen little evidence of the Italian\u2019s supposed magical powers since appointing him in November. The side with the worst defensive record in the Premier League are just as naive at the back, brittle in midfield and wayward in attack as they were under Slavisa Jokanovic, who can be forgiven for feeling smug as he watches Ranieri struggle to perform wonders with a weird mess of a squad. Jokanovic\u2019s successor has picked up 12 points from his first 13 games and Fulham, the only team in the division without an away win, looked like they were waiting to be relegated during their defeat by Crystal Palace. With confidence ebbing away, consecutive home games against Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool are unlikely to lift the mood. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 Fulham 7) Wolves give Everton a footballing lesson Wolves gave Everton a beating and Evertonians many reasons for envy on Saturday. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s players were organised, committed, spirited and dangerous: everything Marco Silva\u2019s side were not as they slipped to a sixth defeat in nine Premier League games. In Conor Coady they possessed a defensive strength and discipline that was in stark contrast to the performance of Michael Keane. In Jo\u00e3o Moutinho they had the purpose and invention the home midfield failed to deliver but it was in attack where Everton, 19 months after the sale of Romelu Lukaku, were totally eclipsed by the quality of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. The Mexico striker led the line superbly and claimed his fourth goal in three games. His work-rate and contribution put the efforts of all of Everton\u2019s offensive players \u2013 Theo Walcott, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Cenk Tosun \u2013 to shame. Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Everton 1-3 Wolves 8) Hughton needs to stop the slide Chris Hughton may not be looking over his shoulder just yet but a fifth consecutive game without a win has seen his Brighton side drop perilously close to the relegation dogfight. Cardiff\u2019s victory means the Seagulls are only five points clear of trouble and having picked up only six points from their last 10 league games, the manager will be eager to stop the slide. They will have an immediate opportunity to do that on Saturday against Burnley after Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup replay with West Brom, although Hughton will be wary of Sean Dyche\u2019s side given their recent revival that has seen them clamber away from danger. Brighton have three more points than at this stage last season, when they ended up 15th, and should be confident of beating that position given they have home games against Huddersfield, Cardiff, Southampton, Bournemouth and Newcastle still to come. Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Brighton 0-0 Watford 9) Dyche looks forward to VAR \u201cNext season we\u2019ll have VAR, and that should be a help,\u201d Sean Dyche said after his side were finally awarded a penalty on a day they should have had two. After waiting since April 2017 the Burnley manager was relieved to be able to claim a point in stoppage time but understandably exasperated by the penalty Ashley Barnes was refused in the first half. What left him even more aghast was the fact Barnes was booked for simulation when he had clearly been knocked over by the goalkeeper. So clearly, in fact, that Anthony Taylor was probably the only person at Turf Moor who thought Barnes was trying to cheat. \u201cA terrible decision,\u201d Alan Shearer said on MOTD. Will VAR be of assistance? If referees are going to need replays to help with such judgment calls the games next season could be both long and unedifying. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Burnley 1-1 Southampton 10) Howe searches for consistency That Dominic Solanke had only one touch in the opposition box on his Bournemouth debut underlined a miserable weekend for Eddie Howe\u2019s side. Solanke, a \u00a319m signing from Liverpool last month, failed to impress in a team performance bereft of any zip, with Bournemouth badly missing the injured Callum Wilson and David Brooks, who is set to miss a month. They were off-colour in Cardiff, nowhere near meeting the benchmark they set after humbling Chelsea. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really good runs and performances where we have looked like the real deal and then a performance when we fell away from that,\u201d said Howe, whose side have lost five of their past eight games. \u201cIs it because the players are not good enough? No. So it can only be a mentality issue and that is something we have got to solve very quickly.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Cardiff 2-0 Bournemouth",

Although the supreme court has transmitted its hearings since 2009, photography and recording of court proceedings elsewhere are strictly controlled by the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which only permits cases in the court of appeal to be broadcast.

The scheme would be funded by the industry, which would be compelled to pay as a condition of their financial licences.</p> <p>But the proposal has already met with early scepticism. The Financial Services Council, a peak body, says it would not be possible unless \u201cthe underlying licensing system is strengthened to ensure licensees meet their obligations\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is critical that priority be given to addressing these issues before setting up a compensation scheme of last resort,\u201d the council said in a statement.</p> <p>Consumer advocacy groups \u2013 the Consumer Action Law Centre and Financial Rights Legal Centre \u2013 welcomed much of the report but criticised the commission for not going further in key areas affecting vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed that some recommendations did not go far enough, such as improving remedies for breaches of responsible lending law and banning junk products,\u201d Financial Rights Legal Centre chief executive, Karen Cox, said.</p> <p>The Financial Sector Union, which represents banking, finance, insurance and superannuation workers, said the changes were mostly \u201ccosmetic\u201d and would not produce systemic change.</p> <p>Hayne was widely expected to deliver tough recommendations after his royal commission exposed scandal after scandal, including billing the dead for financial advice, deliberately misleading regulators, lending to those with no capacity to repay, and the profit-motivated pushing of dodgy financial advice and insurance products. Hayne lay the blame for the misconduct directly at the feet of senior banking executives.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and those who managed and controlled those entities: their boards and senior management,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing that is said in this report should be understood as diminishing that responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, labelled the release of the final report as a \u201cdark day\u201d for the sector. He said Labor agreed to all recommendations in principle.</p> <p>\u201cBanks and financial institutions should work on an ethical basis,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThey should be strong. They should be profitable. They should be robust. They should be above all ethical. This is a sobering report. It\u2019s a report that is long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>The Business Council of Australia welcomed Hayne\u2019s recommendations as \u201ccommon-sense but far reaching\u201d, while the Australian Banking Association responded in much the same manner as recent months. ABA chief executive Anna Bligh admitted the sector had failed customers and pledged to do better.</p> <p>\u201cBanks understand that these failures have caused deep hurt, suffering and heartache for far too many customers and they\u2019re sorry for the pain they have caused,\u201d Bligh said.</p> <p>\u201cImportantly, banks accept full responsibilities for these failings and they know that they must now change to ensure that this never happens again. Banks are determined to learn the lessons, to fix the problems, and to make it right.\u201d</p> <p>Hayne also used the report to attack Australia\u2019s financial regulators as \u201cineffective\u201d, proposing what he described as a \u201cradical\u201d shake-up of Asic and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra).</p> <p>Hayne\u2019s recommendations would give them greater power and more incentive to take banks to court. The regulators would also be subject to a new independent oversight body. Hayne flagged the potential for Asic\u2019s role to be limited to one of investigation and referral, leaving court action to a new and separate \u201cspecialist civil enforcement agency\u201d. He stopped short of recommending such a body, and the Coalition has already ruled it out.</p> <p>Both Asic and Apra welcomed the recommendations and said they would set about considering how best to implement the changes. Apra signalled it would need additional resources to be able to operate in the way outlined by Hayne.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these improvements are already in train, and APRA is committed to delivering on them. APRA appreciates the Commission\u2019s acknowledgment that increasing the intensity of supervision will require additional resources,\u201d Apra chair Wayne Byers said.</p> <p>Hayne recommended 24 cases of misconduct be referred to the financial regulators for consideration of civil or criminal action. The referrals involve almost all of the major banks except Westpac.<strong> </strong>Asic says it has \u201cprioritised\u201d the cases, but would not comment in further detail.</p> <p>Hayne also revealed he wrote to the corporate regulator late last year to invite them to \u201cconsider whether criminal or other legal proceedings\u201d should be taken against unnamed banks involved in the fees-for-no-service scandal, in which customers were knowingly charged for financial advice they never received. AMP, ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac are already expected to pay $850m in remediation over the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cExamination of these issues by Asic is still continuing, and it would not be right for me to anticipate the outcome of those deliberations,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cNor would it be right for me now to name the entities I identified in my communication to Asic.\u201d</p> <p>Hayne said charging customers for financial advice that was never provided was motivated simply by \u201cgreed: greed by licensees, and greed by advisers\u201d. Individuals can be prosecuted, and the offences attract possible jail terms of 10 years.</p> <p>Hayne has recommended significant changes to prevent banks for charging fees for no service. Banks would be required to get consent from customers each year to charge them fees for services, and record in written form what those services are.</p> <p>Banks will better take into account the needs of customers in remote areas and those without English language skills, while a national mediation scheme will be set up to help farmers struggling to pay back loans.</p> <p>Retailers \u2013 car dealers, for example \u2013 are now likely to be subject to the nation\u2019s consumer credit laws, a change long called for by consumer advocates.</p> <p>Mortgage brokers also face a significant crackdown to improve standards and prevent misconduct. Hayne\u2019s recommendations would require them to act in the best interests of borrowers or face civil penalties. He has also recommended the customer pay the broker for arranging the loan, rather than the lender.</p> <p>Frydenberg has left the government some wiggle room on changes to end conflicted remuneration in the broking industry. Changes would only be implemented over stages and after careful consideration of the consequences on lending, Frydenberg said.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to understand these are major changes for an industry and for existing business models, and there needs to be transition periods,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Banking industry codes of conduct will be expanded to cover more financial service providers, and Asic would be given a greater role in approving and enforcing the codes.</p> <p>Remuneration for bank and lending staff would be overhauled, and Apra-regulated institutions would be required to change their bonus and remuneration structures to \u201cencourage sound management of non-financial risks, and to reduce the risk of misconduct\u201d. Boards would be required to regularly assess the effectiveness of their remuneration systems and set limits on the use of financial metrics for long-term bonuses.</p> <p>Financial advisers would be required to tell all retail customers \u201csimply and concisely why the adviser is not independent, impartial and unbiased\u201d.</p> <p>Providers of financial advice would be required to investigate misconduct where it is detected, before advising and remediating all those affected as soon as possible.

      "bodyText": "Some of Australia\u2019s biggest banks could face criminal prosecution over the shocking fee-for-no-service scandal as part of a sweeping response to the royal commission\u2019s damning final report. The much-anticipated report of commissioner Kenneth Hayne will precipitate widespread changes in the financial sector designed to beef up regulators, compensate victims, overhaul banking remuneration, end the unlawful and excessive charging of fees, encourage cultural reform and better protect vulnerable and disadvantaged customers. But critics have warned the royal commission has not gone far enough, and has failed to recommend major structural changes or take a stronger approach to individuals and banks that ought to be criminally prosecuted. The government has immediately agreed to act on all 76 of Hayne\u2019s recommendations, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, conceded that \u201cfrom today the sector must change, and change forever\u201d. A key plank of the government\u2019s response is to set up a compensation scheme of last resort to help victims of banking misconduct. The scheme would be funded by the industry, which would be compelled to pay as a condition of their financial licences. But the proposal has already met with early scepticism. The Financial Services Council, a peak body, says it would not be possible unless \u201cthe underlying licensing system is strengthened to ensure licensees meet their obligations\u201d. \u201cIt is critical that priority be given to addressing these issues before setting up a compensation scheme of last resort,\u201d the council said in a statement. Consumer advocacy groups \u2013 the Consumer Action Law Centre and Financial Rights Legal Centre \u2013 welcomed much of the report but criticised the commission for not going further in key areas affecting vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers. \u201cWe are disappointed that some recommendations did not go far enough, such as improving remedies for breaches of responsible lending law and banning junk products,\u201d Financial Rights Legal Centre chief executive, Karen Cox, said. The Financial Sector Union, which represents banking, finance, insurance and superannuation workers, said the changes were mostly \u201ccosmetic\u201d and would not produce systemic change. Hayne was widely expected to deliver tough recommendations after his royal commission exposed scandal after scandal, including billing the dead for financial advice, deliberately misleading regulators, lending to those with no capacity to repay, and the profit-motivated pushing of dodgy financial advice and insurance products. Hayne lay the blame for the misconduct directly at the feet of senior banking executives. \u201cThere can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned and those who managed and controlled those entities: their boards and senior management,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing that is said in this report should be understood as diminishing that responsibility.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, labelled the release of the final report as a \u201cdark day\u201d for the sector. He said Labor agreed to all recommendations in principle. \u201cBanks and financial institutions should work on an ethical basis,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThey should be strong. They should be profitable. They should be robust. They should be above all ethical. This is a sobering report. It\u2019s a report that is long overdue.\u201d The Business Council of Australia welcomed Hayne\u2019s recommendations as \u201ccommon-sense but far reaching\u201d, while the Australian Banking Association responded in much the same manner as recent months. ABA chief executive Anna Bligh admitted the sector had failed customers and pledged to do better. \u201cBanks understand that these failures have caused deep hurt, suffering and heartache for far too many customers and they\u2019re sorry for the pain they have caused,\u201d Bligh said. \u201cImportantly, banks accept full responsibilities for these failings and they know that they must now change to ensure that this never happens again. Banks are determined to learn the lessons, to fix the problems, and to make it right.\u201d Hayne also used the report to attack Australia\u2019s financial regulators as \u201cineffective\u201d, proposing what he described as a \u201cradical\u201d shake-up of Asic and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra). Hayne\u2019s recommendations would give them greater power and more incentive to take banks to court. The regulators would also be subject to a new independent oversight body. Hayne flagged the potential for Asic\u2019s role to be limited to one of investigation and referral, leaving court action to a new and separate \u201cspecialist civil enforcement agency\u201d. He stopped short of recommending such a body, and the Coalition has already ruled it out. Both Asic and Apra welcomed the recommendations and said they would set about considering how best to implement the changes. Apra signalled it would need additional resources to be able to operate in the way outlined by Hayne. \u201cMany of these improvements are already in train, and APRA is committed to delivering on them. APRA appreciates the Commission\u2019s acknowledgment that increasing the intensity of supervision will require additional resources,\u201d Apra chair Wayne Byers said. Hayne recommended 24 cases of misconduct be referred to the financial regulators for consideration of civil or criminal action. The referrals involve almost all of the major banks except Westpac. Asic says it has \u201cprioritised\u201d the cases, but would not comment in further detail. Hayne also revealed he wrote to the corporate regulator late last year to invite them to \u201cconsider whether criminal or other legal proceedings\u201d should be taken against unnamed banks involved in the fees-for-no-service scandal, in which customers were knowingly charged for financial advice they never received. AMP, ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac are already expected to pay $850m in remediation over the scandal. \u201cExamination of these issues by Asic is still continuing, and it would not be right for me to anticipate the outcome of those deliberations,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cNor would it be right for me now to name the entities I identified in my communication to Asic.\u201d Hayne said charging customers for financial advice that was never provided was motivated simply by \u201cgreed: greed by licensees, and greed by advisers\u201d. Individuals can be prosecuted, and the offences attract possible jail terms of 10 years. Hayne has recommended significant changes to prevent banks for charging fees for no service. Banks would be required to get consent from customers each year to charge them fees for services, and record in written form what those services are. Banks will better take into account the needs of customers in remote areas and those without English language skills, while a national mediation scheme will be set up to help farmers struggling to pay back loans. Retailers \u2013 car dealers, for example \u2013 are now likely to be subject to the nation\u2019s consumer credit laws, a change long called for by consumer advocates. Mortgage brokers also face a significant crackdown to improve standards and prevent misconduct. Hayne\u2019s recommendations would require them to act in the best interests of borrowers or face civil penalties. He has also recommended the customer pay the broker for arranging the loan, rather than the lender. Frydenberg has left the government some wiggle room on changes to end conflicted remuneration in the broking industry. Changes would only be implemented over stages and after careful consideration of the consequences on lending, Frydenberg said. \u201cYou have to understand these are major changes for an industry and for existing business models, and there needs to be transition periods,\u201d he said. Banking industry codes of conduct will be expanded to cover more financial service providers, and Asic would be given a greater role in approving and enforcing the codes. Remuneration for bank and lending staff would be overhauled, and Apra-regulated institutions would be required to change their bonus and remuneration structures to \u201cencourage sound management of non-financial risks, and to reduce the risk of misconduct\u201d. Boards would be required to regularly assess the effectiveness of their remuneration systems and set limits on the use of financial metrics for long-term bonuses. Financial advisers would be required to tell all retail customers \u201csimply and concisely why the adviser is not independent, impartial and unbiased\u201d. Providers of financial advice would be required to investigate misconduct where it is detected, before advising and remediating all those affected as soon as possible. A single, centralised disciplinary body would be established for advisers and all financial advisers would be required to register. Providers of financial advice would be compelled to report serious compliance concerns, and the body could also take reports of misconduct from clients and other stakeholders. A review of the changes to the financial advice sector has been flagged in three years. Asic and Apra, whose efforts to punish misconduct were found sorely wanting, face a raft of changes, including: \u2022 A requirement that Asic must, as a starting point, determine whether misconduct warrants court action. It should reduce its reliance on infringement notices for misconduct, because it is \u201crarely\u201d useful against wealthy corporations. \u2022 Asic and Apra must coordinate and share information more effectively. \u2022 Both agencies should be subjected to quadrennial capability reviews. Apra should undergo such a review as soon as possible. \u2022 A new oversight body should be established to scrutinise their effectiveness. The body would report to the minister biennially. \u2022 Hayne has flagged reducing Asic\u2019s role to purely investigative. In this scenario, which Hayne acknowledges is \u201cradical\u201d, Asic would simply investigate misconduct, before referring it to a specialist independent enforcement agency, which would then take court action. \u201cMisconduct will be deterred only if entities believe that misconduct will be detected, denounced and justly punished,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cMisconduct, especially misconduct that yields profit, is not deterred by requiring those who are found to have done wrong to do no more than pay compensation.

By 2050, Chengdu will be home to what local officials say will be the world\u2019s largest network of paths for people to walk or bike. The Tianfu Greenway is planned to stretch 16,900km around the city, and will be linked to hundreds of parks, gardens and protected \u201cecological zones\u201d, enveloping Chengdu in one massive garden. Some 1,585km had been completed by August last year.</p> \n<p>Existing parks will be expanded. Highways, flyovers and bridges will be \u201cgreened\u201d with flowers and plants. One of the new parks, the Longquan City Forest Park to the east of Chengdu, will be among the world\u2019s largest, spanning an area of 1,275 sq km when it is completed in 2035.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd2c6e684450aab95bc25681500fab10a61a362f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2c6e684450aab95bc25681500fab10a61a362f/0_51_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tianfu New District masterplan, Chengdu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tianfu New District masterplan, Chengdu.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Smith/Gordon Gill Architecture</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Officials are also trying to preserve the rural outskirts of Chengdu.

For much of the city\u2019s 2,000-year history as an administrative and agricultural capital surrounded by good land, Chengdu thrived in relative isolation in China\u2019s hinterlands. Over the last two decades, though, it has experienced a burst of rapid growth, fuelled by Beijing\u2019s \u201cGo West\u201d policy encouraging development in interior cities. In 1998 the city was home to 4.2 million people, according to United Nations estimates. With migrants pouring in from other parts of the province, that figure is now 8.8 million, and the latest UN forecasts predict more than 10 million will live in the urban agglomeration by 2026. Official Chinese data, which tends to include rural areas too, puts the current population at 16 million. To deal with that growth, Chengdu city planners have made environmental protection a focus. Some liken the programme to England\u2019s garden city movement, which emerged in the 1890s to counteract urban crowding and pollution. Local people take tea in a temple garden in Chengdu.

Also living here are my husband and my son (who are not named as joint owners).</p> <p>My parents haven\u2019t got wills. What happens to my home if I\u2019m still living here when they die?

Do I have to buy him out?<br><strong>JS</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It depends how you and your parents jointly own the property. If you are all joint tenants, when one joint owner dies, the property automatically belongs to the two remaining joint owners and then passes automatically to whoever is left when the second joint owner dies. So if your mother dies, the house goes to you and your father and then to you when he dies. If you are joint tenants, the fact that your parents don\u2019t have wills makes no difference to what happens to the house if either of them dies.</p> <p>If, however, you and your parents own the house as tenants in common, the property doesn\u2019t automatically pass to whoever survives on the death of one joint owner.

      "bodyText": "Q I own my home with my parents. It\u2019s jointly owned between me, my mother and my father. Also living here are my husband and my son (who are not named as joint owners). My parents haven\u2019t got wills. What happens to my home if I\u2019m still living here when they die? Does the property automatically come to me or does it go to probate? Also if they were to do wills and maybe, for example, leave their share to my son, what happens then? Do I have to buy him out? JS A It depends how you and your parents jointly own the property. If you are all joint tenants, when one joint owner dies, the property automatically belongs to the two remaining joint owners and then passes automatically to whoever is left when the second joint owner dies. So if your mother dies, the house goes to you and your father and then to you when he dies. If you are joint tenants, the fact that your parents don\u2019t have wills makes no difference to what happens to the house if either of them dies. If, however, you and your parents own the house as tenants in common, the property doesn\u2019t automatically pass to whoever survives on the death of one joint owner. As tenants in common, you each own a distinct share in the property which can be left as a gift in a will (something which can\u2019t be done if you own property as joint tenants). If a tenant in common dies, his or her share in the property makes up part of his or her estate. Where there is no will, who gets what is decided by the intestacy rules. In England and Wales, on the death of a spouse or civil partner, the survivor of the couple keeps everything \u2013 including the share in the property along with savings and investments \u2013 up to \u00a3250,000 and a half share of anything left over. The other half is shared out between the couple\u2019s children. If your parents do decide to make wills \u2013 and assuming you are tenants in common \u2013 they can each leave their share in the house to whoever they like.

      "bodyText": "It looks like a normal bathroom tile. But when amateur internet sleuths managed to locate it, they found the missing piece in an international child abuse investigation. This was one of the clues that led to the arrest of a suspect and the identification of nine child abuse victims. There\u2019s nothing new about the police asking for tips \u2013 think missing person posters or episodes of Crimewatch. But the Trace an Object crowdsourcing effort launched by Europol in 2017 asks individuals and collectives to find clues for unsolved child abuse investigations by identifying parts of digital images. It could be a slice of cheese that someone recognises as Belgian, a crumpled shopping bag or a brightly coloured child\u2019s duvet cover: it just needs a moment of recognition \u2013 human or digital \u2013 to fill in the gaps that lead police to a suspect or a victim. The pictures Europol posts online are drawn from a grim stash of 30m images of child sexual exploitation, which are often circulating on the dark web. Steven Wilson, the head of the agency\u2019s European cybercrime centre, said that some are linked to crimes happening now and others document abuse from decades ago. Wilson said: \u201cIn the cases we deal with here, we have done as much as we can with law enforcement and this is a final throw of the dice. \u201cIn most cases, we are trying to identify a location and the eyes of the world can look at something that you can\u2019t possibly replicate, even by online analysis.

      "body": "<h2>How not to worry about\u2026 Relationships</h2> <p>By Kate Thompson</p> <p><strong>Do sweat the small stuff: </strong>Everyday stresses \u2013 who takes the rubbish out, who does the school run \u2013 can affect couples. These may seem trivial compared with more significant hurdles (moving house, losing a job or the death of a parent), but research shows that how a couple manages these smaller stresses massively affects how they cope with bigger ones. Notice how you are feeling \u2013 overburdened? neglected? \u2013 and, rather than store these feelings up, talk to your partner about it. If you\u2019re on the receiving end, listen, ask questions, and try to understand the other person\u2019s perspective. Being understood helps the \u201csufferer\u201d feel less alone, and a couple feel more intimate. Couples I work with as a therapist, even those in long-term relationships, are often surprised at how the other person is feeling.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Share the load: </strong>Remember, major stress can affect both parties: if one person loses a job, for example, the other may feel added pressure or mourn their partner\u2019s loss of status. It can help to think of relationship strains as a \u201cwe\u201d problem \u2013 \u201chow can we tackle this?\u201d \u2013 rather than one individual shouldering the burden alone. Partners sometimes block each other from attempting change, taking the role of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and believing it\u2019s safer to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d. For the tired parent who complains about doing bathtime, what might they miss without that reconnection with the children at the end of the day? Or can the partner who resents doing the weekly shop tolerate groceries they wouldn\u2019t choose? A couple needs to arrive at a \u201cgood enough\u201d solution that meets both their needs.</p> <p><strong>Communicate: </strong>Difficulties often start with a breakdown in communication. Partners in distress stop sharing their thoughts, their minds swamped by hurts and fears that build up in shared lives. Don\u2019t suffer alone: you need to talk. Confronting things can lead to a renewed sense of closeness and a lessening of stress; confrontation doesn\u2019t have to mean raised voices and a loss of control. Do it with a spirit of curiosity \u2013 not at 11.30pm after a few glasses of wine, or to \u201cout\u201d who you think has got it wrong \u2013 and you\u2019ll discover that your relationship can be a tremendous resource against day-to-day difficulties.</p> <p><em>Kate Thompson is a couple psychoanalytic psychotherapist and clinical lecturer at <a href=\"https://tavistockrelationships.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sriBRD-ARIsABYdwwHtaQJrRwIw4gWgk2JRAwFtFYsbhKM_kcMNmcBlmH07goSrKT4TuugaAmpVEALw_wcB\">Tavistock Relationships</a></em></p> <h2>How not to worry about\u2026 Work</h2> <p>by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/mar/07/women-who-founder-otegha-uwagba-ive-been-treated-differently-being-outspoken-you-get-that\">Otegha Uwagba</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34cd9a93becccb743cf1be177a5c709cdaf8e4dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34cd9a93becccb743cf1be177a5c709cdaf8e4dd/451_103_752_752/500.jpg\" alt=\"Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Don\u2019t be a martyr: </strong>Ask for help. If you\u2019re feeling genuinely overwhelmed, speak to your manager about solutions that might alleviate your stress, whether that means removing a project from your workload or getting more support from your colleagues.</p> <p><strong>Prioritise: </strong>Take a long hard look at your to-do list \u2013 is there anything you can do to make it more manageable? Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether.</p> <p><strong>Break it up: </strong>An eight-hour (or longer) working day without any proper breaks is a recipe for disaster. Aim for shorter periods of focused activity interspersed with regular breaks \u2013 and never skip lunch, away from your desk.</p> <p><strong>Talk it out: </strong>Find a friend or colleague you trust to talk through your problems. A fresh perspective might help.</p> <p><strong>Say \u2018no\u2019 more often: </strong>Stretching yourself too thin in a bid to accommodate every request is a surefire way to escalate your stress levels. Don\u2019t let your inner people-pleaser trick you into overcommitting to work at the expense of your own sense of calm.</p> <p><strong>Establish email boundaries: </strong>The expectation that we respond to work emails even when we\u2019re not technically \u201con the clock\u201d is a blight of modern working culture. Try to pull back, gradually \u2013 start by not checking your emails at all on Saturdays and work your way up, until you\u2019re rarely checking your emails outside of work hours.</p> <p><strong>Evaluate your environment: </strong>Maybe it\u2019s them, not you. Some workplaces are just toxic environments, and instead of tying yourself in knots trying to make things work, sometimes it\u2019s best to just ... bow out. It might be time to start looking for a job elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Treat yourself:</strong> Don\u2019t forget to reward yourself for a job well done. Whether it\u2019s a long bath, a slap-up meal or a spot of retail therapy, never underestimate the power of some straight-up indulgence to boost your spirits and rejuvenate the soul.</p> <p><em>Otegha Uwagba is the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Black-Book-Sunday-bestseller/dp/0008245118\">Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women published by HarperCollins (\u00a36.99)</a></em></p> <h2>How not to worry about\u2026 Family</h2> <p>By Dr Reenee Singh</p> <p><strong>Create rituals: </strong>Family stress often follows change, which falls roughly into two types: the normal life cycles we all face \u2013 a new job, a baby, a house move, the death of an elderly parent, a child starting school \u2013 and unexpected change, such as a job loss, illness, or diagnosis of a mental health condition. For the former, it helps to create rituals around these life-cycle stages, to make the transition easier and acknowledge the change (depending on your cultural or religious background, you may have these already, such as bar and batmitzvahs). These could include a graduation dinner, a housewarming party or retirement party. Unexpected changes are harder to navigate because the family hasn\u2019t evolved a way of coping with them. <br> In these cases, it may help to talk to someone \u2013 a family friend, a community elder, or a professional.</p> <p><strong>Prioritise family time: </strong>Set aside time together as a family. Any shared activity is good: board games; eating together at least three times a week, without screens at the table; watching a film; even car journeys, if you have one. I often suggest parents spend one-on-one time with different children too, to create opportunities for conversations about their school lives and friendships.</p> <p><strong>Realise you\u2019re all in it together: </strong>In family therapy, there is usually one person whom everyone is most concerned about at any one time, but it\u2019s important not to blame an individual for a family breakdown. Try to separate the person from the problem: for example, a family may feel they have a \u201cnaughty child\u201d, so create a name or character for the \u201cnaughtiness\u201d \u2013 Horrid Henry, say \u2013 and keep a record of every time your child let\u2019s him get the better of them. This can also help the family realise that the symptom may be present in every family member. Focusing on one \u201cproblem\u201d person in the family can also obscure another problem \u2013 for example, parents may discover they have issues in their own relationship.</p> <p><strong>Avoid the blame game: </strong>It\u2019s helpful to distinguish between blame and responsibility: everyone in a family has to take responsibility for behaviour that is problematic, and help to do things different in the future.</p> <p><em>Dr Reenee Singh is chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.aft.org.uk/view/index.html\">Association of Family Therapy</a></em></p> <h2>How not to worry about\u2026 Money</h2> <p>By Rupert Jones</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e3481e378f84200d96d440a40acbf4f65e9f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e3481e378f84200d96d440a40acbf4f65e9f0c/325_0_1004_1004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Money Panel composite with Getty imagery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t dwell on financial mistakes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Live in the now: </strong>Try not to get too hung up on what may or may not happen to your finances over the long term, such as how you\u2019re ever going to pay off your student debt, or whether you will ever get on the housing ladder. Similarly, don\u2019t dwell on financial mistakes you may have made in the past and that you probably now can\u2019t do anything about. They can seem mammoth and insurmountable. The fact is, focusing on what you\u2019re spending right now is the best way to protect your financial future.</p> <p><strong>Be honest with yourself: </strong>Carry out an audit of your income, expenditure and debts. Look at what you spend on the essentials and the basics, such as your mortgage or energy bills. You may well be able to cut your costs by switching to another provider (many services now offer to do this automatically for you).</p> <p>Facing up to the reality of your finances, and exercising some control over them will boost your confidence. Happily, there are a string of smartphone apps that can do some of the legwork for you \u2013 and the new breed of digital current accounts such as <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\">Monzo</a> and <a href=\"https://loot.io/\">Loot</a> are all simple to use and typically let you set daily/weekly/monthly budgets, analyse your spending and create savings goals.</p> <p><strong>Face the facts and figures: </strong>Don\u2019t ignore letters, calls and emails. This will just make things worse, so take a deep breath and sort through that pile of letters that you\u2019ve been trying to pretend don\u2019t exist. If you are sweating over a money problem, talking to family members or friends might produce useful advice or a solution.</p> <p><strong>Get help: </strong>There are many sources of free impartial advice. Several organisations can put you in touch with a debt counsellor who can help you come up with a repayment strategy.

These may seem trivial compared with more significant hurdles (moving house, losing a job or the death of a parent), but research shows that how a couple manages these smaller stresses massively affects how they cope with bigger ones. Notice how you are feeling \u2013 overburdened? neglected? \u2013 and, rather than store these feelings up, talk to your partner about it. If you\u2019re on the receiving end, listen, ask questions, and try to understand the other person\u2019s perspective. Being understood helps the \u201csufferer\u201d feel less alone, and a couple feel more intimate. Couples I work with as a therapist, even those in long-term relationships, are often surprised at how the other person is feeling.\u201d Share the load: Remember, major stress can affect both parties: if one person loses a job, for example, the other may feel added pressure or mourn their partner\u2019s loss of status. It can help to think of relationship strains as a \u201cwe\u201d problem \u2013 \u201chow can we tackle this?\u201d \u2013 rather than one individual shouldering the burden alone. Partners sometimes block each other from attempting change, taking the role of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and believing it\u2019s safer to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d. For the tired parent who complains about doing bathtime, what might they miss without that reconnection with the children at the end of the day? Or can the partner who resents doing the weekly shop tolerate groceries they wouldn\u2019t choose? A couple needs to arrive at a \u201cgood enough\u201d solution that meets both their needs. Communicate: Difficulties often start with a breakdown in communication. Partners in distress stop sharing their thoughts, their minds swamped by hurts and fears that build up in shared lives. Don\u2019t suffer alone: you need to talk. Confronting things can lead to a renewed sense of closeness and a lessening of stress; confrontation doesn\u2019t have to mean raised voices and a loss of control. Do it with a spirit of curiosity \u2013 not at 11.30pm after a few glasses of wine, or to \u201cout\u201d who you think has got it wrong \u2013 and you\u2019ll discover that your relationship can be a tremendous resource against day-to-day difficulties. Kate Thompson is a couple psychoanalytic psychotherapist and clinical lecturer at Tavistock Relationships How not to worry about\u2026 Work by Otegha Uwagba Don\u2019t be a martyr: Ask for help. If you\u2019re feeling genuinely overwhelmed, speak to your manager about solutions that might alleviate your stress, whether that means removing a project from your workload or getting more support from your colleagues. Prioritise: Take a long hard look at your to-do list \u2013 is there anything you can do to make it more manageable? Be ruthless in figuring out what you can delay, delegate, or skip altogether. Break it up: An eight-hour (or longer) working day without any proper breaks is a recipe for disaster. Aim for shorter periods of focused activity interspersed with regular breaks \u2013 and never skip lunch, away from your desk. Talk it out: Find a friend or colleague you trust to talk through your problems. A fresh perspective might help. Say \u2018no\u2019 more often: Stretching yourself too thin in a bid to accommodate every request is a surefire way to escalate your stress levels. Don\u2019t let your inner people-pleaser trick you into overcommitting to work at the expense of your own sense of calm. Establish email boundaries: The expectation that we respond to work emails even when we\u2019re not technically \u201con the clock\u201d is a blight of modern working culture. Try to pull back, gradually \u2013 start by not checking your emails at all on Saturdays and work your way up, until you\u2019re rarely checking your emails outside of work hours. Evaluate your environment: Maybe it\u2019s them, not you. Some workplaces are just toxic environments, and instead of tying yourself in knots trying to make things work, sometimes it\u2019s best to just ... bow out. It might be time to start looking for a job elsewhere. Treat yourself: Don\u2019t forget to reward yourself for a job well done. Whether it\u2019s a long bath, a slap-up meal or a spot of retail therapy, never underestimate the power of some straight-up indulgence to boost your spirits and rejuvenate the soul. Otegha Uwagba is the author of Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women published by HarperCollins (\u00a36.99) How not to worry about\u2026 Family By Dr Reenee Singh Create rituals: Family stress often follows change, which falls roughly into two types: the normal life cycles we all face \u2013 a new job, a baby, a house move, the death of an elderly parent, a child starting school \u2013 and unexpected change, such as a job loss, illness, or diagnosis of a mental health condition. For the former, it helps to create rituals around these life-cycle stages, to make the transition easier and acknowledge the change (depending on your cultural or religious background, you may have these already, such as bar and batmitzvahs). These could include a graduation dinner, a housewarming party or retirement party. Unexpected changes are harder to navigate because the family hasn\u2019t evolved a way of coping with them. In these cases, it may help to talk to someone \u2013 a family friend, a community elder, or a professional. Prioritise family time: Set aside time together as a family. Any shared activity is good: board games; eating together at least three times a week, without screens at the table; watching a film; even car journeys, if you have one. I often suggest parents spend one-on-one time with different children too, to create opportunities for conversations about their school lives and friendships. Realise you\u2019re all in it together: In family therapy, there is usually one person whom everyone is most concerned about at any one time, but it\u2019s important not to blame an individual for a family breakdown. Try to separate the person from the problem: for example, a family may feel they have a \u201cnaughty child\u201d, so create a name or character for the \u201cnaughtiness\u201d \u2013 Horrid Henry, say \u2013 and keep a record of every time your child let\u2019s him get the better of them. This can also help the family realise that the symptom may be present in every family member. Focusing on one \u201cproblem\u201d person in the family can also obscure another problem \u2013 for example, parents may discover they have issues in their own relationship. Avoid the blame game: It\u2019s helpful to distinguish between blame and responsibility: everyone in a family has to take responsibility for behaviour that is problematic, and help to do things different in the future. Dr Reenee Singh is chief executive of the Association of Family Therapy How not to worry about\u2026 Money By Rupert Jones Live in the now: Try not to get too hung up on what may or may not happen to your finances over the long term, such as how you\u2019re ever going to pay off your student debt, or whether you will ever get on the housing ladder. Similarly, don\u2019t dwell on financial mistakes you may have made in the past and that you probably now can\u2019t do anything about. They can seem mammoth and insurmountable. The fact is, focusing on what you\u2019re spending right now is the best way to protect your financial future. Be honest with yourself: Carry out an audit of your income, expenditure and debts. Look at what you spend on the essentials and the basics, such as your mortgage or energy bills. You may well be able to cut your costs by switching to another provider (many services now offer to do this automatically for you). Facing up to the reality of your finances, and exercising some control over them will boost your confidence. Happily, there are a string of smartphone apps that can do some of the legwork for you \u2013 and the new breed of digital current accounts such as Monzo and Loot are all simple to use and typically let you set daily/weekly/monthly budgets, analyse your spending and create savings goals. Face the facts and figures: Don\u2019t ignore letters, calls and emails. This will just make things worse, so take a deep breath and sort through that pile of letters that you\u2019ve been trying to pretend don\u2019t exist. If you are sweating over a money problem, talking to family members or friends might produce useful advice or a solution. Get help: There are many sources of free impartial advice. Several organisations can put you in touch with a debt counsellor who can help you come up with a repayment strategy. Try National Debtline, StepChange Debt Charity and PayPlan.

He cut her down using his work knife, rang for an ambulance, and then sat alone with her body and waited. Tricia, 46, had run the family farm with him, despite her frequent bouts of depression, bipolar disorder and psychosis. Catherine Simpson\u2019s tormented, riveting and bleakly funny memoir analyses her sister\u2019s life to try to find out why she killed herself; in the process it becomes a moving evocation of the muck-spattered realities of modern farm life.</p> <p>The family had owned New House Farm since 1925. When Catherine and her two sisters were growing up there in the 70s and 80s, the farm was full of local relatives and eccentric friends such as Fred the Dead, a much-loved, if unpleasant-smelling, knacker man. The girls\u2019 childhoods were mostly outdoorsy and idyllic, though less taken up with romping through meadows than staging barnyard versions of Miss World competitions and fashion shows.</p> <p>In the house, however, it was a different story. Here the Simpsons never conversed, indeed barely spoke at all, intimidated into nervy quietness by a mean-spirited mother who \u201cused silence as a weapon\u201d and put-downs to avoid the obligations to express emotion. \u201cChatting,\u201d writes Simpson, \u201cwas not a concept I was familiar with until I began to visit other families, where I realised, fascinated, that they asked questions and other people answered.\u201d</p> <p>For much of the book Mrs Simpson, a northern matriarch who might have been created by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett\" title=\"\">Alan Bennett</a> for a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/08/reece-shearsmith-league-of-gentlemen-interview\" title=\"\">League of Gentlemen</a></em> spin-off, is portrayed as so extreme a character as to be almost comic, but there are darker implications.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simpson is unafraid to plait the pastoral with the darker aspects of country life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As adults, Catherine and her elder sister, Elizabeth, moved away for work, and Tricia, after travelling for a few years, returned to the farm. Her behaviour had been erratic since she was eight, but now she increasingly sought out conflict, accused friends of betrayal and lapsed into self-pity; her parents, though, simply refused to discuss or even acknowledge the problem, even when she began locking them in the house to protect them from imagined predators. Taciturnity, a comic staple of rural memoirs, here becomes toxic and tragic as Tricia\u2019s problems became worse. Her fatal decline and temporary incarcerations in a failing health system make for heart-rending reading.</p> <p>Simpson, who started the book after her mother died in 2006, tells the story partly by scrutinising the private diaries Tricia kept intermittently throughout her life, reasoning \u201cthat it was better to write about Tricia and memorialise her honestly than fall back on the old habit of staying silent\u201d. In the diaries we find Tricia drafting her first suicide note aged about 14, experiencing a psychic \u201cvisitation\u201d from a dying cousin, and plaintively wishing \u201cI could be who I want to be\u201d; we also see her taking solace in animals and nature. Tricia dreams of horses and cats, and writes with a roughly poetic turn of phrase about the farm (keeping her dog beside her on a moving quad bike is \u201clike balancing a bag of ferrets on a seesaw\u201d). The seasonal and daily routines seem to have helped her retain some stability; it was after the sale of the farm\u2019s milk cows in 2005, when she became too ill and her father too old, to look after them, that she was prescribed her first anti-psychotic medication.</p> <p>In a way, the real memorial for Tricia is the compassionate and beadily observed account of the Lancashire landscape. Simpson is unafraid to plait the pastoral with the darker aspects of country life: she does not hide the ugly accoutrements of intensive farming, such as pig farrowing crates, and she shows how flashers and gropers sometimes took advantage of all three sisters when travelling alone in open country. That honesty underwrites what should be an enduring addition to writing about both mental illness and rural England. It would be something of a spoiler to say whether or not she finds a reason for her sister\u2019s suicide, but less so to report that she appears to gradually understand and forgive her parents\u2019 silences. \u201cHow simple it seems, the idea of sitting down and talking,\u201d she reflects, \u201cbut it was not simple, it was very complicated.\u201d That she resolves to write and \u201cleave behind a lifetime of silence\u201d can only be our gain, and dour rural taciturnity\u2019s loss.</p> <p><em>Richard Benson is the author of The Farm: The Story of One Family and the English Countryside.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 When I Had a Little Sister: The Story of a Farming Family Who Never Spoke </em>by Catherine Simpson is published by 4th Estate (\u00a314.99).

We received part of the order on 2 December after a great deal of chasing. But our daughter had arrived a week earlier, so we could not set up her nursery. I was left scrambling to arrange for someone to be in to collect the order and set up the nursery, whilst recovering from a caesarian section. Thirty emails later we are still waiting for the mattress and sheets for the mini cot, which we have only been able to use for storage. MoKee\u2019s customer service team sounds like a broken record, repeatedly saying the order will be dispatched \u201cat some point in the next week\u201d. It\u2019s all been stressful at what should have been a special time. Months of delay is simply unacceptable \u2013 babies don\u2019t wait (and grow quickly)! EB, Brighton, East Sussex The trendy Scandi-style brand admits it has been a victim of its own success as a small startup with only a small team. Its founder and chief executive, Sam Serra, has personally apologised to you and others also facing delays at a critical time (close to birth). Your outstanding goods have been delivered, and the waterproof sheets changed for a superior version in order to ship faster. Serra told us: \u201cWe are extremely happy to see the sales increasing. It is, however, extremely challenging to adjust the production process in such a short time. We\u2019ve been doing our best \u2013 offering part shipment for free or changing ordered products for ones in stock. However, customers are sometimes facing delays. \u201cWhile we are very disappointed and sorry every time we fail to deliver on time: we know there are thousands of parents in the UK that love the brand and have had a positive experience. Now we have to make sure we can deliver this to all of our customers. We apologise to EB for her experience and hope to do better in the future.\u201d We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "body": "<p>One of the more unexpected political double-acts in parliament has resumed action, with Robert Hayward and Conor McGinn pushing ahead with their joint campaign to have equal marriage extended to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Lord Hayward, a Tory peer, and McGinn, a Labour MP, are at the forefront of seeking change for the one part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still excluded. Late last year, they were named <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/10/17/pinknews-awards-2018-politician-of-the-year-conor-mcginn-lord-hayward/\">politicians of the year</a> at the Pink News Awards.</p> <p>While ministers have expressed sympathy, they say the change can only be made by the Stormont assembly, which has been suspended after two years of political deadlock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/northern-ireland-same-sex-marriage-equality\">It\u2019s time to make Northern Ireland allow same-sex marriage | Conor McGinn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hayward and McGinn have sought to use parliamentary guerrilla tactics, tabling parallel private members\u2019 bills and raising the issue whenever possible. On Friday, Hayward used a debate in the Lords on <a href=\"https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/civilpartnershipsmarriagesanddeathsregistrationetc.html\">extending civil partnerships</a> to table an amendment on equal marriage.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot go on for ever saying that we cannot take action and it has to be left in the hands of Northern Ireland,\u201d said Hayward, a former Conservative MP and business executive who entered the Lords in 2015.</p> <p>One of the many notable features of their partnership is that it happened largely by accident. When Hayward and McGinn initially drew up their private members\u2019 bills they initially had no idea what the other was up to.</p> <p>In a joint interview in McGinn\u2019s Commons office, Hayward said it began when he sought advice on his bill from parliamentary clerks: \u201cSuddenly one of them said to me: \u2018Do you know that there\u2019s a Labour MP pursuing this as well?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They joined forces to begin an energetic campaign that has won them admiration and praise. When McGinn and Hayward received their Pink News award they were introduced as the \u201codd couple\u201d of LGBT rights, something that greatly amuses them both.</p> <p>McGinn is a Catholic, and married with children. Hayward is a long-time LGBT campaigner, and co-founder of pioneering gay rugby union club the King\u2019s Cross Steelers. \u201cHe\u2019s a practising Catholic, I\u2019m a practising homosexual,\u201d Hayward says. McGinn said: \u201cYou know there\u2019s a lot of crossover between these people?\u201d</p> <p>The duo nonetheless stress that their different perspectives illustrate the universal nature of the subject, and how they believe the law must catch up with a fundamentally changed world.</p> <p>McGinn, who comes from Northern Ireland but represents St Helens North in the Commons, remembers how one man in his home region, when asked about equal marriage, dolefully remarked: \u201cThey\u2019re as entitled to be as miserable as the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe point is that if they\u2019re making jokes about it in a village in south Armagh, it\u2019s part of society like anything else, like football or their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>McGinn said he was introduced to the subject by married Northern Irish friends who lived elsewhere and were distraught that their status was not recognised at home.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about being able to stand up in a place like this, and if a kid in Northern Ireland who\u2019s struggling with their sexuality or being bullied at school says: \u2018Well, you know what, at least we\u2019ve got somebody on our side, who\u2019s telling me that it\u2019s all right to be what I am.\u2019 It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hayward, who became engaged with the issue via King\u2019s Cross Steelers players originally from Northern Ireland, accepts that their bills have almost no chance of becoming law without official help: \u201cWe\u2019re both at the back of the queue. I\u2019m 42nd on the list.\u201d</p> <p>The focus is therefore, he said, on finding other opportunities to bring up the subject, such as Friday\u2019s amendment. Hayward won support from a series of peers but withdrew the plan after the equalities minister, Susan Williams, said that while she had \u201cconsiderable sympathy\u201d for the cause it remained a devolved matter.</p> <p>McGinn stresses that while the pair are not \u201cnaive about the political sensitivities\u201d, the deadlock is frustrating, especially when polling shows overwhelming local support for change.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re both talking to the government, and the secretary of state has said she\u2019s supportive of equal marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is it\u2019s two years since the assembly failed and people don\u2019t see any prospect of it coming back, certainly in the short to medium term. They\u2019re just a bit fed up.\u201d</p> <p>But in a period of otherwise often bitter political and cultural splits in parliament, both recognise that their campaign is cheering to many.

      "bodyText": "One of the more unexpected political double-acts in parliament has resumed action, with Robert Hayward and Conor McGinn pushing ahead with their joint campaign to have equal marriage extended to Northern Ireland. Lord Hayward, a Tory peer, and McGinn, a Labour MP, are at the forefront of seeking change for the one part of the UK where same-sex marriage is still excluded. Late last year, they were named politicians of the year at the Pink News Awards. While ministers have expressed sympathy, they say the change can only be made by the Stormont assembly, which has been suspended after two years of political deadlock. Hayward and McGinn have sought to use parliamentary guerrilla tactics, tabling parallel private members\u2019 bills and raising the issue whenever possible. On Friday, Hayward used a debate in the Lords on extending civil partnerships to table an amendment on equal marriage. \u201cWe cannot go on for ever saying that we cannot take action and it has to be left in the hands of Northern Ireland,\u201d said Hayward, a former Conservative MP and business executive who entered the Lords in 2015. One of the many notable features of their partnership is that it happened largely by accident. When Hayward and McGinn initially drew up their private members\u2019 bills they initially had no idea what the other was up to. In a joint interview in McGinn\u2019s Commons office, Hayward said it began when he sought advice on his bill from parliamentary clerks: \u201cSuddenly one of them said to me: \u2018Do you know that there\u2019s a Labour MP pursuing this as well?\u2019\u201d They joined forces to begin an energetic campaign that has won them admiration and praise. When McGinn and Hayward received their Pink News award they were introduced as the \u201codd couple\u201d of LGBT rights, something that greatly amuses them both. McGinn is a Catholic, and married with children. Hayward is a long-time LGBT campaigner, and co-founder of pioneering gay rugby union club the King\u2019s Cross Steelers. \u201cHe\u2019s a practising Catholic, I\u2019m a practising homosexual,\u201d Hayward says. McGinn said: \u201cYou know there\u2019s a lot of crossover between these people?\u201d The duo nonetheless stress that their different perspectives illustrate the universal nature of the subject, and how they believe the law must catch up with a fundamentally changed world. McGinn, who comes from Northern Ireland but represents St Helens North in the Commons, remembers how one man in his home region, when asked about equal marriage, dolefully remarked: \u201cThey\u2019re as entitled to be as miserable as the rest of us.\u201d He said: \u201cThe point is that if they\u2019re making jokes about it in a village in south Armagh, it\u2019s part of society like anything else, like football or their jobs.\u201d McGinn said he was introduced to the subject by married Northern Irish friends who lived elsewhere and were distraught that their status was not recognised at home. \u201cIt\u2019s also about being able to stand up in a place like this, and if a kid in Northern Ireland who\u2019s struggling with their sexuality or being bullied at school says: \u2018Well, you know what, at least we\u2019ve got somebody on our side, who\u2019s telling me that it\u2019s all right to be what I am.\u2019 It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he says. Hayward, who became engaged with the issue via King\u2019s Cross Steelers players originally from Northern Ireland, accepts that their bills have almost no chance of becoming law without official help: \u201cWe\u2019re both at the back of the queue. I\u2019m 42nd on the list.\u201d The focus is therefore, he said, on finding other opportunities to bring up the subject, such as Friday\u2019s amendment. Hayward won support from a series of peers but withdrew the plan after the equalities minister, Susan Williams, said that while she had \u201cconsiderable sympathy\u201d for the cause it remained a devolved matter. McGinn stresses that while the pair are not \u201cnaive about the political sensitivities\u201d, the deadlock is frustrating, especially when polling shows overwhelming local support for change. \u201cWe\u2019re both talking to the government, and the secretary of state has said she\u2019s supportive of equal marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is it\u2019s two years since the assembly failed and people don\u2019t see any prospect of it coming back, certainly in the short to medium term. They\u2019re just a bit fed up.\u201d But in a period of otherwise often bitter political and cultural splits in parliament, both recognise that their campaign is cheering to many. Hayward says: \u201cWe are divided on other matters, divided on the houses we\u2019re in, but we can work together so closely on this.\u201d McGinn said there were other, more unexpected benefits. \u201cI\u2019m told there are certain pubs in Belfast I will never have to buy a drink in again.\u201d He adds, deadpan: \u201cThat\u2019s no good to me whatsoever.\u201d",

His dad is a tailor, who before the conflict ran a newborn clothing business.</p> <p>In 2012, the fighting broke out and life for Alsaker changed irreversibly. Explosions, burnt-out cars, and gunfire became a daily occurrence for him and his family.</p> <p>Soon, checkpoints started appearing every 100 metres all over the city. Whenever Alsaker wanted to go out, to work, to study, to visit a friend, a soldier would ask for ID.</p> <p>The abuse from soldiers became overwhelming. Alsaker recalls being ordered into a small mobile unit in the middle of a delivery to an Adidas store. What started as harassment escalated to a gun being held to the back of his head.</p> <p>Shortly after, in November 2015, he told his father about the incident and Alsaker and both his parents decided it was time to get their eldest son out of the country. His father drove Alsaker to Beirut and booked him on to a flight to Turkey, unsure if he would see his son again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already in danger but you have to put yourself in more danger to be safe again,\u201d Alsaker says.</p> <p>He started looking for a smuggler and soon found one. He paid $1,000 for a crossing from Turkey to Greece. It was all the money he had.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit,\u201d he says of people-smuggling. \u201cThey tell you it\u2019s a new boat. It\u2019s an old boat. They give you a fake lifejacket. We were told 35 people on the boat; there were actually 75.\u201d</p> <p>On the journey across the Aegean Sea, there were amputees, babies throwing up and screaming. \u201cIt was the biggest test of my whole life,\u201d Alsaker says.</p> <p>After arriving in Greece he was given six months\u2019 permission to stay. He made his way to the border with Macedonia in Idomeni where an emergency camp had been constructed. He and 15,000 displaced people were stuck in limbo.</p> <p>Alsaker describes a daily queue for an egg sandwich at the camp as one of the most important places on his lengthy, arduous journey. It was in this queue when he overheard a freelance journalist complaining that no one spoke English.</p> <p>\u201cI jumped out the queue and said I speak English,\u201d he says. \u201cI helped her out, translating for her.\u201d</p> <p>At first he turned down an offer of payment but shortly after he was put in touch with many other reporters, all of whom insisted they had to pay Alsaker.</p> <p>First of all he worked for a journalist at the New York Times. \u201cI made about \u20ac1,000 in five days,\u201d he says. \u201cI was being paid properly. I earned what I lost for the boat in five days.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next five months, Alsaker worked for Time magazine, HBO, This American Life, Channel 4 and others, and made several thousand euro \u2013 all paid in cash and tucked into a plastic money container worn round his neck and tucked under his T-shirt.</p> <p>He knew what he had to do with the money he had earned. \u201cI started looking for another smuggler,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cI thought \u2013 I can go to the UK now and achieve my dream.\u201d He went to Athens and soon found a smuggler who charged \u20ac6,500 to get him to the UK.</p> <p>Alsaker was handed two fake passports and booked on to a first-class flight from Athens to Brussels, another flight from there to Spain and another to an unexpected destination.</p> <p>\u201cI landed in Glasgow,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what Scotland was. The smuggler told me it was very close to London.\u201d</p> <p>It was August 2016. Alsaker left the plane and immediately claimed asylum. He was taken to a detention centre but shortly released and returned to the airport for an interview.</p> <p>At the time, Alsaker still had some money left from his translating work so he was not immediately placed in supported accommodation. As a result he spent his first two nights in the UK on a bench in Glasgow Central station.</p> <p>After two months he was relocated to London. Living on \u00a336 a week, unsure if he would be granted refugee status, he started to apply for universities. He was granted refugee status in April 2017. In late September, he started his degree in visual merchandising at the London College of Fashion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/17/britains-young-refugees-claiming-new-place-on-earth-exhibition\">\u2018I can\u2019t wait to work, but I\u2019m not allowed to\u2019: young refugees on living in limbo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Alsaker wanted to push himself further. After trying and failing to meet the head of visual merchandising at Topshop HQ, he started to canvas stores across London. A few months passed and he was offered a job at the Stratford Westfield store in east London.</p> <p>Despite his success against the worst of odds, there is still something that bothers Alsaker. \u201cNot having my family with me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Alsaker\u2019s mother was pregnant when he left Syria. That child \u2013 his little brother \u2013 is two now. He has never met him in person. They have spoken over video chat on his phone.</p> <p>\u201cI think he thinks I\u2019m a character inside a mobile,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cI named him. He looks like me. Every time I start thinking of scenarios: how will I meet him, should I hug him first, or hug my dad first?\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s why he is backing the <a href=\"http://refugeestogether.co.uk/\">#familiestogether campaign</a> supported by more than 20 organisations including Oxfam, the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Amnesty International UK and UNHCR.</p> <p>Alsaker smiles throughout the interview. It\u2019s an irrepressible smile that somehow breaks through as he recalls experiences that would bring most of us to our knees \u2013 but that is just Alsaker, a young man who sees hope and humour where many would not. The campaign to relax family reunion rules is at an advantage with him on its side. He is a man who never gives up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sat in a studio at London College of Fashion, surrounded by faceless mannequins, bent coat-hangers and ripped fabric, Ammar Alsaker grins indefatigably as he recounts his journey from his home of Damascus to these most unlikely of surroundings. After enduring three years of conflict in Syria, he fled Damascus alone for London, a journey that took nine months and saw him negotiate with people-smugglers, pass through Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Spain and Scotland, and earn thousands of euro as a translator for the world\u2019s media \u2013 all as a teenager. Once he was granted refugee status, he continued to strive to realise his dreams, applying to universities and repeatedly turning up at Topshop HQ to demand the attention of its most senior executives so that he might land a role with the retailer. Now 23, in the second year of his bachelor\u2019s degree and working for Topshop, he is focused on his next challenge \u2013 to persuade the UK government to relax restrictive rules so he can reunite with his family \u2013 including the two-year-old brother he has never met. Alsaker hopes sharing his story might challenge negative stereotypes of asylum seekers and refugees and win support for calls to change immigration rules that only allow adult refugees to apply for their spouses or children under 18 to join them. \u201cSome might say \u2018well, not all refugees have vision and goals,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to say that at the end of the day we are not copies of each other, we are different. People like me came here to be productive and benefit this country.\u201d Alsaker is one of six siblings who grew up in Damascus in a \u201chumble house\u201d. His dad is a tailor, who before the conflict ran a newborn clothing business. In 2012, the fighting broke out and life for Alsaker changed irreversibly. Explosions, burnt-out cars, and gunfire became a daily occurrence for him and his family. Soon, checkpoints started appearing every 100 metres all over the city. Whenever Alsaker wanted to go out, to work, to study, to visit a friend, a soldier would ask for ID. The abuse from soldiers became overwhelming. Alsaker recalls being ordered into a small mobile unit in the middle of a delivery to an Adidas store. What started as harassment escalated to a gun being held to the back of his head. Shortly after, in November 2015, he told his father about the incident and Alsaker and both his parents decided it was time to get their eldest son out of the country. His father drove Alsaker to Beirut and booked him on to a flight to Turkey, unsure if he would see his son again. \u201cYou\u2019re already in danger but you have to put yourself in more danger to be safe again,\u201d Alsaker says. He started looking for a smuggler and soon found one. He paid $1,000 for a crossing from Turkey to Greece. It was all the money he had. \u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit,\u201d he says of people-smuggling. \u201cThey tell you it\u2019s a new boat. It\u2019s an old boat. They give you a fake lifejacket. We were told 35 people on the boat; there were actually 75.\u201d On the journey across the Aegean Sea, there were amputees, babies throwing up and screaming. \u201cIt was the biggest test of my whole life,\u201d Alsaker says. After arriving in Greece he was given six months\u2019 permission to stay. He made his way to the border with Macedonia in Idomeni where an emergency camp had been constructed. He and 15,000 displaced people were stuck in limbo. Alsaker describes a daily queue for an egg sandwich at the camp as one of the most important places on his lengthy, arduous journey. It was in this queue when he overheard a freelance journalist complaining that no one spoke English. \u201cI jumped out the queue and said I speak English,\u201d he says. \u201cI helped her out, translating for her.\u201d At first he turned down an offer of payment but shortly after he was put in touch with many other reporters, all of whom insisted they had to pay Alsaker. First of all he worked for a journalist at the New York Times. \u201cI made about \u20ac1,000 in five days,\u201d he says. \u201cI was being paid properly. I earned what I lost for the boat in five days.\u201d Over the next five months, Alsaker worked for Time magazine, HBO, This American Life, Channel 4 and others, and made several thousand euro \u2013 all paid in cash and tucked into a plastic money container worn round his neck and tucked under his T-shirt. He knew what he had to do with the money he had earned. \u201cI started looking for another smuggler,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cI thought \u2013 I can go to the UK now and achieve my dream.\u201d He went to Athens and soon found a smuggler who charged \u20ac6,500 to get him to the UK. Alsaker was handed two fake passports and booked on to a first-class flight from Athens to Brussels, another flight from there to Spain and another to an unexpected destination. \u201cI landed in Glasgow,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what Scotland was. The smuggler told me it was very close to London.\u201d It was August 2016. Alsaker left the plane and immediately claimed asylum. He was taken to a detention centre but shortly released and returned to the airport for an interview. At the time, Alsaker still had some money left from his translating work so he was not immediately placed in supported accommodation. As a result he spent his first two nights in the UK on a bench in Glasgow Central station. After two months he was relocated to London. Living on \u00a336 a week, unsure if he would be granted refugee status, he started to apply for universities. He was granted refugee status in April 2017. In late September, he started his degree in visual merchandising at the London College of Fashion. But Alsaker wanted to push himself further. After trying and failing to meet the head of visual merchandising at Topshop HQ, he started to canvas stores across London. A few months passed and he was offered a job at the Stratford Westfield store in east London. Despite his success against the worst of odds, there is still something that bothers Alsaker. \u201cNot having my family with me,\u201d he says. Alsaker\u2019s mother was pregnant when he left Syria. That child \u2013 his little brother \u2013 is two now. He has never met him in person. They have spoken over video chat on his phone. \u201cI think he thinks I\u2019m a character inside a mobile,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cI named him. He looks like me. Every time I start thinking of scenarios: how will I meet him, should I hug him first, or hug my dad first?\u201d That\u2019s why he is backing the #familiestogether campaign supported by more than 20 organisations including Oxfam, the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Amnesty International UK and UNHCR. Alsaker smiles throughout the interview. It\u2019s an irrepressible smile that somehow breaks through as he recalls experiences that would bring most of us to our knees \u2013 but that is just Alsaker, a young man who sees hope and humour where many would not. The campaign to relax family reunion rules is at an advantage with him on its side. He is a man who never gives up.",

      "body": "<p>On a rainy Thursday morning, Nathan Phillips of the Omaha nation and I met for an interview over breakfast at Le Caprice, a family-owned Mexican bakery in Washington DC. Phillips had slept just one hour the night before and when I first caught sight of him trudging across 14th Street, he had his hood up to conceal his identity from any would-be harassers.</p> <p>It had been six days since Phillips, 64, stood nose-to-nose with Nicholas Sandmann, a student at Covington Catholic high school on the steps outside the Lincoln Memorial. The stare-down became a national controversy when videos circulated showing Phillips singing and beating a drum, eyes locked with Sandmann. The teenager wore the unmistakable Maga headgear of the Trump campaign and a grin. In some clips, some of his classmates could be seen performing the tomahawk-chop gesture popularized by sports teams with Native American mascots such as the Atlanta Braves.</p> <p>The bitter disagreement over the interpretation has come to epitomize political and racial divisions at the core of American society. Its viral aftermath has taken such an unreal turn that the truth is no longer a mere question of fact \u2013 it\u2019s a matter of power and perspective. One version of the events sees them as the latest examples of the Trump-era intensification of racial discourse. The other views the liberal outrage spurred by the incident as a social justice crusade against an innocent young man victimized by protesters and the press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4/0_0_2560_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Covington Catholic high school students stand in front of Nathan Phillips in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Covington Catholic high school students and Nathan Phillips (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kaya Taitano/Social Media/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sandmann\u2019s family soon hired <a href=\"https://www.runswitchpr.com/\">RunSwitch</a>, a media relations firm with strong ties to the Republican party, to handle the crisis, and L Lin Wood, a high-profile libel attorney known for aggressively pursuing lawsuits against the media. Sandmann has complained that the video was spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the incident.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the day before Phillips and I met, the Today Show aired a pre-recorded interview with Sandmann in which the host asked almost no tough questions of the 16-year-old, who, dressed in muted tones and speaking in a soft voice, presented as a sympathetic youngster. As the counter-offensive picked up traction, widespread sympathy for Phillips began to turn.</p> <p>This whole thing has gotten away from us \u2013 all of us \u2013 but none more than Nathan Phillips. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this squashed and done with,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I find myself in this place and I think everyone is telling me, because of my spiritual walk, this is where Creator put me.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Phillips is tall, maybe a little bit over 6ft, but with a wiry frame. He has tawny sunken cheeks, a silvery pencil-thin mustache and beard with wispy shoulder-length gray-black hair. As we sat down in the bakery \u2013 his coffee in a to-go cup, mine in ceramic mug \u2013 he joked that the waitstaff favored me. \u201c<em>Dang</em>, where\u2019s my fancy cup, lady?\u201d He teased. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just tricking you.\u201d</p> <p>His inflection \u2013 the way he drew out \u201cdang\u201d \u2013 reminded me of many other Native men of his generation, a familiarity rooted in our shared identity. As he chuckled, I counted all of four teeth in his mouth.</p> <p>Unlike Sandmann, Phillips does not have a PR firm to represent him and his side of the story, or an attorney to challenge critical journalists. His support team consists of two people: Ray Kingfisher, a northern Cheyenne who has known him for decades, and Daniel Nelson, a non-Native \u201cally\u201d and program director of the Lakota Peoples Project. Phillips had been couch-surfing with them since he came to DC for the Indigenous Peoples March last week.</p> <p>Part of him, understandably, wanted out of the situation. \u201cMaybe after this happened, I should have just hopped in my car, went back to Michigan,\u201d he thought aloud. \u201cI\u2019m becoming this rightwing media thing, you know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b3baf0b1d85aedaf6b870c0e87ebdc22902c049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b3baf0b1d85aedaf6b870c0e87ebdc22902c049/0_0_3500_2623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Phillips diagrams what happened on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Phillips diagrams his account of what happened on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Phillips does not look like the average Today Show viewer, nor does he have much in common with them. Suburban Americans do not look at him, as they do Sandmann, and see their sons or their own adolescence. Empathy, according to psychological research, is most easily expressed among individuals of the same race. Native Americans, according to the census, account for just <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2015/cb15-ff22.html\">2%</a> of the population. Plus, Phillips is long-winded \u2013 a quality encouraged in Indigenous cultures that doesn\u2019t quite translate to the punchy soundbites favored in print and on cable.</p> <p>Many want to hear his side of the story, but the truth is, it\u2019s hard to tell. To really get it, he insists, we need set the record straight about who he is and where he\u2019s coming from \u2013 and that means looking beyond what happened that cold Friday. So that\u2019s where we begin.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Like so many other Native children, Phillips was wrenched from his birth mother by the child welfare system. Because he was raised outside the community, he never learned his Indian name or his Omaha language.<strong> </strong>Today, Native kids are <a href=\"https://www.nicwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Disproportionality-Table.pdf\">almost three times more likely</a> than the general population to be adopted out of their home, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association. Scholars and activists say foster care has become an extension of boarding school assimilation \u2013 the same way mass incarceration is the afterlife of Jim Crow.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about that time too much, but because it got brought up other places, I just feel like I have to address it.\u201d For the first half hour of our conversation, Phillips weaved harrowing tales of personal abuse and deprivation between sips of coffee and political commentary.</p> <p>There\u2019s the time he ran away to the Omaha reservation in Nebraska at 14 or 15 to find his mother: \u201cI went over there and knocked on this door and this little bitty head shot up out of this window and we locked eyes on each other, and then I could just hear her, \u2018Oh!\u2019 I mean, it was just the sweetest \u2018oh\u2019 I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he recalled, his voice quivering. \u201cShe knew I would come home one day and look for her.\u201d</p> <p>Then, there\u2019s the time he ran away to the reservation at 16 with tragically humorous misconceptions about Indians still hunting buffalo and living in tipis and the way his cousins rejected him for being so clueless. \u2018Get out of here, white boy,\u2019 they said. \u2018Go home, white boy.\u2019 \u201cBroke my heart, man \u2013 I just wanted to be Indian again, you know?\u201d He said. \u201cI was raised as a white man. I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c98f56cae8fbba88b94e8a8a7f2cda2c1470cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c98f56cae8fbba88b94e8a8a7f2cda2c1470cd0/0_0_2826_2862/987.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Phillips in 2018 near Mandan, North Dakota.\" width=\"987\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Phillips in 2018 near Mandan, North Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Stromme/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, there\u2019s the night he came home at 17 with his first hickey. When his foster dad saw it, he knocked Phillips unconscious. And when he came to, his guardian threatened to kill him. \u201cI was getting beat regular with a belt \u2013 I mean, \u2018on the regular\u2019, as they say, you know: weekly, daily,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI got tired of it when I was 17,\u201d said Phillips. He ran away to Topeka, Kansas, where he found a Marine Corps recruiter. These were the waning years of the Vietnam war. While many, including the current president, dodged the draft, Phillips enlisted. It was his only way out. \u201cI was either going to be a ward of the state until I was 21 or I could go into the Corps. That was the choices I had.\u201d</p> <p>Early reports identified Phillips as a Vietnam veteran. In reality he served in the Marine Corps during, but not in, Vietnam. (He refers to himself as a \u201cVietnam-era veteran\u201d, which seems to have been the cause of the confusion.) Some commentators claim he misrepresented his service. Others, like the New York Post, have gone even further and called him a \u201c<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/23/nathan-phillips-is-a-liar-not-a-victim/\">liar</a>\u201d. Phillips is frustrated by the mix-up and the implication that he has been dishonest. If people knew the disturbing truth about those years of his life, maybe they might stop attacking him, he reasons.</p> <p>At powwows and other Native gatherings like the annual ceremony held for Native American veterans that he holds in Arlington National Cemetery, Phillips is honored for his service. \u201cThere was never a question of, \u2018What kind of veteran are you?\u2019\u201d He said. \u201cAs long as you just had that honor, nothing else mattered, you know?\u201d</p> <p>There was, in other words, acceptance and belonging among the community of veterans, Native Americans and Native American veterans \u2013 something that was taken away from him as a small boy.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After an honorable discharge from the Marines in 1976, Phillips turned to the bottle. He didn\u2019t come back to his culture \u2013 or \u201cthe circle\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 until a decade later, when he and Kingfisher were students at the Native-only Haskell Indian Junior College in Lawrence, Kansas. This is also not a pretty story.</p> <p>In 1988 and 1989, five members of the Haskell community \u2013 Christopher Bread, John Sandoval, Cecil Dawes Jr, Harry Oliver and Nilsa Sanchez \u2013 went missing and were murdered without explanation. Rumors about skinheads and serial killers swirled. Native parents wrote to the school to ask if their children would be safe.</p> <p>Indigenous peoples are among the most vulnerable in society to abuse and foul play; more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native people have experienced violence in their lifetime, according to a 2016 report by the <a href=\"https://nij.gov/journals/277/pages/violence-against-american-indians-alaska-natives.aspx\">National Institute of Justice</a>. The ghastly trend of Indigenous women turning up missing and murdered has become so common that it even has its own hashtag: #MMIW. The majority of Indigenous victims of violent crime \u2013 97% of women and 90% of men \u2013 will experience violence at the hands of a non-Native perpetrator in their lifetime.</p> <p>In 1989, after months without much attention and few leads, the Haskell cases made the front page of the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe walked the swamps, and the riverbeds, and the prairies, and the roadsides for them,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cAnd when we found them, it broke our heart.\u201d</p> <p>The family of one of the students, a Navajo man, whose body was found in the Kansas river, held a Native American church meeting on the hospital grounds of the college to pray for the dead 19-year-old. Phillips stood security all night outside the ceremonial tipi \u2013 a structure that members of the faith sometimes liken to a womb. At many gatherings, like the Indigenous Peoples March, he still carries that responsibility as a protector. He\u2019s been sober now for over 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what brought me to the Indigenous Peoples March.\u201d Phillips said, tears rolling down his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re tired of this shit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4b0e80216d3e58f925165e4074e0500b215801ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b0e80216d3e58f925165e4074e0500b215801ac/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Phillips marches with other protesters out of the main opposition camp against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Phillips marches with other protesters out of the main opposition camp against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terray Sylvester/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the community and the movement, they call him \u201cUncle Nate\u201d. He participated in the Indigenous movement against the Dakota Access pipeline, camping in the path of the project at Standing Rock, making many friends throughout Indian country.</p> <p>Last year, he hosted a prayer walk on the first anniversary of the encampment\u2019s end. He carries a sacred pipe and does cultural work with young people through the Native Youth Alliance, a not-for-profit he co-founded. \u201cThey\u2019re my teachers,\u201d he says of the next generation.</p> <p>To earn the right to carry that pipe, he had to travel what some Native people call the \u201cRed Road\u201d. He went through four rounds in the sweat lodge. He stayed up all night for a Native American church meeting. And after a year of sobriety, he was put atop a hill, where he was expected to fast four days and nights to become a pipe carrier. \u201cThat first night, spirits came to me and brushed me off the hill,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing things terrified me, so I left the hill and that pride\u2014that, \u2018I\u2019m a strong guy, I can go up and fast for four days and four nights without any kind of understanding of what am I doing out there.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Phillips tried again and again to stay on that hill. But he could never make it through. He remembers when, six years after his first attempt, on the third night of his fast, he was, once again, ready to march back down the hill. \u201cWhat am I here for?\u201d He asked himself that night. \u201cI wanted to quit.\u201d But he pulled through. That will to face fear and not retreat is still with him.</p> <p>To explain exactly what happened at the Lincoln Memorial that day, Phillips began sketching a map of the steps in front of the reflecting pool. On the drawing, he showed where the prayer circle formed after the Indigenous Peoples March and where the four Black Hebrew Israelites were standing, proselytizing and goading whoever would listen. (Usually, in DC, they just get ignored.) In one video, a Black Hebrew Israelite could be heard calling the Covington students \u201cdusty ass crackers with that racist garbage on\u201d.</p> <p>(Sandmann\u2019s own statement validates this: he said that African American protesters who identified as Black Hebrew Israelites kept on saying \u201chateful things\u201d to him and his classmates.)</p> <p>After attending the nearby anti-abortion March for Life, the Covington Catholic students came in and out of the area throughout the afternoon, according to Phillips, who does wonder where their parents and chaperones were that day and why they never stepped in. (Cellphone footage captured by unrelated parties in the vicinity seemed to show Covington students, Sandmann not among them, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/covington-catholic-high-school-nathan-philips-video-nick-sandman-native-american-man-maga-trump-a8740876.html\">yelling at young women</a> and other passersby.)</p> <p>Towards the end of the day, around 4 or 5pm, the students returned to the steps of the memorial to wait for their chartered bus. That\u2019s when, according to Phillips and others, things got out of hand. The Black Hebrew Israelites began taunting the kids. The students responded \u2013 some with words, others with gestures.</p> <p>Many Covington students, in Phillips\u2019 estimate, responded to the four Black preachers. In a particularly bizarre exercise of masculinity and domination, a few students removed their shirts and began performing a school dance and chant that looked like a bootleg haka. \u201cThese guys and those guys was about the distance from here to that wall right there,\u201d Phillips said, pointing to the back of the cafe, about 20ft away. </p> <p>It was at that point that a young bearded Pawnee man approached Phillips. \u201cUncle, we\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the middle of that.\u201d Phillips replied. \u201cIt\u2019s like a race war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSing a song!\u201d the young man said, pushing a drum into Phillips hand.</p> <p>Phillips flashed back to that night on the hill and the mornings in camp at Standing Rock. \u201cWhen I put the drum in my hand and I thought about it, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to pray here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The song Phillips chose is the anthem of the American Indian Movement (Aim). It is, for many Native people, a song of pride, awakening and empowerment. But for Phillips, it is also an ode to loss: his brother died at an Aim party in the 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I got here to this point and started singing,\u201d Phillips said, pointing to a spot between the circle and the crowd on his hand-drawn map, \u201cthat\u2019s when the spirit took over.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips\u2019 initial intention was to step between the students and Black Hebrew Israelites, sing and retreat. But as he approached the students, the situation felt more volatile. \u201cThat\u2019s when I had a conscious thought of: we\u2019re in a dangerous situation here.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips says he then looked for a gap in the crowd and saw an opening on the steps heading up towards the monument. He looked down to find his footing. When he looked up again, he found himself face-to-face with a young man: Nicholas Sandmann.</p> <p>(For his part, the teenager said: \u201cI never felt I was blocking the Native American protester.

      "bodyText": "On a rainy Thursday morning, Nathan Phillips of the Omaha nation and I met for an interview over breakfast at Le Caprice, a family-owned Mexican bakery in Washington DC. Phillips had slept just one hour the night before and when I first caught sight of him trudging across 14th Street, he had his hood up to conceal his identity from any would-be harassers. It had been six days since Phillips, 64, stood nose-to-nose with Nicholas Sandmann, a student at Covington Catholic high school on the steps outside the Lincoln Memorial. The stare-down became a national controversy when videos circulated showing Phillips singing and beating a drum, eyes locked with Sandmann. The teenager wore the unmistakable Maga headgear of the Trump campaign and a grin. In some clips, some of his classmates could be seen performing the tomahawk-chop gesture popularized by sports teams with Native American mascots such as the Atlanta Braves. The bitter disagreement over the interpretation has come to epitomize political and racial divisions at the core of American society. Its viral aftermath has taken such an unreal turn that the truth is no longer a mere question of fact \u2013 it\u2019s a matter of power and perspective. One version of the events sees them as the latest examples of the Trump-era intensification of racial discourse. The other views the liberal outrage spurred by the incident as a social justice crusade against an innocent young man victimized by protesters and the press. Sandmann\u2019s family soon hired RunSwitch, a media relations firm with strong ties to the Republican party, to handle the crisis, and L Lin Wood, a high-profile libel attorney known for aggressively pursuing lawsuits against the media. Sandmann has complained that the video was spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the incident. On Wednesday, the day before Phillips and I met, the Today Show aired a pre-recorded interview with Sandmann in which the host asked almost no tough questions of the 16-year-old, who, dressed in muted tones and speaking in a soft voice, presented as a sympathetic youngster. As the counter-offensive picked up traction, widespread sympathy for Phillips began to turn. This whole thing has gotten away from us \u2013 all of us \u2013 but none more than Nathan Phillips. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this squashed and done with,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I find myself in this place and I think everyone is telling me, because of my spiritual walk, this is where Creator put me.\u201d * * * Phillips is tall, maybe a little bit over 6ft, but with a wiry frame. He has tawny sunken cheeks, a silvery pencil-thin mustache and beard with wispy shoulder-length gray-black hair. As we sat down in the bakery \u2013 his coffee in a to-go cup, mine in ceramic mug \u2013 he joked that the waitstaff favored me. \u201cDang, where\u2019s my fancy cup, lady?\u201d He teased. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just tricking you.\u201d His inflection \u2013 the way he drew out \u201cdang\u201d \u2013 reminded me of many other Native men of his generation, a familiarity rooted in our shared identity. As he chuckled, I counted all of four teeth in his mouth. Unlike Sandmann, Phillips does not have a PR firm to represent him and his side of the story, or an attorney to challenge critical journalists. His support team consists of two people: Ray Kingfisher, a northern Cheyenne who has known him for decades, and Daniel Nelson, a non-Native \u201cally\u201d and program director of the Lakota Peoples Project. Phillips had been couch-surfing with them since he came to DC for the Indigenous Peoples March last week. Part of him, understandably, wanted out of the situation. \u201cMaybe after this happened, I should have just hopped in my car, went back to Michigan,\u201d he thought aloud. \u201cI\u2019m becoming this rightwing media thing, you know?\u201d Phillips does not look like the average Today Show viewer, nor does he have much in common with them. Suburban Americans do not look at him, as they do Sandmann, and see their sons or their own adolescence. Empathy, according to psychological research, is most easily expressed among individuals of the same race. Native Americans, according to the census, account for just 2% of the population. Plus, Phillips is long-winded \u2013 a quality encouraged in Indigenous cultures that doesn\u2019t quite translate to the punchy soundbites favored in print and on cable. Many want to hear his side of the story, but the truth is, it\u2019s hard to tell. To really get it, he insists, we need set the record straight about who he is and where he\u2019s coming from \u2013 and that means looking beyond what happened that cold Friday. So that\u2019s where we begin. * * * Like so many other Native children, Phillips was wrenched from his birth mother by the child welfare system. Because he was raised outside the community, he never learned his Indian name or his Omaha language. Today, Native kids are almost three times more likely than the general population to be adopted out of their home, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association. Scholars and activists say foster care has become an extension of boarding school assimilation \u2013 the same way mass incarceration is the afterlife of Jim Crow. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about that time too much, but because it got brought up other places, I just feel like I have to address it.\u201d For the first half hour of our conversation, Phillips weaved harrowing tales of personal abuse and deprivation between sips of coffee and political commentary. There\u2019s the time he ran away to the Omaha reservation in Nebraska at 14 or 15 to find his mother: \u201cI went over there and knocked on this door and this little bitty head shot up out of this window and we locked eyes on each other, and then I could just hear her, \u2018Oh!\u2019 I mean, it was just the sweetest \u2018oh\u2019 I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he recalled, his voice quivering. \u201cShe knew I would come home one day and look for her.\u201d Then, there\u2019s the time he ran away to the reservation at 16 with tragically humorous misconceptions about Indians still hunting buffalo and living in tipis and the way his cousins rejected him for being so clueless. \u2018Get out of here, white boy,\u2019 they said. \u2018Go home, white boy.\u2019 \u201cBroke my heart, man \u2013 I just wanted to be Indian again, you know?\u201d He said. \u201cI was raised as a white man. I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d Then, there\u2019s the night he came home at 17 with his first hickey. When his foster dad saw it, he knocked Phillips unconscious. And when he came to, his guardian threatened to kill him. \u201cI was getting beat regular with a belt \u2013 I mean, \u2018on the regular\u2019, as they say, you know: weekly, daily,\u201d he said. \u201cI got tired of it when I was 17,\u201d said Phillips. He ran away to Topeka, Kansas, where he found a Marine Corps recruiter. These were the waning years of the Vietnam war. While many, including the current president, dodged the draft, Phillips enlisted. It was his only way out. \u201cI was either going to be a ward of the state until I was 21 or I could go into the Corps. That was the choices I had.\u201d Early reports identified Phillips as a Vietnam veteran. In reality he served in the Marine Corps during, but not in, Vietnam. (He refers to himself as a \u201cVietnam-era veteran\u201d, which seems to have been the cause of the confusion.) Some commentators claim he misrepresented his service. Others, like the New York Post, have gone even further and called him a \u201cliar\u201d. Phillips is frustrated by the mix-up and the implication that he has been dishonest. If people knew the disturbing truth about those years of his life, maybe they might stop attacking him, he reasons. At powwows and other Native gatherings like the annual ceremony held for Native American veterans that he holds in Arlington National Cemetery, Phillips is honored for his service. \u201cThere was never a question of, \u2018What kind of veteran are you?\u2019\u201d He said. \u201cAs long as you just had that honor, nothing else mattered, you know?\u201d There was, in other words, acceptance and belonging among the community of veterans, Native Americans and Native American veterans \u2013 something that was taken away from him as a small boy. * * * After an honorable discharge from the Marines in 1976, Phillips turned to the bottle. He didn\u2019t come back to his culture \u2013 or \u201cthe circle\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 until a decade later, when he and Kingfisher were students at the Native-only Haskell Indian Junior College in Lawrence, Kansas. This is also not a pretty story. In 1988 and 1989, five members of the Haskell community \u2013 Christopher Bread, John Sandoval, Cecil Dawes Jr, Harry Oliver and Nilsa Sanchez \u2013 went missing and were murdered without explanation. Rumors about skinheads and serial killers swirled. Native parents wrote to the school to ask if their children would be safe. Indigenous peoples are among the most vulnerable in society to abuse and foul play; more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native people have experienced violence in their lifetime, according to a 2016 report by the National Institute of Justice. The ghastly trend of Indigenous women turning up missing and murdered has become so common that it even has its own hashtag: #MMIW. The majority of Indigenous victims of violent crime \u2013 97% of women and 90% of men \u2013 will experience violence at the hands of a non-Native perpetrator in their lifetime. In 1989, after months without much attention and few leads, the Haskell cases made the front page of the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe walked the swamps, and the riverbeds, and the prairies, and the roadsides for them,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cAnd when we found them, it broke our heart.\u201d The family of one of the students, a Navajo man, whose body was found in the Kansas river, held a Native American church meeting on the hospital grounds of the college to pray for the dead 19-year-old. Phillips stood security all night outside the ceremonial tipi \u2013 a structure that members of the faith sometimes liken to a womb. At many gatherings, like the Indigenous Peoples March, he still carries that responsibility as a protector. He\u2019s been sober now for over 30 years. \u201cThat\u2019s what brought me to the Indigenous Peoples March.\u201d Phillips said, tears rolling down his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re tired of this shit.\u201d * * * In the community and the movement, they call him \u201cUncle Nate\u201d. He participated in the Indigenous movement against the Dakota Access pipeline, camping in the path of the project at Standing Rock, making many friends throughout Indian country. Last year, he hosted a prayer walk on the first anniversary of the encampment\u2019s end. He carries a sacred pipe and does cultural work with young people through the Native Youth Alliance, a not-for-profit he co-founded. \u201cThey\u2019re my teachers,\u201d he says of the next generation. To earn the right to carry that pipe, he had to travel what some Native people call the \u201cRed Road\u201d. He went through four rounds in the sweat lodge. He stayed up all night for a Native American church meeting. And after a year of sobriety, he was put atop a hill, where he was expected to fast four days and nights to become a pipe carrier. \u201cThat first night, spirits came to me and brushed me off the hill,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing things terrified me, so I left the hill and that pride\u2014that, \u2018I\u2019m a strong guy, I can go up and fast for four days and four nights without any kind of understanding of what am I doing out there.\u2019\u201d Phillips tried again and again to stay on that hill. But he could never make it through. He remembers when, six years after his first attempt, on the third night of his fast, he was, once again, ready to march back down the hill. \u201cWhat am I here for?\u201d He asked himself that night. \u201cI wanted to quit.\u201d But he pulled through. That will to face fear and not retreat is still with him. To explain exactly what happened at the Lincoln Memorial that day, Phillips began sketching a map of the steps in front of the reflecting pool. On the drawing, he showed where the prayer circle formed after the Indigenous Peoples March and where the four Black Hebrew Israelites were standing, proselytizing and goading whoever would listen. (Usually, in DC, they just get ignored.) In one video, a Black Hebrew Israelite could be heard calling the Covington students \u201cdusty ass crackers with that racist garbage on\u201d. (Sandmann\u2019s own statement validates this: he said that African American protesters who identified as Black Hebrew Israelites kept on saying \u201chateful things\u201d to him and his classmates.) After attending the nearby anti-abortion March for Life, the Covington Catholic students came in and out of the area throughout the afternoon, according to Phillips, who does wonder where their parents and chaperones were that day and why they never stepped in. (Cellphone footage captured by unrelated parties in the vicinity seemed to show Covington students, Sandmann not among them, yelling at young women and other passersby.) Towards the end of the day, around 4 or 5pm, the students returned to the steps of the memorial to wait for their chartered bus. That\u2019s when, according to Phillips and others, things got out of hand. The Black Hebrew Israelites began taunting the kids. The students responded \u2013 some with words, others with gestures. Many Covington students, in Phillips\u2019 estimate, responded to the four Black preachers. In a particularly bizarre exercise of masculinity and domination, a few students removed their shirts and began performing a school dance and chant that looked like a bootleg haka. \u201cThese guys and those guys was about the distance from here to that wall right there,\u201d Phillips said, pointing to the back of the cafe, about 20ft away. It was at that point that a young bearded Pawnee man approached Phillips. \u201cUncle, we\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the middle of that.\u201d Phillips replied. \u201cIt\u2019s like a race war.\u201d \u201cSing a song!\u201d the young man said, pushing a drum into Phillips hand. Phillips flashed back to that night on the hill and the mornings in camp at Standing Rock. \u201cWhen I put the drum in my hand and I thought about it, I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to pray here.\u2019\u201d The song Phillips chose is the anthem of the American Indian Movement (Aim). It is, for many Native people, a song of pride, awakening and empowerment. But for Phillips, it is also an ode to loss: his brother died at an Aim party in the 1970s. \u201cWhen I got here to this point and started singing,\u201d Phillips said, pointing to a spot between the circle and the crowd on his hand-drawn map, \u201cthat\u2019s when the spirit took over.\u201d Phillips\u2019 initial intention was to step between the students and Black Hebrew Israelites, sing and retreat. But as he approached the students, the situation felt more volatile. \u201cThat\u2019s when I had a conscious thought of: we\u2019re in a dangerous situation here.\u201d Phillips says he then looked for a gap in the crowd and saw an opening on the steps heading up towards the monument. He looked down to find his footing. When he looked up again, he found himself face-to-face with a young man: Nicholas Sandmann. (For his part, the teenager said: \u201cI never felt I was blocking the Native American protester. He never made any attempt to go around me. It was clear to me that he had singled me out for a confrontation, although I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d) Phillips looked into the young man\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the youth, the youth that need that song.\u201d He thought. \u201cThe youth that need that mother\u2019s heartbeat to remind them who they are and where they come from.\u201d So he sang louder. \u201cWay-ya way-hi-ya-ho way-oh way yah hey oh!\u201d Some of the students facing him got riled up \u2013 some chanting, others jumping, more than a few tomahawk-chopping. I asked Phillips what he was thinking and feeling in that moment. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve had time to think about it and digest the emotions of trauma that was there being re-twigged [sic] in my memory and all the reasons we came there for the Indigenous People\u2019s Gathering. And so, fear, you know? What\u2019s happening to our country? Because I was in prayer and the prayer was about what was happening to our country \u2013 to protect us, to look down on us. God, what is happening here between these two groups?\u201d \u201cThey are tearing the fabric of America apart right in front of me. That\u2019s how I was praying, that\u2019s how I was feeling.

It\u2019s just based on the number of people who have contacted their insurers so far. </p> \n  <p>For a better idea of how much it will cost, you have to look back at previous disasters. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/11/flash-flooding-hits-hobart-after-torrential-rain\">Hobart floods in May last year</a> cost $99m when the city was hit by flash flooding.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following today\u2019s live coverage of the Townsville flood crisis. The worst of conditions happened overnight after the Ross River dam\u2019s floodgates were opened, sending 1,900 cubic metres of water gushing into the already inundated town. We learned that authorities received more than 1,000 calls for help, while there were also 18 swift-water rescues. About 16,000 homes were without power. Officials faced some criticism for choosing not to impose a forced evacuation. They said they had provided sufficient warnings to residents, who had to take some personal responsibility for their welfare. Today, authorities have been using boats, helicopters and, in some cases, garbage trucks, to rescue hundreds of Townsville residents. The rain has eased in Townsville now, but a monsoon trough remains over the region, with more heavy rain expected. At 5.30pm, the Bureau of Meteorology said there had been up to 268mm of rain over the past 24 hours in parts of Townsville. But since 9am, there had been only 10mm-20mm. On Tuesday, between 55-70 mm of rain is forecast. The Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, has issued a statement warning locals to beware of crocodiles in flood waters. \u201cCrocodiles prefer calmer waters and they may move around in search of a quiet place to wait for flood waters to recede,\u201d Enoch said. \u201cCrocodiles may be seen crossing roads, and when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes where they have not been seen before. \u201cSimilarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly.\u201d Enoch said locals should not attempt to catch or remove a snake. \u201cIt\u2019s best to leave snakes alone to move on of their own accord, or you can contact a local licensed snake removalist if you need assistance,\u201d she said. Some more good news from the weather bureau. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Jess Gardener tells the ABC conditions in Townsville are improving. \u201cThings have eased over the Townsville area over the last few hours,\u201d Gardener says. The area of Woolshed had only seen 2.6mm of rain over that period, and the bureau\u2019s main focus has shifted to an area south of Townsville and around Mackay. Gardener adds that \u201cthe heaviest falls have passed\u201d, but notes there is still \u201cdecent\u201d rainfall forecast for the next few days. \u201cWith everything so saturated that will lead to some more flooding, so we\u2019re not out of the worst of it yet,\u201d she says. Here\u2019s a video report on the situation in Townsville. This should convince people. On ABC local radio, Townsville locals have been describing the scene from their homes. Caller Mark, from Hermit Park, says that there is currently a river flowing through his street. He decided to stay in his home last night, with his wife, 15-year-old son and dog, because they had an emergency plan in place. \u201cWe\u2019re at a fairly high point even though we\u2019re sitting in a river at the moment,\u201d Mark says. The family is self-sufficient, with a generator providing electricity to their home and their elderly neighbours. But both their vehicles \u201cwent under\u201d, while their freezer, washing machine and dryer were \u201clifted\u201d away by the flood waters. Good news for people trying to get in and out of Townsville. Water levels at the Ross River dam have subsided slightly since 11am, when they were predicted to peak. While that\u2019s good news, authorities have pointed out that there is another monsoon trough headed towards Townsville. Queensland\u2019s department of education says schools in the flood-affected areas of north Queensland will remain closed on Tuesday. Two NRL players have been using a boat to help rescue flood victims. Flood-affected Townsville is the headquarters of the North Queensland Cowboys. Antonio Winterstein\u2019s wife, Brooke, posted a call out on Facebook offering to ferry people to the army barracks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people here with cars and if you need we\u2019re dropping people off at the army barracks,\u201d Winterstein says in the video. \u201cSo if you are in Idalia near Abbott St message us on here. The boys are all doing trips over in the boats to come and get you. One of the families that just came over said there\u2019s a house with 21 people in there.\u201d The Townsville mayor, Jenny Hill, has just appeared on Sky News. She has been defending the response to the floods crisis from authorities, amid some concern from residents who said they were not given enough warning. In fact, Hill says that local officials had knocked on doors two days prior to last night, and sent a number of emergency alerts. \u201cI\u2019d argue that we did give the community quite a bit of warning,\u201d she says. Hill notes that the city has received \u201cmore than years\u2019 worth of rain in seven days\u201d. \u201cIt surpasses anything we have on record,\u201d she says. For example, the last time Townsville flooded, the water levels over the Aplins Weir hit 1.77m. This time, it has reached as high as 4m. \u201cThe community ... accepts this is an extraordinary event,\u201d Hill says. The Insurance Council is saying that on the basis of claims already lodged the cost will be $20m. But that is a very early estimate and does not include any itemisation by policyholders. It\u2019s just based on the number of people who have contacted their insurers so far. For a better idea of how much it will cost, you have to look back at previous disasters. For example, the Hobart floods in May last year cost $99m when the city was hit by flash flooding. The Townsville crisis is on a much greater scale so a more comparable event might be the 1974 Brisbane flood which, in 2017 dollar terms, cost $3.2bn, according to the Insurance Council. Another interesting point from my colleague Lisa Cox\u2019s chat with Terry Hughes. Hughes also says the floods are another example of the climate extremes Australia has experienced this summer, alongside record-breaking heatwaves and bushfires. The premier [Annastacia Palaszczuk] for the second time in three months, has been using the word unprecedented. First the unprecedented fires, now it\u2019s unprecedented floods. Scott Morrison has given a press conference offering sympathies to people in Tasmania and Townsville, but he didn\u2019t make any links to climate change. The coral reef scientist Prof Terry Hughes says the flooding will send pulses of sediment from the river systems out into the reef. \u201cAlmost every river in tropical Queensland is flooding,\u201d he says. \u201cYou only have to look out the window in Townsville. The sea is coffee brown.\u201d Hughes says there will be particular concerns for the near-shore reefs around the central part of the Great Barrier Reef, which was heavily impacted by coral bleaching in 2017 and where corals are only starting to recover. \u201cJuvenile corals and baby corals are particularly susceptible to being smothered,\u201d he says. Hughes says the last major flood also smothered seagrasses that species such as dugong feed on. The one \u201csilver lining\u201d is that temperatures in the water are sitting at normal levels, making it unlikely bleaching will occur this year. Another concern to arise from the floods will be the sediment run-off into the Great Barrier Reef. Sediment can smother corals and encourage disease and freshwater can kill corals. Jon Brodie is a professorial research fellow at the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville. He says there will be some threat to coastal seagrass and island fringing reefs from the fine sediment discharge and freshwater from the flooding rivers \u2013 especially in Cleveland Bay from the Ross River. But the Burdekin River is not in major flood yet and the impacts on the reef are much more extensive when it does reach that point, such as in 2011. Brodie says the present flooding posed the greatest risk to areas around Cleveland Bay \u201cwhere there\u2019s one of the most important seagrass nurseries in the whole Great Barrier Reef\u201d. \u201cThe reefs around Magnetic Island on Cleveland Bay used to be very lovely reefs, they will likely be affected as well,\u201d he says. Brodie also says rivers north of Mackay could affect reefs around the Whitsundays.

What we know: Between 400 and 500 homes inundated in Townsville Fears up to 2,000 homes may have been affected by water in some way More than 1,100 residents evacuated overnight; about 1,000 are staying in refuge centres Boats, choppers and council trucks are being used to get people out of flooded suburbs More than 1,000 calls for help in the past 24 hours, most in Townsville Monsoon trough producing intense rain is quite stationary but is gradually moving south Rain has eased in Townsville but more heavy falls are expected later on Monday; conditions remain unpredictable Severe weather warning current from Cardwell south to Mackay and inland to Cloncurry Abnormally high tides and monsoonal squalls forecast for the Gulf of Carpentaria coast and the Torres Strait Townsville airport reopening at 2pm Schools in the region likely to remain closed on Tuesday People in Townsville who have been evacuated \u2013 or are looking for loved ones \u2013 are being urged to sign up with the Red Cross. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, also touched on the floods at a press conference earlier today. It coincided with the premier\u2019s media conference, so I\u2019m just catching up now. Morrison is in Tasmania, where he noted there were bushfires burning across the state. Here\u2019s what he said: As I\u2019ve moved around the recovery centre here and spoken to people and down in the town, spoken to the chopper pilots, the firies and people from Parks, what I hear back is the sense of the resilience and community that always comes to the fore in times like this. I have to say, we\u2019ll be saying exactly the same thing up in Townsville and surrounds at the moment. While Tasmania is gripped by fire, presently, in Townsville, it\u2019s floods. Just as all Australians\u2019 hearts have gone out to people here in Tasmania, the same is very much with the people of Townsville and the surrounding districts up there in the floods at the moment where they\u2019re facing, as we speak, the biggest of challenges. Some more from my colleague Lisa Cox on Woolworths\u2019 food deliveries. Fairfield, Hermit Park, Castletown and Nathan Plaza Woolworths supermarkets are closed. The eight remaining stores in Townsville are open and trading. In Cairns all stores are open and trading, in Ingham stores are receiving stock from Townsville and in Ayr stores are receiving supplies from road in Brisbane. Anandji said two charter planes carrying 30 tonnes of fresh food and essential items would arrive in Cairns on Tuesday, with more to follow in the days ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do all we can to get stock into far north Queensland while the roads are cut, so our customers can shop with the confidence we\u2019ll have stock as and when they need it,\u201d she said. Woolworths has given a statement on its food deliveries for Townsville and Cairns. Tina Anandji, Woolworths\u2019 northern Queensland operations manager, said road access into Townsville had been challenging and supplies would be brought in by a barge. It is not expected to arrive until Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve secured a barge to deliver 300 tonnes of fresh food, nappies, baby formula and other essential items. The barge will be dispatched from Mackay and is expected to arrive in Townsville on Thursday,\u201d she said. She said Woolworths was relying on 30 contingency containers in the meantime \u201ccarrying essential lines such as water, long-life milk, baby formula, beans, noodles and toilet paper, which we\u2019re drawing on to increase the stock in our stores\u201d. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a stressful time for many, and thank our customers for their patience as our team works to fill shelves and serve local shoppers,\u201d she said. Bill Shorten has just made some fairly strong statements linking extreme weather \u2013 the flooding in Townsville and fires in Tasmania \u2013 to climate change. The Labor leader says from Huonville in Tasmania that \u201ceven Australia\u2019s most extreme climate deniers\u201d would have to accept that extreme weather events are becoming more common and that \u201cclimate change is having some effect\u201d. \u201cIt is legitimate to talk about climate change. If we can\u2019t talk about climate change now, with the range of weather events that we\u2019ve got, when will we ever be able to talk about climate change?\u201d Authorities have now issued an emergency alert for Charters Towers, south-west of Townsville. There is a major flood alert for the Burdekin River. The Macrossan Bridge, about 15km from Charters Towers, is expected to be closed for several days. Supermarkets, where possible, are chartering planes to get food and supplies to Townsville and Cairns. The Queensland state general manager of Coles, Jenny Farrell, says: \u201cColes has chartered a plane to deliver fresh produce, groceries and flour to flood-affected Townsville and Cairns customers. \u201cThe plane will land in Cairns this afternoon and half the load will be trucked to Townsville on recently reopened roads.\u201d The plane is due to land in Cairns at 1pm. Farrell says Coles is also investigating alternative delivery routes from Adelaide and Darwin to try to truck in food to other flood-affected areas in far north Queensland. \u201cColes would like to thank our local suppliers, who have helped keep fresh milk, eggs and produce in stores wherever possible,\u201d she said. Police are warning that people from Cardwell, north of Townsville, to Mackay should prepare for possible significant flash flooding. \u201cWe are still in response phase,\u201d the police deputy commissioner and state disaster coordinator, Bob Gee, said. \u201cIt\u2019s really critical that we don\u2019t have a false sense of security. People need to stay away.\u201d Annastacia Palaszczuk says the likely cost of the floods will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Explaining the decision to open the floodgates to the Ross River dam, she says: \u201cWe cannot control the weather \u2026 (the monsoon) it dumped a huge amount of water, the water needed to be released.\u201d Palaszczuk says authorities will soon turn their focus to the recovery, including financial assistance for impacted families. \u201cI know Queenslanders will come together and help people that are impacted,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are going to be here standing with you \u2026 to ensure you get the assistance that is needed.\u201d The Townsville mayor, Jenny Hill, is reassuring the media that the Ross River dam is safe. There appear to be some concerns, locally, about this. Hill criticises what she calls \u201carmchair critics\u201d on Facebook who are raising fears about the dam. \u201cThe dam has done its job,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThe integrity of the dam is fine.\u201d The police deputy commissioner, Bob Gee, says one man is in custody over an alleged break and enter. Otherwise he assures residents that their properties are safe. On public safety, he says: In Townsville we expect that, we hope if rain will go away, but even if it goes away, we will still be in response phase for at least a little while yet. It is really critical that we don\u2019t have a false sense of security. People need to stay away. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is addressing the media now, along with emergency services officials. Palaszczuk congratulates emergency services officials for their efforts overnight. She says 1,100 people were relocated with the help of authorities. There were also 18 swift-water rescues. But her key message is: \u201cWe\u2019re not out of this yet.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s going to be heavy rainfall over the next couple of days,\u201d she says. \u201cThere will also be damaging wind gusts and intense rainfall with significant flash flooding. So, once again, our message is if you don\u2019t need to be out on the roads, please don\u2019t.\u201d Here\u2019s another look from the air, courtesy of Queensland Fire and Emergency Services. Sue Oates, a hydrologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, has been speaking on ABC radio. Oates says that the Ross River dam hit the 43-metre mark last night before the floodgates were opened. At this stage, major flooding is expected to continue throughout the day and into Tuesday before any \u201ceasing\u201d in Townsville. Complicating those predictions, Oates says, is the possibility of further rainfall. She says there is another band approaching, but it\u2019s forecast to move through the area \u201cfairly rapidly\u201d. Currently it\u2019s expected to produce only about an hour of rain, or about 30mm. If you have pictures or video of the floods that you are happy for the Guardian to publish, please contact our picture editor, Carly Earl (carly.earl@theguardian.com). But please observe warnings about entering flood waters and don\u2019t take any personal risk to take a photo. This is some pretty incredible footage from above Townsville\u2019s Black Weir. The Queensland Disaster Management Committee met this morning. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is expected to provide an update on the situation in about half an hour. Here is some information about the best way to donate to help those impacted by the floods. The flood waters are putting pressure on Townsville\u2019s water treatment plant and have resulted in burst water pipes in some parts of the city. As a result, residents are being urged to conserve water. It\u2019s not just people in Townsville and surrounding areas who are being affected by the floods crisis. Flooded highways mean routes to far north Queensland are blocked and it\u2019s resulted in bare food shelves at some supermarkets in towns north of Townsville, such as Cairns. This graph from the Townsville council gives a fair indication of how quickly the Ross River dam has filled. As Ben noted, the Ross River dam is expected to peak about 11am Queensland time \u2013 so in about one hour and 15 minutes. Earlier, people had been heading to the dam to view the spectacle. It\u2019s now closed to the public. There are about 1,000 people at five evacuation centres across Townsville. My colleague Ben Smee notes: Since 1940, Townsville\u2019s average yearly rainfall is 1129.7mm. Since Sunday the rain gauge at Townsville airport has measured 977.2mm. That\u2019s approaching a year\u2019s rainfall in eight days. Ingham, to the north of Townsville, had an extraordinary 419mm of rain yesterday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. The airport is now closed. On ABC North Queensland, we\u2019ve heard that about 16,500 homes have been without power. These are the text messages that Townsville residents received last night as flood levels quickly rose. Still, today, residents in some areas are being told to find higher ground. On Sunday the Townsville council posted a map showing which homes might be inundated by rising flood waters. Most estimates suggest up to 20,000 homes may be impacted. The Ross River dam was at 236% capacity at 7am local time. It is dropping about 1% in capacity every hour, despite the release of 1,900 cubic metres a minute from the open floodgates. Authorities decided to release the large amounts of water on Sunday night in response to the risk that the dam would fail. Disaster plans show most of the city would be inundated if the dam does collapse. In the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s words the release was \u201cto make sure the water had somewhere to go\u201d. Any drop in the dam\u2019s volume is positive news. But the potential for more heavy rainfall remains. At this stage, authorities expect the Ross River to peak about 11am, and for the peak to last most of today. That\u2019s potentially good news for Townsville residents, especially those under threat but not yet underwater. It\u2019s also a sign that the flood emergency is unlikely to end any time soon. The local disaster management committee is meeting at 9am, after which locals should be given updated advice. Overnight, Townsville residents were warned to stay out of the water \u2013 and for good reason. A number of crocodiles sightings have been reported, while the authorities also warned of snakes in the water. Officials made the difficult decision to open the floodgates of Townsville\u2019s Ross River dam overnight. The dam was at nearly 250% capacity at midnight. As the floodgates opened at 8pm, the waterlogged city was inundated with another 1,900 litres of water a second. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told the Nine network: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. In Queensland, of course, we\u2019re used to seeing natural disasters, but Townsville has never seen the likes of this.\u201d Palaszczuk said there were more than 900 people in evacuation centres and that number was expected to increase during the day. Hello and thanks for joining our coverage of the Queensland floods, described by the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, as a \u201conce-in-a-century flood\u201d. My name is Luke Henriques-Gomes. Over the past 24 hours, the Queensland Fire and Emergency received 850 calls for help. Among those rescued were two police officers who became caught in the flood waters. There are fears for about 20,000 homes in what is now being called Townsville\u2019s worst flood on record, with the local Ross River dam now at about 242% capacity. Emergency warnings are in place for 21 suburbs. Please stay with us for rolling coverage of the day\u2019s events.",

      "bodyText": "After eight days of heavy monsoonal rain, authorities in the north Queensland city of Townsville had no choice but to open the floodgates of the Ross River Dam, deliberately flooding about 2,000 homes. The decision was made as the Queensland government also published a warning to people to beware of crocodiles, snakes and other wildlife, which were reported to have left the swollen river and headed into some suburban areas. Some parts of Queensland have had more than 1.5m of rain since last weekend. At Ingham, north of Townsville, 419mm fell in a single day on Sunday. At Townsville almost 1m was recorded at Townsville airport across eight days of torrential rain. The average annual rainfall for the same weather gauge is 1127.9mm. Rescue operations \u2013 some conducted by the State Emergency Service, some by helpful locals in their single-motor fishing boats \u2013 to help residents escape the floodwaters in low-lying city suburbs were still underway late on Monday. In parts of north Queensland, monsoonal rains have bucketed more water in eight days than in a typical year. The Ross River dam above Townsville was measured at a remarkable 247% capacity on Sunday night before the decision was made to release more water, in an attempt to avert a catastrophic collapse. With the floodgates fully open, about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second was released. That stabilised the dam, which on Monday afternoon was holding 523,475 megalitres, or 225% its typical capacity. But the fast-flowing water release caused the Ross River to break its banks and inundate several low-lying areas on Townsville\u2019s south side. Near the suburb of Idalia, a flooded road was transformed into a temporary boat ramp by residents, who used their single-motor fishing boats to help people escape their flooded homes. About 1,000 people spent Sunday night in evacuation shelters, and emergency services conducted 18 \u201cswiftwater\u201d rescues, where people were pulled from flowing floodwaters. The Ross River reached its peak about 11am on Monday and was expected to remain at that level until late on Tuesday night. But the weather remains unpredictable, with a monsoon trough still hovering above north Queensland, and threatening to bucket more rain on the region. Schools were closed and students will be told to remain at home on Tuesday. With the Bruce Highway cut to the north and south of Townsville, supermarkets began to run short of food. Fears of critical shortages were allayed when the Townsville airport was reopened about 2pm and supplies were able to be flown in. Residents were also warned to conserve water as it flowed through town; the flooding caused pipes to burst at the Douglas water treatment plant. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she had \u201cnever seen\u201d a flood like this before. She said the floodgates had to be opened \u201cto make sure the water had somewhere to go\u201d. Palaszczuk warned people on Monday afternoon that the threat of flash-flooding remained, and that residents should not to be complacent. \u201cAs we know there is still heavy rainfall across the area, this monsoonal trough doesn\u2019t seem to want to move much at all,\u201d Palaszczuk said. The state\u2019s disaster coordinator, deputy police commissioner Bob Gee, told people not to drive unless necessary. \u201cWe are still in response phase,\u201d Gee said. \u201cIt\u2019s really critical that we don\u2019t have a false sense of security, people need to stay away.\u201d Queensland\u2019s environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, warned residents about the dangers posed by crocodiles. \u201cCrocodiles prefer calmer waters and they may move around in search of a quiet place to wait for floodwaters to recede,\u201d she said. \u201cCrocodiles may be seen crossing roads and, when flooding recedes, crocodiles can turn up in unusual places such as farm dams or waterholes where they have not been seen before. \u201cSimilarly, snakes are very good swimmers and they too may turn up unexpectedly.\u201d Andrew Roberts said he was more worried about being eaten by a crocodile in his Townsville home than chest-high water surging through the ground floor. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit scary because, when it floods in Townsville, the crocs get into the water.\u201d Roberts, who lives in low-lying Hermit Park, was also angry about the decision to release water from the Ross River dam. \u201cWe were lambs to the slaughter,\u201d he said. \u201cOur homes have been sacrificed to save the rest of Townsville. It should never have been this bad. Why didn\u2019t they have releases earlier and give the water a chance to get away? \u201cHeads should roll over this.\u201d Roberts insists the water won\u2019t reach their second storey and they will not leave their home of 14 years as they have an electricity generator, food, water and a radio. \u201cIt has been a hair-raising experience but ... I would rather be sitting here than in a shelter for the next week not knowing what the hell is going on with what we have here.\u201d Neighbour Paul Shafer understood the decision to open the floodgates was necessary, but knows he is paying the price. He watched the floodwaters rising under his home for days before he finally left on Sunday when he heard the dam floodgates would be fully opened. \u201cIt was just getting too dicey,\u201d he said. He used a kayak to paddle his wife, daughters and the family dog to safety, then he and a neighbour walked out through chest-high water pushing a dog on a boogie board. Shafter has lost two cars, a truck and a caravan in the flood along with the renovated lower level of his Queenslander. Prof Jamie Pittock from the Fenner School of Environment and Society at the Australian National University said the need to spill water from the dam highlighted the limits to using dams for flood control. \u201cDams cannot control the biggest floods,\u201d Pittock said. \u201cLarge flood return frequency is projected to worsen with climate change.\u201d",

I\u2019d try to guess what might be on the programme the next morning and then fret about how I would deal with that particular topic, discussion or contributor. It was utterly pointless \u2013 I would lose sleep through worrying about a scenario or sequence of events that only really existed in my head.</p> <p>Gradually, as I gained experience, the sensation eased, and what remains is what I think of as a healthy and \u2013 for me \u2013 necessary degree of nerves. I would never want to be complacent, and so I like to have a certain on-the-edge-of-my-seat feeling about work. What has really helped me is to think about channelling my nerves towards the result I seek. That in turn makes me focus on the process \u2013 picking out the most salient part of a brief, looking up a nugget of information, zeroing in on a good question \u2013 rather than the big picture which might be daunting or even overwhelming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e61c4f5f6cd52deb478ad8832b4b9f33a81deb5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e61c4f5f6cd52deb478ad8832b4b9f33a81deb5b/0_1657_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mishal Husain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mishal Husain: \u2018Always have a little more than you need.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I often think back to advice that Libby Purves, a former Today presenter, gave me before I started on the programme: \u201cAlways have a little more than you need.\u201d Being forearmed also helps to keep the doubts and niggling anxieties in check.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/18/mishal-husain-interview-name-like-mine-career-only-possible-britain\" title=\"\">The Skills by Mishal Husain</a>, published by Fourth Estate, is out now</em></p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t let anyone else judge your coping mechanisms\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Marian Keyes, </strong><em>novelist</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a78594b22cbc24812ed4b5357181a0ca30c8bb5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78594b22cbc24812ed4b5357181a0ca30c8bb5f/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marian Keyes: \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of mindfulness.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marian Keyes: \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of mindfulness.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a time when I thought I had to say yes to everything I was asked to do, and taking on too much would leave me feeling very stressed. There\u2019s always a battle between my people-pleasing instincts and the fact that my limitations are quite narrow, but I\u2019ve learned to accept those limitations and not over-promise. I\u2019ve learned to say no.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a fan of mindfulness. When I had a breakdown, several people told me to try it, and I did, because I was willing to try anything. But being in the present moment made me even more agitated. I subsequently discovered that mindfulness shouldn\u2019t be practised by people in the throes of an acute depressive episode. That really annoyed me because people throw out advice as if they\u2019re all psychiatrists.</p> <p>I think people should manage stress in whatever way works for them \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone else judge your coping mechanisms. I used to bake, and now I upcycle furniture, which I love. I do it less when I\u2019m writing, because disappearing into my characters is also very calming. Another thing that I find immensely helpful is reading crime novels. A nice straightforward police procedural where nothing terrible happens to anyone and by the end it\u2019s all OK in some fashion. That kind of self-contained world is comforting.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273/273732/the-break/9781405918756.html\" title=\"\">The Break</a> by Marian Keyes is out now in paperback, \u00a37.99</em></p> <h2>\u2018Boxing, strength training or running makes a difference\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Clara Amfo, </strong><em>Radio 1 DJ</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4f4897744bc6a529de2e9eda97bc89226986c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4f4897744bc6a529de2e9eda97bc89226986c8/0_157_8179_4908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clara Amfo: \u2018Getting eight hours definitely makes me less anxious throughout the day.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clara Amfo: \u2018Getting eight hours definitely makes me less anxious throughout the day.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I feel stressed when I feel unprepared. I like to research things meticulously, so If someone is coming on my radio show, or I\u2019m hosting something on TV, I need to have all the material as soon as possible. If I don\u2019t, I feel very anxious. When I\u2019m stressed for longer periods, I stutter a lot, my skin goes to hell and my short-term memory becomes laughable.</p> <p>When it comes to countering stress, I\u2019ve realised the necessity of physical activity. I really feel the difference in my mood when I take the time to go boxing, do strength training or just grab my trainers for a run. I started running in 2015 because I had FOMO (fear of missing out) from my mates who were in a running club. I hated it at first, then after training for my first half marathon I began depending on it as my stress relief. I\u2019ve also become much more strict with my bedtime. Getting eight hours definitely makes me less anxious throughout the day. Corny as it sounds, the best advice I\u2019d give is the same advice friends have given to me \u2013 \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. Feeling stressed and anxious can be frustrating and crippling, but it can\u2019t last for ever.</p> <p><em>Clara Amfo will host the The BRIT Awards 2019: Red Carpet</em><em>. </em><em>ITV2, 20 Feb</em></p> <h2>\u2018Keeping a daily diary can be very therapeutic\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Henry Marsh, </strong><em>Neurosurgeon and author</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28aa1108546f0510732196545afcee8c2bbdaf2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28aa1108546f0510732196545afcee8c2bbdaf2f/359_1671_2633_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Marsh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Marsh: \u2018Over time, I got better at being open about my problems.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a neurosurgeon, I was in a state of mild chronic anxiety all the time. Surgery is intensely stressful \u2013 not so much the actual operating, as having to deal with patients and their families afterwards when things have gone badly. I never resented the anxiety, as I never doubted the value and importance of my work, and it seemed (and still seems) an appropriate price to pay for the privilege of being a surgeon.</p> <p>It helped to remind myself that I had been through similar crises before and survived, even if the poor patient hadn\u2019t. Physical exercise has always been extremely important for me; there are few problems that are not helped by a long walk or run, and I still try to run every day. I also find that writing, in particular keeping a daily diary, can be very therapeutic.</p> <p>Talking to colleagues can be helpful as well; only they can properly understand what it feels like when a patient comes to harm. Over time, I got better at being open about my problems. It is only human to make mistakes. My advice? Ask for help. Have good colleagues.

If I\u2019m worried about a specific tackle, I imagine it going amazingly, and really feel every sensation of that great tackle. It makes a big difference.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned through working with a sports psychologist that music is also a really powerful tool. I use carefully chosen playlists to regulate my mood \u2013 whether that\u2019s to try and pump myself up and feel like a million dollars before a match, or to try and wind down when I\u2019m experiencing stress relating to injury. Being injured is a very specific kind of stress. One of the most anxious periods of my career was in 2017 when I had toe surgery and wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be able to play rugby again.</p> <p>I run a couple of businesses outside of rugby, and time management can be another source of stress. When I have a million things going through my head, writing notes of the most important things can help stop my mind racing. An important lesson has been remembering to only worry about what you can control. You can\u2019t control other people or situations that are out of your hands, you can only control your response.</p> <p><em>Cooking for Fitness by James Haskell is out now in hardback for \u00a319.95</em></p> <h2>\u2018Things improve if I swim regularly and eat well\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Jess Phillips, </strong><em>Labour MP</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f46ea7ca22a47af77cf05e15ebf92ce407df8234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f46ea7ca22a47af77cf05e15ebf92ce407df8234/144_1259_3650_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jess Phillips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Phillips: \u2018When my anxiety is at its worst, I cannot brush off even the smallest worry.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio de Paolo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In politics, things change rapidly, and I find myself cancelling plans and running late, which I find very stressful. I feel obligated not to let people down, so it\u2019s hard when votes shift or sudden urgent debates are called. I also juggle a lot of harrowing cases, such as people being wrongly deported, or families facing eviction and homelessness. It can be stressful thinking you might drop a ball that is someone\u2019s life. All this goes on with the background noise of people feeling perfectly happy to tell you how much they hate you, how awful you are at your job and how they hope you lose it.</p> <p>When my anxiety is at its worst, I cannot brush off even the smallest worry. I also struggle with sleep and feel physically sick. The week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-cox\" title=\"\">Jo Cox</a> was killed, we voted to leave the EU and the prime minister resigned, I was sick pretty much every day. I do find things improve if I swim regularly. Taking the time to quietly think is calming, and regular exercise is helpful for getting to sleep. Eating well also helps, as well as actually doing stuff with my kids, such as cooking, rather than just watching telly together, which is just existing in the same space. When things are really bad I take medication for my anxiety and sleeplessness.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a natural sharer, but following a very severe episode of anxiety, I\u2019ve learned to be more honest and tell people how I\u2019m feeling. That\u2019s the best advice I can give \u2013 speak to someone. It helps.</p> <p><em>Everywoman by Jess Phillips is published by Hutchinson (\u00a38.99).

There was a lot of chaos when I was growing up: my mum left when I was one year-old, my dad was in and out of my life. I\u2019d get belly aches, but the doctors couldn\u2019t find a physical cause. It wasn\u2019t until I was about 27 that I had a name for it.</p> <p>It was during a period when I was working ridiculous hours, either in the studio or travelling. Most of what I do is performance-based, so there\u2019s a lot of adrenaline that comes with it. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, so I went to the doctor, who prescribed me Valium. That came with its own set of problems.</p> <p>Now I\u2019ve learned how important it is to give myself routines: I exercise, I have a hot bath, I put my phone away and go to bed early. They are seemingly simple things that a lot of us forget to do, but consistency is key. Being in the studio is a helpful outlet, it\u2019s therapy.</p> <p>Having a dog is also an important part of my wellbeing: no matter what, I have to look after him. Come rain or shine, I always feel better when I get home from walking Arthur.</p> <h2>\u2018Morning Bikram yoga helped me switch off\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Mabel, </strong><em>singer-songwriter</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"124b9dd1487d5c795b8b0276ac0bfd347f6f7875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124b9dd1487d5c795b8b0276ac0bfd347f6f7875/0_850_5792_7236/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mabel: \u2018I can feel really anxious before big performances, and think, \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mabel: \u2018I can feel really anxious before big performances, and think, \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When 9/11 happened, I was five years-old and at my first day of school \u2013 it\u2019s one of the first times I remember feeling really anxious. It lasted until my late teens. I also had a lot of social anxiety, and when I was 15 or 16 it caused me to leave school and be home-schooled. Lots of creative people struggle with similar things, so my parents [singer-songwriter Neneh Cherry and record producer Cameron McVey] were very understanding.</p> <p>What helped me the most was to take up exercise every day. I went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/19/hot-or-not-bikram-no-more-beneficial-than-any-other-yoga-says-vascular-study\" title=\"\">Bikram yoga</a> at 6.30am pretty much daily for two years. I was exhausted from constantly putting myself down, so having a daily routine whereby I could switch off from that was really good.</p> <p>These days, when I feel stressed it\u2019s because I\u2019ve lost perspective. I can feel really anxious before big performances, and think \u201cthis is insane, I can\u2019t do this\u201d. The solution can be as simple as telling everyone I need a minute, taking a deep breath and focusing on 10 things that are happening that are really sick. Usually the good things outweigh the bad. When I push through that fear, that\u2019s when I feel my best, and amazing things happen.</p> <p><em>Mabel\u2019s single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQKyDD9Yig\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Call Me Up</a>, is out now</em></p> <h2>\u2018Be approachable and understand your team\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Angela Hartnett, </strong><em>Chef</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cdf7b68432ca026b974411ef8aa7e04f18d9494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cdf7b68432ca026b974411ef8aa7e04f18d9494/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Hartnett has learned to stop and take five minutes when things go wrong in the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Hartnett has learned to stop and take five minutes when things go wrong in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I\u2019m feeling stressed in the kitchen, I can get quite quiet and irritable. If food isn\u2019t going out quickly enough, or something goes wrong, I\u2019ve learned to stop and take five minutes. It\u2019s important to address smaller issues as they arise, dealing with the situation as calmly as possible means that it doesn\u2019t spiral out of control.</p> <p>When it comes to bigger problems, you shouldn\u2019t jump in straight away. If the situation allows, then sleep on it or think about what\u2019s bothering you. Things can look easier the next day. Emails really up my anxiety levels, so I always pick up the phone or speak to someone face to face if I can.</p> <p>Years ago, when I was at the Connaught, stressed and quite new to being a head chef, Richard Corrigan told me one of the most important things is to get to know your team. They might travel for two hours each day, or have other things going on outside of work, and as an employer, being approachable and understanding the team is key. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned to try and guide people, but also to let them deal with things themselves \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be like a kindergarten teacher.

I try to focus on the present, and do all I can to mitigate the downsides \u2013 it\u2019s all anyone can do. It can also be really productive to have a cup of tea and think about the source of your stress, then write down practical steps to solve your problem or manage the situation.</p> <p>Sometimes I feel stressed when I\u2019m being pulled in too many directions, but I\u2019ve learned to focus on one thing at a time, rather than do a million things at once. Exercise helps to get me out of a work mindset. I always try to include some physical activity in my day: tennis or kitesurfing if I\u2019m on Necker, or a walk, gym session or a run if I\u2019m travelling. I often find that solutions come to me when I\u2019m allowing my mind that bit of time to relax.</p> <p>It\u2019s better to focus on learning, developing and trying to solve problems rather than to dwell on them.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1097278/finding-my-virginity/9780753556139.html\" title=\"\">Finding my Virginity</a> by Richard Branson out now in paperback, \u00a39.99</em></p> <h2>\u2018Knowing I\u2019ve rehearsed enough helps me to relax\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Melanie C, </strong><em>Singer-songwriter</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve got the Spice Girls tour this summer, playing to huge stadiums. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/05/spice-girls-announce-reunion-tour-without-victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">It\u2019s very exciting</a>, but also anxiety ridden, because it\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve toured, and we want the show to be incredible for the fans who\u2019ve waited so long. Adrenaline is a great thing for a performer, but it can get the better of you.</p> <p>When I\u2019m going into a stressful scenario, feeling prepared and knowing that I\u2019ve rehearsed enough helps me to relax. I\u2019ve practised yoga on and off for about 20 years, and I\u2019ve learned that controlling my breathing is another good way to stay calm. I\u2019ve also done a couple of mindfulness courses, which I found really helpful. I was taught to set a positive intention every day \u2013 mine is often \u201cI will be patient and tolerant today\u201d. Just repeating those words a few times can really set the tone for your day, rather than leaping out of bed thinking \u201cOh god, I\u2019ve not paid that bill, and I\u2019m running late\u201d.</p> <p>Everyone knows what it\u2019s like to have difficulty sleeping, or experience that very uncomfortable feeling of anxiety where your breathing is very high in your chest or your heart is beating rapidly. But so many of the things we get wound up about don\u2019t really matter. If I forget a few words on stage, nobody dies. It can be hard to keep perspective when you\u2019re caught up in your anxiety, but it\u2019s important to remind yourself that everything is always OK in the end.</p> <h2>\u2018If I can go to bed knowing I did my best today, I\u2019m happy\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Gina Miller, </strong><em>Business owner and campaigner</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"432b2029bccb6f244d6dd24849ad80bc892d1268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/432b2029bccb6f244d6dd24849ad80bc892d1268/0_367_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller only has four hours sleep a night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller only has four hours sleep a night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I worked in financial services, as part of a female-led business, I found that pitching to very male-dominated boards created stress. When we\u2019re anxious we tend to shrink into a defeatist position, curving our shoulders or backs. Learning to stand straight, take a breath and speak slowly helps to project a sense of confidence, relieving some of that anxiety.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a vocal campaigner for nearly 15 years, which has made me very good at making enemies. I don\u2019t take it home as much as you\u2019d imagine because I\u2019ve never been somebody who worries whether people like me. I\u2019d recommend it, because caring about what people think is a terrible, terrible burden. I have a \u201cpillow test\u201d \u2013 can I go to bed tonight knowing that I did my best today?

      "bodyText": "\u2018I like to have an on-the-edge-of-my-seat feeling\u2019 Mishal Husain, BBC news presenter When I started presenting the Today programme, in 2013, I had a tight knot in my stomach the night before every shift. I\u2019d try to guess what might be on the programme the next morning and then fret about how I would deal with that particular topic, discussion or contributor. It was utterly pointless \u2013 I would lose sleep through worrying about a scenario or sequence of events that only really existed in my head. Gradually, as I gained experience, the sensation eased, and what remains is what I think of as a healthy and \u2013 for me \u2013 necessary degree of nerves. I would never want to be complacent, and so I like to have a certain on-the-edge-of-my-seat feeling about work. What has really helped me is to think about channelling my nerves towards the result I seek. That in turn makes me focus on the process \u2013 picking out the most salient part of a brief, looking up a nugget of information, zeroing in on a good question \u2013 rather than the big picture which might be daunting or even overwhelming. I often think back to advice that Libby Purves, a former Today presenter, gave me before I started on the programme: \u201cAlways have a little more than you need.\u201d Being forearmed also helps to keep the doubts and niggling anxieties in check. The Skills by Mishal Husain, published by Fourth Estate, is out now \u2018Don\u2019t let anyone else judge your coping mechanisms\u2019 Marian Keyes, novelist There was a time when I thought I had to say yes to everything I was asked to do, and taking on too much would leave me feeling very stressed. There\u2019s always a battle between my people-pleasing instincts and the fact that my limitations are quite narrow, but I\u2019ve learned to accept those limitations and not over-promise. I\u2019ve learned to say no. I\u2019m not a fan of mindfulness. When I had a breakdown, several people told me to try it, and I did, because I was willing to try anything. But being in the present moment made me even more agitated. I subsequently discovered that mindfulness shouldn\u2019t be practised by people in the throes of an acute depressive episode. That really annoyed me because people throw out advice as if they\u2019re all psychiatrists. I think people should manage stress in whatever way works for them \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone else judge your coping mechanisms. I used to bake, and now I upcycle furniture, which I love. I do it less when I\u2019m writing, because disappearing into my characters is also very calming. Another thing that I find immensely helpful is reading crime novels. A nice straightforward police procedural where nothing terrible happens to anyone and by the end it\u2019s all OK in some fashion. That kind of self-contained world is comforting. The Break by Marian Keyes is out now in paperback, \u00a37.99 \u2018Boxing, strength training or running makes a difference\u2019 Clara Amfo, Radio 1 DJ I feel stressed when I feel unprepared. I like to research things meticulously, so If someone is coming on my radio show, or I\u2019m hosting something on TV, I need to have all the material as soon as possible. If I don\u2019t, I feel very anxious. When I\u2019m stressed for longer periods, I stutter a lot, my skin goes to hell and my short-term memory becomes laughable. When it comes to countering stress, I\u2019ve realised the necessity of physical activity. I really feel the difference in my mood when I take the time to go boxing, do strength training or just grab my trainers for a run. I started running in 2015 because I had FOMO (fear of missing out) from my mates who were in a running club. I hated it at first, then after training for my first half marathon I began depending on it as my stress relief. I\u2019ve also become much more strict with my bedtime. Getting eight hours definitely makes me less anxious throughout the day. Corny as it sounds, the best advice I\u2019d give is the same advice friends have given to me \u2013 \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d. Feeling stressed and anxious can be frustrating and crippling, but it can\u2019t last for ever. Clara Amfo will host the The BRIT Awards 2019: Red Carpet. ITV2, 20 Feb \u2018Keeping a daily diary can be very therapeutic\u2019 Henry Marsh, Neurosurgeon and author As a neurosurgeon, I was in a state of mild chronic anxiety all the time. Surgery is intensely stressful \u2013 not so much the actual operating, as having to deal with patients and their families afterwards when things have gone badly. I never resented the anxiety, as I never doubted the value and importance of my work, and it seemed (and still seems) an appropriate price to pay for the privilege of being a surgeon. It helped to remind myself that I had been through similar crises before and survived, even if the poor patient hadn\u2019t. Physical exercise has always been extremely important for me; there are few problems that are not helped by a long walk or run, and I still try to run every day. I also find that writing, in particular keeping a daily diary, can be very therapeutic. Talking to colleagues can be helpful as well; only they can properly understand what it feels like when a patient comes to harm. Over time, I got better at being open about my problems. It is only human to make mistakes. My advice? Ask for help. Have good colleagues. Be a good colleague in return. Admissions: A Life in Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh is published by Orion (\u00a38.99).

If I\u2019m worried about a specific tackle, I imagine it going amazingly, and really feel every sensation of that great tackle. It makes a big difference. I\u2019ve learned through working with a sports psychologist that music is also a really powerful tool. I use carefully chosen playlists to regulate my mood \u2013 whether that\u2019s to try and pump myself up and feel like a million dollars before a match, or to try and wind down when I\u2019m experiencing stress relating to injury. Being injured is a very specific kind of stress. One of the most anxious periods of my career was in 2017 when I had toe surgery and wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be able to play rugby again. I run a couple of businesses outside of rugby, and time management can be another source of stress. When I have a million things going through my head, writing notes of the most important things can help stop my mind racing. An important lesson has been remembering to only worry about what you can control. You can\u2019t control other people or situations that are out of your hands, you can only control your response. Cooking for Fitness by James Haskell is out now in hardback for \u00a319.95 \u2018Things improve if I swim regularly and eat well\u2019 Jess Phillips, Labour MP In politics, things change rapidly, and I find myself cancelling plans and running late, which I find very stressful. I feel obligated not to let people down, so it\u2019s hard when votes shift or sudden urgent debates are called. I also juggle a lot of harrowing cases, such as people being wrongly deported, or families facing eviction and homelessness. It can be stressful thinking you might drop a ball that is someone\u2019s life. All this goes on with the background noise of people feeling perfectly happy to tell you how much they hate you, how awful you are at your job and how they hope you lose it. When my anxiety is at its worst, I cannot brush off even the smallest worry. I also struggle with sleep and feel physically sick. The week that Jo Cox was killed, we voted to leave the EU and the prime minister resigned, I was sick pretty much every day. I do find things improve if I swim regularly. Taking the time to quietly think is calming, and regular exercise is helpful for getting to sleep. Eating well also helps, as well as actually doing stuff with my kids, such as cooking, rather than just watching telly together, which is just existing in the same space. When things are really bad I take medication for my anxiety and sleeplessness. I\u2019m not a natural sharer, but following a very severe episode of anxiety, I\u2019ve learned to be more honest and tell people how I\u2019m feeling. That\u2019s the best advice I can give \u2013 speak to someone. It helps. Everywoman by Jess Phillips is published by Hutchinson (\u00a38.99).

Phone orders min p&amp;p of \u00a31.99 \u2018I have a bath, put my phone away and go to bed early\u2019 Professor Green, rapper and documentary maker I had experience of stress and anxiety before I even knew what they were \u2013 and definitely before I had the tools to cope with them. There was a lot of chaos when I was growing up: my mum left when I was one year-old, my dad was in and out of my life. I\u2019d get belly aches, but the doctors couldn\u2019t find a physical cause. It wasn\u2019t until I was about 27 that I had a name for it. It was during a period when I was working ridiculous hours, either in the studio or travelling. Most of what I do is performance-based, so there\u2019s a lot of adrenaline that comes with it. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, so I went to the doctor, who prescribed me Valium. That came with its own set of problems. Now I\u2019ve learned how important it is to give myself routines: I exercise, I have a hot bath, I put my phone away and go to bed early. They are seemingly simple things that a lot of us forget to do, but consistency is key. Being in the studio is a helpful outlet, it\u2019s therapy. Having a dog is also an important part of my wellbeing: no matter what, I have to look after him. Come rain or shine, I always feel better when I get home from walking Arthur. \u2018Morning Bikram yoga helped me switch off\u2019 Mabel, singer-songwriter When 9/11 happened, I was five years-old and at my first day of school \u2013 it\u2019s one of the first times I remember feeling really anxious. It lasted until my late teens. I also had a lot of social anxiety, and when I was 15 or 16 it caused me to leave school and be home-schooled. Lots of creative people struggle with similar things, so my parents [singer-songwriter Neneh Cherry and record producer Cameron McVey] were very understanding. What helped me the most was to take up exercise every day. I went to Bikram yoga at 6.30am pretty much daily for two years. I was exhausted from constantly putting myself down, so having a daily routine whereby I could switch off from that was really good. These days, when I feel stressed it\u2019s because I\u2019ve lost perspective. I can feel really anxious before big performances, and think \u201cthis is insane, I can\u2019t do this\u201d. The solution can be as simple as telling everyone I need a minute, taking a deep breath and focusing on 10 things that are happening that are really sick. Usually the good things outweigh the bad. When I push through that fear, that\u2019s when I feel my best, and amazing things happen. Mabel\u2019s single, Don\u2019t Call Me Up, is out now \u2018Be approachable and understand your team\u2019 Angela Hartnett, Chef When I\u2019m feeling stressed in the kitchen, I can get quite quiet and irritable. If food isn\u2019t going out quickly enough, or something goes wrong, I\u2019ve learned to stop and take five minutes. It\u2019s important to address smaller issues as they arise, dealing with the situation as calmly as possible means that it doesn\u2019t spiral out of control. When it comes to bigger problems, you shouldn\u2019t jump in straight away. If the situation allows, then sleep on it or think about what\u2019s bothering you. Things can look easier the next day. Emails really up my anxiety levels, so I always pick up the phone or speak to someone face to face if I can. Years ago, when I was at the Connaught, stressed and quite new to being a head chef, Richard Corrigan told me one of the most important things is to get to know your team. They might travel for two hours each day, or have other things going on outside of work, and as an employer, being approachable and understanding the team is key. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned to try and guide people, but also to let them deal with things themselves \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be like a kindergarten teacher. That balance is important. \u2018It can be productive to have a cup of tea and a think\u2019 Richard Branson, business magnate I\u2019m very fortunate to love what I do, but since I launched my first business more than 50 years ago there have been many stressful situations. Usually, if I feel anxious it\u2019s because I\u2019m worrying about what could happen, not what is happening. I try to focus on the present, and do all I can to mitigate the downsides \u2013 it\u2019s all anyone can do. It can also be really productive to have a cup of tea and think about the source of your stress, then write down practical steps to solve your problem or manage the situation. Sometimes I feel stressed when I\u2019m being pulled in too many directions, but I\u2019ve learned to focus on one thing at a time, rather than do a million things at once. Exercise helps to get me out of a work mindset. I always try to include some physical activity in my day: tennis or kitesurfing if I\u2019m on Necker, or a walk, gym session or a run if I\u2019m travelling. I often find that solutions come to me when I\u2019m allowing my mind that bit of time to relax. It\u2019s better to focus on learning, developing and trying to solve problems rather than to dwell on them. Finding my Virginity by Richard Branson out now in paperback, \u00a39.99 \u2018Knowing I\u2019ve rehearsed enough helps me to relax\u2019 Melanie C, Singer-songwriter I\u2019ve got the Spice Girls tour this summer, playing to huge stadiums. It\u2019s very exciting, but also anxiety ridden, because it\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve toured, and we want the show to be incredible for the fans who\u2019ve waited so long. Adrenaline is a great thing for a performer, but it can get the better of you. When I\u2019m going into a stressful scenario, feeling prepared and knowing that I\u2019ve rehearsed enough helps me to relax. I\u2019ve practised yoga on and off for about 20 years, and I\u2019ve learned that controlling my breathing is another good way to stay calm. I\u2019ve also done a couple of mindfulness courses, which I found really helpful. I was taught to set a positive intention every day \u2013 mine is often \u201cI will be patient and tolerant today\u201d. Just repeating those words a few times can really set the tone for your day, rather than leaping out of bed thinking \u201cOh god, I\u2019ve not paid that bill, and I\u2019m running late\u201d. Everyone knows what it\u2019s like to have difficulty sleeping, or experience that very uncomfortable feeling of anxiety where your breathing is very high in your chest or your heart is beating rapidly. But so many of the things we get wound up about don\u2019t really matter. If I forget a few words on stage, nobody dies. It can be hard to keep perspective when you\u2019re caught up in your anxiety, but it\u2019s important to remind yourself that everything is always OK in the end. \u2018If I can go to bed knowing I did my best today, I\u2019m happy\u2019 Gina Miller, Business owner and campaigner When I worked in financial services, as part of a female-led business, I found that pitching to very male-dominated boards created stress. When we\u2019re anxious we tend to shrink into a defeatist position, curving our shoulders or backs. Learning to stand straight, take a breath and speak slowly helps to project a sense of confidence, relieving some of that anxiety. I\u2019ve been a vocal campaigner for nearly 15 years, which has made me very good at making enemies. I don\u2019t take it home as much as you\u2019d imagine because I\u2019ve never been somebody who worries whether people like me. I\u2019d recommend it, because caring about what people think is a terrible, terrible burden. I have a \u201cpillow test\u201d \u2013 can I go to bed tonight knowing that I did my best today? If I can, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019ve managed to achieve a lot because I sleep very little. I tend to survive on about four hours a night, but when I\u2019m stressed it\u2019s even less. When I\u2019ve gone through a stressful situation, the way I counterbalance it is by allowing time to build up my reserves. I\u2019m not someone who responds very well to things like mindfulness and yoga; I\u2019m impatient and they don\u2019t empty my mind. Instead, I love adrenaline sports such as racing cars and free climbing, which completely distract the part of my brain concerned with professional life. I also find music extraordinarily empowering and therapeutic. You can\u2019t beat a jig around the room to Iggy Pop\u2019s Lust for Life, for instance.

      "body": "<p>For Connor, an overwhelming desire to get to the nearest mirror is one of the first signs. \u201cUsually, I would have already begun picking or scratching other parts on my body if I can\u2019t control the urge,\u201d he says. Connor, like many others, lives with compulsive skin picking: an irresistible urge to pick at or scratch one\u2019s skin that can have disastrous effects on body and mind.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I begin picking, I completely zone out,\u201d he says. The aftermath of a session can last for up to 45 minutes, the result not only of the sore, red skin on his face, but also the rush of \u201cself-loathing and hatred\u201d at what he has done to his appearance.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/skin-picking-disorder/\" title=\"\">Skin-picking disorder</a>, also referred to as excoriation disorder or dermatillomania, is believed to affect <a href=\"http://www.bfrb.org/learn-about-bfrbs/skin-picking-disorder\" title=\"\">as many as one in 20 people</a>. It is among a group of behaviours (along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/23/tearing-our-hair-out-learning-to-treat-compulsive-hair-pulling\" title=\"\">trichotillomania</a> \u2013 compulsive hair-pulling) known as <a href=\"http://www.bfrb.org/learn-about-bfrbs\" title=\"\">body-focused repetitive behaviours</a> (BFRBs) and was recently recognised as a distinct entity in psychiatric classification systems.</p> <p>Those who struggle with this disorder might scratch, pick, rub or dig at their skin with their fingernails or sometimes tools such as tweezers, resulting in wounds, sores and, eventually, scarring. <a href=\"http://www.danielglass.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dr Daniel Glass</a>, a consultant dermatologist at the Dermatology Clinic in London, says patients\u2019 skin \u201ccan be quite deeply damaged\u201d by the behaviour and can present anything from one or two lesions to more than a hundred. The impacts can be psychological as well: \u201cIf we have problems with our skin, it may make us feel low and reluctant to face the world.\u201d</p> <p>Although it is growing, awareness of the condition is still fairly low. \u201cThese are disorders of shame and isolation,\u201d explains the psychologist and BFRB expert <a href=\"http://www.wsps.info/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=75\" title=\"\">Fred Penzel</a>, who is based in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps a lot of people from even seeking treatment \u2013 they\u2019re afraid to reveal that they do this.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anxiety and depression might aggravate or exacerbate the problem, but they're not what causes it</p> <footer> <cite>Fred Penzel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After particularly bad incidences of skin picking, Connor has shunned social events, skipped gym sessions (which normally he loves) and hidden away in his room, he says. \u201cI feel embarrassed by what I\u2019ve done to myself.\u201d</p> <p>Common misconceptions about the disorder can make it very stigmatising, says Penzel, who is a founding member of the science advisory boards of <a href=\"https://iocdf.org/\" title=\"\">the International OCD Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bfrb.org/\" title=\"\">the TLC [Trichotillomania Learning Center] Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors</a>. Although it is classified as an \u201cobsessive-compulsive and related disorder\u201d in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the condition is considered different from obsessive-compulsive disorder, as it is neither self-harm nor necessarily driven by a deeper issue or unresolved trauma.</p> <p>Although skin-picking disorder can appear at any age, the onset is often in childhood or adolescence. Connor, now 24, was at secondary school when he noticed how much more he picked at his skin compared with his friends: \u201cI didn\u2019t seem normal,\u201d he says. Holly Davidson, 38, also recalls picking avidly at her skin as a teenager. By the time she first undertook cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) four months ago to try to stop her compulsive habit, it had become such a part of her life that she burst into tears: \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can stop, because it\u2019s been a part of me for 20 years.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davidson has tried numerous potential solutions over the years, including expensive facials, hypnotherapy and wearing gloves; she says CBT \u2013 one of the most common psychotherapy treatments for the disorder \u2013 has been the most effective. But Penzel says treatment for compulsive skin picking can be complex, depending on the severity of the case and the likely cause.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cadoganclinic.com/dr-anjali-mahto/\" title=\"\">Dr Anjali Mahto</a>, a consultant dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic in London, says she often sees cases of acne excori\u00e9e (a skin-picking disorder in which patients squeeze acne spots or even healthy post-acne skin). \u201cWhen people come to the clinic, what you don\u2019t see are the spots \u2013 you just see the areas of skin that people have gouged out because they\u2019ve tried to get rid of the spots.\u201d</p> <p>Although Connor and Davidson report feeling anxiety, stress and frustration in relation to their skin picking, Penzel says it is a common misunderstanding that it is all down to stress. \u201cPeople do these things when they\u2019re either overstimulated, meaning stressed or even happily excited, or they do it when they\u2019re understimulated, meaning when they\u2019re sedentary or bored. So it provides stimulation when you\u2019re understimulated and it reduces it when you\u2019re overstimulated \u2013 it works either way.\u201d Anxiety and depression don\u2019t cause it either, he says. \u201cThey might aggravate or exacerbate the problem, but they\u2019re not what causes it. That\u2019s important to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Figures suggest that 75% of people affected by skin-picking disorder are female, but Penzel is wary of the picture this paints \u2013 women are more likely to seek treatment than men and there have been few comprehensive studies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhRn1pjBwtL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Close up of my skin showing spots, scars and pigmentation. I have picked my skin for many years now and as I age I can see the damage I\u2019ve caused. When I\u2019m stressed, nervous or bored I can pick at my skin for hours. Not just my face but also my arms, legs and back. I will pick at scabs and create spots when there is nothing there. Obsessive skin picking is an actual disorder called dermatillomania or excoriation (I only found that out a few years ago) and is said to be related to OCD. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve researched a lot and have tried many different techniques to help me combat it. Wearing gloves, covering mirrors, hypnotherapy, facials, skin creams, meditation, mindfulness (to name a few). What I\u2019ve realised is, I don\u2019t recognise when I\u2019m stressed and this can build up until my only outlet to de-stress is to pick. It\u2019s an on going battle but is much better than it used to be (maybe that\u2019s why I can talk about it now). I wanted to share this with you incase you struggle with a smiler thing. Stress, anxiety, OCD can show its self in so many different ways and sometimes we are unaware how its effecting our mind and bodies. As a personal trainer I dedicate my life to my body keeping it fit, strong and healthy and making sure I\u2019m eating the right things. But what I easily can neglect is my mind and my emotions and what is going on on the inside. : : : : : : #keepitreal #skinpicking #OCD #stress #anxiety #anxietyhelp #stressrelief #spots #pigmentation #scaring #emotional #realtalk #dermatillomania #CBT #skinpickingdisorder #realvsfake</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hollyactive/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Holly Davidson</a> (@hollyactive) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2018-04-07T16:07:27+00:00\">Apr 7, 2018 at 9:07am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Jacqueline Kilikita, 26, recalls an incident last year when she picked at the flaking skin on her lips so severely that she ripped off a large piece of skin, causing her bottom lip to bleed heavily. \u201cI also pick the skin on my cuticles and sometimes my scalp, so I researched my symptoms and every single one of them was consistent with dermatillomania.\u201d</p> <p>In her role as beauty editor at the website <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb\" title=\"\">Refinery29 UK</a>, Kilikita <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skin-picking-dermatillomania\" title=\"\">published an account of her experience</a>. \u201cAfter I wrote the article, a colleague mentioned that she suffers, too. The comments also showed me that lots of people are in the same boat. One said it was a relief to know that they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p> <p>Reflexology has been helpful for her, she says, but it is expensive; keeping lip balm and moisturiser on hand is a cheaper way to reduce the compulsion: \u201cIf the skin is moisturised or covered in product, I\u2019m less likely to pick.\u201d Trying CBT is next on her list.</p> <p>Penzel advocates a comprehensive BFRB-specific approach to behavioural therapy that falls under the umbrella of CBT. \u201cWe try to look at the entire clinical picture, everything surrounding the problem that feeds into it, because if you don\u2019t do it comprehensively you\u2019re not really going to get it under control,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Another key issue is a lack of understanding of the disorder and how to treat it within the psychological and medical communities. \u201cA lot of people get some very bad reactions from health professionals \u2013 unfortunately, a lot of it is passed off as bad habits, but it really isn\u2019t,\u201d says Penzel. \u201cThis can rise to a great level of seriousness and it should be taken very seriously.\u201d At extreme levels, he has worked with people who have needed plastic surgery or have contracted secondary infections such as <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/necrotising-fasciitis/\" title=\"\">flesh-eating disease</a> (necrotising fasciitis) as a result of severe skin picking.</p> <p>Connor and Davidson say stigma can be a barrier to getting treatment. Of the \u201chandful\u201d of men to whom Connor has spoken who also experience skin-picking disorder, only a few have told their family, friends and doctors, he says. \u201cThey just don\u2019t feel people will understand their situation, which I completely get.\u201d In fact, he made the decision to share his account of living with skin-picking disorder on Instagram in the hope of creating a support network.</p> <p>Davidson says that, for years, she had no idea that she was suffering from a psychological disorder: \u201cIt was just something I did.\u201d She thinks this lack of awareness is very common. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise that you can get help \u2013 a lot of people do really think they\u2019re strange, that they\u2019ve got this weird thing that nobody else has.\u201d</p> <p><em>If you </em><em>are affected by any of the issues raised in this </em><em>article, contact <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/get-help/anxiety-uk-national-infoline-service/\" title=\"\">Anxiety UK\u2019s national Infoline service</a> on 03444 775 774 or the US-based TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors </em><em>at </em><em><a href=\"https://www.bfrb.org/\" title=\"\">bfrb.org</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "For Connor, an overwhelming desire to get to the nearest mirror is one of the first signs. \u201cUsually, I would have already begun picking or scratching other parts on my body if I can\u2019t control the urge,\u201d he says. Connor, like many others, lives with compulsive skin picking: an irresistible urge to pick at or scratch one\u2019s skin that can have disastrous effects on body and mind. \u201cWhen I begin picking, I completely zone out,\u201d he says. The aftermath of a session can last for up to 45 minutes, the result not only of the sore, red skin on his face, but also the rush of \u201cself-loathing and hatred\u201d at what he has done to his appearance. Skin-picking disorder, also referred to as excoriation disorder or dermatillomania, is believed to affect as many as one in 20 people. It is among a group of behaviours (along with trichotillomania \u2013 compulsive hair-pulling) known as body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs) and was recently recognised as a distinct entity in psychiatric classification systems. Those who struggle with this disorder might scratch, pick, rub or dig at their skin with their fingernails or sometimes tools such as tweezers, resulting in wounds, sores and, eventually, scarring. Dr Daniel Glass, a consultant dermatologist at the Dermatology Clinic in London, says patients\u2019 skin \u201ccan be quite deeply damaged\u201d by the behaviour and can present anything from one or two lesions to more than a hundred. The impacts can be psychological as well: \u201cIf we have problems with our skin, it may make us feel low and reluctant to face the world.\u201d Although it is growing, awareness of the condition is still fairly low. \u201cThese are disorders of shame and isolation,\u201d explains the psychologist and BFRB expert Fred Penzel, who is based in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps a lot of people from even seeking treatment \u2013 they\u2019re afraid to reveal that they do this.\u201d After particularly bad incidences of skin picking, Connor has shunned social events, skipped gym sessions (which normally he loves) and hidden away in his room, he says. \u201cI feel embarrassed by what I\u2019ve done to myself.\u201d Common misconceptions about the disorder can make it very stigmatising, says Penzel, who is a founding member of the science advisory boards of the International OCD Foundation and the TLC [Trichotillomania Learning Center] Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors. Although it is classified as an \u201cobsessive-compulsive and related disorder\u201d in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the condition is considered different from obsessive-compulsive disorder, as it is neither self-harm nor necessarily driven by a deeper issue or unresolved trauma. Although skin-picking disorder can appear at any age, the onset is often in childhood or adolescence. Connor, now 24, was at secondary school when he noticed how much more he picked at his skin compared with his friends: \u201cI didn\u2019t seem normal,\u201d he says. Holly Davidson, 38, also recalls picking avidly at her skin as a teenager. By the time she first undertook cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) four months ago to try to stop her compulsive habit, it had become such a part of her life that she burst into tears: \u201cI said: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can stop, because it\u2019s been a part of me for 20 years.\u2019\u201d Davidson has tried numerous potential solutions over the years, including expensive facials, hypnotherapy and wearing gloves; she says CBT \u2013 one of the most common psychotherapy treatments for the disorder \u2013 has been the most effective. But Penzel says treatment for compulsive skin picking can be complex, depending on the severity of the case and the likely cause. Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist at the Cadogan Clinic in London, says she often sees cases of acne excori\u00e9e (a skin-picking disorder in which patients squeeze acne spots or even healthy post-acne skin). \u201cWhen people come to the clinic, what you don\u2019t see are the spots \u2013 you just see the areas of skin that people have gouged out because they\u2019ve tried to get rid of the spots.\u201d Although Connor and Davidson report feeling anxiety, stress and frustration in relation to their skin picking, Penzel says it is a common misunderstanding that it is all down to stress. \u201cPeople do these things when they\u2019re either overstimulated, meaning stressed or even happily excited, or they do it when they\u2019re understimulated, meaning when they\u2019re sedentary or bored. So it provides stimulation when you\u2019re understimulated and it reduces it when you\u2019re overstimulated \u2013 it works either way.\u201d Anxiety and depression don\u2019t cause it either, he says. \u201cThey might aggravate or exacerbate the problem, but they\u2019re not what causes it. That\u2019s important to understand.\u201d Figures suggest that 75% of people affected by skin-picking disorder are female, but Penzel is wary of the picture this paints \u2013 women are more likely to seek treatment than men and there have been few comprehensive studies. Jacqueline Kilikita, 26, recalls an incident last year when she picked at the flaking skin on her lips so severely that she ripped off a large piece of skin, causing her bottom lip to bleed heavily. \u201cI also pick the skin on my cuticles and sometimes my scalp, so I researched my symptoms and every single one of them was consistent with dermatillomania.\u201d In her role as beauty editor at the website Refinery29 UK, Kilikita published an account of her experience. \u201cAfter I wrote the article, a colleague mentioned that she suffers, too. The comments also showed me that lots of people are in the same boat. One said it was a relief to know that they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Reflexology has been helpful for her, she says, but it is expensive; keeping lip balm and moisturiser on hand is a cheaper way to reduce the compulsion: \u201cIf the skin is moisturised or covered in product, I\u2019m less likely to pick.\u201d Trying CBT is next on her list. Penzel advocates a comprehensive BFRB-specific approach to behavioural therapy that falls under the umbrella of CBT. \u201cWe try to look at the entire clinical picture, everything surrounding the problem that feeds into it, because if you don\u2019t do it comprehensively you\u2019re not really going to get it under control,\u201d he says. Another key issue is a lack of understanding of the disorder and how to treat it within the psychological and medical communities. \u201cA lot of people get some very bad reactions from health professionals \u2013 unfortunately, a lot of it is passed off as bad habits, but it really isn\u2019t,\u201d says Penzel. \u201cThis can rise to a great level of seriousness and it should be taken very seriously.\u201d At extreme levels, he has worked with people who have needed plastic surgery or have contracted secondary infections such as flesh-eating disease (necrotising fasciitis) as a result of severe skin picking. Connor and Davidson say stigma can be a barrier to getting treatment. Of the \u201chandful\u201d of men to whom Connor has spoken who also experience skin-picking disorder, only a few have told their family, friends and doctors, he says. \u201cThey just don\u2019t feel people will understand their situation, which I completely get.\u201d In fact, he made the decision to share his account of living with skin-picking disorder on Instagram in the hope of creating a support network. Davidson says that, for years, she had no idea that she was suffering from a psychological disorder: \u201cIt was just something I did.\u201d She thinks this lack of awareness is very common. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise that you can get help \u2013 a lot of people do really think they\u2019re strange, that they\u2019ve got this weird thing that nobody else has.\u201d If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, contact Anxiety UK\u2019s national Infoline service on 03444 775 774 or the US-based TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors at bfrb.org",

At the age of 40, she was murdered in her New York office by a construction worker, who tried to make her death look like suicide. She died not knowing that <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473308/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Waitress</a>, her third movie as a director, had been accepted into the Sundance film festival after being rejected elsewhere. From there, it snowballed.</p> <p>It is not the only thing that has endured. Shelly\u2019s body of work and her tenacious methods are still inspiring film-makers and actors. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000639/\">Ally Sheedy</a>, star of The Breakfast Club and High Art, is among them. \u201cWhen you met Adrienne, she was this tiny, extremely beautiful little spirit of a person,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, as you worked with her, you saw she had this ferocious quality. She was not afraid, would not be intimidated, would keep creating no matter what. She was not going to wait around for agents to call, or for Hollywood to give her the parts she wanted. She was going to put on her running shoes and get out there and tell the stories herself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d2824cb81470bcc0161243e35016fc143c3aa8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d2824cb81470bcc0161243e35016fc143c3aa8b/553_131_798_479/500.jpg\" alt=\"A day at gunpoint \u2026 Ally Sheedy in I\u2019ll Take you There, written and directed by Shelly.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A day at gunpoint \u2026 Ally Sheedy in I\u2019ll Take you There, written and directed by Shelly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Two Left Shoes films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One such story is the prickly 1999 comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210741/\">I\u2019ll Take You There</a>, her second film as director. Sheedy plays Bernice, a crazed romantic who forces the dope who broke her heart to spend the day with her at gunpoint. At a time when US indie cinema was dominated by boys running around with firearms (Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez), Shelly flipped the gender roles, making the male character passive while giving the woman all the power.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m basically playing Adrienne,\u201d laughs Sheedy. \u201cAll that humour and craziness, the obsessiveness, the wild, colourful streak. I\u2019d seen her in Hal\u2019s films and loved her. I was amazed there was this young woman making films herself because there were so few women directing. She had motivation, drive, fearlessness. And she would do this thing of balancing absolute courage with a sense of feeling pathetic. She was a brilliant, sensitive, wounded heart.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I do stupid things when I\u2019m drunk,\u201d says the heroine of Waitress. \u201cLike sleep with my husband.\u201d When the Broadway musical opens in the West End this month, it will represent the latest triumph for a project that began life 13 years ago as an inauspicious low-budget indie film. Set in a folksy small town in the American south, it tells the story of Jenna, a young woman who finds she now has an unwanted pregnancy to go with her unhappy marriage. At least she has her waitressing job at Joe\u2019s Pie Diner \u2013 and her burgeoning affair with her obstetrician \u2013 to keep her buoyant, not to mention the pies she bakes, each one named in honour of her state of mind, such as the Baby Screaming Its Head Off in the Middle of the Night and Ruinin\u2019 My Life Pie. This tart, stylised fable was the brainchild of the late actor-writer-director Adrienne Shelly, who made her name playing intelligent, beguilingly deadpan young women in The Unbelievable Truth and Trust, two arch comedies directed by Hal Hartley in the early 90s. First impressions count and Shelly\u2019s opening scene in The Unbelievable Truth is a doozy: she lies in bed beneath a giant painting of a dollar bill and a photograph of a mushroom cloud, then sits up, stretches and yawns \u2013 while we hear the sound of a bomb exploding on the soundtrack. The audience sees this beautiful, languid woman, a pixieish dead ringer for Rosanna Arquette. Yet what they hear is the sound of destruction. It\u2019s a joke on the idea of a sex bomb, as well as a taste of what was to come from Shelly, who dedicated her career to exploding myths and stereotypes, as well as throwing light on neglected female experience. Shelly\u2019s life was cut cruelly short in November 2006. At the age of 40, she was murdered in her New York office by a construction worker, who tried to make her death look like suicide. She died not knowing that Waitress, her third movie as a director, had been accepted into the Sundance film festival after being rejected elsewhere. From there, it snowballed. It is not the only thing that has endured. Shelly\u2019s body of work and her tenacious methods are still inspiring film-makers and actors. Ally Sheedy, star of The Breakfast Club and High Art, is among them. \u201cWhen you met Adrienne, she was this tiny, extremely beautiful little spirit of a person,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, as you worked with her, you saw she had this ferocious quality. She was not afraid, would not be intimidated, would keep creating no matter what. She was not going to wait around for agents to call, or for Hollywood to give her the parts she wanted. She was going to put on her running shoes and get out there and tell the stories herself.\u201d One such story is the prickly 1999 comedy I\u2019ll Take You There, her second film as director. Sheedy plays Bernice, a crazed romantic who forces the dope who broke her heart to spend the day with her at gunpoint. At a time when US indie cinema was dominated by boys running around with firearms (Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez), Shelly flipped the gender roles, making the male character passive while giving the woman all the power. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m basically playing Adrienne,\u201d laughs Sheedy. \u201cAll that humour and craziness, the obsessiveness, the wild, colourful streak. I\u2019d seen her in Hal\u2019s films and loved her. I was amazed there was this young woman making films herself because there were so few women directing. She had motivation, drive, fearlessness. And she would do this thing of balancing absolute courage with a sense of feeling pathetic. She was a brilliant, sensitive, wounded heart. But in writing Bernice, she was laughing at her own hopeless romanticism, her absolute conviction that she was going to turn it all around and make it work.\u201d Auteurs are traditionally confined to the director\u2019s chair, but Shelly was unusual in that her distinctive voice carried over into her acting, writing and film-making. \u201cYou could always see Adrienne poking through,\u201d says Michael Roiff, who produced Waitress. \u201cOn set, she knew what she wanted. People who have an exacting vision can be brutal but she matched hers with a kindness.\u201d Waitress, which starred Keri Russell as Jenna, is shot in succulent fairytale colours and peppered with heightened, screwball-style dialogue, but Shelly insisted that the pain in the film should be real. That included Jenna\u2019s ambivalence about her pregnancy. \u201cI loved that,\u201d says Cheryl Hines, who played one of Jenna\u2019s waitressing colleagues, though she\u2019s best known as Larry David\u2019s wife in Curb Your Enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty common for women to experience anxiety about having a baby but it doesn\u2019t usually show up in movies.

All the while, milk production has increased 13% over the last decade, even as sales have declined. In 2018 alone, sales dropped 6% compared with plant-based milks, which increased 9%, according to <a href=\"https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/sales-of-vegan-food-skyrocket-3-3-billion\">Nielsen data</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, a handful of heavyweight lobbyists were spending millions in support of the interests of milk, cheese and yoghurt producers in the US. The IDFA spent $1.3m lobbying on a variety of issues, including school milk, according to Senate lobbying disclosures. It gave another $260,000 to candidates, two-thirds of whom were Republican, through its <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00128231\">political action committee</a>, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Dairy Farmers of America spent $924,000, including on school milk, according to CRP.</p> <p>The same year, the Trump administration bought <a href=\"https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/doctors-tells-govt-ditch-dairy-response-50-million-milk-bailout\">$50m</a> worth of milk in August to give to food banks and schools. In September, it announced <a href=\"https://www.capitalpress.com/ag_sectors/dairy/tariffs-will-cost-u-s-dairy-farmers-b-this-year/article_7bca214c-6e48-5312-9d0a-0ece49e5e40e.html\">$127m in direct payments</a> to dairy farmers. In October, American dairy farmers gained more access to the Canadian dairy market thanks to Trump\u2019s renegotiation of Nafta. Then, in December, the new school milk rules were finalized.</p> <p>\u201cFor milk processors, this was really important. They saw milk sales were declining, they continued to decline in schools,\u201d said Frye. Getting low-fat flavored milk back in schools, she said, was one of the \u201ctop five\u201d issues for milk processors. \u201cWe were very pleased to see this change made.\u201d</p> <p>School nutrition rollbacks allowed schools to serve low-fat flavored milk (rather than only non-fat), as well as more refined grains, and delayed sodium restrictions. Even as the USDA approved the measure, much of the public appeared to oppose it. The federal rule-making process requires agencies to seek public comment on new policies. More than 83,000 people commented to the USDA, and 96% of the respondents were against the reintroduction of flavored milk in schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/09/shutdown-american-farmers-china-trade-war-trump\">Shutdown hits American farmers already hurt by China trade war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFeed high quality meals to kids including fruits, veggies and nutritious protein sources.

      "bodyText": "The US Department of Agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, raised a glass of chocolate milk to dairy lobbyists in an unannounced visit to their board of directors\u2019 meeting in October, as the group celebrated a recent trade win. The Trump administration\u2019s North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) negotiations gave American dairy farmers more access to the Canadian market, allowing them to export an additional 50,000 metric tons of milk northward. Just two months later, Perdue would finalize a rule allowing fattier chocolate and strawberry flavored milks to be sold to roughly 31 million kids in school cafeterias. \u201cHe grabbed a glass of chocolate milk, and made a chocolate milk toast to our CEO and our board,\u201d Cary Frye, the senior vice-president of regulatory affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), told the Guardian. Perdue\u2019s chocolate milk salute to the dairy lobby was just one example of how the Trump administration has worked closely with the dairy industry, at a time when the president\u2019s trade war has hurt farmers. Trump\u2019s trade war with China and Mexico has cost American dairy farmers an estimated $1.5bn in retaliatory tariffs. All the while, milk production has increased 13% over the last decade, even as sales have declined. In 2018 alone, sales dropped 6% compared with plant-based milks, which increased 9%, according to Nielsen data. At the same time, a handful of heavyweight lobbyists were spending millions in support of the interests of milk, cheese and yoghurt producers in the US. The IDFA spent $1.3m lobbying on a variety of issues, including school milk, according to Senate lobbying disclosures. It gave another $260,000 to candidates, two-thirds of whom were Republican, through its political action committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Dairy Farmers of America spent $924,000, including on school milk, according to CRP. The same year, the Trump administration bought $50m worth of milk in August to give to food banks and schools. In September, it announced $127m in direct payments to dairy farmers. In October, American dairy farmers gained more access to the Canadian dairy market thanks to Trump\u2019s renegotiation of Nafta. Then, in December, the new school milk rules were finalized. \u201cFor milk processors, this was really important. They saw milk sales were declining, they continued to decline in schools,\u201d said Frye. Getting low-fat flavored milk back in schools, she said, was one of the \u201ctop five\u201d issues for milk processors. \u201cWe were very pleased to see this change made.\u201d School nutrition rollbacks allowed schools to serve low-fat flavored milk (rather than only non-fat), as well as more refined grains, and delayed sodium restrictions. Even as the USDA approved the measure, much of the public appeared to oppose it. The federal rule-making process requires agencies to seek public comment on new policies. More than 83,000 people commented to the USDA, and 96% of the respondents were against the reintroduction of flavored milk in schools. \u201cFeed high quality meals to kids including fruits, veggies and nutritious protein sources. Nix the sugar and processed foods laced with chemicals,\u201d one anonymous commenter told the USDA. \u201cIf we want healthy, informed future citizens in this country let\u2019s start by giving them quality meals in school so they can concentrate and absorb information.\u201d Nevertheless, in its final decision the agency wrote: \u201cAfter careful consideration of all stakeholders\u2019 comments, USDA believes that school nutrition operators have made the case that this final rule\u2019s targeted regulatory flexibility is practical and necessary for efficient Program operation.\u201d In defense of the new rules, Perdue tweeted: \u201cNutritious school meals don\u2019t do anyone any good if kids just throw them into the trash.\u201d The USDA was \u201cempowering local schools\u201d to serve \u201chealthy AND appetizing food\u201d \u2013 an argument often made by the dairy industry. In a survey conducted by the National Dairy Council, 73% of schools said students preferred 1% flavored milk to non-fat milk. Kids drank 288m fewer half pints between 2012 and 2015, lobbyists said. The milk standards are part of the federal government\u2019s subsidized meal program, which feeds more than 31 million kids each day, many of whom get meals free or at reduced prices because their families are low-income. In some cases, meals at school account for half of the daily calories kids consume. The battle to feed them, and what to feed them, has once again pitted dairy lobbyists against nutritionists, in what has long been a politically fraught area entangled with lobbying. In one of the most infamous examples, Congress ruled pizza could be considered a vegetable in school lunches after lobbying from the frozen food industry. Lobbyists for the prune industry also tried to convince the government to add prunes to hamburgers during surplus of the fruit in the early 2000s. The rules, \u201cas weak as they were, they were trying to make schools healthier\u201d, said Susan Levin, director of nutrition for Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group which advocates for vegan diets. \u201cIt\u2019s clear pandering to industry.\u201d Lobbyists for the milk industry fought hard against the Obama-era reforms, which restricted schools to selling only non-fat flavored milks and which the dairy industry blamed for a sharp decline in milk drinking. In 2018 alone, the IDFA spent around $300,000 a quarter lobbying on issues including school lunches. \u201cAny government program is going to be a huge moneymaker for them and that includes schools,\u201d said Levin. \u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of excess surplus product is dumped; it\u2019s dumped in schools, it\u2019s dumped in prisons.\u201d Part of the dairy industry\u2019s education strategy in recent years has been to market chocolate milk as a drink for athletes, and to \u201cinoculate consumers against emerging trends\u201d. The declining birthrate and \u201cchild vegans\u201d were also identified as particular challenges for the milk industry, according to MilkPEP documents. A nutritionist for the University of California called the idea that chocolate milk could help athletes \u201cpreposterous\u201d. \u201cMilk is a very healthy beverage, it\u2019s got protein, calcium, vitamin D \u2013 there\u2019s a reason we are mammals and grow up drinking milk,\u201d said Lorrene Ritchie, the director of the Nutrition Policy Institute at the University of California. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about adding chocolate to it that\u2019s going to help an athlete.\u201d This article was amended on 4 February 2019 to correct a quote that had been misattributed.",

But elsewhere the future may look forlorn. Shops, moreover, are only one facet of a general hollowing-out. As banks close their branches, places lose not just symbols of local commerce but a vital service for businesspeople. (Where else do they get their change?) When a pub closes down, bang goes a precious shared space. The effects of austerity on libraries, museums, day centres and more is self-evident. And the terror of the current moment is that even the places that once claimed to have superseded traditional retail and commerce are now threatened by the new world of online everything: what, you can only wonder, are we going to do with vacant malls and shopping centres?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2019/jan/30/high-street-crisis-town-centres-lose-8-of-shops-in-five-years\">High street crisis deepens: 1 in 12 shops closed in five years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To even begin to answer these challenges, a place needs a mixture of things too often in short supply. One is high-quality local politicians motivated by civic pride, and with an ability to use their imaginations. In some places you see flashes of what this might mean.

Whatever happens to that store, central Manchester does not look likely to join the list of places where the number of vacant premises is turning critical. But elsewhere the future may look forlorn. Shops, moreover, are only one facet of a general hollowing-out. As banks close their branches, places lose not just symbols of local commerce but a vital service for businesspeople. (Where else do they get their change?) When a pub closes down, bang goes a precious shared space. The effects of austerity on libraries, museums, day centres and more is self-evident. And the terror of the current moment is that even the places that once claimed to have superseded traditional retail and commerce are now threatened by the new world of online everything: what, you can only wonder, are we going to do with vacant malls and shopping centres? To even begin to answer these challenges, a place needs a mixture of things too often in short supply. One is high-quality local politicians motivated by civic pride, and with an ability to use their imaginations. In some places you see flashes of what this might mean. In Doncaster the council has plans for a radical reinvention of the town centre: rejuvenated markets; streets to be filled with restaurants, bars and cafes; buildings converted into living spaces \u2013 a mushrooming of the kind of creativity that has turned a former branch of British Home Stores into a huge trampolining centre. Even if there are huge obstacles, this is impressive and exciting. But in smaller places, it is still hard to shake off a sense that the 21st century is going to be defined by a kind of capitalism that will offer much more destruction than creation. Clearly, we are not going pull ourselves away from Amazon and suddenly return to a halcyon era of sweets sold by the quarter and \u201cCan I help you?\u201d. But this country is in a weird, tortured state, and the condition of so many of its towns and cities is at the heart of its angst. When the Brexit mess starts to recede, and we finally get to talk about how on earth we are going to handle the future, this is where everything needs to start: in the places we still honour with such words as \u201ccentre\u201d and \u201cheart\u201d \u2013 where fatalism and despondency need to be turned round, before it is too late. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

That means charging full whack for people to get together and celebrate their identities as much as it means turning brunch into some sort of treasure hunt and packaging it into an event, or adding a glass of wine to an evening art class and charging a fortune via an app. Nevertheless, it really does need to be said that when it comes to LGBT+ rights, charging \u00a371 for people to celebrate their being free is just, well, rich. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 5 February 2019 to add in details of the survey on trans pupils in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Too much of Britain\u2019s aid budget is being spent poorly by Whitehall departments on projects that fail the test of reducing poverty in the world\u2019s poorest countries, a campaign group has said. The One Campaign \u2013 an advocacy organisation set up by the U2 singer Bono \u2013 said the huge gulf in standards across government was undermining the battle to build public trust that taxpayers\u2019 money was being well spent. The UK is one of only a handful of countries to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid and around 70% of the \u00a314bn a year budget is spent by the Department for International Development (DfID). Romilly Greenhill, the One Campaign\u2019s UK director, said that money spent by DfID scored highly for poverty focus, effectiveness and transparency, but the same could not always be said of the 30% of the budget spent by other Whitehall departments. The campaign group\u2019s new Real Aid Index said that only 5% of the \u00a3765m spent by the business, energy and industrial strategy department (BEIS) and 16% of the \u00a31.05bn spent by the Foreign Office (FCO) went to the countries that needed it most. \u201cThis index shows that while most UK aid does exactly what it\u2019s meant to, some parts of government need to up their game. If they\u2019re spending aid which doesn\u2019t bring real change for people in poverty, should it really be called aid at all?\u201d she said. The report also found: \u00a31.5bn of aid was being spent with barely any transparency about where and how it was delivered. At least \u00a3475m of aid came with strings attached so that is has to be spent through UK institutions, contravening Britain\u2019s system of untied aid. \u00a3115m of FCO aid was being spent to subsidise relatively affluent students going to university in the UK. Three of the five largest (in cash terms) programmes within the Newton Fund \u2013 which aims to develop science and innovation partnerships that promote the economic development and social welfare of partner countries \u2013 were based in China and were not focused on global poverty reduction. Britain\u2019s aid budget has become increasingly controversial, since the higher spending necessary to meet the 0.7% UN target has come at a time when other Whitehall departments have faced stringent austerity. Some Conservative MPs believe the commitment should be scrapped. Greenhill said: \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of UK aid is poverty-focused, effective and transparent \u2013 it\u2019s real aid that we can be proud of. But some parts of government don\u2019t adhere to these principles \u2013 in short, they\u2019re not delivering \u2018real aid\u2019. \u201cIf their aid is going to richer countries or on programmes that don\u2019t address poverty, then they\u2019re not only failing the people it\u2019s meant for, they\u2019re letting down the UK taxpayer.\u201d Greenhill said the Treasury should take the opportunity of this year\u2019s spending review to ensure the taxpayer was getting value for money and that aid spending was targeted at poverty reduction. \u201cAs collaboration becomes the new normal for government departments spending UK aid, every penny must be \u2018real aid\u2019. As the Treasury is deciding who gets what in this year\u2019s spending review, they shouldn\u2019t allocate any more aid to departments which don\u2019t deliver \u2018real aid\u2019,\u201d she said. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s overseas development assistance focuses on countries where we can deliver the greatest impact, helping to build a safer and more prosperous planet. \u201cWe are leveraging the UK\u2019s world-leading research base to address global challenges including antimicrobial resistance, food security and building resilience to natural disasters.

      "bodyText": "When Elizabeth Warren declared her intention to run for president in the 2020 US election, a debate swiftly followed over whether the Democratic Massachusetts senator could pass a \u201clikability test\u201d. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked by a reporter if she was perhaps too \u201cnice\u201d to take on Donald Trump immediately after making her own announcement on her intention to run. And California senator Kamala Harris faced scrutiny in rightwing media circles over her dating history after formally jumping into the presidential race. As a record number of Democratic women seek America\u2019s highest office \u2013 and look to limit Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to a single term \u2013 familiar patterns have emerged in the narratives that surround them. But so, too, has a backlash to the old tropes, bolstered by the election of a record number of women in the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cI think in 2016, the idea that \u2018likable\u2019 was gendered wouldn\u2019t have even come up. In 2019, people clearly recognized it and called it out,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, who served as a communications aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in the last election cycle. \u201cThe thing that makes me the most hopeful about intractably sexist media coverage is that with multiple women candidates in the race it becomes really obvious what women have to deal with.\u201d Women have already made history in what is shaping up to be a crowded and diverse field for Democrats, with the 2020 election poised to mark the first time more than one woman has fought for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. It\u2019s a far cry from when Clinton stood alone in the 2008 primaries, and was infamously told by Barack Obama in a Democratic debate that she was \u201clikable enough\u201d. The coverage of Clinton in her first presidential bid drew widespread criticism for a relentless eye on everything from her personality and clothes to the tenor of her voice and what some media outlets characterized at the time as her \u201ccackle\u201d. \u201cLike her or not, one of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued \u2013 and accepted \u2013 role of sexism in American life, particularly in the media,\u201d Katie Couric, then the anchor of the anchor of the CBS Evening News, reflected not long after Clinton was defeated by Barack Obama. Eight years later, there was a palpable shift when Clinton launched her second campaign for the presidency. Much of the conversation around gender centered not on Clinton\u2019s appearance or temperament, but rather the historic nature of her candidacy and the former secretary of state\u2019s qualifications for the role of commander-in-chief. What did not change, however, was the question of \u201clikability\u201d and ongoing commentary over Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness \u2013 the latter propelled by the controversy over her emails and what some reporters have themselves acknowledged became a double standard in media coverage.

      "body": "<p>There is an interrogation that begins whenever a Muslim assumes any role in the public eye, a sort of Muslim inquisition. One can be a writer or a politician or a chef, and be asked questions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the matter at hand. Do you think homosexuality is a sin? What do you think of underage marriage? Do you think Israel has the right to exist? These questions are also asked in spurious surveys commissioned in the hope of generating headlines that suggest the majority of Muslims are violently homophobic, or conform to whatever latest trope is doing the rounds.</p> <p>In the US, this persistent questioning continues despite the fact that Muslims are growing more liberal (specifically, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/07/homophobic-muslim-populist-bogeyman-trump-le-pen\" title=\"\">more accepting of homosexuality</a> than their white evangelical Christian counterparts) while simultaneously suffering increased levels of discrimination. But in the inquisition it\u2019s the questions, not the answers, that are truly revealing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All Omar had done to deserve this outrageous association was to express opinions on Israel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The interrogators assume the innocent air of people who are \u201cjust asking\u201d. But answering their questions accepts their premise, which is that every Muslim\u2019s values are deservedly an object of suspicion until they can prove their liberal credentials. In Britain I\u2019m a veteran of the Muslim inquisition. Often, when I\u2019m warning that the right uses Islamist terror to justify anti-immigrant prejudice, I get asked whether I condemn terrorism. Think it\u2019s wrong to blame migrants for events unrelated to them? Then you must love terrorism!

      "bodyText": "There is an interrogation that begins whenever a Muslim assumes any role in the public eye, a sort of Muslim inquisition. One can be a writer or a politician or a chef, and be asked questions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the matter at hand. Do you think homosexuality is a sin? What do you think of underage marriage? Do you think Israel has the right to exist? These questions are also asked in spurious surveys commissioned in the hope of generating headlines that suggest the majority of Muslims are violently homophobic, or conform to whatever latest trope is doing the rounds. In the US, this persistent questioning continues despite the fact that Muslims are growing more liberal (specifically, more accepting of homosexuality than their white evangelical Christian counterparts) while simultaneously suffering increased levels of discrimination. But in the inquisition it\u2019s the questions, not the answers, that are truly revealing. The interrogators assume the innocent air of people who are \u201cjust asking\u201d. But answering their questions accepts their premise, which is that every Muslim\u2019s values are deservedly an object of suspicion until they can prove their liberal credentials. In Britain I\u2019m a veteran of the Muslim inquisition. Often, when I\u2019m warning that the right uses Islamist terror to justify anti-immigrant prejudice, I get asked whether I condemn terrorism. Think it\u2019s wrong to blame migrants for events unrelated to them? Then you must love terrorism! What I have learned, in the words of the computer in the film WarGames, is that the only winning move is not to play. There was a classic example of the Muslim inquisition at work last week in the US. A congresswoman, Ilhan Omar, was tagged by the representative Lee Zeldin on Twitter, in a message in which he uploaded a vile antisemitic voicemail he had received. \u201cThis new VM just came into my office. @IlhanMN,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is just another day in my world as an American Jew in Congress.

He was just asking whether a Muslim congresswoman agrees with an anonymous voicemail, sent by someone unknown to her, who thinks that Hitler should have finished his job. All Omar had done to deserve this outrageous association with a vile voicemail from a complete stranger was to express opinions on Israel.

Omar said she had been unaware of that, and withdrew the word. That\u2019s it. That is her biggest transgression.

They are elders of the landscape, eons-old survivors protruding into the present.</p> <p>Landmarks like The Rocks often become places for informal acts of communion, where people unwind before a wider horizon. The appeal is felt by children and inner children alike. In some small, momentary way, this wild rock has the power to take us out of ourselves, connect us to something bigger, and awaken a wonder we all carry within us.</p>",

The Rocks were always the enemy castle, the fort to be defended, the symbol of victory. Unknowingly, we venerated them. Now I\u2019m an adult, these rocks are literally my touchstones; if I feel disorientated or adrift I can stand on them and feel perspective returning. The rock of The Rocks, millstone grit, began life 300m years ago in Carboniferous river deltas. From their current lookout they have seen ice ages come and go; have watched the surrounding valleys change from ice-encased glacial corridors to forest-carpeted swamplands to industrial canyons wreathed in smoke. They are elders of the landscape, eons-old survivors protruding into the present. Landmarks like The Rocks often become places for informal acts of communion, where people unwind before a wider horizon. The appeal is felt by children and inner children alike. In some small, momentary way, this wild rock has the power to take us out of ourselves, connect us to something bigger, and awaken a wonder we all carry within us.",

      "bodyText": "Federal Liberal backbencher Ian Goodenough faces being hauled before a powerful parliamentary inquiry over claims he used his MP status to promote lobster businesses with which he has financial links. The MP for Moore in Western Australia took delegates from the Australia Asia Exchange Conference to have lunch at Lobster Shack and to tour the Indian Ocean Rock Lobster processing factory, according to his Facebook post on 10 June last year. His parliamentary register of interests shows that he is a director and company secretary of Australian Agrimarket Pty Ltd. The family of his business partner at Australian Agrimarket, Brent Thompson, owns the Lobster Shack and the Indian Ocean Rock Lobster processing factory near Perth. Goodenough denied any wrongdoing. \u201cI have complied with the rules and declared all relevant information in accordance with the House of Representatives disclosure standards,\u201d he said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cLabor are today peddling spurious claims in an attempt to distract from their retirees tax, which will hit thousands of people in my electorate and across Australia.\u201d It\u2019s believed no trade deals were struck as a result of the guests having lunch at the Lobster Shack. However Goodenough admitted Australian Agrimarket in the past has received commissions from the two lobster companies for securing export deals. \u201cIf we do find clients then we do receive a commission,\u201d Goodenough told the Australian. \u201cThe Thompson family owns the Lobster Shack and Australian Agrimarket is trying to promote exports of Australian produce.\u201d He dismissed a conflict of interest between his role as an MP and business activities. \u201cThe roles are completely separate. There is no undue influence or anything like that,\u201d Goodenough told the newspaper. \u201cIt was a large conference. I promoted the cities of Wanneroo and Joondalup and Gingin area in general.\u201d Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said Goodenough had serious questions to answer. \u201cHe appears to have used his position a member of parliament to promote a business in which he has a financial interest,\u201d Dreyfus said in a statement. \u201cFor Mr Goodenough to pretend his status as an MP is irrelevant \u2013 when he is promoting this business on his official MP\u2019s Facebook page \u2013 simply beggars belief.\u201d Dreyfus said the situation highlighted the need to establish a national integrity commission. The opposition is considering whether the MP should be referred to the parliamentary privileges committee. The backbencher was posting about the lobster business on social media as far back as August 2016. He also posted on social media about holding a Liberal party fundraiser at the Lobster Shack.",

But we knew if we stuck to our plan from Brisbane, Patty has been great and Jhye was great last week. It has been the game we have been searching for all summer with four centurions.

He defends solidly before taking a single behind point, leaving the new man Karunaratne a couple of balls to deal with. He gets under the first - just - before blocking the last. <strong> <br></strong></p> <p>We have an unorthodox solution to the over rates issue <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">on email </a>in from Abhijato Sensarma. I\u2019ll paste in full before coming to my (similar!) thought. </p> <p>\u201cPlayers are humans, and one look at the footage of the yesteryears shows that they play with much more intensity than before. In the domestic tournaments, over-rates are almost always met (or met with harsh penalties), however it\u2019s played with admittedly lower intensity. Unlike a Jadeja who can rush through his overs, today\u2019s regular international cricketers should not be able to stand on their legs once a day\u2019s play is done. With modern strategies being more complex and field setting perhaps a touch sophisticated too, they can get a bit of slack. The only issue is that a reduction in minimum overs per day will create even slower games because players want to rest as much as possible. <br></p> <p>Here\u2019s my idea, which I\u2019ll present irrespective of whether you call me a Brexiter or a Trump supporter - we should play with the pink ball even in regular Test matches (the pink ball is a work in progress but good enough). We can take a ten minute break at the end of the third session, and return to bowl as many overs as possible under the lights in a \u2018fourth session\u2019. Longer playing hours should attract more people during the evening, while neither of the playing sides should mind this added session, because they were supposed to play out that many overs anyways. <br></p> <p>The fourth session will happen only when there are left-overs (pun intended) from that day, with a maximum of ten overs being bowled. It will give bowlers more time to relax during the regular sessions, and create more thoughtful cricket all around. The other three sessions can be shorter in duration by around ten minutes each to ensure significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The final day\u2019s fourth session will have a maximum of fifteen overs to cover all the overs still remaining during the entire game. Even if the session lasts for a handful of overs, it will make for \u2018tricky\u2019 and dynamic passages of play which will draw crowds rather than turn them away in my opinion. What will be yours?\u201d</p> <p>I like the starting point: using the pink ball to help overcome bad light. <a href=\"https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/india-vs-australia-collins-embrace-pink-ball-as-contingency-plan-for-bad-light-1993423.html\">This is how I would do it</a>, written on one of the dreary days in Sydney during the India series.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c57a0e0e4b0c3e1fbdbd8f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-04T02:23:12.931Z\">2.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Richard Ley emails in a hypothetical.</p> <p>\u201cYour side bowls out mine in a session (two hours - sad!) and again after batting. Included in each are a number of lengthy reviews initiated, with reasonable basis, by both sides. To what extent are delays that are within the conditions of the game and outside the fielding side\u2019s control accounted for in decisions about a slow over rate? Should things like high frequency of change of batsman - and the attendant time that takes - and the lengthy reviews - and the time those take - affect the calculation of the over rate? I\u2019d argue that the match duration shouldn\u2019t be discounted completely when considering the over rate if batting collapses and the like have an effect.\u201d</p> <p>I think they are taken into consideration though, Richard, which is why we see comparatively few actual warnings or sanctions in Test cricket. Basically match referees will find whatever reasons they can to give leniency. The West Indies bowling must have been slow even taking that into account, thanks to the four-man pace attack and its success precluding the need to turn to spin. Roston Chase didn\u2019t bowl any spin in the second innings in Antigua.

Obviously the circumstances of a lower-ranked opponent facing all kinds of injury difficulties in foreign conditions mean that players have a much better chance to do well. But it still matters to make the most of that chance.</p> <p>Usman Khawaja has, getting his first hundred of the summer and hopefully a bit of spring back into his step after some injury hassles and during some ongoing off-field dramas. Joe Burns made a huge one when it mattered in the first dig, as did Travis Head, and Kurtis Patterson followed up with his own hundred once the ascendancy had been won. Mitchell Starc then grabbed five wickets, even if at times in strange and fortuitous ways. So they\u2019re all on the board.</p> <p>Marcus Harris, on the other hand, has followed a decent series against India with a poor one against a much more placid bowling attack. He\u2019s got out to very loose shots each time, which doesn\u2019t bode well for England.

Well, for his team bowling too slowly, not for his own figures on the speed gun. Which might have been an issue earlier in his career.</p> <p>A lot of arguments (these are the rules) and counter-arguments (how can your over rate be too slow when you\u2019ve won in three days). I have some sympathy for both sides of it. Slow over rates are annoying. But then, if a team is winning with four fast bowlers coming off long run-ups and taking lots of wickets, why should they have to stop just to get through more deliveries an hour?</p> <p>Perhaps the line below is the most compelling argument.

As Tim Paine holds up the Warne-Murali Trophy and the Australians collect their medals, this is a good time to wrap up the OBO for the Australian international summer. On behalf of Geoff, JP, Sam and myself, thanks for your company throughout. We\u2019ll talk to you soon, I am sure. Bye for now! Tim Paine speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s great to get some reward for the effort we have been putting in. We were 3/30 in both innings and Travis in particular, and Burnsy, dug us out of trouble and put us in a good position. We bowled beautifully as a team that really allowed Starcy to attack. For our group to get some belief out of this is really good.\u201d He adds his personal thanks to Sri Lankan team, Australian fans and sponsors. \u201cThe last 12 months has been a really difficult time. We started this summer trying to win back respect so thanks for sticking with us.\u201d Dinesh Chandimal speaks. \u201cWe were outplayed in all departments so credit to Australia who played outstanding cricket all series. The last six months we didn\u2019t have the right combination for our best XI but that is part of the game. If you get the chance to play for your country you have to take that with both hands. We have a young team and we are always learning, especially in these tough conditions.\u201d Pat Cummins, Player of the Series, speaks. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty happy with how the whole summer went. We had a couple of weeks off as bowlers (after the India Tests) and it came out well. I\u2019m always happy to get the ball swinging around at the Gabba, it\u2019s always good, with the pink ball. The way we bowled as a group was brilliant building up pressure. Our quicks stuck to our aggression and it paid off. We have six months to the Ashes and we have plenty to take to that.\u201d Mitchell Starc, Player of the Match, speaks. \u201cI just tried to come here this week and bowl as fast as I could. It was a great week for the group. A few of us played the Shield game this year and it was a fair bit flatter so we knew what we were coming into. But we knew if we stuck to our plan from Brisbane, Patty has been great and Jhye was great last week. It has been the game we have been searching for all summer with four centurions. For a young and inexperienced group, we have plenty to take from it moving forward.\u201d I neglected to mention, Australia also regain the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy for their work here, which they lost in 2016 in Sri Lanka. Stick with the OBO for the presentation to hear from the captains and the man of the match, who we assume will be Starc but could end up Joe Burns or Travis Head for the work they did when the hosts were in strife on the first morning. Starc straight through the No11! It took six balls, one of those brushing the off stump without taking the bails, but the big quick gets it done to make it ten for the match with his second five-wicket bag here at Canberra. A lovely way to finish the summer for the attack-leader, Australia winning the series 2-0. 50th over: Sri Lanka 148-9 (Rajitha 1, Fernando 0) Cummins gets five balls at the No11, setting him up with the bumper but unable to quite sneak through when directing back at the woodwork. Fernando does the shuffle out to square leg for the final ball, getting his bat down just in time, nearly returning a second catch to Cummins for the day but it is not. Starc gets another chance! One to go now, Cummins putting one just outside the off stump at Perera to begin the new over, winning another conventional edge through to Paine. 49th over: Sri Lanka 148-8 (D Perera 4, Rajitha 1) A packed cordon for Starc to Rajitha, who beats him four times in a row without an edge. Five slips and a gully but they aren\u2019t required. Might Starc miss out on this tenth? Stiff. 48th over: Sri Lanka 148-8 (D Perera 4, Rajitha 1) Cummins to try and finish it off, charging in at Rajitha. He\u2019s accurate but the tailender is up to the task, getting off the mark with halfway reasonable technique, fending a ball off his chest. Perera cops a bouncer to finish and does well to just get his head out of the way. Phew. 47th over: Sri Lanka 147-8 (D Perera 4, Rajitha 0) Good news for people who like milestones, Starc is back on now in an effort to claim his tenth of the match with a second bag of five. He can\u2019t get it done here but that doesn\u2019t stop Paine from going upstairs in the hope that Perera has tickled one to him down the legside. In the third umpire\u2019s chair, Umpire Erasmus (or Umpire The Rasmus, as I prefer) confirms the not out decision taken by Umpire Gough. As a result of the challenge, the over goes for so long that I almost forgot that Perera began it by slashing the left-armer behind point for four. 46th over: Sri Lanka 143-8 (D Perera 0, Rajitha 0) Rajitha gets through the last couple of balls in the successful Cummins over, defending with a nice, straight bat. Start the car! Fourth ball back into the attack from the southern end, Cummins wins a tiny little edge from Karunaratne, taken easily by Paine. Labuschagne really did deserve that wicket. Having sent down a tidy set at Mendis, Paine brought the field in for the final delivery. In response, the leggie sent it a touch wider and the right-hander took the bait, smashing a catch straight to Kustin Patterson at shortish cover. 45th over: Sri Lanka 143-7 (C Karunaratne 22) 44th over: Sri Lanka 143-6 (Mendis 42, C Karunaratne 22) Mendis pulls it back a touch against Lyon, defending conservatively before taking one behind square. That ends an eventful third hour of the fourth day, these two putting on 46 along the way. Drinks. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 142-6 (Mendis 41, C Karunaratne 22) Labuschagne sends down an over like that and it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that he is more than a part-time option with his wrist spin. He\u2019s right on top of Mendis here, the set including a ball that turns a mile to beat the outside edge. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 141-6 (Mendis 40, C Karunaratne 22) Nearly an amazing catch on the deep midwicket boundary, Mendis taken by Burns right on the rope, throwing it back mid-air to try and find Richardson who was racing over for the alley-oop but not quite arriving in time. Karunaratne has a pop too, smashing Lyon over midwicket for another boundary. Sure enough, it prompts another round of chat from the men around the bat, making life as difficult as possible for the man on debut. 18 runs have been added in the last two overs! 41st over: Sri Lanka 128-6 (Mendis 31, C Karunaratne 18) Spin twins, with Labuschagne given his first stint of the second innings, having claimed a wicket with a lovely delivery yesterday. He deserves one here too, Khawaja dropping Karunaratne at slip! It came quick, the edge from a lavish drive, but he did get a good look at it up to his right hand, nearly dragging it down, and getting close diving for the rebound. Earlier, a gorgeous legbreak beat Mendis and a full toss got the treatment from Karunaratne. All happening! 40th over: Sri Lanka 123-6 (Mendis 30, C Karunaratne 14) Singles from each to bookend the over, Karunatarne\u2019s via a genuine edge. Between times, the ball hit Mendis on the lid at the non-strikers\u2019 end due to an errant throw back to Lyon. Fun and games. \u201cGet him before Cummo comes back!\u201d roars Paine, who is having a ball. 39th over: Sri Lanka 121-6 (Mendis 29, C Karunaratne 13) Mendis takes one to square leg first up off Starc, Karunaratne - growing in confidence - doing likewise. The more experienced man sees off the rest. I note that there is a bit more cloud cover now from the west over near the Black Mountain Tower. It\u2019s a long shot, but if Sri Lanka can find a way to bat for another hour or so, well, who knows. 38th over: Sri Lanka 119-6 (Mendis 28, C Karunaratne 12) Mendis has a crack at Lyon first ball and is nearly caught by Richardson at long on, running back with the flight and diving at full stretch. Paine is into him for the shot, in keeping with the theme of this Test. The Aussies are certainly having a nice time, even when a fat edge goes over the catcher at first slip via Karunaratne to finish for a couple, enjoying a laugh. \u201cThey have an early flight,\u201d adds Alyssa Healy on TV. 37th over: Sri Lanka 114-6 (Mendis 25, C Karunaratne 10) What a way to advance into double figures! Karunaratne shows why he is batting No8 on debut, nailing Starc though extra cover like Damien Martyn! Who needs footwork when you can hammer shots like that. Earlier in the over he edged four through the cordon, but all is forgiven after the shot to finish. 36th over: Sri Lanka 106-6 (Mendis 25, C Karunaratne 2) Some classy cricket to end this Richardson over, finding Mendis\u2019 edge with a beautiful bit of outswing (reverse?), the Sri Lankan gun responding next ball with one of the shots of the entire match, a classical on-drive that races down to the rope. Swoon. 35th over: Sri Lanka 101-6 (Mendis 21, C Karunaratne 1) Mendis again takes one from the first ball of the over, again behind point as well. That makes 100 for Sri Lanka in this messy second innings. Karunaratne is under pressure throughout due to the pace and angle Starc is generating from round the wicket, but he\u2019s off the mark in Test cricket from the final delivery, clipping off his pads. Nicely done. 34th over: Sri Lanka 99-6 (Mendis 20, C Karunaratne 0) Mendis takes one from the first Richardson ball, which exposes Karunaratne, the man on debut who is on a pair after the first dig. He builds in confidence through the over, getting behind a compact forward defensive stroke to finish after some dancing around the crease. \u201cOi, mate!\u201d If it isn\u2019t Paris Bob Wilson! \u201cYou waxing satirical about the inconstant admirers of Starc? One day you\u2019re up, next you\u2019re down (and vicey-versey). I was giving him the love when you couldn\u2019t give him away - ie yesterday. I\u2019m a moral limpet. Forget that, I still think Siddle could do a job (he\u2019s the gears that make all parts of the mechanism glide smooth and true). Where oh where is my long-lost vegan Pete?\u201d My view is that Starc\u2019s inconsistency makes him dangerous. You can\u2019t have an attack full of blokes like him, but with Richardson/Hazlewood/Cummins (/Siddle) so accurate, that batsmen never know what they are going to get from the quickest of them all has to be to some advantage. The positive from today is that he\u2019s moving the ball again, which hasn\u2019t been the case that often this summer. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 98-6 (Mendis 19, C Karunaratne 0) Well, for what little it is worth at this stage, Mendis is looking alright against Starc. He defends solidly before taking a single behind point, leaving the new man Karunaratne a couple of balls to deal with. He gets under the first - just - before blocking the last. We have an unorthodox solution to the over rates issue on email in from Abhijato Sensarma. I\u2019ll paste in full before coming to my (similar!) thought. \u201cPlayers are humans, and one look at the footage of the yesteryears shows that they play with much more intensity than before. In the domestic tournaments, over-rates are almost always met (or met with harsh penalties), however it\u2019s played with admittedly lower intensity. Unlike a Jadeja who can rush through his overs, today\u2019s regular international cricketers should not be able to stand on their legs once a day\u2019s play is done. With modern strategies being more complex and field setting perhaps a touch sophisticated too, they can get a bit of slack. The only issue is that a reduction in minimum overs per day will create even slower games because players want to rest as much as possible. Here\u2019s my idea, which I\u2019ll present irrespective of whether you call me a Brexiter or a Trump supporter - we should play with the pink ball even in regular Test matches (the pink ball is a work in progress but good enough). We can take a ten minute break at the end of the third session, and return to bowl as many overs as possible under the lights in a \u2018fourth session\u2019. Longer playing hours should attract more people during the evening, while neither of the playing sides should mind this added session, because they were supposed to play out that many overs anyways. The fourth session will happen only when there are left-overs (pun intended) from that day, with a maximum of ten overs being bowled. It will give bowlers more time to relax during the regular sessions, and create more thoughtful cricket all around. The other three sessions can be shorter in duration by around ten minutes each to ensure significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The final day\u2019s fourth session will have a maximum of fifteen overs to cover all the overs still remaining during the entire game. Even if the session lasts for a handful of overs, it will make for \u2018tricky\u2019 and dynamic passages of play which will draw crowds rather than turn them away in my opinion. What will be yours?\u201d I like the starting point: using the pink ball to help overcome bad light. This is how I would do it, written on one of the dreary days in Sydney during the India series. Richardson is into the book, or ruining Starc\u2019s 9fa as I\u2019d prefer. Not a good shot at all from Dhananjaya, set up by a couple of inswingers at the stumps then chipping to Head at mid-on. No footwork to speak of, it is a soft dismissal. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Mendis 18) 31st over: Sri Lanka 93-5 (Mendis 18, Dhananjaya 2) Starc attacking the stumps of Mendis right away, the right hander digging out the second delivery to point for one. Dhananjaya gives the strike back with a push to square leg, Mendis hammering a cut shot high on the balls of his feet behind point for four. To finish he\u2019s dropped at short leg, which is very Harsh on Harris under the lid who had no time to move before the ball crashed into his leg. \u201cThey stick or they don\u2019t,\u201d as Mike Hussey says on TV. But, in theory at least, they could have been Starc\u2019s fifth. Thanks, Geoff. Just two days ago, Mitch Starc was under more pressure than any player in Australia. Now, he\u2019s a worldbeater once again. Something like that. Bowling the way he was before the lunch break, it is unlikely that this will take long. Umpires Illingworth and Gough are now on the field, followed by Paine\u2019s men, Kusal Mendis (13) and Dhananjaya de Silva (1). Starc has the ball in his end from the Manuka Pool End, in pursuit of his tenth wicket of the match. Indeed, if it all went well, he theorhetically has a 9fa on the shelf here. We\u2019ll see. PLAY! That\u2019s the break: Australia\u2019s session again, as all but perhaps the first session on day one have been. Five wickets in it, four of them to Starc, who is all but guaranteed a ten-wicket match. A tonic for him. Cummins has the other wicket to fall. Sri Lanka have their last two recognised batsmen at the crease, with only the opportunity to do something special on a personal basis and build a good score. The keeper has already batted so there are only the four bowlers to come. That\u2019s it from me for the day and for the Test summer. No doubt there will be some one-day games and so on as Australia tours India and the UAE later this month and into March and April. Then of course the World Cup and the Ashes from England. But as far as the Australian home season goes, thanks for your company and for all your messages \u2013 it\u2019s been a lot of fun. Up next, it\u2019ll be Adam Collins. A couple of new contributions to the Jason Holder debate. Richard Ley emails in a hypothetical. \u201cYour side bowls out mine in a session (two hours - sad!) and again after batting. Included in each are a number of lengthy reviews initiated, with reasonable basis, by both sides. To what extent are delays that are within the conditions of the game and outside the fielding side\u2019s control accounted for in decisions about a slow over rate? Should things like high frequency of change of batsman - and the attendant time that takes - and the lengthy reviews - and the time those take - affect the calculation of the over rate? I\u2019d argue that the match duration shouldn\u2019t be discounted completely when considering the over rate if batting collapses and the like have an effect.\u201d I think they are taken into consideration though, Richard, which is why we see comparatively few actual warnings or sanctions in Test cricket. Basically match referees will find whatever reasons they can to give leniency. The West Indies bowling must have been slow even taking that into account, thanks to the four-man pace attack and its success precluding the need to turn to spin. Roston Chase didn\u2019t bowl any spin in the second innings in Antigua. But then, the innings was done in 42 overs, so does it really matter how slow they were? Robert Wilson offers a different perspective. \u201cGeoff, I\u2019m not that bothered about the quasi-legal ins and outs of the Jason Holder decision. It just seems a remarkably tone-deaf response to the two-Test lesson in rigour, discretion and likeability he gave us. It was old school grace. Typical cricket self-harming. Christ.\u201d And there is, along with arguments that rules must be consistent and unbending, that. 30th over: Sri Lanka 87-5 (Mendis 13, Dhananjaya 1) Lyon with the last over before lunch, and it\u2019s a quiet one, Mendis working a single away to leg before DDS sees Sri Lanka safely through to the break. 29th over: Sri Lanka 86-5 (Mendis 12, Dhananjaya 1) With about six slips and a short leg, Dhananjaya de Silva just defends the ball past Starc and can take a run. There\u2019s no mid off or mid on. In classic Starc fashion, there\u2019s also a wide in the same over that he was on a hat-trick. ...as Dhananjaya de Silva defends stoutly back up the pitch. Not this time. He\u2019s on a hat-trick! Starc is doing it again in the second innings. We had a double Kusal partnership for all of one ball, but it\u2019s over. Kusal Perera was brave (or ill-advised) to bat after his horrible head knock yesterday. Perhaps luckily for him, his second knock doesn\u2019t last. Feels for a ball outside off and edges it. That\u2019s a beauty from Starc! Left-arm over to a left-hand batsman. Angled in with the arm and then straightened a touch off the pitch. Should have hit middle but hit off instead. Dickwella was nowhere near it, jabbing his bat down and hoping for a touch. Not to be. Bails off. 28th over: Sri Lanka 81-3 (Dickwella 25, Kusal Mendis 11) Lyon is bowling very nicely. Over the wicket to the right-hander, around the wicket to the left. They\u2019re both working singles into gaps though. Short leg, slip and leg slip in for Mendis, who still clips with the turn. Dickwella is angling the face of the bat to deflect runs of his own. Hasn\u2019t gone for any glory shots over cow against the turn. 27th over: Sri Lanka 77-3 (Dickwella 23, Kusal Mendis 9) Starc returns to try and blast out another before lunch. Dickwella turns the attempted yorker into a single. Mendis didn\u2019t have too much trouble against Starc in 2016, when he made 176 in Pallekele and 86 in Galle to set up two wins. He cuts a shorter ball quite nicely, straight to point, but a fumble lets him through for a run. 26th over: Sri Lanka 75-3 (Dickwella 22, Kusal Mendis 8) Lyon continues. Mendis sweeps for a single. Not to be outdone, Dickwella reverse sweeps. For none. Tries the regulation sweep instead and gets one. Mendis nearly pops up a catch to short leg, but Labuschagne can\u2019t quite get across in time as the ball was going back down the wicket, and he ends up face down having taken the ball on the half-volley. 25th over: Sri Lanka 73-3 (Dickwella 21, Kusal Mendis 7) Come on, Niroshan! He goes for an uppercut against Cummins but then bails out. Surely you\u2019re out there to play uppercuts at everything. Even yorkers. Mendis can be the more circumspect one, politely knocking away short balls for singles. 24th over: Sri Lanka 72-3 (Dickwella 21, Kusal Mendis 6) Lyon won\u2019t mind that. He likes bowling to lefties, given he can spin the ball away, so he\u2019d love to see Dickwella playing through cover. Even the batsman lathers that particular attempt for four. And that\u2019s why! After a couple of singles, Lyon lands one on a good length. Dickwella is hesitant in getting to the pitch and stabs at the in-between length. Big outside edge goes just fine of the slip catcher for three runs. Lucky for some. \u201cTop bowling!\u201d yells a very loud and lonely man below us in the stands. And it was, even if the over went for 10. There are not many people here on a Monday morning in the public service capital of the nation, I can ell you. Maybe a thousand, tops, by my guess? 23rd over: Sri Lanka 62-3 (Dickwella 13, Kusal Mendis 4) There\u2019s an album by Urthboy titled Distant Sense of Random Menace. That\u2019s what Pat Cummins has as a bowler. Always a sense of threat, even if you\u2019re not sure how it will manifest. He\u2019ll get you in the end. Kusal Mendis is next in, Sri Lanka\u2019s best batsman even at the tender age of 23. Or he might have just turned 24, I think his birthday is around now. He\u2019s unfazed by a Cummins bouncer first ball, and straight-drives the next for four. The line at the body works. Cummins keeps banging away at the ribcage, then goes shorter at the head, and Thirimanne fends away the ball without any timing. Splices it, hanging in the air, and Cummins has time to sprint down the wicket and dive to take a very good catch. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 57-2 (Thirimanne 30, Dickwella 12) It only takes one mistake. Lyon drags down, and Thirimanne is quickly in position for a late cut. Timing, and the outfield has sped up after a few days drying in decent sunshine. The ball skids away for four. 21st over: Sri Lanka 53-2 (Thirimanne 26, Dickwella 12) Cummins, around the wicket to the left-handed duo now. Into the body, cramping them up, as he does. Two slips, two gullies, and a point. They know where Thirimanne likes his runs. Which makes it a bit puzzling that Cummins keeps going at the ribcage, letting the batsman jab a single to leg. There is a short leg catcher under the lid, I suppose, if that shot goes awry. For Dickwella though, third man drops back from gully for the uppercut, while the two slips move into a steeper alignment. There\u2019s no roadblock, instead moving to backward square leg. Then there\u2019s a long leg as well. Field set for the pull shot. As I speak, the backward square moves into the deep as well. Cover and midwicket are open. None of this stops Dickwella going at the short ball, but he doesn\u2019t connect. 20th over: Sri Lanka 50-2 (Thirimanne 23, Dickwella 12) Sri Lanka need 516 runs to win. Is the Dickwella promotion about getting them as quickly as possible? Throws the bat again, edging Lyon past slip for three. Along with some ODI single-taking, they end with seven from the over. The team 50 arrives. 19th over: Sri Lanka 43-2 (Thirimanne 20, Dickwella 8) Four for Dickwella! I\u2019m not going to say that was a good shot in the traditional sense of the word, but it was effective. Full from Cummins and Dickwella shovels across the line and away through wide long-on. Lots of bottom hand, lots of risk if he missed, but he didn\u2019t. A proper slap shot, in the sense of having an ice hockey vibe. Now to toss gloves and throw some haymakers. And then here\u2019s Gary. Which is also true, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about a premeditated advantage. It\u2019s about someone like Holder seeing that he\u2019s smashing England by bowling them out with his quicks, so why would he change that and risk letting an opponent back into the game? It\u2019s more a case of doing what\u2019s working and hoping that it all turns out ok in the end. There\u2019s a lot of debate on my Twitter feed about the Jason Holder suspension. I can\u2019t copy it all over, but we\u2019ll bring in a few bits. First, Karan from earlier. \u201cOn the Jason Holder slow over rate issue; surely a team must be given shouldn\u2019t be penalised when the game finishes within three days. Surely there\u2019s an argument out there that teams should be given the benefit of the doubt when the match doesn\u2019t last the whole five days.\u201d I can see the appeal of this argument, but also it makes it a gamble for captains as to whether they\u2019ll be suspended. Take the risk of a slow rate and get away with it as long as there\u2019s an outright result. Or go slow all game and end up costing overs on day five, and only then will you be punished if it\u2019s a draw. That doesn\u2019t quite stack up for me. 18th over: Sri Lanka 39-2 (Thirimanne 20, Dickwella 4) Nearly got him! Lyon spears a flatter ball through, and Thirimanne thought it was a nice short one to cut, but it skipped past his attempted shot. Nearly the edge, then nearly takes off stump. Lyon does his best disbelief face. 17th over: Sri Lanka 39-2 (Thirimanne 20, Dickwella 4) Cummins gets his first gallop in a double change. The Sri Lankans are happy to take things easy against him at first. Let\u2019s see what he\u2019s got. Just a single from the over. 16th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (Thirimanne 19, Dickwella 4) Home Town Hero\u2122 time, as Nathan Lyon comes on for his first frolic of the day. Thirimanne can\u2019t decide whether to defend or attack. Tries both without notable success. Survives the over though, despite jabbing a single just past short leg at the end. 15th over: Sri Lanka 37-2 (Thirimanne 18, Dickwella 4) Another quick single from Starc, and this time Cummins does hit the woodwork, but Dickwella has made it. I wouldn\u2019t want to be batting with Thirimanne, especially. I\u2019d take him over Inzamam, but you get my drift. Starc gets some drift of his own, way down leg, and Paine does a Superman to save four byes, getting a hint of webbing on the ball to keep the extras to one. Karan Dhamija emails in. \u201cI can look into Manuka Oval from my apartment balcony but it\u2019s been devastating not being on Canberra during the test due to work but thanks to you and others and allowing me to vicariously experience this momentous occasion (including renditions of Great Southern Land which would have definitely woken me up every morning if I was in Canberra) for cricket in Canberra.\u201d At least it\u2019s 10:25 before the Icehouse stuff gets a spin, Karan. As opposed to the 85 versions of I Still Call Australia Home that Qantas got them to play at 7:30am on the first day. (I am also staying just over the road, but not at your house as far as I know.) 14th over: Sri Lanka 34-2 (Thirimanne 16, Dickwella 4) Thirimanne gets a single first ball. He wants to see the Dickwella show. And the keeper obliges with a rasping pull shot against Richardson for four! Richardson is so rattled that he bowls a wide, which is a tough ask in Test cricket. Dickwella is freeeeeee. 13th over: Sri Lanka 28-2 (Thirimanne 15) The wicket falls from the last ball of the over, just after Thirimanne had played a nice straight drive off Starc for three. And who\u2019s this walking out at No4? It\u2019s not Kusal Mendis. It\u2019s not Kusal Perera. It\u2019s Niroshan Dickwella! The wicketkeeper. Batting at two wickets down. Free to express himself at last. Sri Lanka\u2019s Independence Day will be Dickwella\u2019s Independence Day. He has got to get him one alien. Today, Chandimal is French for Chandibad. I\u2019m not sure that he\u2019s a No3, but he\u2019s insisted on playing there. Goes with hard hands defensively at a ball on a good length, into his body, and it takes the shoulder straight off to second slip. Chandi hangs around for a while to see if the catch carried, but the soft signal is out and the replay does nothing to dispel that idea. 12th over: Sri Lanka 25-1 (Thirimanne 12, Chandimal 4) The captain is proceeding serenely by waiting for balls on his pads and then working them for singles. Thirimanne faces most of the Richardson over, circumspect throughout this time, running a single away on the off side to end the stanza. That\u2019s very unexpected, but the man who was staggering off the ground dizzy and bent double yesterday morning will apparently bat when required later today. That doesn\u2019t tally with anything I know about concussion protocols, so it would be interesting to hear what the full story is there. Anyway, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve been told. 11th over: Sri Lanka 23-1 (Thirimanne 11, Chandimal 3) Starc again to Chandimal, who knocks a single to leg. Thirimanne lets a few good balls go, then chases a very wide one that he can\u2019t get near. There\u2019s another wayward one past leg stump as well. Well... I don\u2019t know about that. Keeping to a bowler who hits 150 kph and has a tendency to spray high bouncers and leg-side accidents, Paine is standing about 30 yards back from the stumps. In the time that a batsman whacks a ball straight to mid-on, can he realistically be over the stumps before the throw back is unleashed? Doubt it. 10th over: Sri Lanka 22-1 (Thirimanne 11, Chandimal 2) Richardson to Thirimanne, who leaves most of the over alone before hitting one uppishly through midwicket. Loves that airborne stroke, this man. We did get an extra rendition of that particular song this morning because today is the National Day of Sri Lanka, commemorating their independence day in 1948. And we got two goes at Advance Australia Fair at the Gabba because our own national day highly dubiously remains on January 26. Two Tests, four anthems. How lucky we are. 9th over: Sri Lanka 20-1 (Thirimanne 9, Chandimal 2) Normal service resumes, with Starc swinging one down leg side. That\u2019s no problem at all when he\u2019s also bowling the wicket-taking ones. Chandimal, the skipper, is now at the crease. He opens his account by working two runs through square. Got him! Starc was knocking over Karunaratne for fun in Sri Lanka back in 2016, but hasn\u2019t been able to replicate that in Australia. Now he does, left-arm over to a left-hander, a bit of shape in perhaps, looks like a slight inside edge but perhaps there wasn\u2019t even that. It clips leg stump after stating outside off stump, and off go the bails as the ball flies down to the fine leg boundary. 8th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (Karunaratne 8, Thirimanne 9) Jhye Richardson commences from the Manuka Church end, beneath our window. Great view here. He gets some early swing into the pads, and Thirimanne bats out a maiden. 7th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (Karunaratne 8, Thirimanne 9) Starc is starting us off for the day, having regained the confidence of his captain. He didn\u2019t start with the ball yesterday morning. Away we go, and there\u2019s nearly a run out second ball! Thirimanne drives straight to Cummins but runs anyway, and Australia\u2019s gun misses the throw at the striker\u2019s end that would have done for Karunaratne. The dicey single is all they get, as Starc cranks up the speedometer and the short ball in the first over. Twitter certainly has its downsides, but it also offers things like this. That Final Word podcast (episode 10) is here, if you\u2019re interested. This has been a good Test for Australia in terms of finally getting some tangible results for individual players who needed them. Obviously the circumstances of a lower-ranked opponent facing all kinds of injury difficulties in foreign conditions mean that players have a much better chance to do well. But it still matters to make the most of that chance. Usman Khawaja has, getting his first hundred of the summer and hopefully a bit of spring back into his step after some injury hassles and during some ongoing off-field dramas. Joe Burns made a huge one when it mattered in the first dig, as did Travis Head, and Kurtis Patterson followed up with his own hundred once the ascendancy had been won. Mitchell Starc then grabbed five wickets, even if at times in strange and fortuitous ways. So they\u2019re all on the board. Marcus Harris, on the other hand, has followed a decent series against India with a poor one against a much more placid bowling attack. He\u2019s got out to very loose shots each time, which doesn\u2019t bode well for England. And Marnus Labuschagne couldn\u2019t make a run in Canberra after a good knock on his home ground in Brisbane. As always, you can make your own contributions to the OBO: thoughts, questions, considerations. Find me on Twitter at @GeoffLemonSport or email me at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. A lot of angst on the timeline this morning about Jason Holder\u2019s suspension from the final West Indies Test hosting England. He\u2019s been an inspirational leader in this series and got his team to 2-0 up, and now he\u2019s been banned for bowling too slowly. Well, for his team bowling too slowly, not for his own figures on the speed gun. Which might have been an issue earlier in his career. A lot of arguments (these are the rules) and counter-arguments (how can your over rate be too slow when you\u2019ve won in three days). I have some sympathy for both sides of it. Slow over rates are annoying. But then, if a team is winning with four fast bowlers coming off long run-ups and taking lots of wickets, why should they have to stop just to get through more deliveries an hour? Perhaps the line below is the most compelling argument. Not sure what the solution is, but it\u2019s not the one we have at present. The surface is starting to look a bit blotchy and worn, but it\u2019s played very truly so far. Decent bounce throughout for both teams, which has helped bring about catches behind the wicket. (As have some horrible shots, mind you.) The footmarks might start to be a factor for Nathan Lyon today, who picked up a couple of wickets on his home(ish) ground here in Canberra. Counting down, and we are ready to start day four of the inaugural Test at Manuka Oval. And we can call the experiment a success. Crowds so far of 8556 on the opening Friday, then 11,388 on the Saturday, and 8397 on the Sunday. Pretty good going in a small ground, and it has felt full and cheerful throughout. Barring a lot of rain or a Sri Lankan batting performance for the ages, it should end today. The visiting team hasn\u2019t lost a wicket yet, reaching 0 for 17 after Australia declared for the second time in the match late on the third day. But they\u2019re missing a batsman, with Kusal Janith Perera concussed by Jhye Richardson in the first innings, and that first innings showed that once a wicket fell, a few tended to follow. Sri Lanka\u2019s opener Dimuth Karunaratne also retired hurt in the first innings after being hit on the back of the neck, which was a frightening moment for everyone. Not least for Pat Cummins, who had bowled that ball. But Karunaratne was cleared at hospital of any damage, and was able to resume his innings the next day and raise a half century. He\u2019ll resume again today in his second dig on 8 not out. Sri Lanka need 516 to win, or to bat for two full days to draw. There was some rain forecast but the day has cleared to be sunny with some high and distant cloud.",

      "bodyText": "Refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi has been given 60 days to prepare a defence against Bahrain\u2019s attempt to extradite him from Thailand. The 25-year-old will remain in a Thai prison for more than two months after a judge denied him bail and gave his lawyers until 5 April to file a written appeal before the next scheduled hearing on 22 April. Al-Araibi arrived at Bangkok\u2019s Ratchadaphisek criminal court on Monday morning shackled and barefoot with more than a dozen other prisoners. He was flanked by a guard at each arm and several more behind him. He shouted \u201cdon\u2019t send me to Bahrain\u201d. Supporters shouted back: \u201cAustralia is with you\u201d and \u201cYour wife sends her love\u201d. Al-Araibi, the Australian resident and refugee from Bahrain, has spent almost 70 days detained in Thailand while his country of birth seeks his extradition. A high-profile and extraordinarily unified international campaign seeks his return to Australia, but Thailand has insisted on sending his case through the courts. His appearance on Monday marked the formal beginning of proceedings after Bahrain\u2019s extradition request was formally accepted for consideration on Friday. In court, Al-Araibi stood as the judge read out Bahrain\u2019s allegations against him. He told the court he refused to be extradited. Al-Araibi told the judge the charges against him were politically motivated, and that he feared persecution for religious reasons and for seeking asylum in Australia. Allan McKinnon, Australia\u2019s ambassador designate, as well as delegates from other countries and embassies, appeared as a \u201ccoalition of support\u201d, according to Craig Foster, the former Australian Socceroo captain who is spearheading the campaigning to free al-Araibi. The coalition included representatives of 14 countries and the European Union. Speaking outside the court, McKinnon called for the Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-ocha, to directly intervene to ensure the footballer\u2019s release, after the prosecutor had confirmed he had executive powers to do so. \u201cWe are asking prime minister Prayut to allow Hakeem al-Araibi to return to Australia, he is a refugee, allow him to return to Australia to his friends and his family in the Australian community,\u201d he told reporters. Federico Addiechi, head of sustainability and diversity at Fifa, also attended the hearing to show football\u2019s governing body supported al-Araibi. He said Fifa had made overtures to the football associations of Thailand, Bahrain and Australia but said there were \u201cno legal grounds\u201d for the organisation to enact sanctions called for by advocates. \u201cThat problem is not with the football association in the two or three countries, the problem is elsewhere,\u201d he said. Al-Araibi was arrested on 27 November when he arrived in Bangkok for a honeymoon with his wife. Thai authorities made the arrest on the basis of an Interpol red notice which was issued against the agency\u2019s own policies, which dictate they can\u2019t be issued against refugees on behalf of the countries they fled. Within days the red notice was lifted, but Thai authorities instead pointed to an extradition request by Bahrain. Al-Araibi\u2019s detention was extended by 60 days to allow Bahrain to file its extradition documentation, which was assessed by prosecutors and given to the Thai court on Friday. Thailand maintains it is following legal processes and its immigration chief, Surachate Hakparn, continues to refer to arrest warrants, despite the lifting of the red notice. It has continued to entertain Bahrain\u2019s claim that Al-Araibi is wanted over the vandalism incident of 2012, for which he was convicted in absentia to 10 years in jail, despite evidence he was playing in a televised football match either at the same time as the crime or so close to it he would have been unable to get there. Thailand is not a signatory to the refugee convention and has a history of sending refugees back to their countries of origin. Last month, amid international outcry about Saudi teenager Rahaf al-Qunun, Hakparn pledged the country would no longer return refugees \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d, but said that did not apply to al-Araibi\u2019s case. Chatchom Akapin, director general of the Thai attorney general\u2019s international affairs department, has said the extradition request is for a criminal act. Extraditions for political prosecutions are against Thai law, according to the Bangkok Post. Bahrain, which has an extensively documented history of prisoner mistreatment, including an inquiry commissioned by the king which found a number of deaths in custody as a result, denies al-Araibi faces danger. Al-Araibi told the Guardian last month he believed Bahrain was seeking his return as retribution for public comments he made in 2016 criticising a member of the royal family over his failure to protect athletes during Bahrain\u2019s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011 and 2012.",

After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/12/cowboys-rams-chiefs-colts-nfl-playoffs\">beating the Dallas Cowboys 30-22</a>, the Rams traveled to New Orleans for what\u2019s gone down as one of the most infamous NFC championship games in NFL history.</p> \n  <p>Trailing by three points with less than two minutes left, the Saints were deep in Los Angeles territory poised to score a game-winning touchdown \u2013 or at the very least drain the clock and kick a game-winning field goal.

Had it been correctly called, the Saints would have received a fresh set of downs to work with and almost certainly would have won. Instead, they settled for a field goal and had to return possession to the Rams, who tied the game on their drive.

They were a mere 11-5 in the regular season, with their perfect record at home at Gillette Stadium balanced out by a less-than-perfect road mark of 3-5. It was, however, good enough to give them a much-needed bye week that allowed them to skip the first round of the playoffs.</p> \n  <p>In the divisional round, they knocked off the <em>other</em> Los Angeles team, the Chargers, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/13/nfl-divisional-round-playoffs-los-angeles-chargers-new-england-patriots-latest-score\">41-28 blowout</a> that was by no mean, as close as the scoreline indicates. They had more of a struggle with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/mahomes-mvp-kansas-city-chiefs\">newly minted MVP</a> Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC title game. After taking a late lead in a back-and-forth barnburner, the Chiefs were able to force overtime. Unfortunately for Kansas City, they were burnt by the NFL\u2019s rules which allows for a game to end if a team scores a touchdown on the first possession of OT. The Chiefs lost the coin toss, the Patriots got the ball and Rex Burkhead scored the game-winning touchdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/20/afc-championship-game-new-england-patriots-v-kansas-city-chiefs-live\">The Patriots won 37-31</a>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fb49f59087aeb42a840b929335f2912fd0fd9c9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb49f59087aeb42a840b929335f2912fd0fd9c9/0_0_3690_2673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Brady\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New England quarterback Tom Brady arrives at Mercedes-Benz Stadium before Super Bowl LIII.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark J Rebilas/USA Today Sports</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T21:31:55.994Z\">at 9.31pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57470ce4b0d86c5643831d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T20:11:41.912Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Guardian US columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/super-bowl-patriots-rams-commerce-conscience-social-justice\">writes that</a> tonight\u2019s Super Bowl will be a \u201cthree-way bare-knuckle brawl between the perpetually dueling American values of competition, commerce and conscience\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This clash of conscience is one of the reasons why the NFL struggled to find performers for its halftime show, even though an appearance would mean being exposed to over a hundred million viewers in the United States alone. That can translate into a lot of money. Yet famous singers such as Cardi B, Jay Z, and Rihanna refused to perform out of solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, who has been blackballed for his non-violent, non-verbal message that there is racial inequality and injustice in America. Instead, they have Maroon 5, Big Boi, Travis Scott, and, to sing the national anthem, Gladys Knight. The backlash against the NFL and these performers resulted in the league cancelling the traditional pre-game news conference for the half-time show performers, with the excuse, \u201cAs it is about music, the artists will let their show do the talking as they prepare to take the stage this Sunday.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Clearly, it isn\u2019t just \u201cabout the music\u201d, but also about what the Super Bowl represents. Our ethics aren\u2019t drowned out by Moves Like Jagger as if we were kittens distracted by a laser pointer. Given the increasing political divisiveness in the country, the game isn\u2019t just a game, it\u2019s a cultural symbol of what we stand for and what we turn our backs on. President Trump made football a much bigger political icon in 2017 when he told NFL owners they should fire or suspend any player who takes a knee because that\u2019s disrespecting the flag. He saw no irony in the fact that his calling for the punishment of people who peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights was exactly why the Founders created the First Amendment. Since taking office, Trump has lied to the country over 8,000 times \u2013 an egregious disrespect of the flag, the Constitution, and the country. His daily crock of lies has slowed slightly since he got crock-blocked by Nancy Pelosi, but he is still the quarterback to the NFL\u2019s anti-free speech blitz.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/super-bowl-patriots-rams-commerce-conscience-social-justice\">The Super Bowl is a showdown of America's dueling values: commerce and conscience</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c574650e4b0d86c56438318\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/hunter-felt\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T19:58:16.927Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TonmeisterJones/status/1092147769765183488\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@hunterfelt</a> If you'd told 11-year-old me in 1986 that there would be a Superbowl between the Patriots and the Rams, I'd have laughed for about three years straight.</p>\u2014 Shaun (@TonmeisterJones) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonmeisterJones/status/1092147769765183488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And it\u2019s actually the second one!

Over the past three postseasons (2016-2018), White leads the NFL with eight total touchdowns.</li> \n   <li>New England tight end Rob Gronkowski has 12 touchdown receptions in his postseason career and trails only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice (22) for the most in NFL playoff history. Gronkowski\u2019s 1,076 receiving yards and 12 touchdown receptions are the most ever by a tight end in NFL postseason history.</li> \n   <li>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay, who is 33 years and 10 days old today, is the youngest head coach to lead his team to the Super Bowl. In each of the past two seasons under McVay, the Rams have ranked first or second in points per game.</li> \n   <li>Rams quarterback Jared Goff, the No 1 overall selection in the 2016 NFL draft, is the first quarterback selected No 1 overall to reach the Super Bowl within his first three seasons. Four quarterbacks (Hall of Famers Troy Aikman and John Elway, and Drew Bledsoe and Eli Manning) each reached the Super Bowl in their fourth season.</li> \n   <li>Los Angeles running back Todd Gurley has rushed for a touchdown in each of the team\u2019s two postseason games this season. Gurley led the NFL with 21 touchdowns (17 rushing, four receiving) and ranked fourth with 1,831 scrimmage yards. Rams running back CJ Anderson leads the team in postseason rushing and has 481 rushing yards in the postseason since 2014, the most in the NFL over that span.</li> \n   <li>In the NFC championship game, Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks led the team with seven receptions and 107 receiving yards. Cooks had 80 catches and 1,204 receiving yards in the regular season and became the first player in NFL history to record at least 1,000 receiving yards with three different teams in three consecutive seasons. With New England in 2017, Cooks recorded 65 receptions for 1,082 yards and seven touchdowns and added 10 receptions for 155 yards in the playoffs.</li> \n   <li>Los Angeles defensive tackle Aaron Donald led the NFL with 20.5 sacks in 2018 and joined Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor (1986) as the only players to record 20+ sacks and make it to the Super Bowl in the same season. Rams defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh recorded 1.5 sacks in the NFC championship game and has recorded at least one sack in three of his past four playoff games.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T19:19:17.852Z\">at 7.19pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5733f8e4b072f2ace1c320\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tomlutz\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T18:37:10.522Z\">6.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/03/donald-trump-super-bowl-barron-nfl-brain-injuries\">spoke to CBS in an interview broadcast today</a> and gave some of his thoughts on the NFL and football in general. Despite bemoaning the fact in 2016 that, in his opinion, safety measures to combat concussions have made football \u201csoft\u201d, the president today said he\u2019d rather his son Barron played soccer as football is a \u201cdangerous sport\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football,\u201d Trump said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation this morning. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a dangerous sport and \u2026 I thought the equipment would get better, and it has. The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn\u2019t solved the problem.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo, you know, I hate to say it because I love to watch football. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son, well I\u2019ve heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl\">NFL</a> players saying they wouldn\u2019t let their sons play football. So. It\u2019s not totally unique, but I would have a hard time with it.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6371c105-8ee9-443d-af39-d82f7d9d5474\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVPL1hysCfc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, which can only be diagnosed after death, has been found in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/28/nfl-concussion-numbers-2017-season\">hundreds of former football players</a> although it is most commonly associated with NFL veterans rather than young athletes. Symptoms of CTE include depression, suicidal thoughts, memory loss and mood swings.<br></p> \n  <p>The specter of brain trauma \u2013 along with the controversy over the national anthem protests \u2013 was one of the reasons given for the NFL\u2019s decline in ratings last season. Many people thought viewers no longer wanted to watch a sport that may end up killing many of its participants (although NFL ratings have risen again this season). </p> \n  <p>There\u2019s little doubt that brain trauma concerns the NFL. Several high-profile former players have taken their own lives, including two players who starred for one of today\u2019s Super Bowl teams, the New England Patriots. Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau took his own life in 2012 and Aaron Hernandez ended his own life in prison in 2017 while serving a life sentence for murder. Both men were later found to have been suffering from CTE at the times of their death. Significantly, Seau shot himself in the chest, which meant his brain could be studied after his death.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not just professional players who suffer brain trauma however. Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski was suffering from CTE when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/17/tyler-hilinski-washington-state-quarterback-dies-in-apparent-suicide\">he took his own life in 2018</a>, according to his family. \u201c[Tyler] had the brain of a 65-year-old, which is really hard to take,\u201d his father, Mark, said. </p> \n  <p>CTE fears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/high-school-football-numbers-drop-brain-trauma\">appear to be hitting football at its roots</a>. Recent studies have shown that high school football participation rates have dropped in recent years just as \u201csafer\u201d sports such as baseball, soccer and basketball are growing.</p> \n  <p>There are signs that the NFL\u2019s measures to make the game safer \u2013 such as discouraging helmet-to-helmet tackles, strengthening checks for concussion during games and developing safer equipment \u2013 are working. Concussions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/24/nfl-concussions-decline-injury-report-2018\">were down 29% in the 2018 regular season</a>, although many would argue that even a single concussion is one too many.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/19/nfl-star-brain-injuries-destroyed\">The NFL star and the brain injuries that destroyed him</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57304ae4b072f2ace1c2eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T18:20:49.094Z\">6.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Super Bowl LIII will be an indoor game.

He said then that the Rams would beat the Patriots, and he\u2019s sticking to that pick today. Here\u2019s how our panel of writers see today\u2019s game playing out:</p> \n  <p><strong>New England Patriots 24-21 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a>.</strong> Every time the Patriots play in the Super Bowl it\u2019s a close game. Their differential in Super Bowls in the Brady-Belichick era is +3; their largest margin of victory has been six points. This game will be no different. The Rams have elite-level talent all over the field on both sides of the ball, but I\u2019m backing Brady and Belichick to pick out and exploit LA\u2019s weaknesses. <strong>Oliver Connolly</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>New England Patriots 34-28 Los Angeles Rams</strong>. Considering the fast track under the dome in Atlanta and the points these teams have put up, you can expect video game levels of offense throughout. It only matters who has the ball last, and it\u2019s Brady and Belichick: we all know the script by now. <strong>David Lengel</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>New England Patriots 24-27 Los Angeles Rams.</strong> While it\u2019s never wise to bet against the Patriots, it\u2019s possible to say that they overachieved just to make it this far, coming out of one of their<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/24/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-nfl-2018-season\"> least impressive regular seasons</a> of the Brady/Belichick era and requiring a coin flip to help them to beat the Chiefs. The Patriots Dynasty began with a three-point win over a very talented Rams team, it would be poetic for it to finish with a three-point loss to a Rams team that just so happens to also have a great young quarterback in Goff and a celebrated head coach in Sean McVay. <strong>Hunter Felt</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>New England Patriots 31-33 Los Angeles Rams</strong>. Because (humblebrag alert) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/07/nfl-2018-predictions-mvp-super-bowl-winner\">Rams over Patriots was my preseason pick</a> for the Super Bowl, and I can\u2019t come this far and back out now. <strong>Paolo Bandini</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/super-bowl-predictions-new-england-patriots-los-angeles-rams\">Super Bowl predictions: Guardian writers' picks for Patriots v Rams in Atlanta</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T17:45:00.864Z\">at 5.45pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c57241ae4b0d86c5643820e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tomlutz\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T17:26:14.468Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Atlanta has escaped the worst of the polar vortex that has frozen large parts of the United States this week. Super Bowl Sunday has started mild and overcast. There are a few showers forecast for this afternoon, and a decision is yet to be made on weather the roof at the Mercedes-Benz stadium will be open or not for the game. Atlanta has done a fine job as a host so far, and there\u2019s been a lively atmosphere over the last few days, helped by the ridiculously helpful and welcoming volunteers. Judging by the jerseys on the streets, support is split between evenly between the Patriots and Rams although most residents here are backing the Rams. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c532b89e4b0e0e1bbc248b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-31T17:09:16.258Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bryan will be here shortly. </strong>In the meantime here\u2019s a look at how one of today\u2019s coaches has stayed on top for nearly two decades (clue: it\u2019s not the guy in his early 30s):</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/29/bill-belichick-new-england-patriots-strategy-nfl-super-bowl-liii\">How shapeshifter Bill Belichick has beaten a league built for parity for 18 years</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T17:08:51.541Z\">at 5.08pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

So that does it for our coverage: the Patriots, now arguably the greatest dynasty in the modern era, will enjoy yet another parade in the coming days. That\u2019s all for our day-long coverage of Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. Be sure to check out Tom Lutz\u2019s report from Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Trophy Here comes Vince Wilfork, then Emmitt Smith, then Joe Namath (a Jet, wow!) with the Vince Lombardi trophy, kissed by Pats players as it heads to the podium. Commissioner Roger Goodell is booed before handing the trophy to Kraft, who hoists the silverware, again. The world outside of New England shakes their collective heads. \u201cThere is one constant throughout these 18 years. Two men who are the best at what they\u2019ve done in the history of the NFL. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. And through their hard work and great leadership, I am honored to say for the sixth time, we are all Patriots and once again we\u2019re world champions!\u201d -Robert Kraft \u201cIt\u2019s sweet Jim [Nantz]. Everybody counted us out, from the beginning of the season and the mid season, but we\u2019re still here.\u201d -Bill Belichick \u201cJust so proud of our team. The support here was like a home game, it could have been Gillette Stadium...\u201d How will you motivate yourself to do this again? \u201cLook at this, how could this not motivate you!\u201d -Tom Brady Tom Brady Mobbed by cameras and just about everybody in the dome, Brady hugs CJ Anderson of the Rams and embraces Edelman. Then Kraft enters the fray for some love as the two lock arms. CBS in the US are desperate to get that interview but it\u2019s madness. OK, here we go. \u201cYou know it was an unbelievable year....it\u2019s unbelievable to win this game...the Rams made it tough on every play...the defense made it hard every play.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been this far and lost which is really tough. We had a lot of resolve the last couple of weeks. I wish we played a little biut harder on offense. I can\u2019t believe it...Super Bowl champs.\u201d On retirement...does winning a sixth title change anything? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. I can\u2019t wait to spend some time with my kinds and my life...I am so happy for my teammates, this is a dream come true for all of us.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like Brady is going anywhere. The New England Patriots have won Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. It\u2019s their sixth title in nine tries during this Brady/Belichick run! Zuerlein misses from 48, and this game is all but over! Patriots 13-3 Rams 0:08, 4th quarter Cooks has a 24-yard reception and the Rams are at the 49. Belichick puts everybody back. Cooks has a catch at the 29 and Goff spikes the ball and here comes the field goal unit. Patriots 13-3 Rams 0:52, 4th quarter Goff is incomplete looking for Cooks, and then LA are called for holding, just to make it all that much more painful. Woods takes it up to the 26 as the clock ticks... That\u2019s the Patriots all-time leading scorer sealing a Super Bowl title. His kickoff goes into the endzone. Here come the Rams trying to pull many rabbits out of no hats. It\u2019s good! Barely, but it\u2019s good! The New England Patriots are going to win the Super Bowl again! Patriots 10-3 Rams 1:16, 4th quarter Belichick keeps the offense on the field, runs down the clock and calls a timeout. Does he kick with Gostkowski or something else? They\u2019re gonna kick! It\u2019s about a 41 yard attempt! Patriots 10-3 Rams 1:47, 4th quarter Michel on third and short, and he\u2019s short! Or is he? There\u2019s a measurement. Yes he is! It\u2019s fourth and inches! What does Belichick do? Patriots 10-3 Rams 2:00, 4th quarter Michel runs right, and now it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 1 at the Rams 24 as we hit the two-minute warning. Unless something bananas happens Tom Brady is going to win this thing. Again. Patriots 10-3 Rams 2:25, 4th quarter Michel runs for around four yards, but there is a flag. It\u2019s two actually: a hold and an illegal use of the hands call on New England. LA refuse the penaltie. to get the down. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 6. Patriots 10-3 Rams 2:30, 4th quarter New England are running, and who is it? Burkhead, steaming down to LA\u2019s 33 and it\u2019s a 26-yard gain for the lunch-pail back who has an enormous first down, and that may do it. LA call their final tiomeout. Patriots 10-3 Rams 2:42, 4th quarter Fowler puts illegal hands to the face and it\u2019s another first down for the Pats. That moves the ball up to the Pats 37. Michel is running again for just a few yards. Rams call timeout. They have one left. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 7. Patriots 10-3 Rams 2:47, 4th quarter Michel is running again and this time there\u2019s room! Lot\u2019s of room! Right up the middle, Michel has a huge 26-yard gain! That\u2019s not going to help LA. Patriots 10-3 Rams 3:50, 4th quarter Both teams have a pair of timeouts. New England will start running clock. Michel runs into the line as we hear ticks... Gilmore picks off Goff! He was looking for Cooks but the pass was all wrong and the Pats have possession! Cooks had to make that catch in the end zone in the prior play! That was the moment! Patriots 10-3 Rams 4:24, 4th quarter Goff goes endzone! He\u2019s got Cooks and it goes in and out of his hands! That would have been a touchdown throw but Cooks botched it! Patriots 10-3 Rams 4:27, 4th quarter Goff is money, finding Reynolds for a key third down to keep this drive alive for the Rams. They\u2019re at the Pats 44. Now they\u2019re inside the 30 after Goff hits Cooks on a flag play! Patriots 10-3 Rams 5:29, 4th quarter Goff gets pressure, he\u2019s knocked down after tossing an incomplete pass. It\u2019s a huge 3rd &amp; 9 coming up here for LA. Patriots 10-3 Rams 5:46, 4th quarter Gut check time for LA. Good start: a screen pass to Cooks turns into a big gain down the far sideline for a gain of 19 to the 44. Sony Michel is into the endzone! That\u2019s a real live touchdown play and at a huge moment in this game. Pats in pole position as we head down the stretch in Atlanta! Patriots 3-3 Rams 7:08, 4th quarter Big play to Gronkowski dow to the two-yard line! Great throw to the tight end and it\u2019s first and goal to go for New England! We\u2019re in the red zone! It\u2019s true! Patriots 3-3 Rams 7:53, 4th quarter Brady: a tremendous timing floater to Gronkowski to start the drive. It\u2019s a first down on his fifth catch, this one an 18-yard reception. The crowd cheers \u201cBrady, Brady...\u201d He answers, finding Edelman, his 10th catch for 141 yards. Quickly, New England are inside the Rams 40... Patriots 3-3 Rams 9:49, 4th quarter It\u2019s 3rd and 22 long yards. Goff, hands to Gurley, and he\u2019s hit hard by Flowers for a loss! So the Rams had the ball for some time, but the drive comes to naught. Super Bowl record holding punter Hekker comes out and does what he does, what he\u2019s been doing, a lot, kicks it, down to the Patriots 31. I\u2019m still excited, but why? Patriots 3-3 Rams 10:30, 4th quarter Gurley is back and running, but the center, John Sullivan, is flagged for holding. So now it\u2019s 1st &amp; 20 on the Rams 33. Goff has a cut on his left hand, and now he\u2019s HARD hit while running towards the sideline: Jonathan Jones comes about as close to a personal foul as you can get but there\u2019s no flag! It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 22 after a loss of two and the Pats fourth sack. Patriots 3-3 Rams 11:35, 4th quarter Goff is incomplete on 2nd &amp; 11 and falls to the ground after pressure. Big 3rd &amp; 11 now for LA, and Goff fires into a green swath of turf, incomplete. There\u2019s a flag downfield, but for what? It\u2019s defensive holding and that turns a punt situation into a fresh set of downs, which has to drive Bill Belichick out of his skull. LA on their 27. Now they\u2019re on the 44 as Goff hits Cooks on a curl. Nice gain, and perhaps LA will capitalize on that penalty? Email Christopher Lee writes: \u201cIf Greg the Leg kicks a field goal at the end of the fourth quarter to win the game 6-3 for the rams, could he be in with a chance of winning MVP? Not that that is going to happen. This has got Tom Brady 2 minute drill to win written all over it, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Doubtful. Possible. Yeah, but the big bats are coming up... Patriots 3-3 Rams 12:23, 4th quarter The Rams are on their own 22. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 7, and New England want to talk it over. The Patriots call their first timeout of the game. Patriots 3-3 Rams 12:47, 4th quarter A false start turns a 2nd &amp; 1 until a 2nd &amp; 6. That\u2019s clumsy. Will it matter? Anderson bounces outside but Gilmore punches the ball out of his hands! The ball is loose! Luckily for LA, it rolls out of bounds! It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 2, and now Goff finds Cooks who is running to his right for an eight yard gain and a first down. Fresh set of downs for the Rams. Patriots 3-3 Rams 14:19, 4th quarter Goff has Anderson, who takes a little nothing into a nine-yard gain on the far sideline. That was a dump that looked to be going nowhere: Goff is gaining confidence. Patriots 3-3 Rams 14:47, 4th quarter On 3rd &amp; 4, Littleton breaks up a pass looking for White. Brady was rushed on the play, and there\u2019s been a momentum shift in Atlanta! But Allen does a great job on the punt. The Rams start from their own seven. Patriots 3-3 Rams, end of 3rd quarter Michel has it again, and this time he\u2019s wrapped up, and the whistle is blown without the back hitting the turf. And that will do it for the third quarter. Surely we\u2019ve never completed three quarters of a Super Bowl without a touchdown, right? It\u2019ll be second and long around midfield when we resume. Patriots 3-3 Rams 0:14, 3rd quarter On 2nd &amp; 9, Brady finds White who is running towards the near sideline...but there\u2019s a flag. It\u2019s defensive holding, which as we all know is an automatic first down. Pats have it at their 31. Now they\u2019re at the 50! Michel runs right, finds a hole, bounces off a tackle and runs to midfield after a gain of 19! Great hard-nosed run there. Patriots 3-3 Rams 2:11, 3rd quarter New England start at their own 25. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was excited about a third quarter field goal. Goff, from the shotgun, and he is destroyed! The Pats mob bursts up the middle, first Hightower, then Van Noy, throwing the Rams kid QB to the turf! The Rams TD drive is stalled in favor of the field goal unit. Greg \u201cthe leg\u201d (original) is good from 53! We\u2019re tied! How about that? I think I\u2019m excited! Patriots 3-0 Rams 3:05, 3rd quarter Play action, and Goff goes to the endzone! Cooks has his hands on, leaping for the pill, but McCourty knocks it away just in time! And now it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7... Patriots 3-0 Rams 3:42, 3rd quarter Here come the Rams! Goff fires and connects with Woods over the middle! That\u2019s an 18-yard gain! LA call timeout with the play clock trickling down to two seconds. When we come back, it\u2019s 1st &amp; 10 at the Pats 29... Patriots 3-0 Rams 4:23, 3rd quarter On 2nd &amp; 7, Goff faces pressure and throws it into the arm of Anderson, except Anderson is facing the wrong way. The Rams are 0-8 on third down. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7. Patriots 3-0 Rams 5:03, 3rd quarter Now Anderson has the fourth Rams first down of the night with a four-yard run. This counts as a drive! And wait, there\u2019s more! Cooks has a reception on the near sideline and that\u2019s another gain up to their own 49! Are we seeing the effects of Chung\u2019s absence? Patriots 3-0 Rams 6:10, 3rd quarter Goff finds Reynolds on the far sideline for a gain of seven. I call that progress. Patriots 3-0 Rams 6:33, 3rd quarter Brady looks for Hogan on the far sideline, Peters is on him and breaks it up. I thought I saw a judge reaching for a flag before deciding against it. OK. Every time I write punt, you take a drink. Is it too late for that? It\u2019s a 42-yard kick, which is very un Hekker-like. LA start at the 23. Patriots 3-0 Rams 6:54, 3rd quarter After a NE penalty pushes the Pats back, Brady connects with Edelman over the middle for eight, setting up another big third down. If the Rams win this, I\u2019m with that! Take that Edelman! Patriots 3-0 Rams 8:36, 3rd quarter Goff has heat in the endzone and he throws it away. Hightower put Goff on his back just after the throw. And here comes Mr You Know Who, who has an incredible kick! It skids all the way down to the Pats 29, and that\u2019s a record for Hekker: the longest punt in Super Bowl history at 65 yards! All these punts. It was all worth it, just for that moment! Patriots 3-0 Rams 9:05, 3rd quarter On 2nd &amp; 8 Anderson runs right for about two, up to the four-yard line. That makes it 3rd &amp; 6. Don\u2019t expect anything too splashy from LA deep in their territory. Injury update Chung is done... Will that open anything up for Los Angeles? Stay tuned to find out, the Rams offense are on the field. Patriots 3-0 Rams 10:06, 3rd quarter Another quick pass to Edelman for a gain of about eight, setting up a 3rd &amp;2. Now Brady is in the shotgun: he has time, but his pass towards the far sideline and Edelman is incomplete, so LA hold a and NE will kick. Allen\u2019s punt lands at the two and is downed! So the Rams will have a long way to go as they try to get something, anything on the scoreboard. Patriots 3-0 Rams 10:56, 3rd quarter Brady hits Edelman again in the middle of the field, and there\u2019s room to roam for the wideout. By the time it\u2019s over it\u2019s a big 27-yard third down conversion up to the New England 41! Edelman cannot be stopped. Patriots 3-0 Rams 11:58, 3rd quarter Two little runs, first from Michel and then from Burkhead, set up a 3rd &amp; 4. Patriots 3-0 Rams 12:58, 3rd quarter It\u2019s a big 3rd &amp; 5 as the Rams try to establish their offense. Goff is back to pass and throws into double coverage towards Cooks and Gilmore knocks it away. Here\u2019s a familiar sight: the Rams punting unit. It\u2019s Hekker\u2019s seventh kick. New England will start at their eight yard line. Injury update Chung is up and walking under his own power but it looks like he came down wrong on his right arm and he\u2019s heading to the lockers. Will he be back? He did not play in the second half of Super Bowl LII last season after suffering an injury. Patriots 3-0 Rams 14:07, 3rd quarter Gurely has it! He runs right, he cuts left and he has room! First down and Todd Gurley is alive for a 16-yard gain! And now he\u2019s running again! This time for six more yards! Was this the plan all along? Now Pats safety Patrick Chung is shaken up, much to the chagrin who wears a look of concern on the sideline. Patriots 3-0 Rams 14:56, 3rd quarter Goff throws over the middle and it\u2019s in and out of the mitts of Hightower! That should have been a half-opening pick! And we\u2019re back... A touchback starts off the second half and away we go. Rams start at the 25. Pure punting. True, and I like a pitching duel as much as the next guy, and even better in a Game 7 of the World Series ... but come on! Wanna bet? Bookmakers.tv is reporting that Super Bowl LIII has broken previous betting records in the UK as British fans have wagered over \u00a328 million on the game. If the Rams win, UK bookies will be faced with payouts of over \u00a340m - reportedly a new betting record. Now, if we could only get a touchdown. The peanut gallery So far this has been the most interesting reveal in Super Bowl LIII: a commercial advertising the 100th season of the NFL. Stats Well, Goff has 52 yards passing, and Todd Gurley has three carries for 10 yards, just how LA drew it up. New England have had the ball for 19:52, which I think is longer than they had the ball in the first half v Kansas City in the AFC Championship. Edelman is cementing his MVP candidacy with 93 yards receiving, while Brady has been mostly fine if not spectacular. Now the adjustments begin in the locker room, and there\u2019s lots of time, because Adam Levine beckons. From a fan perspective, it would be great if something fun happened in the second half, just because, you know, I\u2019m worried about the folks who paid on average around $4,300 per ticket getting a decent show. Yep, that will do it for the opening half of Super Bowl LIII. I guess that track meet I predicted isn\u2019t gonna happen. It\u2019s not the fewest combined points in a half in Super Bowl history (2, Minnesota v Pittsburgh, XI), but it\u2019s awfully close! Patriots 3-0 Rams 0:16, 2nd quarter Now Goff is looking for Woods but it\u2019s short of a first down stopping the clock. The Rams have to punt! It\u2019s a good one, down to the New England 2. That will likely do it for the first half. Patriots 3-0 Rams 0:57, 2nd quarter Goff is sacked by Hightower! No timeout called... Patriots 3-0 Rams 1:13, 2nd quarter Brady drops back to pass and fires to Gronkowski: Littleton got a fingertip on it and that may have been enough to force the incompletion! The Rams take over on downs! Patriots 3-0 Rams 1:16, 2nd quarter Brady finds Patterson but he\u2019s about a yard short of a first down. The Rams call timeout. Will New England go for it? They sure will! Here we go! Patriots 3-0 Rams 1:26, 2nd quarter White can\u2019t come up with a screen pass, then Brady misses wWhite on the far sideline. That means it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10 on the 41. Big play for the Rams defense here. Patriots 3-0 Rams 1:30, 2nd quarter There\u2019s a flag on 2nd &amp; 5, it\u2019s thrown because the Rams have 12 men on the field, which is OK in Canada, but not in the United States. New England are at the LA 41. Patriots 3-0 Rams 2:00, 2nd quarter Here\u2019s more from Edelman: this time it\u2019s a 10-yard grab for a first down. New England have one timeout. Burkhead now, steaming ahead to the 40 with a gain of about three. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 7, and guess who has it? Yep, it\u2019s Edelman, who gains another nine. It\u2019s first down near midfield as we hit the warning. Patriots 3-0 Rams 3:57, 2nd quarter Goff, has time, but not that much time! He pump fakes and then takes off to his right where Van Noy hits the Rams QB for a 14-yard loss! https://twitter.com/NFL_DovKleiman/status/1092221880193503233 Here is yet another punt from Hekker: there have been seven overall in Super Bowl LIII. The ball is down at the 27 where New England will take over. Patriots 3-0 Rams 4:49, 2nd quarter Oh, here is that Gurley guy. He has a run of about five. CBS\u2019 sideline reporter says the Rams have nothing to report on the possibly ailing Gurley, who has the ball again for a short gain setting up a 3rd &amp; 2 at the Pats 48. Patriots 3-0 Rams 6:14, 2nd quarter Brady throws short to Michel, complete, but it\u2019s not enough for a first down. Allen punts, Natson has a short return. But there\u2019s a flag on the Pats: it\u2019s a hold on McLellan, and that will give LA decent field position at about the 43. Patriots 3-0 Rams 7:03, 2nd quarter Brady looks for Michel, who is streaking across the middle. It\u2019s incomplete. That sets up a 3rd &amp; 7. Email Benjamin Park wants to know \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Brady\u2019s passing this eve?\u201d No question he\u2019s had his shaky moments, but he\u2019s settled in and is 10/16 for 122 yards now, with 74 to Edelman alone. Patriots 3-0 Rams 7:50, 2nd quarter Goff has loads of time and hits Woods on the far sideline: is that complete? It doesn\u2019t look like it but NE don\u2019t challenge. That\u2019s a healthy 18-yard gain, which is like 180 for LA\u2019s starving pass attack tonight. Now it\u2019s 2nd &amp; 7 and Danny Shelton is all over Anderson, stuffing the back him for a three-yard loss! It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10. Goff goes deep down the far sideline towards Reynolds, but McCourty breaks it up! Goff was rushed by Flowers and the Rams will punt, again. Edelman returns it to the 16, where the Pats will start as they bid to add to their lead. Patriots 3-0 Rams 9:56, 2nd quarter So, I was looking for the Rams to establish the run with Gurley and that hasn\u2019t happened. I was looking for Suh to reek havoc with Donald being double teamed and that really hasn\u2019t happened. I was thinking Dorsett would get some looks thanks to single coverage and that hasn\u2019t happened. And I definitely thought Burkhead would have the first TD and that hasn\u2019t happened. The Rams will start on their 28. Ladies and gentlemen, we have points. Three of them. It wasn\u2019t pretty but the kick was good and New England are on top. Patriots 0-0 Rams 10:34, 2nd quarter Brady has Gronk but that is way short of the first down. Gostkowski is coming out for a 42-yard atempt. Gronkowski is limping... Patriots 0-0 Rams 11:13, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 9, Brady looks for Hogan on the near sideline: quick release and incomplete. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 9. Patriots 0-0 Rams 11:34, 2nd quarter Brady is throwing on third and short and Edelman is wide open! Where is everybody? New England are down to the Rams 30 after a 25-yard gain. Edelman has 74 yards tonight. Patriots 0-0 Rams 12:57, 2nd quarter Brady, a quick pass to Edelman on the far sideline for a gain of six. Now Brady has Gronkowski, who is streaking across the middle of the field for a gain of about three. That sets up a 3rd &amp; 1. Patriots 0-0 Rams 13:58, 2nd quarter Goff in the shotgun. He throws, and it\u2019s tipped on the line by Simon, who got both hands on it, and here comes the punting unit again. There\u2019s a great Rams bounce as the bean rolls down to about the Pats 36. I think we could have expected reasonably strong defense from LA, but I\u2019m surprised how much control both teams have had against some excellent offenses. Patriots 0-0 Rams 14:34, 2nd quarter Andrerson has it again: he\u2019s wrapped up around the neck, (yikes) but there\u2019s a false start flag on LA. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 10. Here\u2019s Anderson again for a gain of one or two. So where is Gurley? He has just one touch. 3rd &amp; 7 coming up. Patriots 0-0 Rams, end of 1st quarter Anderson pushes the pack for about five yards as the first quarter comes to a close: it\u2019s been an uneven one for both teams. Brady has managed 122 yards passing, but has been picked once and almost twice. Goff has had few chances as the Rams held the ball for just 3:07. If the idea was to limit LA\u2019s opportunities, that\u2019s happening. Patriots 0-0 Rams 0:12, 1st quarter Donald puts pressure on Brady, throwing him down just as he throws incomplete! So some decent heat being applied now to New England, which Brady has never handled that well. Pats punt, and the Rams will start at the five. Patriots 0-0 Rams 0:41, 1st quarter Brady is hit! Finally! And the ball is lose! Myers got hands on the Pats QB, but New England fall on it to recover! It\u2019s the first sack of Brady in these playoffs. On 2nd &amp; 19, Brady comes back right away to find Gronkowski for a gain of 14, setting up a manageable 3rd &amp; 5! Patriots 0-0 Rams 2:20, 1st quarter So no score so far: Goff and Brady have combined for less than 60 yards of passing offense. Surely this is going to pick up. Sure enough, here is Edelman on the near sideline, cutting, stopping and catching for a first down. Now Brad is almost picked again! He throws behind Hogan and Peters nearly had the ball for LA! Brady is inconsistent at the start.here... Patriots 0-0 Rams 3:25, 1st quarter It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3. Goff has time and fires a bullet to Woods but Chung is there at safety and the punting unit is coming on for LA. But wait! Have New England have jumped offside? Nope, it\u2019s just a delay of game. No Johnny Hekker magic on this play, but a decent kick down to the 19. Here comes Brady again. Patriots 0-0 Rams 4:14, 1st quarter CBS says that Gostkowski has missed four kicks in the last four Super Bowls for those of you scoring at home. The Pats call for crowd noise and get it. Goff, play-action fakes and then rolls left and floats a pass to Reynolds for a first down catch. LA are into New England territory at the 49. That\u2019s Goff\u2019s first completion of the evening. NO GOOD! Patriots 0-0 Rams 5:35, 1st quarter Gostkowski misses wide left and we\u2019re still scoreless! Patriots 0-0 Rams 5:40, 1st quarter Brady in the shotgun. He hands to White on a draw play: it\u2019s just a two yard gain and here comes the field goal unit. It\u2019ll be a 46-yard attempt. New England did that a lot vs KC two weeks ago, so that seemed a bit predictable. Belichick is just setting them up for later, I am guessing. Patriots 0-0 Rams 6:17, 1st quarter Brady is going for it all down the far sideline, but it\u2019s incomplete as he was looking for Hogan: the Pats wideout was blanketed by Peters in single coverage. Now another timeout called by the Pats: what\u2019s up with that? Big 3rd &amp; 8 when we come back. Patriots 0-0 Rams 6:17, 1st quarter We have a Gronkowski sighting: he finds the seam in the zone for a healthy 19 yard gain and the Pats are on the move, well into Rams territory at the LA 33! Patriots 0-0 Rams 7:39, 1st quarter Michel takes a handoff and is wrapped up for a four-yard loss. Then there\u2019s an end-around that results in a toss to Burkhead for another big loss, but there\u2019s a flag. It\u2019s a personal foul on, I believe, Dante Fowler Jr and that\u2019s an automatic first down and 15 yards. It\u2019s not Fowler who should have gotten the flag, perhaps it\u2019s a helmet to helmet hit by Coleman. Now the Pats are calling for time. When we resume it\u2019s 1st &amp; 10 on the New England 48. Patriots 0-0 Rams 9:56, 1st quarter Brady has time and a man: it\u2019s Edelman, who is open on the far sideline and he has just enough for a first down. That will settle Brady\u2019s nerves, if he has nerves. Doubtful. Patriots 0-0 Rams 10:34, 1st quarter The folks at CBS here in the US tell us that it\u2019s the first time Tom Brady was intercepted on his first throw from scrimmage in the playoffs, which seemed like a safe bet. Michel has his third carry for a gain of about one. Now Brady is in the shotgun. He takes the snap and fires immediately on a screen towards Michel and it\u2019s way off. Now it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 9. Patriots 0-0 Rams 11:15, 1st quarter Big 3rd &amp; 8: Goff back, Hightower is rushing right up the gut towards Goff, who gets it off just in time looking for Reynolds but it\u2019s incomplete! So the Rams fail to capitalize and LA have to punt as the New England defense holds. Edelman has the punt, but he\u2019s going the wrong way and is pushed back! It\u2019s a 53-yard punt and the Pats will start at the 12. INTERCEPTION! Patriots 0-0 Rams 12:06 1st quarter Brady is back to pass, he\u2019s looking for Hogan and it\u2019s deflected! Nickell Robey-Coleman got his hands on it and Littleton picked it off! So Brady is picked on his very first play and the Rams take over with tremendous field position! Patriots 0-0 Rams 12:14, 1st quarter The Pats are off and running, literally. Back-to-back-to-back runs to start off. Michel has done the bulk of the work to get New England up to the 42. They\u2019re running clock, out to limit Rams overall chances in this game, right from the outset. It\u2019s a similar approach to the KC game. Should the Rams have differed? Super LIII is finally underway! Patterson takes the kickoff up to the New England 25 yard line and here comes Tom Brady in his ninth Super Bowl! Howdy folks. It\u2019s almost game time and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all ready after two weeks of non-stop buildup. The first major prop bet is ready for us: the Patriots called heads and it landed tails, because they\u2019re saving that coin toss win for overtime. The Rams elected to differ and so the Pats will get the kickoff. Stand by for the actual Super Bowl! And now it\u2019s time for the coin toss and I will hand things over to my colleague David Lengel who will be liveblogging the actual game. Gladys Knight is the queen, she gives a gorgeous, full-voiced rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner with an extraordinarily long \u201cfree.\u201d I\u2019m giving her 9/10 and if you bet on how long it would be, I hope you took the over: it was 2min 1sec by our count. Since moving to the Boston area, the Patriots have appeared in six Super Bowls and won two, the Red Sox have won three World Series, and the Boston Bruins and the Boston Celtics have won a championship apiece. Just in case you were wondering why the rest of America have gotten sick of Boston fans. And the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Chris Long is honored with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. Well deserved. Email from Fintan Walsh Given that the Patriots are normally prepared for almost anything thanks to their intense video study of their opponents, and that the Ram\u2019s offense - while good - tends to be more simplistic, do you think they\u2019ll be able to put enough creativity into their offense to surprise the Pats? What\u2019s the Rams\u2019 path to victory there do you think? Cheers. Great question. I think it all comes down to pressuring Tom Brady. If you disrupt the quarterback, the rest of the plan will fall apart more often than not. That\u2019s why I think Aaron Donald has to be the man here, whether by getting to Brady himself or getting enough attention that the rest of the defense has the chance. And here come the Rams. The Patriots came out to Ozzy Osbourne while the Rams came out to TI\u2019s Bring \u2018Em Out. The crowd seemed to be on the Patriots\u2019 side here, so this could be a home game type feel for them. The New England Patriots are taking the field now, we\u2019re getting closer to the kickoff. Mike Atkinson returns: \u2018The Patriot Way\u2019 is a \u2018lite\u2019 version of \u2018dictatorial\u2019 (Malcolm Butler) Ok three quick fire questions: 1) Marcus Peters is the Rams weak link if paired with Gronk; assuming Gilmore pairs up against Woods who he knows from Buffalo; 2) Jared Goff isn\u2019t the QB that Sean McVay truly wants and isn\u2019t a true No.1 pick level player; they will trade for Russell Wilson either before or in Free Agency in 2020 3) Baker Mayfield was robbed for OROY You won\u2019t hear me arguing the first point about the Patriot Way. Belichick\u2019s a genius football man, not so much the cuddliest individual on the planet. And time for an annual tradition from the great Paolo Bandini: How much does a beer cost at the Super Bowl. Email from Justin Kavanagh: Tom Brady\u2019s MAGA hat stands for MAKE AMERICA GERIATRIC AGAIN, I presume? It should be noted that this is indeed a generational matchup. On the Patriots side, Brady is 41 and Belichick is 66. For the Rams, we have head coach Sean McVay who is (ridiculously) 33 years old and quarterback Jared Goff who is 24. Should the Rams win, there could be a very strong passing-of-the-torch vibe. Most of the pre-game hosts on CBS are going with the New England Patriots. It\u2019s 4-1 with only Nate Burleson picking the Rams. So much for the \u201cnobody believed in us\u201d line that New England is trying to push. Email from Roger Kirkby: I hope the Pats become the Patsies tonight, it\u2019s not the Rams fault that the call went their way, name any player that would go and complain to the refs \u201cya got it all wrong ref, I hit the guy before he got the ball\u201d more chance of being bitten by a giraffe. The good news for fans in England, you can go to bed at halftime as the Rams are gonna blow out the Pats. 28 zip at the half. After the Super Bowl against the Falcons, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s ever safe to turn off a postseason game featuring the Patriots. So that\u2019s the Boston Red Sox\u2019s Mookie Betts among today\u2019s winners. Can I change my prediction to Patriots over Rams? Email from William Mann: Hi there! I\u2019ve only ever watched the Patriots 4 &amp; 1/2 times live on TV. 2007 Super Bowl XLII v Giants - they lost 2012 Super Bowl XLVI v Giants - they lost 2016 AFC Championship v Broncos - they lost 2018 Super Bowl LII v Eagles - they lost The other 1/2 time I watched them was the 2017 Super Bowl LI v Falcons. They were losing 21-3 at half-time, so I went to bed. When I woke up, they had won.... I will be watching them tonight. And the killer thing is: I actually support the Patriots!!! From my apartment, I think I just heard all of Somerville MA yell \u201cgot to bed now!\u201d It should be noted that this could be Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski\u2019s final game with the Patriots. Gronk, as he is affectionately known, already has established himself as one of the best to ever play the position \u2013 or possibly even the best. He\u2019s been ineffective and dealing with an injuries for most of the year, so it\u2019s probably the right time for him to considering it calling it quits before his body starts collapsing upon itself like a dying star. The good news is that he\u2019s apparently as healthy has been all year. Something to watch for during today\u2019s game: the first male cheerleaders to perform at the Super Bowl. Lauren Aratani has the report: Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies of the Los Angeles Rams are set to be the first male cheerleaders to perform at a Super Bowl. The duo broke the gender barrier when they joined the team in March, becoming the first male cheerleaders in the NFL in recent memory (or, at the least, the first since 1987). Male cheerleaders have had a presence in high school and college stunt-heavy cheerleading teams for years, but they have been largely absent from the cheerleading squads of pro teams. The Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts have men as stunt performers on their cheer teams. But Peron and Jinnies, both professional dancers, are notably on the Rams\u2019 team to dance. Mike Atkinson: Thanks for the response, here\u2019s my take, Bellichik and the Pats are actually a \u2018Billy Beane\u2019 Oakland A\u2019s type organisation. They recruit players specifically for a single attribute that just happens to fit in with their identity (2 TE\u2019s etc) at the time. They might be terrible at everything else but they possess one skill that compliments the play call direction. Tom Brady is the classic example, he throws quick release slot routes of 15 yards and nothing else (or rarely anything else). The genuine of Coach Bellichik is that he uses the identity of the Patriots to define the entire leagues style, he sets the tone, waits for everyone else to catch up, and then changes. I fully expect him to draft a raft of safeties this year (and maybe Kyle Murray.....) and play 7 on defensive snaps as opposed to EDGE or MLB, simply because everybody else is trying to find ways to stop mobile QB\u2019s. My final point is this, and interested to get your take- The scariest thing about the Patriots is their aura, especially when it\u2019s tight and clutch!, their players aren\u2019t special (except for Gilmore). Despite the fact that I\u2019m writing this in the heart of Patriots country, I don\u2019t really put much stock in more intangible things. I was never a big fan of the whole \u201cPatriots Way\u201d thing, for instance, especially since it seemed to be an incredible fungible thing. As you rightly point out, Belichick is always changing things up, emphasizing different elements of the game, etc. There\u2019s not a single way. Or maybe that unpredictability is the aura. It\u2019s the preparing for the unpreparable. I am guessing that they still aren\u2019t over it. Some news coming out of Atlanta, where law enforcement agents of all stripes have converged. Rapper 21 Savage has been apprehended by ICE Authorities said the musician is in fact a British national who entered the US legally in 2005 but failed to leave under the terms of a nonimmigrant visa. The rapper, whose given name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was placed in removal proceedings... \u201cMr Abraham-Joseph was taken into Ice custody as he is unlawfully present in the US and also a convicted felon,\u201d Cox said. Abraham-Joseph has a history of gang activity and according to an Ice statement was convicted on felony drug charges in Fulton county, Georgia, in October 2014. He has been affiliated with the Atlanta music scene and performed in the city as recently as Thursday, as part of the Super Bowl Music Fest at State Farm Arena. Usain Bolt, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist and former Central Coast Mariners striker, has been making the rounds in Atlanta and is in the building for tonight\u2019s game. Naturally, the 32-year-old world record holder in the 100m, 200m and 4\u00d7100m couldn\u2019t resist trying his hand in the 40-yard dash at the NFL Experience expo when he passed through yesterday. And, naturally, Bolt tied John Ross\u2019s combine record of 4.22sec ... in sweatpants and sneakers. Sign him up. Email from Justin Kavanagh: The ageless Tom Brady is slowly becoming American sports\u2019 Picture of Dorian Gray. What else does that portrait in his attic now reveal, apart from deflated balls, I wonder? A MAGA hat. Email from Mike Atkinson: Hi, Here\u2019s a question for you. What do you think the production of players such as Edelman, Burkehead, James White (and preciously Amendola) would be like if they were playing for a different team, or even a different QB (Garroppolo)? Gronk, Moss and to some extent Josh Gordon could succeed in any scheme, but how do the Pats get so much from really average players with attributes so far removed from the atypical for the position? There\u2019s no question that playing under Bill Belichick\u2019s schemes and with Tom Brady, who is arguably the best quarterback in NFL history, brings out the best in players. I mean, one of the most impossible arguments in the sports right now is whether Belichick made Brady or Brady made Belichick, but it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s a rather symbiotic relationship. Julian Edelman is a great example of this, as he came in to replace Wes Welker, who put up huge members, and he has already surpassed Welker\u2019s numbers in the postseason. Of course, since Belichick is the one putting together his own team, the answer might be that he\u2019s really good at finding the players whose talents complement each other. I think that might be the best way to put it without denigrating the skills of the players themselves. He puts people in the best position to win. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl pregame show is already in full swing. Right now they have Tim McGraw who presumably didn\u2019t have much pressure on him to skip the proceedings. That\u2019s not true for every performer. This might be a good sign for the New England Patriots. The Boston Celtics, playing an afternoon game just beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 134-129. The home crowd\u2019s chant in the game\u2019s final minute? \u201cBeat L.A.,\u201d of course. What else? For those of you interested in counter-programming, Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d is still going on although you have missed the halftime act. This has to be a marked improvement over the actual Super Bowl halftime act. As much as we\u2019d love to just stick to sports, that\u2019s pretty much impossible with a cultural institution like the Super Bowl given the current political landscape. As much as ever, the NFL has been a cultural battlefield and the Guardian\u2019s Tom Dart wrote about this earlier this week. A couple of months later in 2016, the then San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, began to protest against police brutality and racism by kneeling when the Star-Spangled Banner was played before games. A backlash against his stance fuelled by criticism from Donald Trump both as a Republican presidential candidate and after he entered the White House helped politicise and polarise America\u2019s favourite sport. Now, the focus this weekend is not only on the glitz of the $1.5bn (\u00a31.15bn) Mercedes-Benz stadium and whether the New England Patriots can beat the Los Angeles Rams to secure a record sixth title for their 41-year-old star quarterback, Tom Brady. A yearly event that was essentially an overblown party and corporate moneyspinner is also now a vehicle for difficult questions about the past, present and future of civil rights in America. https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/31/super-bowl-nfl-civil-rights-social-justice In October, Guardian Cities and Guardian US partnered to report live from Atlanta, celebrating the gateway city of the \u201cnew south\u201d for its triumphs and reckoning with its challenges. One piece of Guardian Atlanta week included a football game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where tonight\u2019s game takes place. Only the focus was Atlanta United, the second-year MLS club that\u2019s become the most improbable phenomenon in American sports today \u2013 and a vibrant symbol of a new Atlanta. Atlanta United wound up averaging more than 53,000 fans for their home games in their second season, ranking them among the top 20 clubs in the world. Here\u2019s good news for those hoping for a close game, despite all of the blowouts that we had earlier in the playoffs. Not great news for Patriots fans hoping for a smooth victory, although something tells me that there\u2019s not going to be a whole lot of sympathy out there for fans of the team with five Super Bowl wins since 2001. 1. I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert with the Xs and Os of football, but I suspect we\u2019ll see a whole bunch of New England\u2019s 21 personnel (two backs, one tight end, two wide receivers). They\u2019ve used that formation 44% of the time since the Josh Gordon suspension. As far as Aaron Donald, I have absolutely no idea how to possibly contain him: the tackle is the best defensive player in the league. 2. With regards to Aqib Talib, the cornerback who is currently with the Rams but spent some time in New England: I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s a HOFer yet, but a win here along, to go with the ring he earned with the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, would certainly be an impressive bullet to add to his resume. How the Rams got here The Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints battled for the best record in the NFL for all of the regular season and they both finished with identical 13-3 marks. It came as no surprise they were the last two teams standing in the NFC. After beating the Dallas Cowboys 30-22, the Rams traveled to New Orleans for what\u2019s gone down as one of the most infamous NFC championship games in NFL history. Trailing by three points with less than two minutes left, the Saints were deep in Los Angeles territory poised to score a game-winning touchdown \u2013 or at the very least drain the clock and kick a game-winning field goal. Instead, on 3rd and 10, the Rams got away with a blatantly obvious bit of defensive pass interference. Had it been correctly called, the Saints would have received a fresh set of downs to work with and almost certainly would have won. Instead, they settled for a field goal and had to return possession to the Rams, who tied the game on their drive. The Rams won 26-23 in overtime on a 57-yard Greg Zuerlein field goal and Saints fans, well, they sued. No, really. And they\u2019re protesting on the streets of New Orleans today. How the Patriots got here It\u2019s hard to say it with a straight face since they made it all the way to the Super Bowl, but the Patriots have had a rather mediocre season by their stratospheric standards. They were a mere 11-5 in the regular season, with their perfect record at home at Gillette Stadium balanced out by a less-than-perfect road mark of 3-5. It was, however, good enough to give them a much-needed bye week that allowed them to skip the first round of the playoffs. In the divisional round, they knocked off the other Los Angeles team, the Chargers, a 41-28 blowout that was by no mean, as close as the scoreline indicates. They had more of a struggle with newly minted MVP Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC title game. After taking a late lead in a back-and-forth barnburner, the Chiefs were able to force overtime. Unfortunately for Kansas City, they were burnt by the NFL\u2019s rules which allows for a game to end if a team scores a touchdown on the first possession of OT. The Chiefs lost the coin toss, the Patriots got the ball and Rex Burkhead scored the game-winning touchdown. The Patriots won 37-31. Guardian US columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer, writes that tonight\u2019s Super Bowl will be a \u201cthree-way bare-knuckle brawl between the perpetually dueling American values of competition, commerce and conscience\u201d. This clash of conscience is one of the reasons why the NFL struggled to find performers for its halftime show, even though an appearance would mean being exposed to over a hundred million viewers in the United States alone. That can translate into a lot of money. Yet famous singers such as Cardi B, Jay Z, and Rihanna refused to perform out of solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, who has been blackballed for his non-violent, non-verbal message that there is racial inequality and injustice in America. Instead, they have Maroon 5, Big Boi, Travis Scott, and, to sing the national anthem, Gladys Knight. The backlash against the NFL and these performers resulted in the league cancelling the traditional pre-game news conference for the half-time show performers, with the excuse, \u201cAs it is about music, the artists will let their show do the talking as they prepare to take the stage this Sunday.\u201d Clearly, it isn\u2019t just \u201cabout the music\u201d, but also about what the Super Bowl represents. Our ethics aren\u2019t drowned out by Moves Like Jagger as if we were kittens distracted by a laser pointer. Given the increasing political divisiveness in the country, the game isn\u2019t just a game, it\u2019s a cultural symbol of what we stand for and what we turn our backs on. President Trump made football a much bigger political icon in 2017 when he told NFL owners they should fire or suspend any player who takes a knee because that\u2019s disrespecting the flag. He saw no irony in the fact that his calling for the punishment of people who peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights was exactly why the Founders created the First Amendment. Since taking office, Trump has lied to the country over 8,000 times \u2013 an egregious disrespect of the flag, the Constitution, and the country. His daily crock of lies has slowed slightly since he got crock-blocked by Nancy Pelosi, but he is still the quarterback to the NFL\u2019s anti-free speech blitz. And it\u2019s actually the second one! Well, kind of. Super Bowl XXXVI took place between the New England Patriots and the Rams, who then were based in St Louis. It ended up being New England\u2019s first Super Bowl win, capped off by a memorable drive by the Patriots, who had no timeouts in a tie game with only 1:30 left in regulation. Tom Brady navigated them down the field for an Adam Vinatieri game-winning field goal with time expiring. You\u2019ll be forgiven if you remember the halftime show a bit better. Hello, my name\u2019s Hunter Felt and I\u2019ll be navigating this blog from here until around kickoff. I\u2019ll be here to provide you with all the background you\u2019ll need before today\u2019s Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams. If you want to contribute to the liveblog, you can send your comments, predictions, questions, Super Bowl memories and fan mail to @HunterFelt or hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com. We\u2019re just under four hours till kickoff. For now we\u2019ll hand things off to Hunter Felt. Tonight\u2019s game is the third Super Bowl to be played in Atlanta after the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 30-13 win over the Buffalo Bills in 1994 and the St Louis Rams\u2019 23-16 triumph over the Tennessee Titans in 2000. Both of those games took place in the Georgia Dome, the iconic Atlanta venue that was demolished 440 days ago. Never forget. The Patriots are back at the final hurdle after last year\u2019s come-from-ahead loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. History suggests that doesn\u2019t bode well. The last five teams to reach the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year have all lost: the 1974 Vikings, the 1987 Broncos, 1991 Bills, the 1992 Bills and the 1993 Bills. Some more background bric-a-brac from the pre-game notes: New England earned a trip to the Super Bowl with a 37-31 overtime win against Kansas City in the AFC championship game. The Patriots join the Buffalo Bills (1990-93) and Miami Dolphins (1971-73) as the only teams in the Super Bowl era to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. The Rams advanced to today\u2019s title game with a 26-23 overtime victory against New Orleans in the NFC championship game. Los Angeles kicker Greg Zuerlein converted the game-winning 57-yard field goal in overtime, the longest game-winning field goal in postseason history. Los Angeles advanced to their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history (1979, 1999 and 2001) and are looking for their second Super Bowl title. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady will be making their ninth Super Bowl appearance together, the most NFL title games for any head coach and starting quarterback duo in league history. Belichick and Brady have won five Super Bowls together, the most by a head coach and starting quarterback combination. Brady, who is making his NFL-record ninth career Super Bowl start, is the only starting quarterback in league history to win five Super Bowls and the only player ever to be named Super Bowl MVP four times (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX and LI). Brady set a Super Bowl record with 505 passing yards last year and is the all-time leader in Super Bowl passing yards (2,576), completions (235), passing attempts (357) and touchdown passes (18). He is also the NFL postseason leader in wins by a starting quarterback (29), completions (984), passing attempts (1,554), passing yards (10,917) and touchdown passes (73). New England rookie running back Sony Michel has five rushing touchdowns this postseason, the most rushing touchdowns by a rookie in postseason history. Michel has rushed for at least 100 yards in each of his first two career postseason appearances and can join Arian Foster as the only players in postseason history to rush for at least 100 yards in each of their first three playoff games. Patriots running back James White, who had a rushing touchdown in Super Bowl LII, has scored four touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving) in two career Super Bowl appearances. Over the past three postseasons (2016-2018), White leads the NFL with eight total touchdowns. New England tight end Rob Gronkowski has 12 touchdown receptions in his postseason career and trails only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice (22) for the most in NFL playoff history. Gronkowski\u2019s 1,076 receiving yards and 12 touchdown receptions are the most ever by a tight end in NFL postseason history. Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay, who is 33 years and 10 days old today, is the youngest head coach to lead his team to the Super Bowl. In each of the past two seasons under McVay, the Rams have ranked first or second in points per game. Rams quarterback Jared Goff, the No 1 overall selection in the 2016 NFL draft, is the first quarterback selected No 1 overall to reach the Super Bowl within his first three seasons. Four quarterbacks (Hall of Famers Troy Aikman and John Elway, and Drew Bledsoe and Eli Manning) each reached the Super Bowl in their fourth season. Los Angeles running back Todd Gurley has rushed for a touchdown in each of the team\u2019s two postseason games this season. Gurley led the NFL with 21 touchdowns (17 rushing, four receiving) and ranked fourth with 1,831 scrimmage yards. Rams running back CJ Anderson leads the team in postseason rushing and has 481 rushing yards in the postseason since 2014, the most in the NFL over that span. In the NFC championship game, Rams wide receiver Brandin Cooks led the team with seven receptions and 107 receiving yards. Cooks had 80 catches and 1,204 receiving yards in the regular season and became the first player in NFL history to record at least 1,000 receiving yards with three different teams in three consecutive seasons. With New England in 2017, Cooks recorded 65 receptions for 1,082 yards and seven touchdowns and added 10 receptions for 155 yards in the playoffs. Los Angeles defensive tackle Aaron Donald led the NFL with 20.5 sacks in 2018 and joined Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor (1986) as the only players to record 20+ sacks and make it to the Super Bowl in the same season. Rams defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh recorded 1.5 sacks in the NFC championship game and has recorded at least one sack in three of his past four playoff games. Donald Trump spoke to CBS in an interview broadcast today and gave some of his thoughts on the NFL and football in general. Despite bemoaning the fact in 2016 that, in his opinion, safety measures to combat concussions have made football \u201csoft\u201d, the president today said he\u2019d rather his son Barron played soccer as football is a \u201cdangerous sport\u201d. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football,\u201d Trump said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation this morning. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a dangerous sport and \u2026 I thought the equipment would get better, and it has. The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn\u2019t solved the problem. \u201cSo, you know, I hate to say it because I love to watch football. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son, well I\u2019ve heard NFL players saying they wouldn\u2019t let their sons play football. So. It\u2019s not totally unique, but I would have a hard time with it.\u201d Chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, which can only be diagnosed after death, has been found in hundreds of former football players although it is most commonly associated with NFL veterans rather than young athletes. Symptoms of CTE include depression, suicidal thoughts, memory loss and mood swings. The specter of brain trauma \u2013 along with the controversy over the national anthem protests \u2013 was one of the reasons given for the NFL\u2019s decline in ratings last season. Many people thought viewers no longer wanted to watch a sport that may end up killing many of its participants (although NFL ratings have risen again this season). There\u2019s little doubt that brain trauma concerns the NFL. Several high-profile former players have taken their own lives, including two players who starred for one of today\u2019s Super Bowl teams, the New England Patriots. Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau took his own life in 2012 and Aaron Hernandez ended his own life in prison in 2017 while serving a life sentence for murder. Both men were later found to have been suffering from CTE at the times of their death. Significantly, Seau shot himself in the chest, which meant his brain could be studied after his death. It\u2019s not just professional players who suffer brain trauma however. Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski was suffering from CTE when he took his own life in 2018, according to his family. \u201c[Tyler] had the brain of a 65-year-old, which is really hard to take,\u201d his father, Mark, said. CTE fears appear to be hitting football at its roots. Recent studies have shown that high school football participation rates have dropped in recent years just as \u201csafer\u201d sports such as baseball, soccer and basketball are growing. There are signs that the NFL\u2019s measures to make the game safer \u2013 such as discouraging helmet-to-helmet tackles, strengthening checks for concussion during games and developing safer equipment \u2013 are working. Concussions were down 29% in the 2018 regular season, although many would argue that even a single concussion is one too many. Super Bowl LIII will be an indoor game. NFL officials have confirmed the retractable roof over Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be closed during on-field warm-ups, opened for the pre-game pomp, national anthem and flyover, then closed again for the game in light of the 50F forecast. We\u2019re about six hours from kickoff of Super Bowl LIII between the AFC champion New England Patriots against the NFC champion Los Angeles Rams, the first title game matchup between No 2 seeds since the NFL began seeding teams in 1975. Our if you\u2019re just parachuting in, our handy guide to America\u2019s biggest sports night will get you up to speed. But here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s at stake: With a New England victory ... The Patriots will have captured their sixth Super Bowl championship, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers (six) for most in NFL history. New England will have won their 37th postseason game, surpassing Pittsburgh (36) for the most all-time. Head coach Bill Belichick will join George Halas and Curly Lambeau as the only coaches ever to win six NFL championships. Quarterback Tom Brady will have won a sixth Super Bowl, surpassing Charles Haley (five) for the most of any player. With a Los Angeles win ... The Rams will celebrate the second Super Bowl victory in the history of their franchise (after Super Bowl XXXIV) and their first in Los Angeles. At age 33, head coach Sean McVay will become the youngest coach ever to win the Super Bowl. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin holds the current mark at age 36. Quarterback Jared Goff will become the first quarterback selected No 1 overall in the NFL draft to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory within his first three seasons. Our very own Paolo Bandini managed to call today\u2019s match-up when we made our pre-season predictions back in September. He said then that the Rams would beat the Patriots, and he\u2019s sticking to that pick today. Here\u2019s how our panel of writers see today\u2019s game playing out: New England Patriots 24-21 Los Angeles Rams. Every time the Patriots play in the Super Bowl it\u2019s a close game. Their differential in Super Bowls in the Brady-Belichick era is +3; their largest margin of victory has been six points. This game will be no different. The Rams have elite-level talent all over the field on both sides of the ball, but I\u2019m backing Brady and Belichick to pick out and exploit LA\u2019s weaknesses. Oliver Connolly New England Patriots 34-28 Los Angeles Rams. Considering the fast track under the dome in Atlanta and the points these teams have put up, you can expect video game levels of offense throughout. It only matters who has the ball last, and it\u2019s Brady and Belichick: we all know the script by now. David Lengel New England Patriots 24-27 Los Angeles Rams. While it\u2019s never wise to bet against the Patriots, it\u2019s possible to say that they overachieved just to make it this far, coming out of one of their least impressive regular seasons of the Brady/Belichick era and requiring a coin flip to help them to beat the Chiefs. The Patriots Dynasty began with a three-point win over a very talented Rams team, it would be poetic for it to finish with a three-point loss to a Rams team that just so happens to also have a great young quarterback in Goff and a celebrated head coach in Sean McVay. Hunter Felt New England Patriots 31-33 Los Angeles Rams. Because (humblebrag alert) Rams over Patriots was my preseason pick for the Super Bowl, and I can\u2019t come this far and back out now. Paolo Bandini Atlanta has escaped the worst of the polar vortex that has frozen large parts of the United States this week. Super Bowl Sunday has started mild and overcast. There are a few showers forecast for this afternoon, and a decision is yet to be made on weather the roof at the Mercedes-Benz stadium will be open or not for the game. Atlanta has done a fine job as a host so far, and there\u2019s been a lively atmosphere over the last few days, helped by the ridiculously helpful and welcoming volunteers. Judging by the jerseys on the streets, support is split between evenly between the Patriots and Rams although most residents here are backing the Rams. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look at how one of today\u2019s coaches has stayed on top for nearly two decades (clue: it\u2019s not the guy in his early 30s):",

      "bodyText": "Learning absolutely nothing from last year\u2019s non-event that saw a faux-woodsy Justin Timberlake blandify the half-time show, this year Maroon 5 sunk it even further. The band delivered an inoffensive, hard to hate but hard to feel anything for performance with jarring cameos that felt tacked on. Ads-wise, a lot of studios chose to sit this one out with many expected trailers not showing up. Marvel and Disney dominated while there were some inspired concepts from the non-entertainment side of things, such as the insane Skittles musical. It\u2019s crazy how one of the most in-demand gigs in the industry has now become a poisoned chalice but Maroon 5 has gained approximately nothing from getting involved this year and it\u2019s going to be a tough ask to find someone to perform in 2020. Us There\u2019s inevitable trepidation surrounding the release of the impossible-to-Google Us, writer-director Jordan Peele\u2019s follow-up to Get Out, a film that was a box office smash, a thinkpiece generator, an Oscar-winner and a cultural phenomenon. But last year, the first teaser helped to allay fears with arguably one of the most effectively assembled trailers we\u2019ve seen for a long time and now, Peele has shared a second, tantalising look at his nightmarish new thriller about a family haunted by doppelgangers, starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Black Panther breakout Winston Duke. Its March release seems scarily far away. Toy Story 4 One of the most anticipated ads of the night ended up being a cruelly brief one but regardless, will help sustain excitement until the fourth, and likely final, Toy Story film is released later this year. Stop what you\u2019re doing. The whole Bud Light v the corn industry feud just got real. I\u2019ve just been emailed the following statement from an Anheuser-Busch as a way of calming things down. Good luck with that! \u201cAnheuser-Busch fully supports corn growers and will continue to invest in the corn industry. Bud Light\u2019s Super Bowl commercials are only meant to point out a key difference in Bud Light from some other light beers. This effort is to provide consumers transparency and elevate the beer category.\u201d Verizon honors first responders Good stuff from Verizon, whose commercial is an ode to first responders, with testimony from 12 football players involved in gruesome accidents, plus LA Chargers coach Anthony Lynn and a bevy of firefighters, policeman, and EMS workers. A 30-minute documentary telling each story in more detail is available online, but for the purposes of airing a spot during the game Verizon\u2019s managed a truncated 60-second version too. For those who like things easy I hope you\u2019re not tired of Tony Romo (in the booth tonight) and his now famously prescient commentary. But of course you didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get through an entire Super Bowl without a commercial starring Romo, who after freakishly calling plays before they happened in the AFC Championship Game a few weeks ago has been duly christened the wunderkind of pro football punditry. Here he promotes Sketchers slip-ons, which, in a failure of the copy team\u2019s adjectival imagination, are described as \u201ceffortless\u201d and \u201cincredibly comfortable.\u201d The shoes are not bad-looking though, and Romo, like fellow QB Aaron Rodgers, oozes the approachable vibe demanded of spots like these. Maximalist advertising from Mercedes-Benz Where to start with this Mercedes-Benz spot, which features a lost cat, a high-stakes golf putt, an opera performance, a whale, a rocket, Ludacris, and a very good-looking dude-bro, all in an attempt to tell us that the German carmaker now has its own Alexa (which, to Amazon\u2019s credit, is becoming a consumer catchall for personal assistant-devices the way Kleenex is for tissues). Basically, you can tell the new Mercedes A-Class to start the music, change the colors on the dashboard, adjust the temperature, all things I thought Mercedes cars did already! One of the strangest commercials tonight isn\u2019t really a commercial. In an attempt to outdo all competitors, Skittles created an entire musical rather than just an ad, starring Dexter\u2019s Michael C Hall. The 30-minute event premiered today at Manhattan\u2019s Town Hall and according to Deadline, it was, well, pretty damn weird: So with no spoiler alerts necessary \u2013 you\u2019ll never see the likes of Skittles again \u2013 the plot was this: On Feb. 3, 2019, various and sundry New Yorkers wander inside a Manhattan bodega, making ready for the Big Game, some mentioning the large crowds outside \u2013 the first of many self-references to the Skittles event itself \u2013 when in walks Michael C. Hall himself, dressed in a cat costume that he explains is for a Super Bowl commercial. Hall is in a grouchy mood, unhappy with himself for selling out and feeling silly in the cat suit. Soon enough he\u2019s belting out the first of the show\u2019s three very catchy show-tune-style songs, this one called \u201cThis Might Have Been A Bad Idea.\u201d (\u201cSometimes,\u201d he sings, \u201cthings turn out exactly as you fear\u201d). Then, after popping a Skittle and changing his mind about his decision (\u201cI\u2019ll win a Tony!\u201d), Hall is interrupted by one complaining audience member after another. \u201cI don\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on,\u201d says a guy who identifies himself as Mitch from St. Petersburg (Largo, technically). \u201cI thought this was gonna be one of those crazy ads with talking animals, like the ones that are on during the game.\u201d We\u2019re all Rihanna Video of the full Maroon 5 halftime show? Anyone? Anyone? You Are My Fire You\u2019ve got to give it up for Doritos for turning their Super Bowl advertisement into a joint music video featuring the Backstreet Boys and Chance the Rapper and largely foregoing any promotional jargon for their product save the fact that it is \u201chot.\u201d Miscellaneous observations: this is the night\u2019s most colorful commercial; Chance does not seem entirely at ease with the choreography; I Want It That Way remains an earworm. Michelob Ultra goes ASMR but it\u2019s very hard to hear According to the internet phenomenon known as ASMR the faint sounds of the ocean and the wind and Zoe Kravitz whispering and tapping lightly on a bottle of Michelob Ultra in the brand\u2019s latest ad are intended to arouse sensations of calm and euphoria. Congratulations to you if it worked! Bob Dylan for Budweiser A simple spot from Budweiser, with a wind-swept canine on the back of a horse carriage, set to the tune of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d Very Americana, very Coen brothers. At the end Budweiser says their beer is now brewed with wind power. I don\u2019t pretend to know the environmental implications of beer-brewing methods but the Fossil Fuel folks are apparently already attacking the commercial so props to Budweiser. This is oddly transfixing A Dystopian Alexa With its bottomless coffers Amazon predictably buys a 90-second spot, with cameos from Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker, and Broad City\u2019s Abbi and Ilana. It probably unintentionally calls to mind the sad world of Spike Jonze\u2019s movie Her, where Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his operating system, except here Whitaker listens to his podcast through his toothbrush, Ford\u2019s French bulldog barks at Alexa in dog-language, and the Broad City gals are catapulted from a hot tub after requesting it play music. It\u2019s kind of funny and self-deprecating but it\u2019s also depressing that Amazon thinks this is the sort of messaging that will sell Alexa\u2019s and they\u2019re probably right? Prior to game time this ad had nearly 25m YouTube views, so yeah, they\u2019re probably right. Want to read more about just how meh Maroon 5\u2019s halftime performance was? Here you go! We\u2019re not the only ones happy about the non-Cloverfieldness of tonight A Tearjerker from Microsoft It\u2019s really easy to be cynical watching massive corporations pay millions to air their 30-second commercials during the championship game of a league that earns $8b in annual revenue and cannot be brought to feign interest in or concern for the veritable crisis that is traumatic brain injury in its employ. But Microsoft\u2019s genuinely inspiring commercial promoting an adaptive video game controller for the physically disabled provided a nice reprieve from the mechanisms of the football-industrial complex. Comedian Aparna Nancherla made an appearance in the Bubly ad earlier and has since tweeted that she\u2019s donating some of her salary: Remember last year when we got all excited by the news that Netflix was going to surprise drop the third Cloverfield movie the moment the game ended? And then remember how appalled we all felt once we\u2019d actually watched the damn thing? Well, let\u2019s live in that moment again shall we: Hanna Seen by some as another post-Atonement misstep for director Joe Wright (it did follow maudlin Oscarbait drama The Soloist), Hanna was viewed by others as an audacious curio. A strange, unconventional thriller starring Saoirse Ronan as a child assassin and a deliciously campy Cate Blanchett as the woman hunting her down, it didn\u2019t land commercially but Amazon has taken the concept and turned it into a series, one that looks solidly entertaining but not quite as odd as its source material. As a special bonus, there\u2019s also a \u201csurprise\u201d drop of the first episode right after the game ends which will only be available for 24 hours. Daniel Radcliffe is supporting the Rams, which given the theme of this liveblog isn\u2019t of great interest, but hey he does have something to say about Tom Brady\u2019s political stance... Close Talker Now, this is a good commercial: witty, relatable, to-the-point, and Seinfeld-referential. Luke Wilson plays a close talker much like Elaine\u2019s boyfriend from the season five two-parter The Raincoats. Wilson mentions \u201call-new Colgate total\u201d in the first five seconds and spends the rest of the spot getting right up in his colleagues\u2019 grills to share his enthusiasm for this new toothpaste. My only gripe is the strangely phrased tagline \u201cdo more for your whole mouth,\u201d which is both vague and syntactically awkward. In related news, Netflix has tweeted that viewership is down 32% compared to a normal Sunday, which means that earlier Guillermo del Toro tweet didn\u2019t do much good... Our Planet Furthering their plan for world domination, Netflix is now intent on taking over the genre of wildlife documentary. Tonight they dropped the first teaser for Our Planet, made in collaboration with David Attenborough. It\u2019s often hard to tell these apart on first sight but we\u2019ll find out more in March. Ever wondered how they manage to get the halftime show in and out quite so effectively? Check out this rather excellent video: There\u2019s also some frustration with Levine\u2019s decision to take his whole damn shirt off, given how Janet Jackson was treated a few years back for a much smaller flash. And the reaction to Maroon 5 is, hmmmm, not good: Bubly/Bubl\u00e9 Bold of Pepsi to advertise its new seltzer water product with Michael Bubl\u00e9, one of those super-corny celebrities who it\u2019s unreasonably fun to dunk on. The joke is that his name is pronounced boo-blay and the drink is pronounced bubbly (but spelled, inexplicably, with only one \u201cb\u201d). Ba-dum-ching. But there is a brief cameo by the comedian Aparna Nancherla and that is something to get excited about. Now with added footage: And Big Boi arriving in a car! This is a take That Travis Scott stage-dive that ended safely (he returned to the stage at the end) The vest has been replaced with nothing and a heavily tatted Levine is now shirtless, trying to replicate the moves of Mick Jagger. Rumours suggested that the Rolling Stone had been approached to join the band on stage but thankfully, mercifully that didn;t work out. Now there are fireworks and even more fire within the stadium and errmmmm, that\u2019s it? Big Boi returned just for the applause and damn it, he should have down the whole show. Big Boi is here! Wrapped up in an extravagant fur coat, the Atlanta rapper literaly drove into the stadium to give a performance of Outkast classic The Way You Move. But with that, he\u2019s gone (he\u2019d better come back) and Levins is stripped down to a vest (probably also worried about that tracksuit fire). So far, it has to be said, as welcome as the guests have been, their songs have felt a little tacked onto what is essentially a Maroon 5 tour date. Big Boi had better be coming back. Just reiterating. Straight onto probably their biggest song to date, Girls Like You, without Cardi B who was approached to perform but refused out of loyalty to Colin Kaepernick. Instead, she\u2019s been replaced by an impressive gospel choir, giving a played out song a new lease of life. Back in time now and another undeniably catchy song - She Will Be Loved. Not so sure about everyone holding lanterns with inspirational words like, ermmm, \u201csmile\u201d. It\u2019s all very #inspirational. Okay so I was wrong about that chronology as Travis Scott, introduced by Spongebob, has landed, I imagine for the first time ever on CBS. It\u2019s a nice change of tone and it\u2019s interesting hearing CBS try to deal with his swearing. Oh but now Levine is bouncing around the stage next to him, like a confused dad waiting at a school disco. Scott has gone for a stage-dive which is a risk but more on that later. There\u2019s a lot of fire as well as Levine in a tracksuit top which is obviously a concern given the flammability but now This Love is being blasted out and, again, this really is a great pop song. It seems like there\u2019s a chronology going on with the setlist which can only mean things are heading south. Oh and the stage design is very, well, pedestrian compared to recent years. Which makes sense, given who\u2019s performing. The first half is over and some team is beating some team at something or something. But anyway less of that and more of some music with Adam Levine and pals here to entertain football fans grabbing a snack. Weirdly introduced by Steve Carell (Pepsi\u2019s new ad star), the band started with Harder to Breathe, a worthy reminder that they used to produce some craft pop earworms. It\u2019s a rocky, well pop rocky start, that\u2019s set to turn into hip-hop rather soon. Cardi B has now confirmed that she turned down an opportunity to perform with Maroon 5 in order to stand with Colin Kaepernick. \u201cMy husband, he loves football,\u201d she told AP. \u201cHis kids play football. It\u2019s really hard for him \u2026 He really wants to go to the Super Bowl, but he can\u2019t go to the Super Bowl, because he\u2019s got to stand for something. You have to sacrifice that. I got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform. But there\u2019s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.\u201d In case you needed a reminder of Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cforgettable but flashy\u201d performance from last year, well, here you go: So Bud Light\u2019s corn syrup ad didn\u2019t, ahem, pop for everyone: Carrie and The Dude eschew their drinks-of-choice Very possibly the best ad of the night: Sarah Jessica Parker and Jeff Bridges appear in character (as Carrie Bradshaw and Jeffrey \u201cThe Dude\u201d Lebowski, respectively) and order glasses of Stella Artois, shocking a waitstaff that has already prepared Carrie a Cosmo and The Dude a White Russian. Very savvy of Stella to appeal to a TV show and a film with huge cult followings, though I remain chagrined they haven\u2019t parodied A Streetcar Named Desire (even though others have thought of it). The Twilight Zone A rather nifty tease here of the new rebooted take on The Twilight Zone, arriving on CBS All Access later this year. It makes sense, with the game showing on CBS, that the channel would use this chance to promote their own goods but less predictable is how they chose to unveil the show. Hosted by Jordan Peele, the man himself appears in a creepily empty stadium before that familiar theme tune kicks in \u2026 The ImWithKap hashtag, mentioned earlier in Ava DuVernary\u2019s tweet has been trending today with other celebrities all choosing not get involved in this year\u2019s game in support of Colin Kaepernick. As well as DuVernay, Common, who provided a song for her MLK biopic Selma, has also shared this: Adam Levine posted this tease of what we might be able to expect at halftime. A leather jacket is likely. \u201cAnd people think I\u2019m nuts\u201d It was not always the case that Super Bowl commercials live and die by compulsory celebrity cameos but apparently it is now: here, Charlie Sheen and Alex Rodriguez make blink-and-you-miss-it appearances for Planters Nuts, tactful in its ability to find perhaps the two (and-a-half, haha) most appealing men to a certain subset of America. The catchy, Super Bowl-appropriate #CrunchTime hashtag and the brief Ave Maria soundtrack both get stamps of approval. Toyota co-opts an inspirational story No Super Bowl commercial tradition is as tried-and-true as the one where an uber-corporation spends 30-40 seconds on a genuinely uplifting or galvanizing story and then, in a graceless pivot, tells us why their product is the car- or tech- or beer-equivalent of said story. This ad for the Toyota Rav-4 starts with Antoinette \u201cToni\u201d Harris, who last year received a scholarship to play college football at Bethany College and has said she hopes to be the first female NFL player. She is amazing, but the pivot to Toyota is laughably ham-fisted. Toni says she\u2019s \u201cnever been a big fan of assumptions\u201d and then Toyota man says \u201cNeither have we!\u201d and introduces \u201cthe hybrid that will shatter perceptions.\u201d Honk if you like corporate feminism! I mean ... Bud Light x Game of Thrones To quote Marvel, is this \u2026 the most ambitious crossover event in history? In their second ad of the night, Bud Light\u2019s embrace of fire-breathing dragons and all things medieval is shown to be \u2026 a strange collab with HBO and Game of Thrones, who essentially hijacked the brand\u2019s commercial to announce its forthcoming final season. A refreshing and surprising departure from some of the more run-of-the-mill adverts this evening. Glinda the Good Witch hawks avocados If you looked up from your bowl of guac you\u2019ll have seen the lovely stage legend Kristin Chenoweth in an avocado commercial that is funny but extremely scatterbrained: it\u2019s an extended riff on dog shows, but here the humans are the pets and are forced to keep their composure as they \u201ccompete for the ultimate prize: Avocados from Mexico.\u201d The ones who can\u2019t resist the avocado\u2019s lure get dog-collar cones put on them; someone else uses the phrase \u201csniff the bum of victory.\u201d But the main takeaway here is that I\u2019ll buy anything Kristin Chenoweth is selling. There\u2019s a Pringles stack for everyone except Alexa! Some dark, automation and AI-themed subtext to this Pringles ad, in which a couple o\u2019 dudes extol the virtue of Pringles stacks (there are a whopping 318 flavor combinations, by the way) before an Alexa-like gadget announces she\u2019ll \u201cnever know the joy of tasting any, for I have no hands to stack with, no mouth to taste with, no soul to feel with.\u201d An effective commercial inasmuch as I was unaware Pringles had so many different flavors! In case you really don\u2019t want to watch the game, Guillermo del Toro is trying to tempt you away (teasers for a new film he\u2019s producing are on the way) Everyone knows a Cathy! Very funny spot from T-Mobile, consisting of just a screenshot of a text from Cathy, who\u2019s got a lot to get off her chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep things brief,\u201d reads the tagline. T-Mobile is apparently planning to run one ad per quarter, so there\u2019s more where that came from. And now trying to outdo Diddy who wore a memorably memorable fur coat at last year\u2019s Super Bowl, here\u2019s Jamie Foxx in a panda jumper Audi presents a cashew-induced dreamscape The opening of Audi\u2019s Super Bowl ad for its new line of e-cars is\u2026an ode to Terrence Malick\u2019s Days of Heaven? Maybe it wasn\u2019t deliberate, but the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne sure looks like the dreamy wheat fields where Richard Gere and Sam Shepard competed for Brooke Adams\u2019 affections. Anyway, it lasts for only a few seconds before we pivot to the fancy car and then someone is administering the Heimlich and then there\u2019s a projectile cashew that seems to suggest the man had fallen unconscious and dreamt of the new Audi vehicle. It is that rare car advert that doesn\u2019t paint by the numbers, though. Cardi and Carell for Pepsi The great Steve Carell emits strong dad vibes in this solid Pepsi commercial, which also features Cardi B and Lil Jon and takes great pains to distinguish between the rappers\u2019 similar tag lines: \u201cOh!-kay\u201d (Jon) and \u201cO-kurrr\u201d (Cardi). But Pepsi is more than okay, they tell us, which is a rather tepid selling point vis-\u00e0-vis the Coca Cola commercial that aired before the game and more or less positioned Coke as the world\u2019s eminent bridge-builder and problem-solver. Bud Light Throws Shade A shot across the bow from Bud Light, who\u2019s coming for its rivals Miller and Coors with a Game of Thrones-themed advertisement about how beer is best brewed sans corn syrup. Putting aside the fact that Bud Light tastes like toilet water, that was a sharp and savage followup to their Bud Knight ad from 2018. Expensify This 2 Chainz plays a rapper who\u2019s filming a music video: on the hood of his futuristic convertible is a silver dish of hors d\u2019oeuvres. Adam Scott is the label boss who says he needs paper receipts. But obviously 2 Chainz has Expensify for that! Hobbs &amp; Shaw Just as you were about to scream into the sky, asking the heavens just why the Fast and Furious franchise hasn\u2019t turned into an extended cinematic universe, your prayers have been answered. Given both the phenomenal success of the underdog motoring saga and The Rock\u2019s continuing ascent, this was an inevitable step and for the first self-referential spin-off he\u2019s joined by Jason Statham\u2019s character for a Mission: Impossible-esque caper (even Fallout\u2019s Vanessa Kirby is joining them). They\u2019re pitted against Idris Elba\u2019s superhuman bad guy as well as a ton of atrocious dialogue (\u201cI\u2019m what you\u2019d call an ice cold can of whoop ass\u201d) but predictably, it all looks rather fun. Captain Marvel While some studios have chosen to spend less cash teasing their new movies during the Super Bowl in recent years, here\u2019s another sign that Marvel and Disney have little interest in doing the same. As well as sharing new footage from the final Avengers movie, there\u2019s also a new look at Captain Marvel, the film that\u2019s set to share a connection given Infinity War\u2019s mysterious post-credits scene. It\u2019s more of the same but further showcases that Brie Larson\u2019s newly introduced character will be the most powerful superhero of them all. Turkish Airlines And there\u2019s the 30-second version of Ridley Scott\u2019s lush and much-hyped ad for Turkish Airlines, who\u2019ve brought out big guns like Morgan Freeman for their Super Bowl ads the last several years. Starring Blade Runner 2049\u2019s Sylvia Hoeks, the full six-minute version of can be found above. #KillerSkin Skincare brand Olay goes slasher for its #KillerSkin commercial, an extended riff on the Halloween movies, with a Michael Myers copycat to boot. Smart choice to recruit a battle-scarred horror veteran like Sarah Michelle Gellar for this one; utterly perplexing choice to recruit her and\u2026not reference Buffy the Vampire Slayer? For that reason this otherwise killer commercial falls just short of receiving an ol\u00e9. Jason Bateman as an elevator operator Kudos to Hyundai for this rather clever deployment of Jason Bateman\u2019s ample charm. He plays an elevator attendant directing passengers to different floors of a building, or different circles of hell: the root canal floor, the jury duty floor, the middle seat, the talk (\u201cyour body\u2019s changing, my body changed, even grandma\u2019s body changed,\u201d says dad.) Finally we reach the Hyundai floor, which looks like it was designed by Frank Gehry. I have no opinion on the merits of Hyundai cars but this is an effective ad. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Hoping to kick off some positive buzz for the third season of a show that really didn\u2019t need a second season, Hulu has launched a splashy new teaser for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, returning all too soon. It starts out like a propaganda ad for a healthy new period for America before Offred enters, hinting at agency and revenge that she\u2019s not been allowed for so long. \u201cWake up America, morning\u2019s over,\u201d she says and we hope that the second season lull will be following suit. The Ball is in Your Court Another great ad, this one with Serena Williams, who in burnishing her reputation as one of the five greatest American athletes of all time \u2013 another top-fiver\u2019s on the field right now and his name appropriately rhymes with Shady \u2013 has in the last year appeared in commercials for Chase, Vogue, Nike, Gatorade, and Tempur-Pedic. I reckon her best partnership is the one that just aired, with dating app Bumble, which is premised on the idea that in matches between straight folks only women can facilitate conversation. As highlights from her illustrious career play, Serena narrates and encourages women to make the first move. \u201cDon\u2019t wait to be given power, because here\u2019s what they won\u2019t tell you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou already have it.\u201d A nice antidote to the manly, concussive bluster of the night\u2019s main event. Christina Applegate gives talking M&amp;Ms a lift It\u2019s always a delight to see unjustly unsung comic genius Christina Applegate on screen, even if it\u2019s in an M&amp;Ms advert instead of the star vehicle she\u2019s deserved (and been denied) for close to two decades. Here she gives us a kind of harried Veronica Corningstone vibe as she chauffeurs a trio of colorful, bickering M&amp;Ms. Full disclosure: I thought this was a commercial for high-performance brake pads until the camera finally revealed our candy-colored passengers. Avengers: Endgame After seemingly endless online theorising post-Infinity War\u2019s gobsmacker of an ending, Marvel released the first trailer for the follow-up last year to acclaim and yes, even more theorising. Tonight, more screengrabs will be studied with a second tease of the final Avengers film that\u2019s a bit shorter than many would have hoped but does the job rather nicely. It\u2019s a grief group-themed ad about refusing to move on and sees the survivors teaming up ready to find their missing friends. \u201cSome people move on but not us,\u201d Cap says, echoing a fanbase who will find it hard to say goodbye to these guys. And here\u2019s a snippet of her belting it out with ease: A topical reaction to Gladys Knight\u2019s performance! Walmart Getting in on a running theme of the evening\u2019s advertisements, when seems to be pop culture references, Walmart\u2019s latest has many, many vehicles, starting with the Batmobile before including the cars from Ghostbusters, Cars, Dumb and Dumber, Jurassic Park, Scooby-Doo, and Back To The Future. The idea is what they\u2019re calling the Grocery Pickup Program, where groceries that you\u2019ve ordered online are delivered to your parking spot. Yours truly has done a little digging and there is of course a $30 grocery minimum to be met in order to use the service. Wonder Park Hoping that its second amusement park movie within a year does a whole lot better than its last one (Johnny Knoxville\u2019s misfiring Action Point), Paramount is giving a big push to this animated adventure. With age, these films often feel a bit like a fever dream and the trailer, involving some \u201cchimpanzombies\u201d, a British porcupine voiced by John Oliver and a fish carousel does give it a trippy feel. But a stacked voice cast, also including Kenan Thompson, Jennifer Garner, Mila Kunis and Matthew Broderick, and a script from the duo behind Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol suggests wondrous times ahead. Empress of Soul Gladys Knight has just taken the stage, or the pitch to be more specific, with a rousing performance of the National Anthem. Video will be on the way soon but first here\u2019s a look at the rather brilliant R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle providing a rather brilliant recital of America the Beautiful In case you want to read more about that particular debate, here\u2019s a reported feature: If you found last year\u2019s half-time performance by Justin Timberlake to be a tad milquetoast then you might want to have a nap this year as Maroon 5 will be taking the stage. It\u2019s a controversial choice given that tonight\u2019s game is in Atlanta and there\u2019s been understandable frustration that the whitest of white pop acts ever has been chosen to represent the city. To make up for that, there will be cameos from Travis Scott and Big Boi and lead singer Adam Levine insists that it will be a history-making performance. \u201cThis is the show that will have the biggest hip-hop presence that there has ever been on the show,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t look back and find that to be the case before.\u201d One of the night\u2019s most anticipated trailers is for Avengers: Endgame and while there were question marks over whether or not it might be showing, this looks like proof to us (either that or the Russos are super big SMILF fans) Random Super Bowl group photo alert! Tonight\u2019s National Anthem will be performed by Atlanta\u2019s own Gladys Knight, who has come under some fire for her decision to be involved. Colin Kaepernick\u2019s lawyer Mark Geragos referred to any performer being involved tonight as \u201ccrossing an intellectual picket line\u201d but in her defence, Knight explained that she believes she is helping bring everyone together. Selma director Ava DuVernay is one of many celebrities giving the game a wide berth tonight over what she calls the \u201cracist treatment\u201d of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Her tweet was then quote-tweeted by the man himself: Excited about the Super Bowl but not so bothered about the actual, ya know, Super Bowl element of it? Fear not, this liveblog will be focused on everything that happens tonight outside of the actual game itself. There\u2019ll be celebrities in attendance bragging about it on the gram, brands unveiling splashy new star-studded ads, studios sharing new footage from some of the summer\u2019s biggest movies and Maroon 5 performing with some very special guests. If you do want to check out the score then please head over here but otherwise stick with us for everything else.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales Labor party will quarantine $100,000 in donations at the centre of a corruption probe into the party\u2019s fundraising prior to the last state election. On Monday the ABC reported details of an Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation into donations received by the party before the 2015 state election. It follows Icac raids on Labor\u2019s Sussex Street headquarters in December which Guardian Australia reported at the time were understood to relate to a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner held before the 2015 election. The ABC reported the fundraiser, attended by the federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, was at the centre of an Icac investigation into whether 20 small donations totalling $100,000 were actually a single donation made by another unidentified person and covered up via so-called straw donors. Responding to the reports, the NSW Labor leader, Michael Daley, said he had instructed the party to transfer $100,000 to the NSW electoral commission \u201cuntil the Icac investigation into political donations is concluded\u201d. In a statement, Daley\u2019s office said he had first learned of the allegations at the centre of the probe following the raid. His office said he \u201chas had no prior knowledge of matters raised today in ABC reports on a dinner held in 2015\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the secretary of the Labor party today and I\u2019ve issued her a very simple direction: work with the electoral commission and send them $100,000 to quarantine,\u201d Daley said on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any tainted money in those donations but if there is I don\u2019t want a bar of it. We won\u2019t be using any of it in the campaign.\u201d The investigation comes at a difficult time for NSW Labor. Less than two months out from the next state election, the Coalition government last week announced a range of integrity measures which appear aimed at reminding voters of the corruption that plagued the previous NSW Labor government and led to the former MP Eddie Obeid being sent to jail in 2016. Last week the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced a range of new anti-corruption measures, including a new specialist unit attached to the Department of Public Prosecutions charged with prosecuting public sector corruption. She also announced new travel disclosure rules for MPs and lobbyists representing foreign states or companies. She seized on the ABC report on Monday, describing it as \u201cvery concerning\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately many people must be shaking their heads thinking \u2018nothing much has changed in the Labor party\u2019,\u201d she said.",

In an info-dump opening, we learn that Lucy Purcell died in Paradise, Nevada on 12 August 1988, and that her cousin \u2013 Dan O\u2019Brien \u2013 disappeared while living near the strip in 1987. \u201cOld news,\u201d says West, who seems very keen to move on.

The children\u2019s clothing and belongings were found under his house, but Hays notices there is no damage on a backpack which should have been blasted to bits as it was about five feet away from the claymore when it was detonated. The attorney general wants the original case upheld but the investigation team who conducted the deposition are working with Woodard\u2019s kids to try and clear his name a decade down the line. In a move straight out of the season one playbook, we also find out that the police never discovered who was playing Dungeons and Dragons with the Purcell kids in the woods.</p> <p>There are two interrogations this week. An informal one with a very annoyed Freddy Burns, who is living in a trailer and has clearly struggled since being implicated in the kids\u2019 murder/disappearance. He tells Hays and West that he saw Woodard riding away from Devil\u2019s Den, not toward it. He calls Hays a \u201cblack motherfucker\u201d for his prison rape threats from 1980, and in the car as they drive away Hays notes that when he was Burns\u2019 age he was in the jungles of Vietnam, not pissing his pants in a police cell. The pair also talk to a young man who moved in the same circles as Julie Purcell. She called herself the \u201csecret princess\u201d or the \u201cprincess from the pink room\u201d, apparently, and calls a police hotline to request that Tom Purcell desist from looking for her.

The Telegraph did a nice recap of the Satanic Panic outcry related to D&amp;D too. Notes and observations We find out that West chucked his medals in a river and also met Bill Clinton for a photo op. That makes sense considering Clinton is an Arkansas man and former governor, and West\u2019s heroics at the Woodard shootout probably merited recognition. A lot of people have talked about Mahershala Ali\u2019s great performance as Hays, but the 2015 showdown scene between the ageing detectives is owned by Stephen Dorff. You really get the sense of a man not wanting to revisit old crimes and mistakes but being forced to. Welcome back Rust and Marty! See recommended reading for more info on them and shared universes. What do people think of that Easter egg? For those of you sticking with the music, I\u2019ve updated the Spotify playlist and chucked in a couple of related songs that aren\u2019t on the official OST. TD points are on offer for anyone who spots them and can tell me why they\u2019ve been included. That Warren Zevon song that closed the episode is such a belter. The chorus really hit the right notes after that finally scene: \u2018Don\u2019t the sun look angry through the trees/ Don\u2019t the trees look like crucified thieves/ Don\u2019t you feel like Desperados under the eaves/ Heaven help the one who leaves.\u2019",

      "bodyText": "Police have already used the threat of higher penalties contained in encryption legislation to coerce criminal suspects to unlock digital devices such as phones. Although the home affairs department is still consulting with industry on how to implement new powers to build backdoors into devices, the doubling of penalties for people refusing to unlock their own devices is already having an effect, the Australian federal police has told a parliamentary inquiry. The department has supported many bipartisan amendments to strengthen safeguards in the act but complained it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the role given to the AFP to approve state police\u2019s exercise of new powers and a carve-out that prevents anti-corruption bodies from accessing them. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security is still scrutinising the legislation, which passed parliament in December, including amendments proposed by Labor and backed by the tech giants and other industry stakeholders. The AFP submitted that new powers have had \u201csignificant operational benefit\u201d and revealed that technical assistance requests \u2013 which ask industry to voluntarily help law enforcement agencies \u2013 \u201care being sought in support of active AFP investigations into serious commonwealth crime\u201d. The AFP declined to say whether compulsory notices have been issued, citing secrecy provisions, but offered to assist the committee in private. The AFP gave two examples where suspects helped unlock their digital devices, after the encryption bill doubled penalties from five to 10 years imprisonment for those who refuse to do so after police gain a warrant. One was a case of investigating importation of illegal drugs from the dark web; the second related to the distribution and possession of electronic child exploitation material. After a bipartisan PJCIS recommendation, the government introduced a section requiring the AFP commissioner to approve technical assistance notices issued by state and territory law enforcement agencies. The AFP commissioner is required to \u201capply the same statutory criteria, and go through the same decision making process\u201d as the agency whose decision is being checked. The department warned that amendment had caused \u201cserious concerns\u201d about \u201cthe sovereignty of co-equal policing agencies\u201d and the propriety of federal control over state bodies. It said the role required sensitive information to be shared outside of joint operations, would require the AFP commissioner to \u201csecond-guess\u201d operational decisions, and require expert knowledge of state operations. The department noted many of the crimes under investigation were state-based with no connection to the federal sphere. The department warned the role could cause \u201cstructural conflict\u201d and state and territory police might be less willing to exercise their new powers. The AFP said it \u201ccould interfere with the independent operational decision-making processes of policing agencies and may be unworkable\u201d. The department suggested that the AFP\u2019s role should be limited to coordinating the use of new powers, to ensure consistency in the way they are applied without needing to approve decisions. The department noted that the government had also excluded state and territory independent commissions against corruption from accessing new powers to break encryption, despite the fact they investigate \u201cserious misconduct and criminal activity\u201d. \u201cThere is an inconsistency in entrusting these commissions with intrusive interception and surveillance powers but preventing them from obtaining the incidental powers to facilitate these activities and others through technical assistance,\u201d it said. Industry has criticised the encryption law, arguing it is still unclear what the safeguard against being required to build \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d means. The department said the safeguard against backdoors in a \u201cwhole class of technology\u201d would mean that companies could not be compelled to build weaknesses in all instances of a particular model of mobile phone, operating system, or form of encryption. It also prohibits weaknesses that would jeopardies other users security.",

He looked anything but a man who had seen it all before though \u2013 on the first pass of the game he forced a throw to Chris Hogan.

He ground out short passes here and there until he brought his team into field goal range and this time Gostkowski was successful from 42 yards. It wasn\u2019t pretty but the Patriots at least had points on the board: it had taken them nearly 20 minutes to open the scoring.</p> \n<p>Goff, meanwhile, was struggling to put any passes together against the Patriots\u2019 stifling defense.

It feels good for us to get it all. Shout out to him getting his, but this is a team game and it feels good to win.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Rams\u2019 real offensive star this season, has been running back Todd Gurley but he was having similar struggles to Goff \u2013 possibly due to a lingering knee injury that he had picked up towards the end of the regular season. By the end of the first-half the entire Rams\u2019 offense had combined for 57 yards, 36 fewer than Edelman had on his own.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4518f59a9863e9598e458869d6cceb37717a466\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4518f59a9863e9598e458869d6cceb37717a466/0_0_3650_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Goff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rams\u2019 Jared Goff looks on after throwing a rally-killing interception in the fourth quarter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brady got the ball back with three minutes left in the first half, exactly the kind of situation in which we have seen him lead his team to a touchdown at a crucial point in the game time and time again. But his throws were off \u2013 one to a wide open James White on the sidelines was particularly painful \u2013 and at least five yards off target. Still, the Patriots made it to halftime with a lead of 3-0, the fewest points scored in the first half of a Super Bowl in 44 years. More significantly, perhaps, it was the first time they had led at halftime in their last three Super Bowls. In a game that looked like it was going to be decided by fine margins and small tactical adjustments the Patriots, coached by arguably football\u2019s most brilliant strategist of all time, held a clear advantage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/04/los-angeles-rams-jared-goff-todd-gurley-super-bowl-2019-nfl\">Rams beat themselves in Super Bowl as wheels fall off once-mighty offense</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The third quarter started with Gurley finally producing something of significance, jagging through the Patriots defense for 16 yards, a play that gave the Rams a glimmer of hope. It said a lot about the game that the Rams\u2019 best player had been their punter, Johnny Hekker: by midway through the third quarter he had as many touches \u2013 eight \u2013 as Gurley.</p> \n<p>Such were the Rams\u2019 struggles that it was easy to forget they were only 3-0 down. Goff, who had been confused by the Patriots pass rush all game, finally strung some passes together and Greg Zuerlein, one of the best kickers in the league, evened the score with a 53-yard field goal with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It was another nerveless kick from the man who had taken the Rams to the Super Bowl with a 57-yard effort in overtime in the previous game.</p> \n<p>And then, as the game wound down to its last 10 minutes Brady \u2013 perhaps inevitably \u2013 decided to win it. The 41-year-old reeled off four successive passes, the final of which was a beauty to Gronkowski \u2013 a ball threaded into the few centimeters of the field uncovered by the Rams\u2019 defensive backs. Brady hadn\u2019t been great for most of the game \u2013 but he was great when it mattered. Gronkowski emerged with the ball on the two-yard line and the next play Sony Michel punched the ball home from two yards. When Stephon Gilmore intercepted Goff on the next drive with four minutes left, the Patriots looked like winners. Shortly afterwards, as Gostkowski\u2019s field goal made it 13-3, they were.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1092249791650615298\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This pass!<br>THIS CATCH!<br><br>Brady and Gronk looking GOOD.<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SBLIII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SBLIII</a> on CBS <a href=\"https://t.co/LJjHpUNVMj\">pic.twitter.com/LJjHpUNVMj</a></p>\u2014 NFL (@NFL) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1092249791650615298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 4, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty.

Shout out to him getting his, but this is a team game and it feels good to win.\u201d The Rams\u2019 real offensive star this season, has been running back Todd Gurley but he was having similar struggles to Goff \u2013 possibly due to a lingering knee injury that he had picked up towards the end of the regular season. By the end of the first-half the entire Rams\u2019 offense had combined for 57 yards, 36 fewer than Edelman had on his own. Brady got the ball back with three minutes left in the first half, exactly the kind of situation in which we have seen him lead his team to a touchdown at a crucial point in the game time and time again. But his throws were off \u2013 one to a wide open James White on the sidelines was particularly painful \u2013 and at least five yards off target. Still, the Patriots made it to halftime with a lead of 3-0, the fewest points scored in the first half of a Super Bowl in 44 years. More significantly, perhaps, it was the first time they had led at halftime in their last three Super Bowls. In a game that looked like it was going to be decided by fine margins and small tactical adjustments the Patriots, coached by arguably football\u2019s most brilliant strategist of all time, held a clear advantage. The third quarter started with Gurley finally producing something of significance, jagging through the Patriots defense for 16 yards, a play that gave the Rams a glimmer of hope. It said a lot about the game that the Rams\u2019 best player had been their punter, Johnny Hekker: by midway through the third quarter he had as many touches \u2013 eight \u2013 as Gurley. Such were the Rams\u2019 struggles that it was easy to forget they were only 3-0 down. Goff, who had been confused by the Patriots pass rush all game, finally strung some passes together and Greg Zuerlein, one of the best kickers in the league, evened the score with a 53-yard field goal with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It was another nerveless kick from the man who had taken the Rams to the Super Bowl with a 57-yard effort in overtime in the previous game. And then, as the game wound down to its last 10 minutes Brady \u2013 perhaps inevitably \u2013 decided to win it. The 41-year-old reeled off four successive passes, the final of which was a beauty to Gronkowski \u2013 a ball threaded into the few centimeters of the field uncovered by the Rams\u2019 defensive backs. Brady hadn\u2019t been great for most of the game \u2013 but he was great when it mattered. Gronkowski emerged with the ball on the two-yard line and the next play Sony Michel punched the ball home from two yards. When Stephon Gilmore intercepted Goff on the next drive with four minutes left, the Patriots looked like winners. Shortly afterwards, as Gostkowski\u2019s field goal made it 13-3, they were. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty. I\u2019ll take any ugly win over a pretty loss,\u201d Edelman, who was named the game\u2019s MVP after catching 10 passes for 141 yards, said. Many hate the Patriots, but few can deny their brilliance.",

      "bodyText": "The peak body for Australian dairy farmers has labelled a new vegan Magnum made of pea protein \u201ca problem for the dairy industry\u201d and said it should not be called an ice-cream. The vegan Magnum, released widely in Australia this month, is a dairy-free version of the popular ice-cream snack. It features dairy-free chocolate made from coconut oil and cacao butter, and pea protein flavoured with vanilla. At launch, its maker, Unilever, described it as a \u201cvelvety plant-based product\u201d that provides \u201ca creamy experience without the need for dairy\u201d. \u201cA first for the Australian market, the 100% dairy-free range will feature two of the brand\u2019s signature flavours \u2026 allowing vegans the opportunity to enjoy and share a moment of pure pleasure,\u201d the company said. A Unilever spokeswoman said the vegan Magnum was not misleading because it was never marketed or described as ice-cream but rather as an \u201ciced confection\u201d. Under Australian food regulations, only products with cream or milk can be called ice-cream. But a spokesman for Australian Dairy Farmers said the launch of the Magnum and other non-dairy alternatives to ice-cream was an issue for the industry. \u201cThis is becoming an increasing problem for the dairy industry, with plant-based alternatives incorrectly being marketed as milk or other products associated with dairy,\u201d he said. \u201c[Magnum] made a commercial decision to introduce a vegan addition to their Magnum product line to satisfy a very vocal community \u2026 it is misleading to call this product an ice-cream.\u201d Zade Watson, the president of the Vegan and Vegetarian Society of Queensland, welcomed the launch and said it was \u201cdefinitely a smart move for Magnum\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something that you will see from the larger companies over the next few years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Australia, we\u2019re a country that suffers from drought, and water usage is really intensive for dairy farming.

With an arsenal of pop hits at their disposal, the Adam Levine-led septet gave the fans at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium a pretty forgettable half-time show, with assists from Travis Scott, Outkast\u2019s Big Boi, and a gospel choir that added some vocal heft to Levine\u2019s sweet but thin falsetto. Perhaps that\u2019s what the NFL wanted, what with the league\u2019s chronic aversion to pushing the envelope, but the show brought into sharp focus the achievements of recent half-time show acts like Prince, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga who, singing and dancing in equal measure, helmed their shows all by themselves.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/feb/03/super-bowl-ads-half-time-show-maroon-5-avengers-endgame-toy-story-4-trailers-video-highlights\">Super Bowl half-time show: Maroon 5 end with fireworks and nudity \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: I grew up on Maroon 5\u2019s debut album Songs About Jane, a lovely collection of pop-rock earworms, and thankfully the band played beloved oldies like This Love and She Will Be Loved. But, as far as half-time performances go, the show itself was a pretty toothless, cookie-cutter affair, marked by the requisite pyrotechnics and some floating lanterns as Adam and co ran down a list of radio hits: Harder to Breathe, Sugar, Girl Like You, and Moves Like Jagger among them.</p> \n<p>During the latter track, Levine threw caution to the wind and took his shirt off, revealing his much bandied-about torso in homage to the song\u2019s titular Rolling Stone. It was a last-ditch attempt at some gravitas after several minutes of unenthusiastic guitar-strumming and hip-gyrating, but it came over as a little lame and must have elicited an eye-roll from Janet Jackson, who was crucified for her wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl exactly 15 years ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3379a5dbd7307e52a152bdd2e62cdd54785e2ce2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3379a5dbd7307e52a152bdd2e62cdd54785e2ce2/0_271_4060_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Levine, Big Boi, and Sleepy Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Levine, Big Boi, and Sleepy Brown.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These days, the NFL finds itself it right in the thick of the culture wars, mired in controversy over its tepid approach to player safety (most notably the crisis of brain damage among retired players, and the NFL\u2019s historic slow-walk on the issue) and the league\u2019s owners\u2019 collective blackballing of Colin Kaepernick in the wake of his decision to protest against police brutality during the national anthem two years ago. Throw in commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s mismanagement of about a half-dozen other controversies \u2013 Deflategate, domestic violence, and some patently racist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/27/nfl-owner-bob-mcnair-inmates-running-the-prision\">remarks</a> by team owners \u2013 and one can understand why merely associating with the league has, in some enclaves of the entertainment world, become verboten.</p> \n<p>Case in point: Rihanna, Cardi B, Pink, and Jay-Z all reportedly turned down the chance to helm this year\u2019s half-time show, a few of them pointing specifically to the NFL\u2019s treatment of Kaepernick. Travis Scott initially refused too, but agreed after the NFL agreed to donate $500,000 to Dream Corps, a social justice advocacy group focused on fighting poverty (Maroon 5 and its label Interscope donated the same amount to Big Brothers Big Sisters, a youth mentorship organization). Years ago it would have been hard to imagine anyone turning down what was once considered the biggest gig in entertainment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce34df73af6e7cd8c2cd9c5e47e978ab2d240d2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce34df73af6e7cd8c2cd9c5e47e978ab2d240d2b/0_130_3408_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travis Scott at half-time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travis Scott at half-time.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maroon 5, then, were a suitable choice for a league that has taken great pains to safeguard its status as the national pastime and maintain as broad an appeal as possible. Scott\u2019s cameo was intended to provide a jolt, and he did indeed crowd-surf after a breathless and heavily-bleeped performance of SICKO MODE and Like a Light, but the appearance was short-lived. Then came hometown favorites Sleepy Brown and Big Boi (Andr\u00e9 3000 is too busy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WI49OA3BjU\">starring</a> in Claire Denis films), who performed the Outkast classic The Way You Move, clad in fabulous furs, and was gone in a flash.</p> \n<p>The half-time show is a necessarily star-powered event, and so as long as the performer has about a half-dozen recognizable hits to play, disaster is almost always averted. But the bar should be higher than the staid, run-of-the-mill jaunt we got from Maroon 5. True, <em>it\u2019s not always <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIjVuRTm-dc\">rainbows and butterflies</a></em>, but it didn\u2019t have to fall this flat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s hope you weren\u2019t banking on Maroon 5 to salvage a surprisingly dull Super Bowl (or is it a Punt Bowl?). With an arsenal of pop hits at their disposal, the Adam Levine-led septet gave the fans at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium a pretty forgettable half-time show, with assists from Travis Scott, Outkast\u2019s Big Boi, and a gospel choir that added some vocal heft to Levine\u2019s sweet but thin falsetto. Perhaps that\u2019s what the NFL wanted, what with the league\u2019s chronic aversion to pushing the envelope, but the show brought into sharp focus the achievements of recent half-time show acts like Prince, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga who, singing and dancing in equal measure, helmed their shows all by themselves. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I grew up on Maroon 5\u2019s debut album Songs About Jane, a lovely collection of pop-rock earworms, and thankfully the band played beloved oldies like This Love and She Will Be Loved. But, as far as half-time performances go, the show itself was a pretty toothless, cookie-cutter affair, marked by the requisite pyrotechnics and some floating lanterns as Adam and co ran down a list of radio hits: Harder to Breathe, Sugar, Girl Like You, and Moves Like Jagger among them. During the latter track, Levine threw caution to the wind and took his shirt off, revealing his much bandied-about torso in homage to the song\u2019s titular Rolling Stone. It was a last-ditch attempt at some gravitas after several minutes of unenthusiastic guitar-strumming and hip-gyrating, but it came over as a little lame and must have elicited an eye-roll from Janet Jackson, who was crucified for her wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl exactly 15 years ago. These days, the NFL finds itself it right in the thick of the culture wars, mired in controversy over its tepid approach to player safety (most notably the crisis of brain damage among retired players, and the NFL\u2019s historic slow-walk on the issue) and the league\u2019s owners\u2019 collective blackballing of Colin Kaepernick in the wake of his decision to protest against police brutality during the national anthem two years ago. Throw in commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s mismanagement of about a half-dozen other controversies \u2013 Deflategate, domestic violence, and some patently racist remarks by team owners \u2013 and one can understand why merely associating with the league has, in some enclaves of the entertainment world, become verboten. Case in point: Rihanna, Cardi B, Pink, and Jay-Z all reportedly turned down the chance to helm this year\u2019s half-time show, a few of them pointing specifically to the NFL\u2019s treatment of Kaepernick. Travis Scott initially refused too, but agreed after the NFL agreed to donate $500,000 to Dream Corps, a social justice advocacy group focused on fighting poverty (Maroon 5 and its label Interscope donated the same amount to Big Brothers Big Sisters, a youth mentorship organization). Years ago it would have been hard to imagine anyone turning down what was once considered the biggest gig in entertainment. Maroon 5, then, were a suitable choice for a league that has taken great pains to safeguard its status as the national pastime and maintain as broad an appeal as possible. Scott\u2019s cameo was intended to provide a jolt, and he did indeed crowd-surf after a breathless and heavily-bleeped performance of SICKO MODE and Like a Light, but the appearance was short-lived. Then came hometown favorites Sleepy Brown and Big Boi (Andr\u00e9 3000 is too busy starring in Claire Denis films), who performed the Outkast classic The Way You Move, clad in fabulous furs, and was gone in a flash. The half-time show is a necessarily star-powered event, and so as long as the performer has about a half-dozen recognizable hits to play, disaster is almost always averted. But the bar should be higher than the staid, run-of-the-mill jaunt we got from Maroon 5. True, it\u2019s not always rainbows and butterflies, but it didn\u2019t have to fall this flat.",

On 1 July 1988 they supported David Bowie at the Dominion Theatre in London, then split up days later. I was not there.

I bought 200 cigarettes, a bottle of tequila and a bunch of albums. One of those was Crooked Mile by Microdisney, which I found in a bargain bin for the peseta equivalent of 80 pence. All I knew about Microdisney was they were Irish and lived in London \u2013 and 80 pence was a risk worth taking.</p> <p>The mass smoking of duty-free cigarettes hastened my quitting. The tequila gave me a two-day hangover.

Despite being playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and legendary songwriter Mickie Most saying it was \u201cone of the greatest pop singles of the last 15 years\u201d, it failed to chart.</p> <p>The next song, Angels, sounds like a Steely Dan classic. Then comes Our Children, which wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on an early 1960s Ray Charles album. Three songs in and they\u2019d gone from pop to classic rock to country-soul \u2013 I already had my 80 pence worth. And, as I soon discovered, it\u2019s not even their best album. That would be 1985\u2019s The Clock Comes Down the Stairs \u2013 a novel of Irish emigrant life and Catholic guilt distilled into a 43-minute record that reduces me to tears every time I play it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drcINSwOWw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1drcINSwOWw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Coughlan\u2019s acerbic lyrics mixed with the pop classicism of guitarist Sean O\u2019Hagan led BBC\u2019s John Peel to call Microdisney \u201can iron fist in velvet glove\u201d. But even Peel\u2019s imprimatur did not lead to record sales, and they were gone before I truly knew them.</p> <p>Over the following decades I bought the other Microdisney records, solo albums by Coughlan and O\u2019Hagan and those they did with their respective groups the Fatima Mansions and the High Llamas. I saw Fatima Mansions live twice and the High Llamas once, and they were great shows. But I never thought I\u2019d get to see Microdisney play.</p> <p>And then, in 2017 came <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ucc98-3fm/iron-fist-in-velvet-glove-the-story-of-microdisney\">the brilliant Iron Fist in Velvet Glove radio documentary</a> about the band, followed soon after by the announcement they\u2019d play shows in Dublin and London in June 2018.

I managed to get a ticket. My expectations were sky high, but nothing could have prepared me for the power and majesty of seeing them metres in front of me. I had an ear-to-ear grin for the entire set. It really felt like something close to heaven.</p> <p>Afterwards, the band mixed with the audience in the venue bar. I said to O\u2019Hagan that as I\u2019d travelled from Sydney I reckoned I\u2019d come the furthest. He then introduced me to his sisters, one of whom had travelled from Canberra and the other from Brisbane.

      "bodyText": "To cross the planet once to see a band is indulgent. Twice might be a bit mad. Last June I flew from Sydney to Dublin to see Microdisney play their first gig in 30 years. Now I\u2019m going from Sydney to Cork to see their final ever gig. My love affair with Microdisney began as the band ended. On 1 July 1988 they supported David Bowie at the Dominion Theatre in London, then split up days later. I was not there. I was in the Pyrenean microstate of Andorra, having gone there on a day trip from a package holiday in Spain. Andorra is beautiful, but I was concerned with taking advantage of its duty-free status. I bought 200 cigarettes, a bottle of tequila and a bunch of albums. One of those was Crooked Mile by Microdisney, which I found in a bargain bin for the peseta equivalent of 80 pence. All I knew about Microdisney was they were Irish and lived in London \u2013 and 80 pence was a risk worth taking. The mass smoking of duty-free cigarettes hastened my quitting. The tequila gave me a two-day hangover. But I still play Crooked Mile, 31 years later. It starts with the should-have-been-massive single Town to Town. When, 40 seconds in, I heard Cathal Coughlan sing \u201cShe\u2019s trying to pronounce my name\u201d, I was ready to proclaim their genius. As a P\u00e1draig, I felt his pain. Despite being playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and legendary songwriter Mickie Most saying it was \u201cone of the greatest pop singles of the last 15 years\u201d, it failed to chart. The next song, Angels, sounds like a Steely Dan classic. Then comes Our Children, which wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on an early 1960s Ray Charles album. Three songs in and they\u2019d gone from pop to classic rock to country-soul \u2013 I already had my 80 pence worth. And, as I soon discovered, it\u2019s not even their best album. That would be 1985\u2019s The Clock Comes Down the Stairs \u2013 a novel of Irish emigrant life and Catholic guilt distilled into a 43-minute record that reduces me to tears every time I play it. Coughlan\u2019s acerbic lyrics mixed with the pop classicism of guitarist Sean O\u2019Hagan led BBC\u2019s John Peel to call Microdisney \u201can iron fist in velvet glove\u201d. But even Peel\u2019s imprimatur did not lead to record sales, and they were gone before I truly knew them. Over the following decades I bought the other Microdisney records, solo albums by Coughlan and O\u2019Hagan and those they did with their respective groups the Fatima Mansions and the High Llamas. I saw Fatima Mansions live twice and the High Llamas once, and they were great shows. But I never thought I\u2019d get to see Microdisney play. And then, in 2017 came the brilliant Iron Fist in Velvet Glove radio documentary about the band, followed soon after by the announcement they\u2019d play shows in Dublin and London in June 2018. Coughlan and O\u2019Hagan were going to be joined by Jon Fell on bass and Tom Fenner on drums from the last line-up of the band, plus another guitarist, a keyboard player and backing vocalist. The night before the Dublin show, they played a rehearsal gig in front of about 150 people. I managed to get a ticket. My expectations were sky high, but nothing could have prepared me for the power and majesty of seeing them metres in front of me. I had an ear-to-ear grin for the entire set. It really felt like something close to heaven. Afterwards, the band mixed with the audience in the venue bar. I said to O\u2019Hagan that as I\u2019d travelled from Sydney I reckoned I\u2019d come the furthest. He then introduced me to his sisters, one of whom had travelled from Canberra and the other from Brisbane. Later, in a bar across the road, I walked into Coughlan posing for someone\u2019s selfie and chatted briefly with him about how much Ireland had changed for the better. He was intense. I\u2019d have been disappointed if he wasn\u2019t. And now it\u2019s about to end again, and Microdisney are bringing it all back home to Cork, where it began almost 40 years ago. If it\u2019s a time to take stock for the band, it is for me too. I\u2019ve rarely returned to Cork since I left there in December 1991. It\u2019s a city full of great memories, but also ghosts and regrets. I\u2019m both looking forward to and dreading introducing myself to people I recognise from nearly 30 years ago by saying \u201cI used to have long hair. And a lower BMI.\u201d Not only am I now old enough to see one of my favourite bands reform, I\u2019m also old enough to see them break up again.

Aram behaves like a traditional patriarch but Seta is too spirited and inquisitive to be a submissive consort. The marriage is also shadowed by Seta\u2019s inability to bear children.

      "body": "<p>In the corner of a small, plain room near Salisbury Cathedral \u2013 the precise spot must remain a secret for security reasons \u2013 conservation expert Chris Woods and archivist Emily Naish are hunched over one of the world\u2019s most precious documents.</p> <p>Three months after <a href=\"https://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/magna-carta\">Salisbury\u2019s Magna Carta</a> was the focus of a hammer attack, Woods and Naish are minutely checking the 800-year-old parchment for damage before it is put back on public display on Monday.</p> <p>As your Guardian correspondent looks on, Woods, director of <a href=\"http://www.ncs.org.uk/\">the National Conservation Service</a>, removes the document from its special protective frame and uses a microscope hooked up to a laptop and his keen naked eye to establish if any lasting harm has been done.</p> <p>Cathedral archivist Naish, who looks after thousands of documents \u2013 some even older than Magna Carta \u2013 insisted she was calm. \u201cI don\u2019t get nervous when it comes out of its frame. I know it\u2019s important but it\u2019s just part of the job. You have to be careful. You don\u2019t want to drop it or spill anything on it; you have to treat it as carefully as everything else we look after.\u201d</p> <p>But the attack at the end of October was a shock. The frame holding Magna Carta sits within another special protective case. It was this outer case that was damaged, causing tiny glass shards and fine dust to fall on to the Magna Carta frame. A 45-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident.</p> <p>\u201cHappily, everything worked as it should have done,\u201d said Naish. \u201cIt took a long time to make an impact on the outer case and it didn\u2019t shatter.\u201d</p> <p>A dehumidifier hums in the inspection room as Woods and Naish work, keeping the relative humidity (RH) at about the 40% mark \u2013 if it becomes too humid, potentially devastating mould could form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2fceacf96f0b146dcf7656cefbc37b962e4085c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2fceacf96f0b146dcf7656cefbc37b962e4085c/0_0_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magna Carta under a microscope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magna Carta under a microscope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Czapp/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Magna Carta was written on parchment \u2013 in this case, sheepskin. \u201cSkin is very reactive to the environment,\u201d said Woods. \u201cIf it has taken on some moisture, it will change its shape slightly.\u201d</p> <p>Magna Carta\u2019s ink \u2013 now a rich, dark brown \u2013 is stable. But if the parchment expands or shrinks, it can crumble because it does not move in tandem with the skin.</p> <p>When Woods examined the document outside its frame, it was possible to see gaps and fissures where in years gone by ink has been lost. Also clearly visible was an area of scraping presumably made eight centuries ago by a scribe who scrubbed letters out.</p> <p>Naish pointed out holes in the corners made by drawing pins and brown stains from where it was once rested on cardboard, vivid reminders that Salisbury\u2019s Magna Carta has not always been so well cared for.</p> <p>In the 19th century, Naish said, the Wiltshire Magna Carta briefly went missing before being found again in the library. There is also a \u2013 perhaps apocryphal \u2013 story that one of Naish\u2019s predecessors used to take the document home and store it under her bed for safekeeping. \u201cI think there may be a slight element of truth in that,\u201d said Naish.</p> <p>Renewed interest in Magna Carta in 2015 \u2013 its 800th anniversary year \u2013 meant the cathedral was given money from the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve the way it is looked after and displayed.</p> <p>While they worked, Woods and Naish spoke of their recurring nightmares about losing the documents. But they have fond memories of 2015 when the four surviving copies were <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/press-releases/2015/august/last-chance-to-see-magna-carta-exhibition-at-the-british-library\">brought together at the British Library</a> in London.</p> <p>\u201cAll four were moved to the Houses of Parliament for one day,\u201d said Naish.

      "bodyText": "In the corner of a small, plain room near Salisbury Cathedral \u2013 the precise spot must remain a secret for security reasons \u2013 conservation expert Chris Woods and archivist Emily Naish are hunched over one of the world\u2019s most precious documents. Three months after Salisbury\u2019s Magna Carta was the focus of a hammer attack, Woods and Naish are minutely checking the 800-year-old parchment for damage before it is put back on public display on Monday. As your Guardian correspondent looks on, Woods, director of the National Conservation Service, removes the document from its special protective frame and uses a microscope hooked up to a laptop and his keen naked eye to establish if any lasting harm has been done. Cathedral archivist Naish, who looks after thousands of documents \u2013 some even older than Magna Carta \u2013 insisted she was calm. \u201cI don\u2019t get nervous when it comes out of its frame. I know it\u2019s important but it\u2019s just part of the job. You have to be careful. You don\u2019t want to drop it or spill anything on it; you have to treat it as carefully as everything else we look after.\u201d But the attack at the end of October was a shock. The frame holding Magna Carta sits within another special protective case. It was this outer case that was damaged, causing tiny glass shards and fine dust to fall on to the Magna Carta frame. A 45-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident. \u201cHappily, everything worked as it should have done,\u201d said Naish. \u201cIt took a long time to make an impact on the outer case and it didn\u2019t shatter.\u201d A dehumidifier hums in the inspection room as Woods and Naish work, keeping the relative humidity (RH) at about the 40% mark \u2013 if it becomes too humid, potentially devastating mould could form. Magna Carta was written on parchment \u2013 in this case, sheepskin. \u201cSkin is very reactive to the environment,\u201d said Woods. \u201cIf it has taken on some moisture, it will change its shape slightly.\u201d Magna Carta\u2019s ink \u2013 now a rich, dark brown \u2013 is stable. But if the parchment expands or shrinks, it can crumble because it does not move in tandem with the skin. When Woods examined the document outside its frame, it was possible to see gaps and fissures where in years gone by ink has been lost. Also clearly visible was an area of scraping presumably made eight centuries ago by a scribe who scrubbed letters out. Naish pointed out holes in the corners made by drawing pins and brown stains from where it was once rested on cardboard, vivid reminders that Salisbury\u2019s Magna Carta has not always been so well cared for. In the 19th century, Naish said, the Wiltshire Magna Carta briefly went missing before being found again in the library. There is also a \u2013 perhaps apocryphal \u2013 story that one of Naish\u2019s predecessors used to take the document home and store it under her bed for safekeeping. \u201cI think there may be a slight element of truth in that,\u201d said Naish. Renewed interest in Magna Carta in 2015 \u2013 its 800th anniversary year \u2013 meant the cathedral was given money from the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve the way it is looked after and displayed. While they worked, Woods and Naish spoke of their recurring nightmares about losing the documents. But they have fond memories of 2015 when the four surviving copies were brought together at the British Library in London. \u201cAll four were moved to the Houses of Parliament for one day,\u201d said Naish. Each was transported in its own van driven by armed guards with motorcycle outriders. Naish rode with the Salisbury copy, and Woods accompanied Lincoln\u2019s version as they whizzed through the capital. \u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d said Naish. As they reached Westminster, by chance or luck, the song Nobody Does It Better from the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me was playing on the stereo of the van in which Naish was travelling. \u201cThat was quite a moment,\u201d she said. At Westminster, a high-ranking official said security for transporting the Magna Cartas had been tighter than that laid on for the Queen, explaining: \u201cYou can replace the monarch, but not the Magna Carta.\u201d The inspection complete, Woods and Naish declared themselves satisfied. The only damage was to two modern paper hinges that help hold Magna Carta to the board it rests on. They were easily replaced. All being well, the document will be safe for at least another 800 years. \u201cSkin can last an extremely long time,\u201d said Woods. \u201cIf mould gets in, it can turn it to dust. If that doesn\u2019t happen, and we\u2019re here to make sure it doesn\u2019t, it should last indefinitely.\u201d",

When I give talks on this, I\u2019m often asked: \u2018How do you know it\u2019s racism?\u2019 I\u2019m never asked: \u2018How do you know it\u2019s sexism?\u2019\u201d The report, published by the University and College Union, recommends that universities be more transparent about the promotion process to professorial positions, while Rollock says the practice of heads of department being able to veto internal job applications should end. The union said universities needed to overhaul their promotion structures to ensure \u201cgenuine equality of opportunity\u201d. The report also recommends that universities have dedicated initiatives for black female academics, to provide financial stability and career support from postgraduate study through to the early stages of their academic career. It calls on universities to acknowledge the extra effort made by black academics in supporting black students and staff. \u201cWhere such work is carried out, black academics should be explicitly recognised and rewarded for such contributions as part of promotion considerations,\u201d it says. Matt Waddup, the UCU\u2019s head of policy, said: \u201cThis report tells of a higher education system that is plagued by bullying and stereotyping, and forces black women to develop strategies just to cope. They don\u2019t feel they can be themselves, yet also feel forced into the role of stereotype and role model. \u201cWe need to look at how to transform a system that black female professors say is riddled with unfairness and bias. That starts with an overhaul of promotion structures to ensure genuine equality of opportunity.\u201d",
