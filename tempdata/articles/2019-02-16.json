No, sorry \u2013 one backbench MP, who certainly deserves the moniker of \u201cmoderate\u201d, told the House: \u201cI do not believe that we have lost control of our borders. I do not believe that people smugglers determine who comes into Australia and who does not. We can support orderly processes, we can warn people against people smugglers and we can warn them not to risk their lives on unseaworthy boats.\u201d The MP also suggested that \u201cvulnerable people are again being made into a football to be kicked around in the interests of partisan politics. This is despite the facts and the best values of our society.\u201d Oh, my mistake! That wasn\u2019t said this week; that was Liberal party MP Petro Georgiou delivering his valedictory speech in June 2010. Even at the time, Georgiou was an outlier, a rare sighting of the moderate Liberal MP in the wild \u2013 most were completely subjugated by John Howard. Now such views are absent from the public debate \u2013 the moderate view that dare not speak its name. Kelly O\u2019Dwyer was widely described as a \u201cmoderate Liberal\u201d when she announced her retirement, and yet there she was on Thursday yelling at the opposition benches, perfectly comfortable with the government\u2019s position on the medevac bill and similarly enjoying the gaming of the parliamentary process to extend question time so as not to have to vote on a bill to introduce a royal commission into disabled care. Fellow \u201cmoderate\u201d Christopher Pyne was there leading the government\u2019s tactics \u2013 such fun and japes. Being a moderate in the Liberal party now basically means you\u2019re not considered an insane person who thinks the gays are coming to marry us all and that climate change is a UN conspiracy. But in reality what it really means is that you are someone who may have moderate views but do nothing about them, and worse, will actually act in a manner fully in keeping with the hardline conservatives in the party. For example, Pyne, when education minister, appointed arch-conservative Kevin Donnelly to review the national curriculum. If that is moderate, let us no longer see it. Pyne, O\u2019Dwyer and fellow \u201cmoderate\u201d Greg Hunt were also infamously pictured celebrating the repeal of a price on carbon with Peter Dutton. So moderate were they that they campaigned and advocated for a climate change policy produced by Tony Abbott, which did nothing to reduce our emissions. Malcolm Turnbull was long viewed as the great moderate hope, because \u201cmoderate\u201d has come to mean \u201csocially moderate (or progressive); economic conservative\u201d \u2013 as though the latter does not completely undermine the former. Being cool with marriage equality is a pretty easy hurdle to clear, but O\u2019Dwyer and others in the economic team under the \u201cmoderate\u201d Turnbull pushed to cut income taxes for the wealthy, stood by happily watching attacks on the ABC and the vilification of those on disability support pensions and other welfare, introduced \u201cwork for the dole\u201d schemes, and attacked industry super funds despite the Productivity Commission finding the overwhelming problem with the superannuation system was retail funds. They attacked renewable energy at every opportunity, cowered before the conservatives when introducing an energy policy that did anything substantial to reduce emissions, cut company taxes and pushed for a lowering of the tax base that would inevitability lead to cuts in services. And now they are spreading misinformation about changes to the system of dividend imputation, under which a vast majority of $5bn in tax rebates goes to the wealthiest retirees who pay no tax. And of course, the excuse is \u2013 \u201coh, but they are trying \u2026 we should forgive Turnbull because look who he had to deal with, they are at least better than the others\u201d. Sure they may be better, but the outcomes produced show little to no difference. No one forced them to join this Liberal party that has been controlled by the non-moderate forces for more than 20 years. The economic conservative but social moderate is someone who is sad about inequality but happy to champion policies that will exacerbate it. Someone who will say nothing, lest the hard conservatives exclude him or her from positions of power, which at any rate they will use to pursue conservative ends. The moderate Liberal is a myth. Let us stop lionising them and rather ask what they have done that is either deserving of the label, or better yet, deserving of praise. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia.",

Outside, the snow is melting and the sky getting brighter but, with every lengthening day, the winter of his career with the German champions creeps in a little more. In June he will draw a line under 10 years\u2019 service and he fully admits the scale of what he has achieved takes some working through.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t realise sometimes,\u201d he says, still wondering how easy it can be to take pleasure in the moment when football just \u201ckeeps going, going, going\u201d and presents new obstacles every week. \u201cI\u2019m now 35, that\u2019s not young any more, not in football at least. I\u2019m still there playing as a winger at one of the best clubs in Europe, so that\u2019s something quite special.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/13/jordan-sancho-burussia-dortmund-tottenham-champions-league\">Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho makes mark but has to settle for second best | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There has been no winger to match Robben in the modern era; no player who, from a perch close to the touchline, has been able to exert such a startling, dynamic influence for so long. He says his wife, Bernadien, sometimes reminds him to cherish his party piece, the acceleration infield and arrowed left-footed finish that has exposed opponents to ridicule time and again. The weight of evidence suggests the fault has rarely been theirs: it seems a simple action but, if that were the case, Robben could not have taken ownership of it so emphatically.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can be very proud of that because people say it\u2019s like your own move, running inside and scoring a goal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have been doing throughout the years and, well, it\u2019s still successful.\u201d</p> \n<p>It worked twice, to predictable yet thrilling effect, when Bayern beat Benfica 5-1 two months ago in his most recent match. \u201cWell, if you do it at the right time it still surprises them. Timing is the key, always.\u201d</p> \n<p>That was the case, too, when it came to managing his departure from Bayern. Robben deliberated with his family before announcing, in December, that his time was almost up, and it has given rise to what he calls \u201ca little bit of a strange period\u201d. There is the medium term to consider, with offers for next season hardly scarce; it competes with the immediate challenge, the one that has always preoccupied him above all, of the next game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Liverpool pose that test on Tuesday and for Robben, who knows every chance to exceed his 110 Champions League appearances must be grasped at this point, the prospect of Anfield in the last 16 summons a few spectres. His involvement against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side is in question because of a thigh injury but there is an imbalance he would like to redress. \u201cI think, if you ask [about] the worst stadium for me, it\u2019s probably Liverpool,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have your favourite opponent and there always has to be a negative one.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a rare glimpse of old wounds and partly explains why, when the fixture was confirmed, Robben called it \u201cthe worst possible draw\u201d for Bayern. He was there when, in 2004-05 and 2006-07, Chelsea fell maddeningly short in Champions League semi-finals. The first was decided by Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d, and Robben prefers to leave it at \u201cwe\u2019ll never know\u201d when asked whether it went in. The second was settled on penalties, one of which he sent too close to Pepe Reina, and proved to be his penultimate match for the club. He remembers that as an \u201cemotional game\u201d and, both times, Chelsea were repelled by a formidable defensive blockade.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that time [Liverpool] were really capable of being this cup fighter team, also in the FA Cup or [League] Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one or two games they could really live up to it and perform; just not the whole season, which was maybe too much. That was their biggest quality: they were there at the moment they needed to be there.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow I think it changed and they developed really well. The manager has done a great job. Last year they were in the Champions League final and at the moment they are top [of the Premier League]. It\u2019s a long, long time ago that they won the league and that\u2019s the one they\u2019re dreaming of.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robben managed that feat twice at Chelsea as they broke their own hex, stretching back 50 years, in 2005 before retaining their title. \u201cWe played with two strikers, two wingers; it was really like a 4-4-2, a lot of offensive players,\u201d he remembers of a dashing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho side whose bravura nowadays feels as if it must be a trick of the memory. \u201cBut what I remember about that period is the team: a real team, all together, the players and characters all fitting together very, very well. We had a great manager as well in Mourinho, who made sure the team spirit was working well. And for me it was a big, big step because I was 20 years old [on arriving in 2004]. It was the first time I went abroad. Especially if you are that young, you have to grow up very quick.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b57c2e4c96c92e52b07d78bcefa483bb5a1aae8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b57c2e4c96c92e52b07d78bcefa483bb5a1aae8/113_0_3046_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arjen Robben (left) and Franck Ribery (right) have formed one of the great partnerships in world football.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arjen Robben (left) and Franck Ribery (right) have formed one of the great partnerships in world football.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Hoppe/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Eventually deemed too brittle at Chelsea before counting the cost of being an attacker at Real Madrid on the shoulder of the second <em>gal\u00e1ctico </em>wave, Robben has blossomed at Bayern. Although the feeling is alien now, in 2009 the move held muted appeal: the Bavarians\u2019 bulletproof self-confidence had taken some dents and it was not the gleaming superclub he represents now. \u201cI was at a big club, Real Madrid, and my goal was to win the Champions League at least once,\u201d he says. \u201cBayern were maybe not in the top five or 10 in Europe at that time, so that made my decision a little bit difficult because I had my ambitions. But in the end it was the best decision of my career.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom that moment on I think the club \u2013 not because of me, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 really started to develop, not only on the football side but in different areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>He plays down his own influence: had he not run on to a backheel from his left-sided analogue, Franck Rib\u00e9ry, to devastate Klopp and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in 2013, then Bayern\u2019s wait for a Champions League would be nearing 20 years and his own need would be excruciating. It exorcised the ghost of another spot-kick miss, in the 2012 final against Chelsea, and is one success he readily recalls enjoying \u2013 \u201cperhaps that was one of my best summer holidays\u201d \u2013 but he believes none of it could have happened without the France international.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think these 10 years I have experienced would have been totally different without Franck,\u201d he says of Rib\u00e9ry. \u201cI think maybe also the other way round. That\u2019s something he has to say but we have achieved something amazing here at this club and I\u2019m only very thankful, as well, to him because without him it would have been different.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Wembley he spent what he loosely agrees were his best years under Pep Guardiola. \u201cNormally at 29, 30, you say you\u2019re not really going to improve yourself again and make steps. But with him I think I still developed as a player. He\u2019s just a very special guy in terms of tactics and the way he improves the game.\u201d</p> \n<p>His figures from that period are stunning and heighten the idea that, had he not missed around 160 games with niggling injuries at Bayern, he might be remembered in the Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar bracket rather than, more realistically, a notch beneath.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have to stay close to yourself and I know I have done everything in my career to get the most out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully people have enjoyed it and there is nothing more I can do. This is what I am.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/15/sportswashing-europes-biggest-clubs-champions-league-owners-sponsors-uefa\">Sportswashing and the tangled web of Europe's biggest clubs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He has no truck with regrets, even when reminded of the duel with Iker Casillas that might have stolen glory for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final. \u201cYou can always say: \u2018What if?\u2019 but in the moment it goes like that\u201d \u2013 he snaps his fingers. \u201cYou have to decide what to do in one split second, and you will never know. There was still half an hour to play: Spain could still have attacked and scored. Of course it was a one-on-one and, by maybe one or two centimetres, it hit his toe and went out. And yet it was a good decision because he went the other way. So can you blame yourself? No, not really.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is the closest he has come to defensiveness during a relaxed conversation that he has spent draped on a sofa. There is the faintest dash of mischief in the atmosphere when he discusses his next move, which he expects to know before the end of the season.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always said that, as long as I enjoy it and physically feel good enough to perform at the level I want to, then I will continue,\u201d he says. \u201cI am also still curious where I will be next year. Maybe England, maybe Spain, maybe somewhere else: it can be anywhere. We will see.\u201d</p> \n<p>The mention of England has been dropped in deliberately, that much is obvious, but the prospect is left dangling and he is more expansive when it comes to the labours it will take to keep going. \u201cYou have to take care of your body, you have to sleep well, eat well, the normal things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work but you get something in return and that\u2019s why I do it.\u201d That payback sounds, for all his natural caution over the years, like something akin to intense enjoyment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201c\u2018Enjoy it, enjoy it,\u2019 that\u2019s what you say to young players.\u201d Arjen Robben is wrestling with the question of whether, across two decades of dedication to his art, he has managed to practise what he preaches. \u201cBut then you ask yourself: \u2018Are you also enjoying it?\u2019 Maybe it\u2019s good, also, for yourself to enjoy it.\u201d It comes to be a recurring theme during a lunchtime at Bayern Munich\u2019s training ground that finds Robben in mellow, reflective mood. Outside, the snow is melting and the sky getting brighter but, with every lengthening day, the winter of his career with the German champions creeps in a little more. In June he will draw a line under 10 years\u2019 service and he fully admits the scale of what he has achieved takes some working through. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t realise sometimes,\u201d he says, still wondering how easy it can be to take pleasure in the moment when football just \u201ckeeps going, going, going\u201d and presents new obstacles every week. \u201cI\u2019m now 35, that\u2019s not young any more, not in football at least. I\u2019m still there playing as a winger at one of the best clubs in Europe, so that\u2019s something quite special.\u201d There has been no winger to match Robben in the modern era; no player who, from a perch close to the touchline, has been able to exert such a startling, dynamic influence for so long. He says his wife, Bernadien, sometimes reminds him to cherish his party piece, the acceleration infield and arrowed left-footed finish that has exposed opponents to ridicule time and again. The weight of evidence suggests the fault has rarely been theirs: it seems a simple action but, if that were the case, Robben could not have taken ownership of it so emphatically. \u201cI can be very proud of that because people say it\u2019s like your own move, running inside and scoring a goal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have been doing throughout the years and, well, it\u2019s still successful.\u201d It worked twice, to predictable yet thrilling effect, when Bayern beat Benfica 5-1 two months ago in his most recent match. \u201cWell, if you do it at the right time it still surprises them. Timing is the key, always.\u201d That was the case, too, when it came to managing his departure from Bayern. Robben deliberated with his family before announcing, in December, that his time was almost up, and it has given rise to what he calls \u201ca little bit of a strange period\u201d. There is the medium term to consider, with offers for next season hardly scarce; it competes with the immediate challenge, the one that has always preoccupied him above all, of the next game. Liverpool pose that test on Tuesday and for Robben, who knows every chance to exceed his 110 Champions League appearances must be grasped at this point, the prospect of Anfield in the last 16 summons a few spectres. His involvement against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side is in question because of a thigh injury but there is an imbalance he would like to redress. \u201cI think, if you ask [about] the worst stadium for me, it\u2019s probably Liverpool,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have your favourite opponent and there always has to be a negative one.\u201d It is a rare glimpse of old wounds and partly explains why, when the fixture was confirmed, Robben called it \u201cthe worst possible draw\u201d for Bayern. He was there when, in 2004-05 and 2006-07, Chelsea fell maddeningly short in Champions League semi-finals. The first was decided by Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d, and Robben prefers to leave it at \u201cwe\u2019ll never know\u201d when asked whether it went in. The second was settled on penalties, one of which he sent too close to Pepe Reina, and proved to be his penultimate match for the club. He remembers that as an \u201cemotional game\u201d and, both times, Chelsea were repelled by a formidable defensive blockade. \u201cAt that time [Liverpool] were really capable of being this cup fighter team, also in the FA Cup or [League] Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one or two games they could really live up to it and perform; just not the whole season, which was maybe too much. That was their biggest quality: they were there at the moment they needed to be there. \u201cNow I think it changed and they developed really well. The manager has done a great job. Last year they were in the Champions League final and at the moment they are top [of the Premier League]. It\u2019s a long, long time ago that they won the league and that\u2019s the one they\u2019re dreaming of.\u201d Robben managed that feat twice at Chelsea as they broke their own hex, stretching back 50 years, in 2005 before retaining their title. \u201cWe played with two strikers, two wingers; it was really like a 4-4-2, a lot of offensive players,\u201d he remembers of a dashing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho side whose bravura nowadays feels as if it must be a trick of the memory. \u201cBut what I remember about that period is the team: a real team, all together, the players and characters all fitting together very, very well. We had a great manager as well in Mourinho, who made sure the team spirit was working well. And for me it was a big, big step because I was 20 years old [on arriving in 2004]. It was the first time I went abroad. Especially if you are that young, you have to grow up very quick.\u201d Eventually deemed too brittle at Chelsea before counting the cost of being an attacker at Real Madrid on the shoulder of the second gal\u00e1ctico wave, Robben has blossomed at Bayern. Although the feeling is alien now, in 2009 the move held muted appeal: the Bavarians\u2019 bulletproof self-confidence had taken some dents and it was not the gleaming superclub he represents now. \u201cI was at a big club, Real Madrid, and my goal was to win the Champions League at least once,\u201d he says. \u201cBayern were maybe not in the top five or 10 in Europe at that time, so that made my decision a little bit difficult because I had my ambitions. But in the end it was the best decision of my career. \u201cFrom that moment on I think the club \u2013 not because of me, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 really started to develop, not only on the football side but in different areas.\u201d He plays down his own influence: had he not run on to a backheel from his left-sided analogue, Franck Rib\u00e9ry, to devastate Klopp and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in 2013, then Bayern\u2019s wait for a Champions League would be nearing 20 years and his own need would be excruciating. It exorcised the ghost of another spot-kick miss, in the 2012 final against Chelsea, and is one success he readily recalls enjoying \u2013 \u201cperhaps that was one of my best summer holidays\u201d \u2013 but he believes none of it could have happened without the France international. \u201cI think these 10 years I have experienced would have been totally different without Franck,\u201d he says of Rib\u00e9ry. \u201cI think maybe also the other way round. That\u2019s something he has to say but we have achieved something amazing here at this club and I\u2019m only very thankful, as well, to him because without him it would have been different.\u201d After Wembley he spent what he loosely agrees were his best years under Pep Guardiola. \u201cNormally at 29, 30, you say you\u2019re not really going to improve yourself again and make steps. But with him I think I still developed as a player. He\u2019s just a very special guy in terms of tactics and the way he improves the game.\u201d His figures from that period are stunning and heighten the idea that, had he not missed around 160 games with niggling injuries at Bayern, he might be remembered in the Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar bracket rather than, more realistically, a notch beneath. \u201cYou have to stay close to yourself and I know I have done everything in my career to get the most out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully people have enjoyed it and there is nothing more I can do. This is what I am.\u201d He has no truck with regrets, even when reminded of the duel with Iker Casillas that might have stolen glory for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final. \u201cYou can always say: \u2018What if?\u2019 but in the moment it goes like that\u201d \u2013 he snaps his fingers. \u201cYou have to decide what to do in one split second, and you will never know. There was still half an hour to play: Spain could still have attacked and scored. Of course it was a one-on-one and, by maybe one or two centimetres, it hit his toe and went out. And yet it was a good decision because he went the other way. So can you blame yourself? No, not really.\u201d It is the closest he has come to defensiveness during a relaxed conversation that he has spent draped on a sofa. There is the faintest dash of mischief in the atmosphere when he discusses his next move, which he expects to know before the end of the season. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that, as long as I enjoy it and physically feel good enough to perform at the level I want to, then I will continue,\u201d he says. \u201cI am also still curious where I will be next year. Maybe England, maybe Spain, maybe somewhere else: it can be anywhere. We will see.\u201d The mention of England has been dropped in deliberately, that much is obvious, but the prospect is left dangling and he is more expansive when it comes to the labours it will take to keep going. \u201cYou have to take care of your body, you have to sleep well, eat well, the normal things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work but you get something in return and that\u2019s why I do it.\u201d That payback sounds, for all his natural caution over the years, like something akin to intense enjoyment.",

      "body": "<p>The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, was at the centre of a growing cabinet row on Saturday night as senior government sources blamed him for offending the Chinese and causing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/16/gavin-williamson-china-warship-threat-philip-hammond\" title=\"\">cancellation of a crucial trade visit to Beijing</a> by the chancellor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>Senior Conservatives said it was time to rein in Williamson, who has earned the nickname Private Pike in Whitehall after a series of gaffes. Treasury insiders said comments the defence secretary had made in a speech last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/11/brexit-uk-military-defence-gavin-williamson\" title=\"\">sending the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific</a> had caused such \u201cclear irritation\u201d in Beijing that the trip scheduled for this weekend could not take place.</p> <p>The Treasury issued an official comment saying \u201cthe chancellor is not travelling to China at this time\u201d and adding that \u201cno trip was ever announced or confirmed\u201d. But sources confirmed that Williamson\u2019s clumsy and undiplomatic language had caused real upset that had been relayed back to London by the Chinese authorities.</p> <p>The result was that a visit that been planned for many weeks \u2013 and that would have focused on opening up Chinese markets to UK exports \u2013 has been put off until the diplomatic damage is repaired.</p> <p>Williamson said in the speech last Monday that the aircraft carrier would be sent to an area where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The remarks incensed the Chinese just days before Hammond was due to arrive for a series of meetings, including one with the Chinese vice premier, Hu Chunhua.</p> <p>Government sources said there was disbelief across Whitehall departments, particularly as the comments came at a time when the UK is desperate to negotiate better trading arrangements across the globe as it prepares to leave the European Union on 29 March.

      "bodyText": "The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, was at the centre of a growing cabinet row on Saturday night as senior government sources blamed him for offending the Chinese and causing the cancellation of a crucial trade visit to Beijing by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Senior Conservatives said it was time to rein in Williamson, who has earned the nickname Private Pike in Whitehall after a series of gaffes. Treasury insiders said comments the defence secretary had made in a speech last week about sending the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific had caused such \u201cclear irritation\u201d in Beijing that the trip scheduled for this weekend could not take place. The Treasury issued an official comment saying \u201cthe chancellor is not travelling to China at this time\u201d and adding that \u201cno trip was ever announced or confirmed\u201d. But sources confirmed that Williamson\u2019s clumsy and undiplomatic language had caused real upset that had been relayed back to London by the Chinese authorities. The result was that a visit that been planned for many weeks \u2013 and that would have focused on opening up Chinese markets to UK exports \u2013 has been put off until the diplomatic damage is repaired. Williamson said in the speech last Monday that the aircraft carrier would be sent to an area where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea. The remarks incensed the Chinese just days before Hammond was due to arrive for a series of meetings, including one with the Chinese vice premier, Hu Chunhua. Government sources said there was disbelief across Whitehall departments, particularly as the comments came at a time when the UK is desperate to negotiate better trading arrangements across the globe as it prepares to leave the European Union on 29 March. Williamson said in his speech that the UK was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flout international law \u2013 an apparent reference to China\u2019s expansionist ambitions in the South China Sea. Hammond and Williamson have had a tense relationship for months, partly as a result of the defence secretary\u2019s attempts to secure more money for his budget at a time when the chancellor has been under intense pressure to deliver more funds for the NHS. On Saturday night former Tory cabinet minister and governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten said it was time to \u201cbring back the grown-ups\u201d. Lord Patten said China should be welcomed to the global economic community, although it should play by the same rules as everyone else. He stressed that a careful diplomatic balance had to be struck: \u201cYou don\u2019t win deals by cowering whenever China gets cross, nor on the other hand does stamping a foot persuade the Chinese that we are more important than we are.\u201d Another senior Tory said Theresa May should issue an order to \u201cpipe down, Private Pike\u201d. The chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on China, the Tory MP Richard Graham, said: \u201cThe crucial thing is that we do need to engage with China, and we do need to be sensitive with the tone, and I suspect that is where the issue is at the moment.\u201d Steve Tsang, the director of the School of Oriental and African Studies\u2019 China Institute, said: \u201cIt is a silly thing for Gavin Williamson to have said, particularly when there is no compelling reason to say it now and the ship he was referring to is not even ready to send.\u201d But he added that there was nothing wrong, in principle, with a navy vessel sailing in the South China Sea.

The ADB has 18 official volumes (and a supplementary volume of \u201cmissing persons\u201d) covering more than 13,000 scholarly biographies written by 4,500-plus authors over a 60-year period. It runs on the smell of a dusty archive including last year $50,000 in interest from an endowment fund established in 1997 and re-launched in 2009, and a recurrent budget of about $1.19m (which has been stagnant compared with wages over the past decade).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/12/whats-in-a-name-a-lot-when-were-admiring-murders-and-murderers\">What\u2019s in a name?

These are remarkable figures that ought be the envy of internet news and information startups. Potential marketability aside (the ADB is driven by public service, not profit), they also highlight the public appetite for such important national content \u2013 for both history nerds and others with passing interest.</p> <p>Bongiorno says Australians concerned with the future of what is a national cultural treasure (and the longest-running and largest collaboration in the humanities in this Australia) should donate to the ADB\u2019s endowment fund. In recent years some of Australia\u2019s wealthiest people (including Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull) are said to have contributed. The ADB only draws on the fund\u2019s interest.</p> <h2>Punching above its weight</h2> <p>Bongiorno says: \u201cIn contrast with government generosity to the Australian War Memorial \u2013 about half a billion dollars (<a href=\"http://honesthistory.net.au/wp/government-commits-to-500-million-extensions-to-australian-war-memorial-and-11-million-for-veterans-discount-card-and-lapel-pin/\">announced last year with little deference to financial and governance processes for such a large commonwealth spend</a>) for a new major extension \u2013 the ADB is among the multitude of great national cultural institutions which have to do a great deal with pretty limited resources. But it has a visionary general editor, a fine staff and a large army of devoted volunteers around the country.\u201d</p> <p>Such is the cultural and political potency of Anzac, with its capacity to eclipse other Australian narratives \u2013 including the ADB\u2019s 13,000 individual ones \u2013 that bring texture and complexity, for all the good and the bad, to the stories of Australia and the 60,000 years of continental civilisation that preceded it.</p> <p>Led by <a href=\"https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/nolan-mc\">Melanie Nolan</a>, director of the National Centre of Biography and the ADB\u2019s editor, the dictionary overhaul is underscored by a commitment to examine the lives of many more colonial women and the establishment of an <a href=\"http://history.cass.anu.edu.au/centres/ncb/indigenous-australian-dictionary-biography\">Indigenous Australian Dictionary of Biography</a> (IADB), which aims to add 190 new Indigenous biographies.</p> <p>The Australian Research Council funds the IADB project. The dictionary\u2019s Indigenous working party will advise and guide the project and consult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Indigenous project includes eminent historians <a href=\"http://history.cass.anu.edu.au/people/tom-griffiths\">Tom Griffiths</a> and <a href=\"https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/allbrook-m\">Malcolm Allbrook</a> as chief investigators and is led by Yawuru woman, the academic historian, <a href=\"http://www.historyofemotions.org.au/about-the-centre/researchers/shino-konishi/\">Shino Kinishi</a>.</p> <p>Griffiths, chair of the ADB\u2019s editorial board, has written of being \u201chumbled by the range and generosity of its expert volunteer labour, the brilliance and originality of its thousands of unpaid and willing contributors, the enthusiastic support of universities, libraries and museums right around the country, the dedication of its vital working parties and members of the editorial board, the skill and devotion of its staff, and the daily dependence on ADB entries by scholars and readers, businesspeople and politicians, lawyers, teachers, journalists, nurses, farmers, cooks, possibly shearers and hopefully millionaires\u201d.</p> <h2>Finding the missing</h2> <p>Nolan says the first step in addressing the dictionary of biography\u2019s \u201cglaring gender imbalance\u201d is to identify an extra 1,500 females who lived and perhaps flourished during the colonial era.</p> <p>\u201cJust 12% of the ADB\u2019s 13,000 biographical subjects are women \u2013 an imbalance which is even more notable when the early volumes alone are considered,\u201d says Nolan.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first four volumes 48 \u2013 just over 4% \u2013 of the 2,212 subjects were women ... and just 1.8% in volumes one and two.\u201d</p> <p>Glaring omissions, Nolan points out, include Barangaroo, the first wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/19/bennelongs-grave-how-history-betrayed-australias-first-diplomat\">Bennelong </a>(the Wangal-born warrior who became an informal envoy between the Gadigal tribes around Port Jackson and the British colonists) and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/bedlam-asylum-and-grog-20031024-gdhn9o.html\">Lucy Hannah Applewhaite.</a> The name Barangaroo \u2013 an Eora woman of great authority who was probably present at a famous meeting of Indigenous women and white men in February 1788 \u2013 is appropriately well known. Yet she has no ADB entry.</p> <p>With her husband, Applewhaite (1833-1909), a relative of musician Peter Garrett, worked at the NSW colonial immigration office and depot in 1861. \u201cA year later she was appointed head matron of the Hyde Park asylum, making her one of Sydney\u2019s first professional working mothers. Her husband and their nine children lived on the second floor of the asylum,\u201d Nolan says.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing her husband\u2019s death, she married William Hicks and had another five children \u2013 while continuing to work. With a salary at its peak of \u00a3250, she was one of the highest paid female public servants in NSW.\u201d</p> <p>Bennelong does have <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bennelong-1769\">an ADB entry.</a> But it is painfully inadequate and does him significant disservice, consistent with so much of the historiography about him until recent years.</p> <p>Bennelong was a warrior and a peacemaker, for a time held captive in chains by his European dispossessors. He took the pragmatic path of becoming a diplomat of sorts between the Sydney tribes and the invaders. He travelled to England with the first colonial governor, Arthur Phillip, was a husband and father who clung to his culture despite the ravages of colonialism. He developed friendships \u2013 out of necessity, certainly, but they apparently came to be infused by genuine warmth \u2013 with Europeans on his country, not least Phillip, and the former soldier, convict and brewer James Squire. He lived the last 18 years of his life in what is today\u2019s lower north shore suburb of Kissing Point, where he had another wife and more children, and led the local tribe. He was complex, articulate and politically savvy.</p> <p>Yet for more than two centuries, he has been straightjacketed as the subject of a black-white colonial morality tale: the Indigenous man straddling two worlds, inevitably toppling into the divide, dying as an obstreperous drunk having surrendered cultural agency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19630cae4b9966d9f2c703e772f978caabf9c7a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19630cae4b9966d9f2c703e772f978caabf9c7a3/0_0_3000_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woollarawarre Bennelong (c 1764-1813)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woollarawarre Bennelong (c 1764-1813), a Wangal-born warrior and a peacemaker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Australian author Eleanor Dark \u2013 one of the early postcolonial female novelists I most admire \u2013 wrote <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dark-eleanor-12400\">Bennelong\u2019s dictionary of biography entry,</a> published in 1966. Dark was at the vanguard of her time when it came to shedding light on the colonial shadows. Her novel, The Timeless Land (1941), featuring Bennelong as a character, was remarkable in its literary elegance and for its groundbreaking historical research that promoted understanding of European invasion and the complex interracial relations that followed, among both regular readers and eminent historians including Manning Clark. It was most enlightened for its day.</p> <p>But it, too, denied Bennelong the agency now being afforded him by another generation of historians, notably <a href=\"https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/kate-fullagar\">Kate Fullagar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eorapeople.com.au/tag/keith-vincent-smith/\">Keith Vincent-Smith</a>.</p> <p>Dark writes how Bennelong, after returning to Sydney in 1795, \u201ccould no longer find contentment or full acceptance either among his countrymen or the white men\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTwo years later he had become so fond of drinking that he lost no opportunity of being intoxicated, and in that state was so savage and violent as to be capable of any mischief.\u201d</p> <p>In a colony that ran on grog, the indignant scorn is reserved for an Indigenous man who drank, often at the governors\u2019 table. In truth, Bennelong came and went from Kissing Point to the colonial hub across the water and he had a rich tribal life for his last 18 years, which Dark manages to all but avoid.</p> <p>Nolan says: \u201cEven the most progressive often did not view Indigenous subjects on their own terms. Take for instance Eleanor Dark whose 1941 [The] Timeless Land was a real effort by a white woman to understand the Indigenous perspective. Then look at her ADB articles on Bennelong and Arabanoo [also a captive, for a time, of Arthur Phillip]. She writes the ADB articles from the colonising perspective. But then going back and rereading Timeless Land reveals the limits of her research and knowledge. We are about to put revised articles up for three Indigenous subjects, including Bennelong and <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/arabanoo-1711\">Arabanoo</a> because they are so woeful.\u201d</p> <h2>Slavery associations</h2> <p>A revisions committee is \u201ccurrently triaging the articles in volumes 1 and 2\u201d, according to Nolan. \u201cMy understanding is that a third of them need to be completely rewritten. A third need to be revised and a third need minor corrections.\u201d</p> <p>They include numerous entries about prominent figures from Britain who became pillars of colonial society in Australia, but whose connections to the slavery industry were omitted from the ADB. In September 2018, I published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/21/colonial-australias-foundation-is-stained-with-the-profits-of-british-slavery\">an article about these omissions</a>.</p> <p>They include men like English-born George Fife Angas (1789-1879), a pillar of the South Australian establishment. A merchant banker, landowner, colonial parliamentarian and philanthropist, he helped establish the Union Bank of Australia in 1836 and the South Australian Banking Co. He was sufficiently wealthy to buy 4,000 acres of fertile land on the Rhine and Gawler rivers in the Barossa range and, according to the ADB\u2019s 1966 entry he was: \u201cA Christian first, despite his varied business ventures Angas had a lifelong passion for forming societies and joining charitable committees.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/21/colonial-australias-foundation-is-stained-with-the-profits-of-british-slavery\">Colonial Australia\u2019s foundation is stained with the profits of British slavery | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/angas-george-fife-1707\">ADB says</a>: \u201cHe joined influential reformers in fighting for the emancipation of slaves and the restoration of nonconformist missionaries in British Honduras.\u201d It omits to mention he\u2019d also been a slave owner.</p> <p>The association of some colonial figures with slavery came to light in a book by political scientist and historian <a href=\"https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/professor-clinton-fernandes\">Clinton Fernandes</a> of University of NSW, Canberra. They were drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/\">Legacies of British Slave-ownership database</a> at the University College London (UCL) \u2013 a remarkable resource that aims to publicly record those Britons who profited from slavery.</p> <p>At the time of the book\u2019s publication, the ADB had been aware \u2013 due to the UCL database \u2013 of the slavery connections (and the omissions from the biographical entries) of some of the relevant colonial figures. It is understood that multiple sources indicate that potentially dozens of prominent colonial men with ADB entries might have slavery connections. If so, their entries need to be rewritten in light of the new information.</p> <p>Many of the current entries do reference interests in Caribbean plantations. This begs the question, of course, about whether the omissions of slavery connections (just like the absent details of frontier violence against Indigenous people by prominent graziers in the ADB\u2019s articles) are deliberate.</p> <p>\u201cDid an author in 1960 know that her subject was a slave owner who received compensation from the British government and migrated to Australia to invest the money and become rich and then, knowing this, she deliberately did not put it in her article? I cannot say that that was the case definitely (I only joined the ADB in 2008), but I think that this kind of thing was rare,\u201d Nolan says.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, many authors wrote articles from a colonising perspective. What they selected and how they presented their subjects sometimes tells us as much about the authors as it does about the subjects that they are writing on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/04/reuniting-indigenous-sticks-with-their-stories-the-museum-on-a-mission-to-give-back\">Reuniting Indigenous 'sticks' with their stories: the museum on a mission to give back</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How many entries need to be revised?</h2> <p>Nolan raises the example of the ADB article on explorer and pastoralist <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mcmillan-angus-2416\">Angus McMillan </a>(1810-1865) after who a federal electorate was named.</p> <p>\u201c[It] recorded that he \u2018took a sympathetic interest in the welfare of Aborigines\u2019. New research has shown he was involved in frontier violence so we have commissioned a new entry that will cover this. How many other entries of pastoralists will need to be revised?\u201d</p> <p>The answer would seem to be: perhaps dozens.</p> <p>And they include those relating to the pioneering Kimberley pastoralist family, the Duracks, whose most prominent member, the novelist<a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/durack-dame-mary-gertrude-27045\"> Mary Durack,</a> wrote evocatively about frontier grazing and pioneering in her novels Kings in Grass Castles and Sons in the Saddle.</p> <p>The omissions in her books about the appalling, intensely violent, inhumane treatment of Aboriginal custodians (by her antecedents; by what passed for a remote judicial system; by an evidentiary protocol that invariably absolved the invaders of culpability; by a brutal, corrupt policing system that bolstered the profits of those families in Durack\u2019s grass castles) have been left to contemporary Western Australian historians such as <a href=\"https://uwap.uwa.edu.au/products/every-mothers-son-is-guilty-policing-the-kimberley-frontier-of-western-australia-1882-1905\">Chris Owen</a>, to fill.</p> <p>A lack of resources promises to make the top-to-toe revision of the ADB slow going.</p> <p>The most (but not the only) problematic volumes, 1 and 2, currently comprise 1,182 (mostly white men). Revision has started with the missing persons volume in 2005, which added 565 articles and the Indigenous Australian Dictionary of Biography project which will add 190 Indigenous articles. Much more is needed.</p> <p>Nolan explains: \u201cIn a revised version I would both revise the articles we have, add a few hundred more and then add the same number of female, convict and Indigenous Australians ... a total of, say, 3,000 subjects. So a really realistic costing to just revise the period up to 1,850 would be $8m over eight years.\u201d</p> <p>It is a lot of money. Though not in the scheme of funds allocated to other cultural projects; think about other potential usages of the more than $500m granted to the war memorial, which has not been subjected to the cuts of many other national institutions.</p> <p>Other countries have placed comparatively greater value on their own equivalent national dictionaries of biography.</p> <p>In the decade from 1994, Britain\u2019s original Dictionary of National Biography (30,941 articles, written by 653 authors between 1885 and 1900 with annual updates) was completely revised. The ODNB went online in 2004; 10,000-plus contributors produced 50,113 articles covering 54,922 lives at a cost of \u00a325m, bankrolled by the British Academy and Oxford University Press.</p> <p>The first official state-funded two-volume Dictionary of New Zealand Biography was published in 1940. The 1966 Encyclopedia of New Zealand, again state-funded, comprised 1,157 biographies.</p> <p>The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography project began in 1983. Underwritten with NZ Lottery Board grants, from about 1990-2000 the project received between $800,000 and $1m per annum. More than 3,000 articles were published in five volumes between 1990 and 2000 (with two volumes in Maori).</p> <h2>A historical life of its own</h2> <p>A cultural behemoth such as the Australian Dictionary of Biography takes on a historical life of its own. In 2013, Nolan and Christine Fernon published the first official history of the dictionary: <a href=\"https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/adbs-story\">The ADB\u2019s Story.</a> They drew, in part, on all of the working files on subjects in the dictionary from the earliest to the latest volumes \u2013 44 metal filing cabinets full of them. In writing history, the chosen authors made their own. Today those cabinets would also hold truths about the notable omissions, mere oversights or otherwise, in some of the entries.</p> <p>Political events, new databases \u2013 such as the profits of slavery resource \u2013 and public inquiries all raise new questions about the accuracy of some biographical portraits.</p> <p>As ADB editor Melanie Nolan writes: \u201cSome readers assumed that we could simply and systematically add an addendum to ADB articles of sexual abusers in light of the findings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse ... However, much of the evidence to the 2017 royal commission was on camera. Moreover, the problem with naming and accusing is that it [the allegations] is untested in the court.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes other records will emerge, unanticipated, to cast new light \u2013 or shadow \u2013 on old subjects. For example the original ADB article on artist and writer Donald Friend didn\u2019t mention his sexual relations with houseboys in Bali and Sri Lanka during the 1960s and 70s. But Friend\u2019s diaries, which the National Library of Australia published from 2001 to 2006, document his paedophelia. This is proof enough for <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/friend-donald-stuart-leslie-12516\">the ADB</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEvidence is the issue,\u201d Nolan says.</p> <p>History demands no less.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You\u2019re a student writing an essay or a journalist traversing uncertain historical terrain and you want to know a little, for example, about colonial leader Lachlan Macquarie, pioneering \u201csettler\u201d John Batman or former governor general William Slim. So you search their respective names and \u201cbiography\u201d. Your top hit, in each case, is likely to be their entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, this country\u2019s pre-eminent resource about noteworthy deceased citizens. Lachlan Macquarie, you\u2019ll learn, approached Aboriginal people with a \u201chumanitarian conscience\u201d \u2013 though he did once organise a \u201cmilitary drive to chasten them\u201d when they\u2019d shown signs of \u201cungrateful hostility\u201d. The ADB, meanwhile, portrays Batman in a most positive tone regarding Indigenous people. and Slim, Australian governor general from 1953 to 1960, was a war hero and \u201cformer teacher [who] enjoyed visiting schools and talking to pupils\u201d. In fact Macquarie used \u201cterror\u201d (his words) tactics including cutting off and displaying the heads of Aboriginal victims and ordered that black children be stolen from the sites of his soldiers\u2019 massacres. Batman, meanwhile, was a syphilitic grifter who led mass killings of Tasmanian Aboriginal people and struck a worthless \u201ctreaty\u201d with the Indigenous of the land upon which Melbourne was imposed. Slim was the subject of paedophilia allegations at the recent commonwealth royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse relating to visits he made as governor general to a farm school for child migrants in rural New South Wales in the 1950s. There are many more examples of where the ADB\u2019s biographies have been exposed, with the passage of time as, at best, historically incomplete and at worst, perhaps, deliberately so in some cases. History, of course, is not static. Time exposes its epochal trends, the contexts \u2013 political and social \u2013 in which it\u2019s written and its occasional susceptibility to the cultural mores and sensibilities of its day. And that is why the ADB has embarked on an ambitious project to reassess and re-scrutinise the lives of the subjects in its earliest volumes, to find the \u201cmissing\u201d \u2013 mostly women and Indigenous people \u2013 and to apply new resources to scrutinising those in its 60-year-old pages. It will involve the addition to some entries of material that was not originally available. In some cases it will involve the rewriting of history in the light of truths that may not have been apparent \u2013 or were overlooked \u2013 decades ago. This process may well be the fantasy of every professional and autodidact history nerd \u2013 the latter a rank to which I claim membership. I\u2019ve been a fierce critic of the shortcomings of the ADB\u2019s earlier colonial volumes, although I was oblivious to the scant resources allocated to the dictionary and the enormous time and effort required to bring it up to date. Frank Bongiorno, head of the history school at the Australian National University \u2013 which produces the ADB \u2013 describes what is happening as a \u201cdecolonisation\u201d. \u201cInevitably when you\u2019ve been running for 60 years, and your life spans a revolution in how Australians understand their identity, their history and their place in the world, the earliest work will sometimes be out of date, and especially so in relation to the Indigenous experience of dispossession and violence. \u201cBut the ADB team \u2013 which like so many of our great cultural institutions is much smaller than it once was \u2013 is decolonising a project whose origins lie in an era before most white Australians were prepared to face what they and their ancestors had done to Aboriginal people,\u201d Bongiorno says. \u201cClearly, updating the early colonial entries \u2013 most of them written over 50 years ago \u2013 is highly desirable but a multimillion dollar task involving thousands of hours of research, writing, fact-checking and editing.\u201d It seems almost incomprehensible that the ADB, which is part of the ANU\u2019s National Centre of Biography, has eight equivalent full-time staff but just three \u2013 an administrator, a programmer and an online manager \u2013 dedicated to the decolonisation project. It has great reliance on the brainpower of hundreds of volunteer writers \u2013 among them academic and autodidact historians, journalists, teachers and others with the demonstrated research skills to write the entries. The entries span first colonial contact to subjects who died in 1994. The ADB has 18 official volumes (and a supplementary volume of \u201cmissing persons\u201d) covering more than 13,000 scholarly biographies written by 4,500-plus authors over a 60-year period. It runs on the smell of a dusty archive including last year $50,000 in interest from an endowment fund established in 1997 and re-launched in 2009, and a recurrent budget of about $1.19m (which has been stagnant compared with wages over the past decade). The ADB receives 60m to 70m internet hits a year, the Centre for Biography another 20m. These are remarkable figures that ought be the envy of internet news and information startups. Potential marketability aside (the ADB is driven by public service, not profit), they also highlight the public appetite for such important national content \u2013 for both history nerds and others with passing interest. Bongiorno says Australians concerned with the future of what is a national cultural treasure (and the longest-running and largest collaboration in the humanities in this Australia) should donate to the ADB\u2019s endowment fund. In recent years some of Australia\u2019s wealthiest people (including Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull) are said to have contributed. The ADB only draws on the fund\u2019s interest. Punching above its weight Bongiorno says: \u201cIn contrast with government generosity to the Australian War Memorial \u2013 about half a billion dollars (announced last year with little deference to financial and governance processes for such a large commonwealth spend) for a new major extension \u2013 the ADB is among the multitude of great national cultural institutions which have to do a great deal with pretty limited resources. But it has a visionary general editor, a fine staff and a large army of devoted volunteers around the country.\u201d Such is the cultural and political potency of Anzac, with its capacity to eclipse other Australian narratives \u2013 including the ADB\u2019s 13,000 individual ones \u2013 that bring texture and complexity, for all the good and the bad, to the stories of Australia and the 60,000 years of continental civilisation that preceded it. Led by Melanie Nolan, director of the National Centre of Biography and the ADB\u2019s editor, the dictionary overhaul is underscored by a commitment to examine the lives of many more colonial women and the establishment of an Indigenous Australian Dictionary of Biography (IADB), which aims to add 190 new Indigenous biographies. The Australian Research Council funds the IADB project. The dictionary\u2019s Indigenous working party will advise and guide the project and consult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Indigenous project includes eminent historians Tom Griffiths and Malcolm Allbrook as chief investigators and is led by Yawuru woman, the academic historian, Shino Kinishi. Griffiths, chair of the ADB\u2019s editorial board, has written of being \u201chumbled by the range and generosity of its expert volunteer labour, the brilliance and originality of its thousands of unpaid and willing contributors, the enthusiastic support of universities, libraries and museums right around the country, the dedication of its vital working parties and members of the editorial board, the skill and devotion of its staff, and the daily dependence on ADB entries by scholars and readers, businesspeople and politicians, lawyers, teachers, journalists, nurses, farmers, cooks, possibly shearers and hopefully millionaires\u201d. Finding the missing Nolan says the first step in addressing the dictionary of biography\u2019s \u201cglaring gender imbalance\u201d is to identify an extra 1,500 females who lived and perhaps flourished during the colonial era. \u201cJust 12% of the ADB\u2019s 13,000 biographical subjects are women \u2013 an imbalance which is even more notable when the early volumes alone are considered,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cIn the first four volumes 48 \u2013 just over 4% \u2013 of the 2,212 subjects were women ... and just 1.8% in volumes one and two.\u201d Glaring omissions, Nolan points out, include Barangaroo, the first wife of Bennelong (the Wangal-born warrior who became an informal envoy between the Gadigal tribes around Port Jackson and the British colonists) and Lucy Hannah Applewhaite. The name Barangaroo \u2013 an Eora woman of great authority who was probably present at a famous meeting of Indigenous women and white men in February 1788 \u2013 is appropriately well known. Yet she has no ADB entry. With her husband, Applewhaite (1833-1909), a relative of musician Peter Garrett, worked at the NSW colonial immigration office and depot in 1861. \u201cA year later she was appointed head matron of the Hyde Park asylum, making her one of Sydney\u2019s first professional working mothers. Her husband and their nine children lived on the second floor of the asylum,\u201d Nolan says. \u201cFollowing her husband\u2019s death, she married William Hicks and had another five children \u2013 while continuing to work. With a salary at its peak of \u00a3250, she was one of the highest paid female public servants in NSW.\u201d Bennelong does have an ADB entry. But it is painfully inadequate and does him significant disservice, consistent with so much of the historiography about him until recent years. Bennelong was a warrior and a peacemaker, for a time held captive in chains by his European dispossessors. He took the pragmatic path of becoming a diplomat of sorts between the Sydney tribes and the invaders. He travelled to England with the first colonial governor, Arthur Phillip, was a husband and father who clung to his culture despite the ravages of colonialism. He developed friendships \u2013 out of necessity, certainly, but they apparently came to be infused by genuine warmth \u2013 with Europeans on his country, not least Phillip, and the former soldier, convict and brewer James Squire. He lived the last 18 years of his life in what is today\u2019s lower north shore suburb of Kissing Point, where he had another wife and more children, and led the local tribe. He was complex, articulate and politically savvy. Yet for more than two centuries, he has been straightjacketed as the subject of a black-white colonial morality tale: the Indigenous man straddling two worlds, inevitably toppling into the divide, dying as an obstreperous drunk having surrendered cultural agency. The Australian author Eleanor Dark \u2013 one of the early postcolonial female novelists I most admire \u2013 wrote Bennelong\u2019s dictionary of biography entry, published in 1966. Dark was at the vanguard of her time when it came to shedding light on the colonial shadows. Her novel, The Timeless Land (1941), featuring Bennelong as a character, was remarkable in its literary elegance and for its groundbreaking historical research that promoted understanding of European invasion and the complex interracial relations that followed, among both regular readers and eminent historians including Manning Clark. It was most enlightened for its day. But it, too, denied Bennelong the agency now being afforded him by another generation of historians, notably Kate Fullagar and Keith Vincent-Smith. Dark writes how Bennelong, after returning to Sydney in 1795, \u201ccould no longer find contentment or full acceptance either among his countrymen or the white men\u201d. \u201cTwo years later he had become so fond of drinking that he lost no opportunity of being intoxicated, and in that state was so savage and violent as to be capable of any mischief.\u201d In a colony that ran on grog, the indignant scorn is reserved for an Indigenous man who drank, often at the governors\u2019 table. In truth, Bennelong came and went from Kissing Point to the colonial hub across the water and he had a rich tribal life for his last 18 years, which Dark manages to all but avoid. Nolan says: \u201cEven the most progressive often did not view Indigenous subjects on their own terms. Take for instance Eleanor Dark whose 1941 [The] Timeless Land was a real effort by a white woman to understand the Indigenous perspective. Then look at her ADB articles on Bennelong and Arabanoo [also a captive, for a time, of Arthur Phillip]. She writes the ADB articles from the colonising perspective. But then going back and rereading Timeless Land reveals the limits of her research and knowledge. We are about to put revised articles up for three Indigenous subjects, including Bennelong and Arabanoo because they are so woeful.\u201d Slavery associations A revisions committee is \u201ccurrently triaging the articles in volumes 1 and 2\u201d, according to Nolan. \u201cMy understanding is that a third of them need to be completely rewritten. A third need to be revised and a third need minor corrections.\u201d They include numerous entries about prominent figures from Britain who became pillars of colonial society in Australia, but whose connections to the slavery industry were omitted from the ADB. In September 2018, I published an article about these omissions. They include men like English-born George Fife Angas (1789-1879), a pillar of the South Australian establishment. A merchant banker, landowner, colonial parliamentarian and philanthropist, he helped establish the Union Bank of Australia in 1836 and the South Australian Banking Co. He was sufficiently wealthy to buy 4,000 acres of fertile land on the Rhine and Gawler rivers in the Barossa range and, according to the ADB\u2019s 1966 entry he was: \u201cA Christian first, despite his varied business ventures Angas had a lifelong passion for forming societies and joining charitable committees.\u201d The ADB says: \u201cHe joined influential reformers in fighting for the emancipation of slaves and the restoration of nonconformist missionaries in British Honduras.\u201d It omits to mention he\u2019d also been a slave owner. The association of some colonial figures with slavery came to light in a book by political scientist and historian Clinton Fernandes of University of NSW, Canberra. They were drawn from the Legacies of British Slave-ownership database at the University College London (UCL) \u2013 a remarkable resource that aims to publicly record those Britons who profited from slavery. At the time of the book\u2019s publication, the ADB had been aware \u2013 due to the UCL database \u2013 of the slavery connections (and the omissions from the biographical entries) of some of the relevant colonial figures. It is understood that multiple sources indicate that potentially dozens of prominent colonial men with ADB entries might have slavery connections. If so, their entries need to be rewritten in light of the new information. Many of the current entries do reference interests in Caribbean plantations. This begs the question, of course, about whether the omissions of slavery connections (just like the absent details of frontier violence against Indigenous people by prominent graziers in the ADB\u2019s articles) are deliberate. \u201cDid an author in 1960 know that her subject was a slave owner who received compensation from the British government and migrated to Australia to invest the money and become rich and then, knowing this, she deliberately did not put it in her article? I cannot say that that was the case definitely (I only joined the ADB in 2008), but I think that this kind of thing was rare,\u201d Nolan says. \u201cOn the other hand, many authors wrote articles from a colonising perspective. What they selected and how they presented their subjects sometimes tells us as much about the authors as it does about the subjects that they are writing on.\u201d How many entries need to be revised? Nolan raises the example of the ADB article on explorer and pastoralist Angus McMillan (1810-1865) after who a federal electorate was named. \u201c[It] recorded that he \u2018took a sympathetic interest in the welfare of Aborigines\u2019. New research has shown he was involved in frontier violence so we have commissioned a new entry that will cover this. How many other entries of pastoralists will need to be revised?\u201d The answer would seem to be: perhaps dozens. And they include those relating to the pioneering Kimberley pastoralist family, the Duracks, whose most prominent member, the novelist Mary Durack, wrote evocatively about frontier grazing and pioneering in her novels Kings in Grass Castles and Sons in the Saddle. The omissions in her books about the appalling, intensely violent, inhumane treatment of Aboriginal custodians (by her antecedents; by what passed for a remote judicial system; by an evidentiary protocol that invariably absolved the invaders of culpability; by a brutal, corrupt policing system that bolstered the profits of those families in Durack\u2019s grass castles) have been left to contemporary Western Australian historians such as Chris Owen, to fill. A lack of resources promises to make the top-to-toe revision of the ADB slow going. The most (but not the only) problematic volumes, 1 and 2, currently comprise 1,182 (mostly white men). Revision has started with the missing persons volume in 2005, which added 565 articles and the Indigenous Australian Dictionary of Biography project which will add 190 Indigenous articles. Much more is needed. Nolan explains: \u201cIn a revised version I would both revise the articles we have, add a few hundred more and then add the same number of female, convict and Indigenous Australians ... a total of, say, 3,000 subjects. So a really realistic costing to just revise the period up to 1,850 would be $8m over eight years.\u201d It is a lot of money. Though not in the scheme of funds allocated to other cultural projects; think about other potential usages of the more than $500m granted to the war memorial, which has not been subjected to the cuts of many other national institutions. Other countries have placed comparatively greater value on their own equivalent national dictionaries of biography. In the decade from 1994, Britain\u2019s original Dictionary of National Biography (30,941 articles, written by 653 authors between 1885 and 1900 with annual updates) was completely revised. The ODNB went online in 2004; 10,000-plus contributors produced 50,113 articles covering 54,922 lives at a cost of \u00a325m, bankrolled by the British Academy and Oxford University Press. The first official state-funded two-volume Dictionary of New Zealand Biography was published in 1940. The 1966 Encyclopedia of New Zealand, again state-funded, comprised 1,157 biographies. The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography project began in 1983. Underwritten with NZ Lottery Board grants, from about 1990-2000 the project received between $800,000 and $1m per annum. More than 3,000 articles were published in five volumes between 1990 and 2000 (with two volumes in Maori). A historical life of its own A cultural behemoth such as the Australian Dictionary of Biography takes on a historical life of its own. In 2013, Nolan and Christine Fernon published the first official history of the dictionary: The ADB\u2019s Story. They drew, in part, on all of the working files on subjects in the dictionary from the earliest to the latest volumes \u2013 44 metal filing cabinets full of them. In writing history, the chosen authors made their own. Today those cabinets would also hold truths about the notable omissions, mere oversights or otherwise, in some of the entries. Political events, new databases \u2013 such as the profits of slavery resource \u2013 and public inquiries all raise new questions about the accuracy of some biographical portraits. As ADB editor Melanie Nolan writes: \u201cSome readers assumed that we could simply and systematically add an addendum to ADB articles of sexual abusers in light of the findings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse ... However, much of the evidence to the 2017 royal commission was on camera. Moreover, the problem with naming and accusing is that it [the allegations] is untested in the court.\u201d Sometimes other records will emerge, unanticipated, to cast new light \u2013 or shadow \u2013 on old subjects. For example the original ADB article on artist and writer Donald Friend didn\u2019t mention his sexual relations with houseboys in Bali and Sri Lanka during the 1960s and 70s. But Friend\u2019s diaries, which the National Library of Australia published from 2001 to 2006, document his paedophelia. This is proof enough for the ADB. \u201cEvidence is the issue,\u201d Nolan says. History demands no less.",

      "body": "<p>In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,\u201d she once told an <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a23925/meghan-markle-interview/\" title=\"\"><em>Esquire</em></a> journalist, who\u2019d described her writing as \u201cincredible\u201d. \u201cWhat it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tormenting the Duchess of Sussex has become a national sport, limited only by the supply of new material</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now that tormenting the Duchess of Sussex has become a national sport, limited only by the supply of new material, this same incredible handwriting is proving a treasure trove for character assassins. Last week, after her father released sections of a private letter she had written, alleged handwriting experts confirmed what the Meghan pursuit is making increasingly clear: harassment by the press is not over in the post-Leveson era, just different, and not merely because the results are disseminated instantly, <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/5-reasons-conspiracy-theorists-claim-meghan-markles-pregnancy-fake-2755839\" title=\"\">with added conspiracy</a>, on social media.</p> <p>More vigilance over physical privacy still leaves room for intrusive, but undisprovable, speculation; greater avoidance of libels does not restrict dehumanising commentary, volunteered, of course, from a perspective of strictly caring emotional literacy. Body language experts will claim, for instance, to gauge her mental state from Meghan\u2019s deployment of her bump. Since the Ipso <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/\" title=\"\">code of conduct</a> proscribing harassment doesn\u2019t cover any distress caused by amateur analysis, maybe former phone hackers and laid-off bin rummagers could yet find employment as hired gaslighters of one sort or another.</p> <p>For the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, Ruth Myers, a handwriting expert, found, in a protractedly unflattering <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-emotionally-insecure-self-13980578\" title=\"\">analysis</a>, that the letter exposed Meghan as \u201cemotionally insecure and self-pitying\u201d. Also \u201ceasily provoked to anger\u201d. It was further possible for this scholar to deduce, from handwriting alone, \u201can inability to forgive\u201d, something arguably contradicted by the letter\u2019s existence.</p> <p>In the same document, Emma Bache, another expert, discovered evidence of a \u201cshowman and a narcissist\u201d. Tracey Trussell detected vulnerability: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for her to forget people who have meant so much to her in her life.\u201d</p> <p>If, having got beyond her conscious, professional calligraphy, these experts could not agree on which facets, out of so many, of the duchess\u2019s character are most concerning, well, perhaps that only confirms, to the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6661499/Cruel-trolls-spew-bile-against-Duchess-Sussex.html\" title=\"\">trolls</a> congregating on Twitter, that fellow Meghanphobe <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6460443/PIERS-MORGAN-Ex-friend-Meghan-Markle-ruthless-social-climbing-actress-used-getting-way.html\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a> is correct to feel (following his defriending by her) generally \u201csuspicious and cynical about Ms Markle\u201d.</p> <p>Morgan is sympathetic, instead, to the emotionally abusive man who, with the unstinting support of the British press, has committed to destroying Meghan\u2019s pleasure in her wedding, her pregnancy and, by the sound of it, her forthcoming motherhood \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6695877/PIERS-MORGAN-Sorry-George-Meghans-no-Princess-Diana-not-media-vilifying-her.html\" title=\"\">her poor father</a>\u201d. If superficially unalike, the two older men appear to share an incredulous resentment that a young woman might, out of self-preservation, disregard them, no matter many times they misrepresent or admonish her.</p> <p>The latest example of Morgan\u2019s retribution was among several press retorts prompted by an intervention by George Clooney, who warned: \u201cShe is being pursued and hunted in the same way that Diana was and it\u2019s history repeating itself.\u201d</p> <p>By way of correcting him, a number of royalty authorities seized this opportunity to attack Meghan, for the completely new personality defect of being implicitly compared with Diana, by someone who is probably not \u2013 her critics say \u2013 a proper friend anyway. Arthur Edwards, who photographed the teenage Diana in a transparent skirt (\u201cthe sun came out and revealed those beautiful legs\u201d), told Meghan to \u201clighten up. You\u2019re not the new Princess Diana.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-parallels-with-diana-are-unjustified-s59p9dqn9\" title=\"\">the <em>Times</em></a>, Clooney\u2019s comment was dismissed as \u201cutter fantasy\u201d.</p> <p>If not exactly fantasy, Clooney\u2019s version of Diana\u2019s persecution does, admittedly, leave lots out. Glossed over is the late princess\u2019s well-documented habit, with the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4838254/Diana-s-call-RICHARD-KAY-recalls-final-conversation.html\" title=\"\">collusion of chosen journalists</a>, of invading her own privacy; her later refusal to use royal protection officers. When secrecy mattered to her, Diana did take holidays or have long relationships, undocumented in the press. Moreover, prior to her first (initially denied) experiment in shared psychodrama, authored with Andrew Morton, in which she detailed Prince Charles\u2019s infidelity with Camilla Parker-Bowles, the young Diana remained, to her husband\u2019s annoyance, a cherished national pet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Would any of this, it is increasingly asked, have happened if Meghan were not (to use her term) biracial?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So if anything, Clooney surely does not go far enough.

      "bodyText": "In the period when the acquisition of the former Meghan Markle was depicted as little short of a national triumph, much was written in the British press about her various accomplishments. These are, after all, roughly as common in royal spouses as successful independent careers. Meghan, the actress and blogger and charity worker, is also, it emerged, a skilled calligrapher. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,\u201d she once told an Esquire journalist, who\u2019d described her writing as \u201cincredible\u201d. \u201cWhat it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning.\u201d Now that tormenting the Duchess of Sussex has become a national sport, limited only by the supply of new material, this same incredible handwriting is proving a treasure trove for character assassins. Last week, after her father released sections of a private letter she had written, alleged handwriting experts confirmed what the Meghan pursuit is making increasingly clear: harassment by the press is not over in the post-Leveson era, just different, and not merely because the results are disseminated instantly, with added conspiracy, on social media. More vigilance over physical privacy still leaves room for intrusive, but undisprovable, speculation; greater avoidance of libels does not restrict dehumanising commentary, volunteered, of course, from a perspective of strictly caring emotional literacy. Body language experts will claim, for instance, to gauge her mental state from Meghan\u2019s deployment of her bump. Since the Ipso code of conduct proscribing harassment doesn\u2019t cover any distress caused by amateur analysis, maybe former phone hackers and laid-off bin rummagers could yet find employment as hired gaslighters of one sort or another. For the Daily Mirror, Ruth Myers, a handwriting expert, found, in a protractedly unflattering analysis, that the letter exposed Meghan as \u201cemotionally insecure and self-pitying\u201d. Also \u201ceasily provoked to anger\u201d. It was further possible for this scholar to deduce, from handwriting alone, \u201can inability to forgive\u201d, something arguably contradicted by the letter\u2019s existence. In the same document, Emma Bache, another expert, discovered evidence of a \u201cshowman and a narcissist\u201d. Tracey Trussell detected vulnerability: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for her to forget people who have meant so much to her in her life.\u201d If, having got beyond her conscious, professional calligraphy, these experts could not agree on which facets, out of so many, of the duchess\u2019s character are most concerning, well, perhaps that only confirms, to the trolls congregating on Twitter, that fellow Meghanphobe Piers Morgan is correct to feel (following his defriending by her) generally \u201csuspicious and cynical about Ms Markle\u201d. Morgan is sympathetic, instead, to the emotionally abusive man who, with the unstinting support of the British press, has committed to destroying Meghan\u2019s pleasure in her wedding, her pregnancy and, by the sound of it, her forthcoming motherhood \u2013 \u201cher poor father\u201d. If superficially unalike, the two older men appear to share an incredulous resentment that a young woman might, out of self-preservation, disregard them, no matter many times they misrepresent or admonish her. The latest example of Morgan\u2019s retribution was among several press retorts prompted by an intervention by George Clooney, who warned: \u201cShe is being pursued and hunted in the same way that Diana was and it\u2019s history repeating itself.\u201d By way of correcting him, a number of royalty authorities seized this opportunity to attack Meghan, for the completely new personality defect of being implicitly compared with Diana, by someone who is probably not \u2013 her critics say \u2013 a proper friend anyway. Arthur Edwards, who photographed the teenage Diana in a transparent skirt (\u201cthe sun came out and revealed those beautiful legs\u201d), told Meghan to \u201clighten up. You\u2019re not the new Princess Diana.\u201d In the Times, Clooney\u2019s comment was dismissed as \u201cutter fantasy\u201d. If not exactly fantasy, Clooney\u2019s version of Diana\u2019s persecution does, admittedly, leave lots out. Glossed over is the late princess\u2019s well-documented habit, with the collusion of chosen journalists, of invading her own privacy; her later refusal to use royal protection officers. When secrecy mattered to her, Diana did take holidays or have long relationships, undocumented in the press. Moreover, prior to her first (initially denied) experiment in shared psychodrama, authored with Andrew Morton, in which she detailed Prince Charles\u2019s infidelity with Camilla Parker-Bowles, the young Diana remained, to her husband\u2019s annoyance, a cherished national pet. So if anything, Clooney surely does not go far enough. Within months of her marriage, with zero contribution from their victim, sections of the UK press had identified Meghan as someone of whom virtually anything malicious might be said, regardless of accuracy, public interest and its potential impact on her health. Neither her advancing pregnancy nor one attempted correction has brought any respite. Whatever privacy concessions Meghan Markle was willing (however inexplicably) to make in exchange for royal privileges, she could not, reasonably, have anticipated these sustained personal attacks, for which the sole justification is \u2013 ludicrously \u2013 that they originate in a man who should ideally be rewarded with a restraining order. Would any of this, it is increasingly asked, given the indulgence extended to most royal hangers-on, have happened if Meghan were not, to use her term, biracial? Plainly, this affluent couple have choices and an exit from royal life could liberate them, at once, from vindictive relations and their press facilitators, to say nothing of their current destiny as lifetime specimens for bodily and other analysis. Plus we\u2019d finally find out if anything would make the Markles happy. That outcome might be less promising, however, for the reputations of the very news groups that, seconds after identifying Meghan as breath of fresh air, decided she was also a hardened manipulatrix, cruel to her poor stalker of a daddy, with a way of being pregnant that really pisses off newsroom executives. And leave aside plunging trust levels, and journalism\u2019s deepening funding crisis, will no one think of the graphologists? \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

The league talks a very public game about fairness, community, and patriotism, but its moral convictions are bottom-lined based. Now, instead of having played fair with Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid because it\u2019s the right thing to do, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/15/colin-kaepernick-reaches-settlement-with-nfl-over-kneeling-protest-fallout\">the league has been forced to settle a grievance</a> launched by the pair that alleged the NFL\u2019s team owners had blackballed them for protesting during the national anthem.</p> <p>While the settlement is a win for Kaepernick and Reid, it\u2019s a severe loss for the meaning of sports in America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/15/colin-kaepernick-reaches-settlement-with-nfl-over-kneeling-protest-fallout\">Colin Kaepernick reaches settlement with NFL over kneeling protest fallout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We constantly question the appropriateness of athletes as role models in America. Do they show the qualities of character that we would like our children to embrace? Every act they perform is reported, analyzed, and judged by sports commentators and the public. As someone who\u2019s been under that unflinching microscope for most of my life, I can tell you it\u2019s an uncomfortable place to be. But it\u2019s also fair that the public scrutinize individuals who their children idolize and emulate. The Kaiser Family Foundation survey concluded that famous athletes rank second (72%) behind parents (92%) as people children \u201clook up to or want to be like.\u201d Because of that important influence, we should be vigilant in who we promote as heroes. Hall of fame quarterback Joe Montana did some damage to that ideal <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/joe-montana-on-patriots-if-you-aint-cheating-you-aint-trying/\">when he told a reporter in 2015</a> that the Super Bowl winning 49ers were known to skirt the rules. \u201cThey always say, \u2018If you ain\u2019t cheating, you ain\u2019t trying.\u2019\u201d The New England Patriots\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/11/deflategate-tom-brady-gets-four-game-ban-patriots-lose-first-round-pick\">Deflategate saga</a> didn\u2019t help, either.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we need to apply the same intense scrutiny to sports teams and their owners as we do to the individual players like Kaepernick and Reid. Sports is a major symbol of American values of fair play, sportsmanship, dedication, sacrifice, discipline, and teamwork. In many parts of the midwest and the south, high school football <em>is</em> America. But the NFL is putting all that in jeopardy when it refuses to take a leadership role in standing up for the constitution \u2013 and the rights of athletes like Reid and Kaepernick to protest peacefully \u2013 instead of cowering in the ticket booth counting money, afraid to offend people who place entertainment over ethics.</p> <p>Compromising the integrity of the sport teaches kids the wrong lesson, which is especially damaging when football is facing such a shaky future. The National Federation of High School Associations\u2019 recent survey, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/30/high-school-football-numbers-drop-brain-trauma\">showed a decade-long decline in football</a>. Some of that decline can be attributed to fears over concussion, another topic in which the league has often failed to cover itself in glory.</p> <p>Even more significant is that professional football has a crisis of conscience \u2013 in that it doesn\u2019t really have one. The now familiar on-field patriotic displays and fighter jet flyovers are patriotism-for-hire: the military pays millions to have soldiers parade around the field and sing God Bless America before games. If it were authentic patriotism, wouldn\u2019t the NFL allow these displays to be made for free? And when the league does contribute to the community and social issues, it\u2019s usually to help smooth its image after bad publicity. Following the player backlash to the NFL punishing players who took a knee, the NFL and a group of about 40 players <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21614673/nfl-agrees-commit-nearly-100m-seven-years-charities-important-african-american-communities\">reached an agreement</a> that the league would contribute $89m over seven years to fund projects dealing with criminal justice reform, law enforcement/community relations, and education.</p> <p>The NFL is like a naughty kid: is it sorry because it did wrong or because it got caught?</p> <p>But there are signs of hope that the league can be a force for good. In January, the NFL, in conjunction with the Players Coalition, launched a social justice platform called Inspire Change emphasizing education, economic development and community and police relations. They will be funding grassroots organizations like <a href=\"https://www.bbbs.org/\">Big Brothers Big Sisters of America</a> and <a href=\"http://operationhope.org/\">Operation HOPE</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/b55eb7bf8f6e4ba582e9be952f0cee2f\">Anna Isaacson</a>, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of social responsibility, explained: \u201cThis launch involves grants, new African American history education programs in schools, grants with organizations we have not worked with before and who are doing the work on the ground, and PSAs on broadcasts.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction. I\u2019d like to see 2019 as the rebirth of the NFL as a vibrant leader in sports, dedicated to supporting the values of the country as expressed in the constitution rather than pandering to the narrow minds of those who mistake parochialism for patriotism. Playing to the dwindling core is a losing strategy, in politics and in football.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is an NBA hall of fame member and recipient of the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

As soon as one kid raises his hand to make that challenge, the coach quickly dismisses the team, pulls him aside, and says: \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind!\u201d That\u2019s how I see the NFL. The league talks a very public game about fairness, community, and patriotism, but its moral convictions are bottom-lined based. Now, instead of having played fair with Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid because it\u2019s the right thing to do, the league has been forced to settle a grievance launched by the pair that alleged the NFL\u2019s team owners had blackballed them for protesting during the national anthem. While the settlement is a win for Kaepernick and Reid, it\u2019s a severe loss for the meaning of sports in America. We constantly question the appropriateness of athletes as role models in America. Do they show the qualities of character that we would like our children to embrace? Every act they perform is reported, analyzed, and judged by sports commentators and the public. As someone who\u2019s been under that unflinching microscope for most of my life, I can tell you it\u2019s an uncomfortable place to be. But it\u2019s also fair that the public scrutinize individuals who their children idolize and emulate. The Kaiser Family Foundation survey concluded that famous athletes rank second (72%) behind parents (92%) as people children \u201clook up to or want to be like.\u201d Because of that important influence, we should be vigilant in who we promote as heroes. Hall of fame quarterback Joe Montana did some damage to that ideal when he told a reporter in 2015 that the Super Bowl winning 49ers were known to skirt the rules. \u201cThey always say, \u2018If you ain\u2019t cheating, you ain\u2019t trying.\u2019\u201d The New England Patriots\u2019 Deflategate saga didn\u2019t help, either. That\u2019s why we need to apply the same intense scrutiny to sports teams and their owners as we do to the individual players like Kaepernick and Reid. Sports is a major symbol of American values of fair play, sportsmanship, dedication, sacrifice, discipline, and teamwork. In many parts of the midwest and the south, high school football is America. But the NFL is putting all that in jeopardy when it refuses to take a leadership role in standing up for the constitution \u2013 and the rights of athletes like Reid and Kaepernick to protest peacefully \u2013 instead of cowering in the ticket booth counting money, afraid to offend people who place entertainment over ethics. Compromising the integrity of the sport teaches kids the wrong lesson, which is especially damaging when football is facing such a shaky future. The National Federation of High School Associations\u2019 recent survey, for example, showed a decade-long decline in football. Some of that decline can be attributed to fears over concussion, another topic in which the league has often failed to cover itself in glory. Even more significant is that professional football has a crisis of conscience \u2013 in that it doesn\u2019t really have one. The now familiar on-field patriotic displays and fighter jet flyovers are patriotism-for-hire: the military pays millions to have soldiers parade around the field and sing God Bless America before games. If it were authentic patriotism, wouldn\u2019t the NFL allow these displays to be made for free? And when the league does contribute to the community and social issues, it\u2019s usually to help smooth its image after bad publicity. Following the player backlash to the NFL punishing players who took a knee, the NFL and a group of about 40 players reached an agreement that the league would contribute $89m over seven years to fund projects dealing with criminal justice reform, law enforcement/community relations, and education. The NFL is like a naughty kid: is it sorry because it did wrong or because it got caught? But there are signs of hope that the league can be a force for good. In January, the NFL, in conjunction with the Players Coalition, launched a social justice platform called Inspire Change emphasizing education, economic development and community and police relations. They will be funding grassroots organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and Operation HOPE. Anna Isaacson, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of social responsibility, explained: \u201cThis launch involves grants, new African American history education programs in schools, grants with organizations we have not worked with before and who are doing the work on the ground, and PSAs on broadcasts.\u201d That\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction. I\u2019d like to see 2019 as the rebirth of the NFL as a vibrant leader in sports, dedicated to supporting the values of the country as expressed in the constitution rather than pandering to the narrow minds of those who mistake parochialism for patriotism. Playing to the dwindling core is a losing strategy, in politics and in football. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is an NBA hall of fame member and recipient of the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Pep said his team would \u201csuffer\u201d and in the first half they did. Newport gave them a few frights for sure. As for Laporte, his woeful header to gift Amond a goal will have done him no favours with Pep. Mahrez probably gave his manager a reminder of his different skillset to that of Sterling and Bernardo Silva, but both those players are probably simpler and more effective than the winger, who overplays at times.

They\u2019ve seen off the Met Police, Wrexham, Leicester and Middlesbrough to set up the juiciest of home ties with Manchester City in the fifth round. Romance is very much alive in this corner of south Wales. The brilliant thing about today\u2019s match is that even if Pep Guardiola plays an understrength team, it will still be capable of beating most sides in Europe, meaning that anything other than a City win will be considered a PROPER CUP SHOCK. </p> <p>However, the chances of seeing a PROPER CUP SHOCK are as slim as a pencil shaving on a diet, aren\u2019t they? City have put seven past Rotherham, nine past Burton and six past Chelsea in recent weeks. And while Newport boss Michael Flynn can be grateful he hasn\u2019t got David Luiz in his defence this evening, his side will have to be on it whatever the City XI. The pitch may be a leveller and Guardiola has even suggested there are things Newport can do better than his \u00a31bn squad, who will \u201csuffer\u201d at Rodney Parade.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anything can happen in one game, especially away from home. I\u2019ve seen Newport\u2019s last few games and they are incredible at set pieces and throw-ins. What they do, they do really well. They are taller and stronger than us and, in some areas, might be better than us, so we will have to make sure we play our own game and not theirs and focus on what we are good at. They have all been in this situation before, it is part of football and we will absolutely not be complaining about it. The players know what FA Cup football is about too, these sort of challenges arrive every year and we know they can be tricky. Last season at Wigan for instance I thought we played a decent game, but then we had a man sent off and when it was 10 v 11 they scored a late goal.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66783bb170eeb45a50661a7dd93ad1fc2d0ec53a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66783bb170eeb45a50661a7dd93ad1fc2d0ec53a/0_138_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodney Parade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola checks out the Rodney Parade pitch. Good enough?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> So Newport might want to pepper the City box with some inviting crosses early on given that Pep has admitted his team are more vertically-challenged, compared to the strapping but plucky hosts. In any case, Newport will need the backing of a raucous crowd at Rodney Parade if they\u2019re to ruffle the feathers of their illustrious visitors. If we are to see the upset of all upsets in this year\u2019s competition it will require a collective loss of focus by City \u2013 and Guardiola\u2019s sides very rarely do that, not when he\u2019s always within the eyeline of his players gesticulating wildly to get his instructions across. Expect goals. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/15/newport-county-inside-story-club-rose-dead-manchester-city-fa-cup\">Newport County: the inside story of a club that rose from the dead</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 5.30pm GMT</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-16T16:29:53.868Z\">at 4.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, I\u2019m going to leave you now. Here\u2019s Stuart James\u2019s match report from Rodney Parade. What an enjoyable Cup tie. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye. Pep Guardiola speaks: \u201cWell, it was a really tough game. They scored a goal \u2013 a stupid goal \u2013 at the end and Phil\u2019s goal helped the team to not suffer at the end. A big compliment to all the guys who played today. The first 15-20 minutes were difficult. The long throw-ins they were much, much better than us. But the last 50 minutes we were good. Winning here \u2013 I realise what English football is today \u2013 we are not used to these types of games. That is why the Cup is so difficult.\u201d It\u2019s Welsh football in an English competition Pep, but we know you mean well. Are all four trophies possible? \u201cEvery challenge is different. When you want to be in all competitions you have to adapt. And today we adapt and that helps us to grow as a team. The big mistake is that you believe you are better than the other team.\u201d Riyad Mahrez speaks: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to play here. Especially with the pitch. The most important thing is the victory. We played good and controlled the game. We are professionals and we have to be ready for anything. Everyone is happy to get through. We have to forgert the FA Cup and concentrate on the Champions League. We are just taking it game by game.\u201d And here\u2019s Phil Foden, who must have had a lovely lawn in his back garden when he was growing up: \u201cThat\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve played on. We had to keep the ball moving and they tired at the end. We scored straight away after they scored. It\u2019s a big squad and everyone wants to show the boss you can start.\u201d What a bizarre end to the game \u2013 a flurry of goals that didn\u2019t really reflect the shape of the game. Having said that, there were moments in the second half when City looked like they could have kicked on and scored more had they opted for the forward pass rather than the sideways one. Pep said his team would \u201csuffer\u201d and in the first half they did. Newport gave them a few frights for sure. As for Laporte, his woeful header to gift Amond a goal will have done him no favours with Pep. Mahrez probably gave his manager a reminder of his different skillset to that of Sterling and Bernardo Silva, but both those players are probably simpler and more effective than the winger, who overplays at times. Foden was impressive too. And that\u2019s that. A valiant effort from the League Two side. To go in at half-time at 0-0 was a shock in itself. But the City machine clicked into gear in the second half. The home fans at Rodney Parade give their players a raucous send-off after a fantastic Cup run that will have filled up the coffers but more importantly, given the team \u2013 and town \u2013 a huge boost. And that\u2019s just rubbing it in. Stones cuts a delicious right-footed pass back into the box and in behind Newport\u2019s defence for Mahrez, who takes one touch before rifling home at Day\u2019s near post. 90+3 min: \u2026 but smashes it into the wall and out for a corner. A corner that is played short. City hold on to possession and then \u2026 90+2 min: City win a free-kick 25 yards out in a central position. Sane stands over it \u2026 Spoil sports! Sane wins possession in midfield and pops the ball off to Foden. The youngster glides towards the edge of the box, cuts on to his left foot, and hammers a shot into the roof of the net. How dare you score Newport! Well, well, well. Poole hoiks a ball forwards, Laporte makes a hash of his header, trying to head it to Otamendi but finding Amond instead, who stabs a lovely finish over Ederson and into the net. Could they? 88 min: Nope. City break but Sane is flagged offside \u2026 87 min: Newport win a corner. Can they get a goal to remember the occasion by? 85 min: Sane has just stabbed the ball into Day\u2019s conk (again). Day should ask Sane to foot the bill if he needs any cosmetic adjustments to his beak after the match. And then Jesus has a pop at goal from 20 yards but day plucks it out of the air. 83 min: Newport clear and Amond gathers possession on the halfway line and turns and tries to run into the inside-right channel \u2026 but a pack of four City players hunt him down and retrieve the ball like dutiful dogs. That almost seemed unfair. That was incredible workrate from City in the transition, considering the nature of the game now. 82 min: Silva is off and Gundogan is on. Not a bad deputy. 80 min: Mahrez tries to find Jesus in behind the Newport defence but O\u2019Brien stretches out a tired limb and snuffs out the danger. He\u2019s been impressive here. 78 min: Fernandinho\u2019s evening\u2019s work is done. He\u2019s replaced by Laporte, which may mean Stones coming into midfield but second guessing Pep is about as pointless as storing water in a giant sieve. 77 min: Liverpool fans will be happy with this. City\u2019s schedule remains busier than Theresa May\u2019s. This is a lovely solo goal. Foden cleverly flicks the ball over Bennett in midfield and then delicately dribbles forwards to the edge of the area. Bennett faces him up but the youngster does a razor-sharp stepover and lashes a shot into Day\u2019s bottom left corner. Day gets a hand to it, but not a strong enough one. The tie\u2019s done. 71 min: Foden jumps into Bennett and gives a free-kick away. It\u2019s floated into the box, flicked on and headed straight at Ederson by O\u2019Brien. It was a difficult ball to get any power on. But Newport are still in this while there\u2019s just a goal in it. 69 min: Amond is set free down the inside-right channel after some neat interplay from Newport. Otamendi steams in to close the forward down and as they clash Amond\u2019s studs dig into the defender\u2019s ankle and leave him on the turf. It was a bright attack and an innocuous coming together. Otamendi will be OK. The magic sponge should sort that out. 68 min: Dolan is on for Labadie, who has put a shift and a half in for the home side. 65 min: Whoah! Ederson almost gifts Newport a goal, as the ball bobbles up off the pitch as he tries to join in the possession power-play and is closed down by Matt and Amond. He burst ahead of Matt to clear the ball, though. He made up for that error very quickly. 64 min: City are in total control now. Foden finds Mahrez, who finds Danilo, who finds Stones, who finds Otamendi etc and so on. Perhaps Pep has told his players to dominate possession and not go near a Newport player to limit the chance of picking up an injury. It would be peak Pep. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot too hard either, you could twang a hammy, lads.\u201d 61 min: Mahrez does about 99 stepovers in a display of skill that is more a dance act than a football move. He eventually cuts inside and should shoot with his left foot but adds another unnecessary dragback to his act and pings the ball wide with his right foot. Guardiola mutters something under his breath. \u201cBerk,\u201d perhaps. Newport make a change. Sheehan comes on in place of Bakinson, who almost gave Newport the lead in the first half. 59 min: Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop go the Manchester City passes. Then Fernandinho wallops the ball into O\u2019Brien and Newport break but Matt is quickly crowded out of it. 58 min: City are getting into the groove now. Danilo, who has been slick and threatening on the right, plays a one-two with Jesus and slams a shot off the near post. Day did well to spread himself and cover the angle, though. Newport need to stand firm here. 56 min: Danilo immediately tests Day with a left-footed sighter from 25 yards, making the keeper stretch low to his left to divert the ball around the post. He\u2019s alert enough, though, keeping the City lead at just a solitary goal. 54 min: Day requires a fair bit of treatment on his bust nose. It was a strange goal, like watching a boxer send a straight right through an opponent\u2019s guard. Day probably should have got his hands on the ball but the pace of the shot meant it breeched his palms and hit him square on the bridge of his nose. Oof! And then the bubble is burst! San\u00e9 and Jesus play a neat one-two on the left of the penalty area and San\u00e9 races in on goal. Day stands up tall and San\u00e9 smashes the ball at Day, the ball walloping the keeper in the nose and dropping into the goal behind him. Day\u2019s nose has been bloodied by that \u2013 and the home fans fall just a little quiet for the first time. 49 min: Amond flicks the ball on to Matt, who is put under pressure by Otamendi in the box. He holds the ball up diligently, though, and lays the ball off wide to Willmott. His low cross finds Amond, but he can\u2019t turn and shoot. Promising signs for Newport, though. 47 min: Newport are pinned back early on but they keep their wits about them and stay compact to keep City at bay. Then Poole strides out of midfield like a latterday Beckenbauer and causes a wild roar from the home fans. Newport work it out wide but City press and win back possession and then give it away. It\u2019s a bit of a scrappy start to this half. Newport will be very happy with that. 45 mins: The teams have just emerged to this. Oof! That\u2019ll get you going. No changes on either side. Right. We\u2019re almost ready for the second half. Newport looked a little tired towards the end of the first 45. Though I imagine the Newport masseuse is probably the most knackered member of staff at Rodney Parade at present. O\u2019Brien and Demetriou must be inhaling Vicks Vaporub like mad men as they pysche themselves up for this half. They need to do the same again. \u201cRe: 26 min: I can reassure Peter Oh that Newport is EXACTLY like he imagines it. But sadly, it\u2019s never recovered from the closing of TJs, rock club par excellence. The site of Kurt Cobain\u2019s proposal to Courtney Love (allegedly). If County can keep the score like this, it might be almost as impressive!\u201d whoops Matt Dony. Does that count as a Cup shock already? What an incredible effort by the League Two side to keep City at bay. They\u2019ve been heroic at the back and punchy up front on set-pieces \u2013exactly as Michael Flynn would have wanted them to be. Stay tuned. I\u2019ll be back shortly. Here\u2019s some half-time reading on another Welsh team: 44 min: Danilo spies a gap at Day\u2019s left-hand post and has a pop from 25 yards. The ball dips and curls towards goal and then drifts wide by a foot. Day was a little worried as that came fizzing in. 42 min: Silva\u2019s toes begin to twinkle, he cuts through Newport with a delicious pass to Foden that gives City some added impetus. And then after some neat interplay Silva looks set to fire on goal when O\u2019Brien stretches out a leg to clear the danger. A moment later, San\u00e9 dances into teh poenalty area and O\u2019brien (again!) hurls himself at the shot in the Colin Hendry-style (ask your parents, kids) to deny the German. On closer inspection the ball hit O\u2019Brien\u2019s arm. That would be given in the Premier League, I reckon. Mariner\u2019s been generous there. San\u00e9 didn\u2019t really appeal, though. 40 min: Some sloppiness has crept into City\u2019s play. First, Otamendi tries to play out from the back with a vertical pass that holds up on the pitch that Newport cut out. And when City pick up possession again Fernandinho puts too much beef on his pass forwards to Jesus. 38 min: I was just writing that it\u2019s not been an overly physical match and how Pep will be delighted with that, when Bennett clatters into Jesus from behind and leaves the centre-forward wincing. I think he\u2019s OK though. 36 min: The ball drops to Amond in the City box. He\u2019s under pressure and needs to take his shot early. He swivels and shoots towards the near post but he only half-connects with the ball and it\u2019s not bothering Ederson. 34 min: San\u00e9 plays a rapid-fire one-two with Silva and bursts into the box on the left. He looks up and watches Day go down early, firing high, but too high. The ball pings off the crossbar and out for a goal-kick. 32 min: After having been given the runaround for a few minutes Newport win a valuable free-kick and a breather. The ball is pinged over to Matt on the left wing. Newport keep possession admirably and are forced back to their keeper, but that\u2019s OK. 30 min: City are pop-pop-popping their way forwards with a little more urgency now. Silva tries to slalom his way into a shooting position on the left side of the penalty area but three Newport defenders hurry over like panicked firefighters to put out the flames of danger. 29 min: It\u2019s still goalless. Bravo Newport. 28 min: And then Zinchenko whips a brilliant left-footed cross into the corridor of uncertainty that Jesus is an inch away from connecting with. This Cup tie is great fun! 27 min: Another long throw from Newport and another nervy moment for City, as Ederson punches, unconvincingly, to the penalty spot, where City scramble clear. Has Rory Delap been coaching Newport this week? 26 min: \u201cGreetings from Northern California!\u201d chirps Peter Oh. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Newport but have an idea of what the city might be like, based on a couple of cultural references. Ok, so a parody video of the Jay-Z &amp; Alicia Keys song, and a Manic Street Preachers tune may not provide the most accurate picture, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got! In any case, the photos of Pep Guardiola inspecting the pitch are priceless. It looks like he was fully expecting to find shards of glass and mole burrows.\u201d Or an overturned shopping trolley. 22 min: Mahrez looks like a player with a point to prove. He\u2019s not started for City in the Premier League in 2019 and he\u2019s trying his hardest to force his way into Guardiola\u2019s thoughts here. This time he gathers possession on the edge of the box , rolls the ball out of his feet and whips a low shot towards the bottom corner that\u2019s a yard wide. He might be trying a bit too hard, actually. Cool it. 20 min: Mahrez ghosts into the box on the right and drills a low shot towards the far post that Day does well to palm away. It\u2019s Newport who react quickest, though, and the League Two side clear the danger. 19 min: Newport create another chance from a long throw. Matt flicks the ball against Danilo, who turns and watches in horror as Labadie cocks the trigger but wallops a shot from 12 yards wide. He was under pressure, in his defence. But what an effort this is by Newport. 18 min: Silva pops the ball off to Fernandinho on the edge of the Newport box. He looks to his right and sees Mahrez is covered. So he whacks a hopeless shot wide instead. Rather impatient that. 17 min: City look comfortable enough in possession but the pitch just look a little on the stodgy side and I think it\u2019s taking some of the zip out of their play. They\u2019re a little slower going forwards than they usually are. 14 min: And Ederson has just used that agility to deny Newport from going 1-0 up! What a save this is! A long throw is flicked on to Bakinson. The ball bounces in front of him and the midfielder nods the ball at the corner only to see Ederson, at full stretch, claw the ball away. A wonderful stop. One Banks would be proud of. We have a Cup tie all right! 13 min: Nope. Butler fails to beat the first man. City can break but Jesus is robbed of possession and Matt has a sniff of a chance but Ederson snuffs it out by racing off his line. What an alert stopper he is. As well as being incredible on the floor, like Gordon Banks, he\u2019s an agile and keeper too. 12 min: Newport win a corner! A roar goes up from the home crowd. Can they? 10 min: City are hogging the ball like a team that have had \u00a31bn invested in them. Funny that. Then Fernandinho of all people decides he\u2019s had enough of all this possession, drilling a shot a yard wide from just outside the area. 9 min: Mahrez twists O\u2019Brien this way and that and leaves him behind as he heads for the touchline. He looks up and drills a cross-shot at goal that Day tips away for a throw-in on the far side. Some lovely trickery by the City winger there, though. 7 min: City dominate possession for a minute but then the ball gets caught behind Silva and his pass is cut out in Newport\u2019s half. Poole does well under pressure to knock a ball down the line that Amond hares in to behind Otamendi. He dribbles into the box but is crowded out as Stones get back to cover. 6 min: Jesus flicks the corner on at the near post and Newport clear. No alarms so far. The home side are doing better than Hyde in 1887. 5 min: City finally get on the ball and after some slick passing on the right they win a corner. Set pieces are supposed to be the area Newport are stronger than City in. 3 min: Demetriou curls a testing cross towards the back post that Ederson stretches to pluck out of the air. More positive signs for Newport. 2 min: Poole chases a long ball down the right and it needs an alert Ederson to race off his line and wallop the ball out of play and possibly out of the ground. That\u2019s a promising start for the home side. 1 min: Newport, in their amber strip, get the game under way. They\u2019re shooting left to right on my screen. So imagine that if you will. City, in dark blue shirts and shorts with luminous yellow socks, are going the other way. Before we kick off, Gordon Banks is remembered fondly at Rodney Parade. Both sets of supporters give the brilliant goalkeeper and lovely man a warm round of applause, as do the players. \u201cEngland\u2019s NO1\u201d is chanted loudly too. Lovely stuff. A dismissive tweet for sure: It\u2019s Magic of the Cup time! The teams emerge from the tunnel into a riotous din at Rodney Parade, the noise pure bouncing around the compact little stadium in south-east Wales. What a night for Newport! City\u2019s players have their poker faces on, they\u2019re in the zone. Some of Newport\u2019s players, however, betray just a little astonishment at the sight before them. They\u2019ve had some famous nights here in recent years but this one must have caused the butterflies to flutter around their stomachs more than any other. Ian Kay is glad that a certain Argentinian is playing: \u201cI\u2019ve never said this before, but I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re playing Otamendi \u2013 it sounds like his sort of game.\u201d Are you sure? He loves to race out to connect with a high ball, miss it, and then play catch up. Mind you, he doesn\u2019t do that as often these days. He doesn\u2019t start as often either. Matt Rayner is having none of this plucky Newport talk: \u201cWhen all of Wales and England are against us, it\u2019s lucky for us that we have one nation funding us. So surely that\u2019s two against one. City are the underdogs.\u201d Pep speaks: \u201cIn three or four days we have a Champions League game and then a Cup final. We have to remember what we have done, the good and the bad things, in the past. Newport play a different game [to Wigan, who knocked them out last season]. We are a different team to then.\u201d Boos rain down on the City players as they make their way off the pitch after limbering up on the Rodney Parade turf. And then the partisan home fans launch into some lusty chants of their own. They\u2019re right up for this. It\u2019s going to be a fierce atmosphere come kick-off. Ian Sargeant, like most neutrals, is wearing Newport County amber tonight: \u201cHaving seen them kick off their Cup run at my local team, Met Police, and with them outlasting my own team (West Ham) I\u2019ve adopted them as my Cup team. A couple of the local scrotes ee-yored the Newport centre half (Franks) for a lot of the game. I\u2019d love it (love it Keegan styley) if he came off the bench to bury the winner, and yelled Eee-yor into the cameras \u2026\u201d Even if City put a truckload of goals past Newport this evening they will have to go some way to better the biggest ever FA Cup win. We have to go back to 15 October 1887 for that, when Preston beat Hyde by just the 26 goals to nil. Yes, 26-0! Did Hyde spend the afternoon in the pub or go on strike in the 1st minute? That\u2019s a goal every three-and-a-bit minutes! Millwall join Watford and Brighton in the quarter-finals. They\u2019ve beaten Wimbledon 1-0. Of course, Wales has played host to one of the biggest ever FA Cup shocks. Step forward Wrexham in January 1992 who, like Newport, were in the fourth tier when they shot down the Gunners. Arsenal, like City, were the reigning league champions at the time. Mickey Thomas scored a belting free-kick in a famous 2-1 win at the Racecourse Ground. Oh, and get well soon Mickey. Here\u2019s what the Newport manager, Michael Flynn, has to say having just seen that City lineup: \u201cThat just goes to show how much respect Pep Guardiola has not just for us but for City fans too. We want to put on a show and stop them. I think it would be [the biggest Cup upset ever] because of the finances in the game and the level they are playing at.\u201d On the pitch, which looks pretty good to me from the few shots I have seen: \u201c I want football to be played the right way. The people of Newport deserve to see how good these players can be. Not just City players but our lot too. This day is for our fans too. It\u2019s a one-off but who knows?\u201d Flynn has made two changes from last Tuesday\u2019s 1-0 defeat at MK Dons but his team is the same as the one that beat Middlesbrough. so that means starting spots for on-loan Manchester United defender Regan Poole and strike duo Jamille Matt and Padraig Amond. Newport County: Day, Butler, Demetrio, O\u2019Brien, Bennett, Poole, Bakinson, Labadie, Willmott, Matt, Amond: Subs: Townsend, Pipe, Franks, Dolan, Marsh-Brown, Sheehan, McKirdy. Manchester City: Ederson, Zinchenko, Stones, Otamendi, Danilo, Fernandinho, Sane, Silva (C), Foden, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Muric, Laporte, Walker, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Sterling, Bernardo Silva. Referee: Andre Mariner. Yeah, not bad that City team. Seven changes but, bloody hell, that\u2019s strong. Danilo, Nicolas Otamendi, Phil Foden, David Silva, Leroy Sane, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus come in. Evening. Newport have had a magical Cup run so far. They\u2019ve seen off the Met Police, Wrexham, Leicester and Middlesbrough to set up the juiciest of home ties with Manchester City in the fifth round. Romance is very much alive in this corner of south Wales. The brilliant thing about today\u2019s match is that even if Pep Guardiola plays an understrength team, it will still be capable of beating most sides in Europe, meaning that anything other than a City win will be considered a PROPER CUP SHOCK. However, the chances of seeing a PROPER CUP SHOCK are as slim as a pencil shaving on a diet, aren\u2019t they? City have put seven past Rotherham, nine past Burton and six past Chelsea in recent weeks. And while Newport boss Michael Flynn can be grateful he hasn\u2019t got David Luiz in his defence this evening, his side will have to be on it whatever the City XI. The pitch may be a leveller and Guardiola has even suggested there are things Newport can do better than his \u00a31bn squad, who will \u201csuffer\u201d at Rodney Parade. Anything can happen in one game, especially away from home. I\u2019ve seen Newport\u2019s last few games and they are incredible at set pieces and throw-ins. What they do, they do really well. They are taller and stronger than us and, in some areas, might be better than us, so we will have to make sure we play our own game and not theirs and focus on what we are good at. They have all been in this situation before, it is part of football and we will absolutely not be complaining about it. The players know what FA Cup football is about too, these sort of challenges arrive every year and we know they can be tricky. Last season at Wigan for instance I thought we played a decent game, but then we had a man sent off and when it was 10 v 11 they scored a late goal. So Newport might want to pepper the City box with some inviting crosses early on given that Pep has admitted his team are more vertically-challenged, compared to the strapping but plucky hosts. In any case, Newport will need the backing of a raucous crowd at Rodney Parade if they\u2019re to ruffle the feathers of their illustrious visitors. If we are to see the upset of all upsets in this year\u2019s competition it will require a collective loss of focus by City \u2013 and Guardiola\u2019s sides very rarely do that, not when he\u2019s always within the eyeline of his players gesticulating wildly to get his instructions across. Expect goals. Kick-off: 5.30pm GMT",

Support for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal remains low after the prime minister\u2019s latest Commons defeat on Thursday. Only 12% think May\u2019s EU withdrawal deal is good, while 48% think it is bad. Half (51%) of voters who backed the Tories in 2017 think their MPs should back the deal, down from 55% two weeks ago. The public remains deeply divided over what should happen if MPs cannot agree a Brexit deal. While 42% think Brexit should be delayed and a public vote held, the same proportion think Britain should simply leave the EU with no deal in March. If a referendum was held between remaining in the EU and leaving on the terms of May\u2019s deal, 46% would vote to remain while 35% would vote for the deal. Expectation that Britain will leave with a deal has remained consistent over the past fortnight, with 21% thinking it is the most likely outcome. More than a third (36%) believe we will leave without a deal, while a quarter (24%) think Britain will not leave the EU in March. Opinium polled 2,005 adults online between 13 February and 15 February.",

I\u2019m just trying to do good for me. I love pole vaulting and I love the feeling of flying.\u201d There was a world record in the men\u2019s 1500m as the 19-year-old Ethiopian Samuel Tefera won a sprint finish against his compatriot Yomif Kejelcha to beat Hicham El Guerrouj\u2019s mark and win in 3.31.04. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Tefera.",

Tim has served his sentence, worked redemptively and no one should be forever and a day punished.\u201d Galvin\u2019s partner, Bobbie-Joe Woods, said she worried about her partner\u2019s mental health, and her children, aged between five and 13, were struggling with the situation. \u201cIt has a lot of effects on us. We\u2019ve already been waiting more than two years for him to get out of jail,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just want their dad back\u201d Labor senator, Patrick Dodson, said the case demonstrated \u201ca lack of understanding of the unique status of First Nations peoples and their relationship with Australian citizenship\u201d, and noted the disproportionately high rates of incarceration among Indigenous people. \u201cFrom representations made to my office, I understand that Mr Galvin has clear ties to Australia and faces significant impediments should he be deported to New Zealand \u2013 a country he demonstrably has no ties to,\u201d Dodson told Guardian Australia. \u201cI am concerned that this matter does not properly consider Mr Galvin\u2019s ties to Australia and that his Aboriginality is more than simply lineage, and includes connection to country, community and culture.\u201d It is not the first time the Australian government has attempted to deport someone of Indigenous heritage. Previous cases have gone to the high court, notably Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms, who are are seeking damages. Similarly to Galvin, both men were told shortly before their planned release from jail that they would instead be going to immigration detention. Both were born overseas but have lived in Australia since they were young children. Both have an Aboriginal parent. Love, who was born in Papua New Guinea, has an Aboriginal father. His visa was reinstated after 40 days of detention, the ABC reported, but Thoms is still in detention. Georgatos said his organisation was supporting another eight families in similar predicaments to Galvin\u2019s. The home affairs department said it does not comment on individual cases.",

Privately, players are dismayed at the way the club is being run and feel disappointed for the manager, Graham Potter, as much as themselves. Leroy Fer, the captain, was so frustrated with the prospect of Daniel James leaving in January that \u2013 and this was before the deadline-day fiasco when the plug was pulled on the winger\u2019s move to Leeds at the last minute \u2013 he telephoned Swansea\u2019s American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, to ask what was going on.</p> \n<p>Perhaps at this stage it is worth pointing out to anyone who has taken a break from football for the past three years that Swansea, who host Brentford in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday, are no longer the model club they once were. Huw Jenkins, who was a hero when he presided over Swansea\u2019s rise through the leagues, was cast as a villain by the time he resigned as chairman a fortnight ago, and the supporters trust is engaged in a bitter legal dispute with those who sold their shares to the Americans in 2016.</p> \n<p>As for Kaplan and Levien, it has been a disastrous two and a half seasons under their watch and the harsh reality is that the wording on the cover of the latest edition of the <em>Swansea Oh Swansea</em> fanzine probably sums up how the vast majority of supporters feel about them: \u201cGet out of our club\u201d.</p> \n<p>Physically, they are rarely in it. Decisions are made from the other side of the Atlantic and apart from appointing Potter, who had previously guided Ostersund from the fourth to the top tier of Swedish football, it is hard to think of much else Kaplan and Levien have got right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The strategy since relegation has been cuts, cuts and more cuts. Or, to borrow the Americans\u2019 phrase, \u201chard medicine\u201d. Sixteen senior players have left and only five have arrived. When the summer transfer window closed, Potter was left with one senior central defender after two were sold on deadline day.</p> \n<p>Backed into a corner, Potter has relied on youngsters to such an extent that Swansea, who spent seven seasons in the top flight and were relegated from the Premier League nine months ago, are fielding a team in the Championship that, in terms of the age of their players, resembles that of a club operating on a shoestring in League Two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0fa4856f2b82c5bae37616f93fdee3140639752f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fa4856f2b82c5bae37616f93fdee3140639752f/245_87_1787_2830/631.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Ayew is one of Swansea\u2019s high-earners now out on loan.\" width=\"631\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Ayew is one of Swansea\u2019s high-earners now out on loan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before this weekend\u2019s matches \u2013 and this is an extraordinary statistic \u2013 players aged 23 and under had racked up 17,357 minutes for Swansea in the Championship this season \u2013 the third-highest total by the 72 Football League clubs, behind Yeovil and Swindon with Crewe fourth on the list. The two other clubs relegated from the Premier League last season, West Brom and Stoke, are 65th (5,101 minutes) and 71st (2,717 minutes) respectively.</p> \n<p>The primary factor in all of this is that Swansea are in a dire position financially, paying the price for a wage bill that was allowed to spiral out of control over the course of several years and a series of calamitous signings during their last season in the Premier League in particular. Each party will cite mitigating circumstances but the reality is that Jenkins and the owners \u2013 not one or the other \u2013 have their fingerprints on that mess.</p> \n<p>It is sobering to think that the best part of \u00a345m was wasted on Sam Clucas, Wilfried Bony and Andr\u00e9 Ayew last season, and \u00a325m on wages, loan fees and transfer fees for Renato Sanches, Tammy Abraham and Roque Mesa. Swansea wrote off millions when they sold Clucas to Stoke in that deadline day fire sale in August. Bony was earning \u00a34.5m a year in the Championship until a heavily subsidised loan move was agreed in January \u2013 the Ivorian had no relegation clause in his contract \u2013 while no permanent buyer could be found for Ayew last summer.</p> \n<p>Bony and Ayew, incidentally, were August and January deadline-day signings last season. For an image of Swansea\u2019s approach to transfers during that turbulent campaign, picture a bloke dashing down Oxford Street as the shops prepare to close on Christmas Eve, buying the wrong present for his wife and overpaying at the same time. Then later finding out nobody else wants it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Worryingly for Swansea, Ayew, who is on loan at Fenerbahce, will still have two years to run on a lucrative contract when this season is over. Borja Bast\u00f3n, who was the \u00a315.5m club-record signing until Ayew rejoined from West Ham, is also out on loan \u2013 the Spaniard has started four league games for Swansea in three years \u2013 and under contract until 2020. Jordan Ayew, Jefferson Montero and Tom Carroll, on loan at Crystal Palace, West Brom and Aston Villa respectively, also have deals that run for another 16 months. The same applies to Nathan Dyer and Kyle Naughton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/04/swansea-oli-mcburnie-scotland-socks-shin-pads-interview\">Swansea\u2019s Oli McBurnie: \u2018I wear toddlers\u2019 shin pads, the smallest I can find\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All of which means that as much as Swansea want to press the reset button, they cannot leave the pain of their financial profligacy in the Premier League behind, and that has damaging ramifications for Potter. It is understood there is another \u00a330m hole to fill in the summer, even allowing for a second parachute payment, and it is hard to see how selling the players listed above \u2013 if buyers can be found \u2013 would make much of a dent in that figure.</p> \n<p>With Swansea\u2019s owners unwilling or unable to put any money in themselves to cover that shortfall \u2013 \u201cWe will be relentless in our determination to continually improve this club, and we have the financial resources to do so\u201d was the dubious claim made by Kaplan and Levien after they became majority shareholders \u2013 the concern is that Potter will have to sell one or more of the youngsters who have thrived under him and played with the sort of hunger and passion that restores the faith of supporters.</p> \n<p>It is remarkable then that despite all this doom and gloom, the off-field distractions and the clear sense that things could get worse at Swansea before they get better, Potter continues to diligently go about his work, refusing to sound downbeat and remaining totally committed to the job that he took on last summer. He is the glue holding a broken club together.</p>",

Privately, players are dismayed at the way the club is being run and feel disappointed for the manager, Graham Potter, as much as themselves. Leroy Fer, the captain, was so frustrated with the prospect of Daniel James leaving in January that \u2013 and this was before the deadline-day fiasco when the plug was pulled on the winger\u2019s move to Leeds at the last minute \u2013 he telephoned Swansea\u2019s American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, to ask what was going on. Perhaps at this stage it is worth pointing out to anyone who has taken a break from football for the past three years that Swansea, who host Brentford in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday, are no longer the model club they once were. Huw Jenkins, who was a hero when he presided over Swansea\u2019s rise through the leagues, was cast as a villain by the time he resigned as chairman a fortnight ago, and the supporters trust is engaged in a bitter legal dispute with those who sold their shares to the Americans in 2016. As for Kaplan and Levien, it has been a disastrous two and a half seasons under their watch and the harsh reality is that the wording on the cover of the latest edition of the Swansea Oh Swansea fanzine probably sums up how the vast majority of supporters feel about them: \u201cGet out of our club\u201d. Physically, they are rarely in it. Decisions are made from the other side of the Atlantic and apart from appointing Potter, who had previously guided Ostersund from the fourth to the top tier of Swedish football, it is hard to think of much else Kaplan and Levien have got right. The strategy since relegation has been cuts, cuts and more cuts. Or, to borrow the Americans\u2019 phrase, \u201chard medicine\u201d. Sixteen senior players have left and only five have arrived. When the summer transfer window closed, Potter was left with one senior central defender after two were sold on deadline day. Backed into a corner, Potter has relied on youngsters to such an extent that Swansea, who spent seven seasons in the top flight and were relegated from the Premier League nine months ago, are fielding a team in the Championship that, in terms of the age of their players, resembles that of a club operating on a shoestring in League Two. Before this weekend\u2019s matches \u2013 and this is an extraordinary statistic \u2013 players aged 23 and under had racked up 17,357 minutes for Swansea in the Championship this season \u2013 the third-highest total by the 72 Football League clubs, behind Yeovil and Swindon with Crewe fourth on the list. The two other clubs relegated from the Premier League last season, West Brom and Stoke, are 65th (5,101 minutes) and 71st (2,717 minutes) respectively. The primary factor in all of this is that Swansea are in a dire position financially, paying the price for a wage bill that was allowed to spiral out of control over the course of several years and a series of calamitous signings during their last season in the Premier League in particular. Each party will cite mitigating circumstances but the reality is that Jenkins and the owners \u2013 not one or the other \u2013 have their fingerprints on that mess. It is sobering to think that the best part of \u00a345m was wasted on Sam Clucas, Wilfried Bony and Andr\u00e9 Ayew last season, and \u00a325m on wages, loan fees and transfer fees for Renato Sanches, Tammy Abraham and Roque Mesa. Swansea wrote off millions when they sold Clucas to Stoke in that deadline day fire sale in August. Bony was earning \u00a34.5m a year in the Championship until a heavily subsidised loan move was agreed in January \u2013 the Ivorian had no relegation clause in his contract \u2013 while no permanent buyer could be found for Ayew last summer. Bony and Ayew, incidentally, were August and January deadline-day signings last season. For an image of Swansea\u2019s approach to transfers during that turbulent campaign, picture a bloke dashing down Oxford Street as the shops prepare to close on Christmas Eve, buying the wrong present for his wife and overpaying at the same time. Then later finding out nobody else wants it. Worryingly for Swansea, Ayew, who is on loan at Fenerbahce, will still have two years to run on a lucrative contract when this season is over. Borja Bast\u00f3n, who was the \u00a315.5m club-record signing until Ayew rejoined from West Ham, is also out on loan \u2013 the Spaniard has started four league games for Swansea in three years \u2013 and under contract until 2020. Jordan Ayew, Jefferson Montero and Tom Carroll, on loan at Crystal Palace, West Brom and Aston Villa respectively, also have deals that run for another 16 months. The same applies to Nathan Dyer and Kyle Naughton. All of which means that as much as Swansea want to press the reset button, they cannot leave the pain of their financial profligacy in the Premier League behind, and that has damaging ramifications for Potter. It is understood there is another \u00a330m hole to fill in the summer, even allowing for a second parachute payment, and it is hard to see how selling the players listed above \u2013 if buyers can be found \u2013 would make much of a dent in that figure. With Swansea\u2019s owners unwilling or unable to put any money in themselves to cover that shortfall \u2013 \u201cWe will be relentless in our determination to continually improve this club, and we have the financial resources to do so\u201d was the dubious claim made by Kaplan and Levien after they became majority shareholders \u2013 the concern is that Potter will have to sell one or more of the youngsters who have thrived under him and played with the sort of hunger and passion that restores the faith of supporters. It is remarkable then that despite all this doom and gloom, the off-field distractions and the clear sense that things could get worse at Swansea before they get better, Potter continues to diligently go about his work, refusing to sound downbeat and remaining totally committed to the job that he took on last summer. He is the glue holding a broken club together.",

      "bodyText": "Championship West Brom did the damage in the five minutes before the break to stay firmly in the promotion hunt with a 2-0 win at Midlands rivals Aston Villa. Hal Robson-Kanu headed the Baggies in front in the 41st minute before Jay Rodriguez added a second moments later to ensure Darren Moore\u2019s side made the short trip home with all three points. Villa are now seven points off the final play-off place. In the early game debutant Dominic Iorfa was the Sheffield Wednesday hero as he scored a dramatic equaliser in the 10th minute of added time to earn a point at Rotherham. The on-loan Wolves man equalised with the final kick before his teammate Fernando Forestieri added to the chaotic finale by getting himself sent off for going into the crowd during the celebrations. Forestieri had earlier put Wednesday ahead before goals from Jon Taylor and Richie Towell looked set to give the Millers a win. Sheffield United pumped Reading 4-0 at Bramall Lane to go second behind Norwich, who themselves won 4-0 at Bolton. Gary Madine got two before half-time after Kieron Freeman gave the Blades the lead, with John Fleck adding the fourth just after the break. At Portman Road, Ipswich\u2019s January loan signing Will Keane left it very late to atone for Jonas Knudson\u2019s mistake that allowed James McClean to put Stoke ahead. Keane\u2019s added-time strike gave the Tractor Boys a point that saw them gain ground on Bolton and Reading above them. There were no goals at Deepdale as Preston North End and Nottingham Forest played out a draw. League One Luton\u2019s unbeaten run is now at 20 games and showed know sign of ending at Fleetwood. Two quick-fire goals just before half-time from George Moncur and Pelly Ruddock set Mick Harford\u2019s side en route for three points with Paddy Madden\u2019s added-time effort little more than a consolation by that point. Earlier, promotion chasers Portsmouth saw their bid to catch Barnsley in second place suffer a blow at Roots Hall as Simon Cox\u2019s hat-trick salvaged a point for Southend who trailed 3-0 after half an hour. Barnsley took advantage of Pompey\u2019s earlier slip to make the gap five points with Cauley Woodrow getting both goals, one from the spot, to dispatch mid-table Wycombe 2-1. There was late drama at Oakwell as Adam El-Abd was sent off before Joe Jacobson scored a penalty in the 100th minute. Goals from Amadou Bakayoko, Jordy Hiwula and Bright Enobakhare saw Coventry dispatch Walsall 3-0 at the Ricoh Arena. Ivan Toney\u2019s goal was enough to give Peterborough a 1-0 win at Oxford and keep them in touch teams in the play-off sides. Gillingham gave themselves some breathing room at the other end of the table with a Mark Byrne strike on the half hour giving them all three points against Scunthorpe. There was a draw with a goal for each side between Shrewsbury and Burton. There were scoreless stalemates at Valley Parade, where Bradford welcomed Plymouth, and at the Valley as Charlton hosted Blackpool. League Two Stevenage\u2019s Ilias Chair denied Lincoln City the opportunity to stretch their lead at the top of League Two with the QPR loanee\u2019s 94th-minute equaliser adding to his strike seven minutes prior to complete a comeback from 2-0 down and snatch a point. The Imps\u2019 unbeaten league run stretches to nine games but not in the manner they would have hoped. Notts County\u2019s survival hopes got a major boost as Craig Mackail-Smith\u2019s first goal since October earned a battling home victory over Mansfield in front of 12,660 fans at Meadow Lane. The Stags fall to third, four points behind leaders Lincoln and now trail Bury by two after Nicky Maynard\u2019s goal gave the Shakers victory at Exeter. In the battle of the play-off hopefuls Carlisle ran MK Dons close but Hallam Hope\u2019s 90th-minute strike was not enough to spark a late rally as the visitors held on for a 3-2 win. Forest Green moved up to fifth by dispatching struggling Yeovil. Mark Cooper\u2019s side were 3-0 up before the hour. Staying at the bottom of the table, Morecambe bagged a vital three points on the road at Port Vale, Aaron Collins got the only goal of the game. It was the same scoreline at Blundell Park where Grimsby beat Cheltenham. Macclesfield drew 1-1 at home with Colchester, as did Oldham with Crewe. Cambridge and Tranmere played out a goalless draw.",

Aged 19, he joined the US army as a medic and served 11 months in Iraq, returning with what a forensic psychiatrist later described as one of the worst cases of PTSD he\u2019d ever seen. Walker developed a heroin addiction and in 2011 began robbing banks, carrying out 10 heists in four months before he was arrested and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Now, with less than two years left on his sentence, he has published <em>Cherry</em>, a novel partly based on his experiences, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/nico-walker-is-a-convicted-bank-robber-cherry-proves-hes-also-a-must-read-author/2018/08/13/fcfff502-9b30-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.d20ea287638f\" title=\"\">the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/nico-walker-is-a-convicted-bank-robber-cherry-proves-hes-also-a-must-read-author/2018/08/13/fcfff502-9b30-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.d20ea287638f\" title=\"\"> Washington Post </a></em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/nico-walker-is-a-convicted-bank-robber-cherry-proves-hes-also-a-must-read-author/2018/08/13/fcfff502-9b30-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.d20ea287638f\" title=\"\">called</a> \u201ca miracle of literary serendipity, a triumph\u2026 his prose echoes Ernest Hemingway\u2019s cadences to powerful effect\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What prompted you to start writing?</strong><br>Matthew Johnson, who co-owns Tyrant Books, read a [2013] BuzzFeed article about me. We started talking and he told me I should write a book about my experiences. I wasn\u2019t so eager to do it, because a lot of the stuff touched raw nerves. But he convinced me, so I went at it one step at a time. I definitely didn\u2019t want to write a non-fiction memoir.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong><br>Legally, I didn\u2019t think that I could.

I\u2019d work on a typewriter in the law library, shoulder to shoulder with people. After a while, I\u2019d get up really early when everyone was still asleep.</p> <p><strong>Were the prison authorities supportive?</strong><br>I don\u2019t think they were aware that I was writing it.

The military parts are the ones that most closely mirror my experience. But even then, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s quite different.</p> <p><strong>Iraq turns out to be </strong><strong>much worse than your narrator is prepared for. It\u2019s a really tough section to read.</strong><br>It was something I didn\u2019t want to lie about. I needed to show it for how it really was and dispel any myths. It was a pretty bad experience. We had been told there was this existential threat [to the Iraqis] we were supposed to prevent and it turned out to not be the case. Going there, you find out you\u2019re the problem. It seemed like we were trying to provoke as much fighting as we could.</p> <p><strong>Do you believe that aggressive approach was sanctioned higher up?</strong><br>I can\u2019t really say. Maybe the people who were making the policy knew that was how it happened and counted on it. Definitely I feel personally culpable. I don\u2019t want to give this wrong idea that I was some kind of pacifist or observer \u2013 I was an active participant. [In the 2013 Buzzfeed article, Walker describes raiding houses and participating in combat missions during which innocent Iraqis were killed.] Maybe not to extremes, but I certainly didn\u2019t try to ever stop anything and I endorsed whatever was going on just by being there.

I never went around telling people I had this thing and I never felt vindicated. But it was nice to have someone acknowledge at least the possibility that I wasn\u2019t just some sort of antisocial, sociopathic person.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re not citing PTSD as an explanation or excuse for what happened in the years after you came back from Iraq \u2013 the drug taking, the bank robbing?</strong><br>Well, I was a criminal before Iraq. I used to sell marijuana. I\u2019d broken into a house or two. So I had that aspect. But when I was arrested, I couldn\u2019t understand what the big deal was. I was a little bit out of my mind at the time. Compared with what I\u2019d been doing in Iraq, robbing banks seemed like kids\u2019 stuff. Obviously it was wrong; I realise this now.</p> <p><strong>To what extent has writing helped you deal with all this?</strong><br>A lot. [Iraq] used to be something I couldn\u2019t think about without getting very upset. I\u2019d be back there and it would be very intense. I\u2019d get in a real excited state. You\u2019d have some despair after that. Nowadays, it doesn\u2019t seem like my life any more \u2013 it seems like somebody else\u2019s. It\u2019s not even something I think about.</p> <p><strong>Now </strong><strong>you\u2019ve published a book, with </strong><strong>a couple of years left on your sentence, how do you feel about the future?</strong><br>I feel all right about it. I\u2019ve caught a really good break and I\u2019m going to try to continue writing. Having the possibility of a career, having money, having motivation, having a purpose, a reason for getting out of bed... a lot of these guys here don\u2019t have that. For them, getting out of jail is just going to be when a whole new set of problems start and I\u2019m lucky that\u2019s not the case for me so much.</p> <p><strong>What have you been reading and what will you read next?</strong><br>The last good thing I read was <em>Cockfighter</em> by Charles Willeford.

Wearing trainers and light jackets, they were ill-prepared for the challenge. They were also unfazed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/08/man-dies-hypothermia-france-italy-derman-tamimou-togo\" title=\"\">the fate of Derman Tamimou</a>, a 29-year-old from Togo who died of hypothermia after embarking on the same journey the week before.</p> <p>Each of them recounted traumatic past experiences.

Sami had heard that there might be another trail. \u201cWe have to try to make a life for ourselves \u2013 there is nothing for us in Italy. There is no work, and if you try to get documents, they block you.\u201d</p> <p>Staying in Italy has become increasingly difficult since the country\u2019s rightwing populist government enacted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/vulnerable-migrants-made-homeless-after-italy-passes-salvini-decree\" title=\"\">hardline immigration measures</a>. Many now making their way to Claviere are among those made homeless after being evicted from refugee centres across Italy in recent months as a result of the new law.</p> <p>Named after Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister, the law abolishes Italy\u2019s humanitarian protection permit. The two-year permit, which was given to those who were not eligible for refugee status but who for various reasons could not be sent home, enabled people to find work and was renewable. The document also allowed people to cross into other EU states, on condition of prior notification to Italian authorities, and stay for up to 90 days. It had been granted to an estimated 100,000 people who had arrived in Italy in recent years.</p> <p>Paolo De Marchis, the mayor of Oulx, said there had been an increase in arrivals in the town since a draft version of the law was published in September. \u201cSome had been applying for protection but were afraid of not getting it and so escaped from the centres,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers have come since losing their protection. They arrive with the sole objective of reaching the French border. They are convinced things there will be better. The reality is, they get rejected at the border.\u201d</p> <p>Italy\u2019s loudest complaint against France is the turning back of thousands of migrants at the French border. The strictest controls are in place at the frontier that divides the French Riviera from Italy\u2019s Liguria region, near the city of Ventimiglia. During the first half of 2018, French authorities said they sent back more than 10,500 people who tried to cross by train, or by walking along the motorway or through the mountains.</p> <p>Charities have accused French police of using heavy-handed tactics against migrants, including the use of pepper spray, as well as mistreating children and falsifying their birth dates on \u201crefusal of entry\u201d documents so they could pass them off as adults and send them back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c0749bd235420f02725c6db80602d39a049e8fb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0749bd235420f02725c6db80602d39a049e8fb0/0_203_3072_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matteo Salvini was instrumental in a new law denying a form of humanitarian permit to migrants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matteo Salvini was instrumental in a new law denying a form of humanitarian permit to migrants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Italy also argues that French police often flout border rules. Last April, the government summoned the French ambassador after police barged into a clinic for migrants set up by a charity, Rainbow for Africa, at the train station in Bardonecchia, one stop after Oulx, and forced a Nigerian man suspected of carrying drugs to provide a urine sample. The test was negative.</p> <p>Meanwhile Salvini, who also leads the far-right League party, branded France a \u201cdisgrace\u201d in October after evidence emerged of French police \u201cdumping\u201d migrants by the side of a road in Claviere instead of bringing them to the authorities and declaring why they were being returned. Technically, after crossing into another EU state, migrants have the right to have their cases for asylum heard. The French government admitted to an \u201cerror\u201d but argued that countries needed to be more efficient in expelling illegal immigrants.</p> <p>\u201cSalvini celebrated that discovery, but it had been happening for a year,\u201d said Davide Rostan, a local priest in the Susa Valley.</p> <p>The revelation was the ammunition Salvini needed against France, but he is playing a similar game by sending boat migrants back across the Mediterranean to Libya. Last week he boasted about how his tough measures had led to a significant drop in migrants arriving, while at the same time expulsions had increased. In reality, those \u201cexpelled\u201d usually end up at the border, as Italy has neither the money nor the procedures in place to send people home.</p> <p>While it is illegal to send back minors, France is not breaking the law by returning people whose first EU landing point was Italy, according to the rules of the controversial<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/examination-of-applicants_en\" title=\"\"> Dublin regulation</a> \u2013 under which Italy, like Greece, has borne the brunt of the migration crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe only solution would be to rewrite the Dublin agreement completely,\u201d said Rostan. \u201cThis is the big problem \u2013 Europe doesn\u2019t want poor people coming into its fortress to look for jobs, as millions of Europeans have done elsewhere in the world.\u201d</p> <p>As the bitter wrangling continues, a network of volunteers is working along the border, offering food, clothes and shelter to migrants, and warning them about the mountains.</p> <p>Tamimou is the first person known to have died while attempting the journey from Claviere this winter. Three people died last year on the more treacherous Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle, a pass that begins in Bardonecchia and is less used now. \u201cThe path from Claviere is less difficult but it is the easiest one to be intercepted on,\u201d said Silvia Gilardi, a representative of Rainbow for Africa. \u201cPeople arrive at Oulx station unprepared for the cold and the snow, with just a small rucksack and the clothes they\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p> <p>Elena Pozzallo, who volunteers at Oulx station, hosted a 20-year-old from Cameroon last year who was convalescing after almost losing his feet to frostbite on the Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle. \u201cI\u2019m no superhero, there are plenty of others who help,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the situation here is like a cat trying to catch its tail. We warn people against going, but still they try, maybe five or six times. The Dublin agreement definitely needs to change but, in general, leaders need to be less egotistical and more compassionate.\u201d</p>",

Named after Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister, the law abolishes Italy\u2019s humanitarian protection permit. The two-year permit, which was given to those who were not eligible for refugee status but who for various reasons could not be sent home, enabled people to find work and was renewable. The document also allowed people to cross into other EU states, on condition of prior notification to Italian authorities, and stay for up to 90 days. It had been granted to an estimated 100,000 people who had arrived in Italy in recent years. Paolo De Marchis, the mayor of Oulx, said there had been an increase in arrivals in the town since a draft version of the law was published in September. \u201cSome had been applying for protection but were afraid of not getting it and so escaped from the centres,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers have come since losing their protection. They arrive with the sole objective of reaching the French border. They are convinced things there will be better. The reality is, they get rejected at the border.\u201d Italy\u2019s loudest complaint against France is the turning back of thousands of migrants at the French border. The strictest controls are in place at the frontier that divides the French Riviera from Italy\u2019s Liguria region, near the city of Ventimiglia. During the first half of 2018, French authorities said they sent back more than 10,500 people who tried to cross by train, or by walking along the motorway or through the mountains. Charities have accused French police of using heavy-handed tactics against migrants, including the use of pepper spray, as well as mistreating children and falsifying their birth dates on \u201crefusal of entry\u201d documents so they could pass them off as adults and send them back. Italy also argues that French police often flout border rules. Last April, the government summoned the French ambassador after police barged into a clinic for migrants set up by a charity, Rainbow for Africa, at the train station in Bardonecchia, one stop after Oulx, and forced a Nigerian man suspected of carrying drugs to provide a urine sample. The test was negative. Meanwhile Salvini, who also leads the far-right League party, branded France a \u201cdisgrace\u201d in October after evidence emerged of French police \u201cdumping\u201d migrants by the side of a road in Claviere instead of bringing them to the authorities and declaring why they were being returned. Technically, after crossing into another EU state, migrants have the right to have their cases for asylum heard. The French government admitted to an \u201cerror\u201d but argued that countries needed to be more efficient in expelling illegal immigrants. \u201cSalvini celebrated that discovery, but it had been happening for a year,\u201d said Davide Rostan, a local priest in the Susa Valley. The revelation was the ammunition Salvini needed against France, but he is playing a similar game by sending boat migrants back across the Mediterranean to Libya. Last week he boasted about how his tough measures had led to a significant drop in migrants arriving, while at the same time expulsions had increased. In reality, those \u201cexpelled\u201d usually end up at the border, as Italy has neither the money nor the procedures in place to send people home. While it is illegal to send back minors, France is not breaking the law by returning people whose first EU landing point was Italy, according to the rules of the controversial Dublin regulation \u2013 under which Italy, like Greece, has borne the brunt of the migration crisis. \u201cThe only solution would be to rewrite the Dublin agreement completely,\u201d said Rostan. \u201cThis is the big problem \u2013 Europe doesn\u2019t want poor people coming into its fortress to look for jobs, as millions of Europeans have done elsewhere in the world.\u201d As the bitter wrangling continues, a network of volunteers is working along the border, offering food, clothes and shelter to migrants, and warning them about the mountains. Tamimou is the first person known to have died while attempting the journey from Claviere this winter. Three people died last year on the more treacherous Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle, a pass that begins in Bardonecchia and is less used now. \u201cThe path from Claviere is less difficult but it is the easiest one to be intercepted on,\u201d said Silvia Gilardi, a representative of Rainbow for Africa. \u201cPeople arrive at Oulx station unprepared for the cold and the snow, with just a small rucksack and the clothes they\u2019re wearing.\u201d Elena Pozzallo, who volunteers at Oulx station, hosted a 20-year-old from Cameroon last year who was convalescing after almost losing his feet to frostbite on the Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle. \u201cI\u2019m no superhero, there are plenty of others who help,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the situation here is like a cat trying to catch its tail. We warn people against going, but still they try, maybe five or six times. The Dublin agreement definitely needs to change but, in general, leaders need to be less egotistical and more compassionate.\u201d",

On Friday Javid said he \u201cwould not hesitate\u201d to prevent the return of UK Isis recruits, an approach at odds with Begum\u2019s family in Bethnal Green, east London, who want the 19-year-old to return home \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. Qadir, a senior expert with the government\u2019s counter-extremism Prevent programme and whose cases included raising the alarm about a group of schoolgirls who planned to join Isis in Syria, said: \u201cJavid is fuelling the [Isis] narrative and giving wind to the sails of other extremists. If we continue with this trajectory we\u2019ll be sowing the narrative for them to reap and use against us.\u201d Qadir, whose charity Active Change Foundation was supported by police and worked with high-profile extremists until 2016, said the home secretary\u2019s emphatic response would backfire. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t change their approach to this, we potentially have a second wave of Isis coming, the connecting up and reloading of Isis, fence-sitters who are more sympathetic to another kind of narrative,\u201d he said. This point was backed by Baroness Sal Brinton, president of the Lib Dems, who described Begum\u2019s radicalisation as a form of grooming. \u201cWe know that in that particular school three girls went [to join Islamic State], but probably more were approached. Surely our child protection laws have to kick in. As she returns we should look at what happens, as she was 15, and what happened out there.\u201d Begum, 19, who is heavily pregnant, wants to return to the UK to raise her child but is worried that her baby will be taken from her if she does return from the refugee camp in Syria where she was found by the Times last week. Although Begum is likely to be traumatised, Qadir said that if she received the right mentoring, counselling and passed through the necessary security protocols, she could be successfully rehabilitated. The question of what approach to adopt towards Isis returnees following the near-total eradication of the terrorist group\u2019s caliphate in Syria and Iraq is increasingly vexed, with France alone among the European countries in being proactive in preparing for their nationals\u2019 return. The French government, hit with a series of devastaing Isis-inspired terror attacks, has been making contingency plans to prevent their nationals slipping the net in north-east Syria as the US withdraws. In Brussels the focus has been on trying to raise standards in the swift sharing of information among EU member states, and its dissemination to border databases should there be an uncontrolled wave of returnees. The EU\u2019s security commissioner, Sir Julian King, has made repeated appeals for the capitals to prepare for the fallout from Isis\u2019s military defeat. \u201cSome 6,000 men and women left the EU to travel to the conflict zone \u2013 and around 1,500 children with one or more parent eligible for an EU passport have been taken there or were born there,\u201d King said in a recent speech. Yet along with the appeals of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU\u2019s coordinator for the fight against terrorism, calls for improvements in the sharing of intelligence seem to have fallen on deaf ears. A series of de Kerchove\u2019s reports have lamented the lack of progress in spreading the most up-to- date information between national authorities. Few are convinced that the EU\u2019s security services can be relied upon for them to pick up even the most dangerous individuals. \u201cThey have dropped the ball, despite plenty of warning,\u201d said Karin von Hippel, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute. In the Netherlands the justice and security minister, Ferdinand Grapperhaus, recently braved the critics by revealing that the government was cooperating with local authorities in Syria for the return of women accused of Isis membership and their children. He made his comments after a Dutch citizen died in a displacement camp in northern Syria\u2019s Ain al-Issa, leaving two children behind. Yet the Netherlands, of which Begum\u2019s husband, Yago Riedijk, 26, is a national, born into a middle-class family in an affluent suburb in Arnhem, otherwise retains a tough approach which is echoed elsewhere to foreign fighters. \u201cNobody, but really nobody, with the exception of France, wants them back,\u201d said Rik Coolsaet, a professor of international relations at Ghent University Closer to home, on the streets of Bethnal Green, many hope Begum will be allowed to return, among them Suhail Ahmed, manager of an Asian fashion store. He said: \u201cBecause she is a British citizen, she should be under the law [here]. It is bad what she did, but police can handle it. When she is older she will not think this way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Netflix recently sent up the art world in its feature film, Velvet Buzzsaw. It\u2019s a strange hybrid of spoof and horror, but an early section, in which ludicrous money is thrown around and gross consumption and cut-throat competition are par for the course, is the most successful. (A later gag, in which a gallerist mistakes a pile of bin bags for a new work, is surely the dad joke of satire.) It descends into a mess of blood and gore when the paintings of a freshly discovered outsider artist become sentient and take their revenge on the people who profited from them. The artist Nan Goldin, famous for her intimate photographs of a certain kind of New York life, is continuing her admirable fight to highlight the more gruesome aspects of the real art world. After a call to arms on Instagram, Goldin and her activist collective Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) staged a die-in at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, scattering fake prescriptions, chanting and unfurling signs. The statistics laid bare by the red-and-black banners were stark: \u201c400,000 dead\u201d; \u201c200 dead each day\u201d;\u201cShame on Sackler,\u201d read one. \u2018Take down their name,\u201d read another. Goldin and Pain have staged protests like this before at other institutions that take philanthropic donations from the branch of the Sackler family whose pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, was responsible for the creation of the painkiller OxyContin in 1995 and its subsequent aggressive marketing. As has been reported, OxyContin has been strongly linked to the opioid crisis engulfing the US and critics say the family\u2019s support for the arts amounts to a kind of laundering of morality. Goldin became addicted to OxyContin, she has said, after being prescribed the painkiller for tendonitis in her wrist. Her rapid addiction led her to black market drugs, which in turn almost killed her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they live with themselves,\u201d she told the Guardian. At the latest protest, she led chants of \u201cWe want their money\u201d, suggesting it be put towards treatment initiatives for addicts. Goldin now has a London gallery in her sights. But what\u2019s striking about Goldin\u2019s protests is not only her persistence, but the absence of other voices of a similar stature daring to join her. Kathy Burke was a castaway like no other It has been decided that Desert Island Discs is the greatest radio show of all time, which is a bit like saying that pizza is the greatest food of all time, because, well, obviously it is. Last week\u2019s Radio Times poll of 46 industry experts put the 77-year-old 1st 27 January 1942 Radio 4 show ahead of The Archers and the 60s comedy Round the Horne, though Michael Parkinson, a former host, was less impressed with the accolade. \u201cIt has a credibility and a strange reputation. Really, when you think about it, it\u2019s just an interview going out,\u201d he told the Express, adding that The Goon Show would have got his vote. But Desert Island Discs it is. The best thing about the show\u2019s longevity is the wealth of archive episodes that the BBC has made available to download, all the way back to what remains of the early days, which documents, among other things, how much and how quickly our voices have changed. The poll did not pick a best episode, so I\u2019ll put one forward: Kathy Burke, interviewed by Kirsty Young, in August 2010, for both musical selection \u2013 Lady Gaga, the Specials and Missy Elliott \u2013 and creative choice of luxury item. I\u2019ll leave it to you to find out what it was. Will Smith, playing more mind games than The Matrix It has been a busy week for Will Smith, who debuted his new, blue torso as the genie in the trailer for Disney\u2019s live-action reboot of Aladdin, to the dismay of many fans and the delight of the internet\u2019s meme factories, which made more than a few references to Arrested Development and Avatar. \u201cI wanted a muscular 1970s dad,\u201d the director Guy Ritchie told Entertainment Weekly of Smith\u2019s look in the film, to the confusion of 1970s dads everywhere. In the week in which he, ahem, blue it, Smith also dangled the vision of an alternative 1990s, a glitch in the system, where he had played Neo in The Matrix and not Keanu Reeves and Val Kilmer, rather than Laurence Fishburne, had ended up as Morpheus. In a video uploaded to YouTube, Smith said that this was a story he was \u201cnot proud of, but it\u2019s the truth. I did turn down Neo in The Matrix\u201d, sadly leaving nobody with the option of taking the, I\u2019m sorry, blue pill. Smith says he was less than convinced by the Wachowskis\u2019 pitching of the fight scene: \u201cSo, dude, we\u2019re thinking like, imagine you\u2019re in a fight and then you, like, jump. Imagine if you could stop jumping in the middle of the jump. But then, people could see around you\u2026\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I made Wild Wild West.\u201d Leaving aside the suggestion that The Matrix wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to have two black leads, it is a new favourite alternative casting story and I love alternative casting stories. Imagine the films that could have been if Jack Nicholson had played Michael Corleone or Gwyneth Paltrow or Angelina Jolie had been Cher in Clueless. In the immortal words of Keanu Reeves: \u201cWhoa.\u201d \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Richard Jolly saw Norwich cruise to the top of the Championship. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from the Cherry Red. Notts County 1-0 Mansfield Cambridge 0-0 Tranmere Carlisle 2-3 Milton Keynes Exeter 0-1 Bury Forest Green 3-0 Yeovil Grimsby Town 1-0 Cheltenham Lincoln City 2-2 Stevenage Macclesfield 1-1 Colchester Northampton 0-0 Crawley Oldham 1-1 Crewe Port Vale 0-1 Morecambe Southend 3-3 Portsmouth Bradford 0-0 Plymouth Charlton 0-0 Blackpool Coventry 3-0 Walsall Fleetwood 1-2 Luton Gillingham 1-0 Scunthorpe Oxford 0-1 Peterborough Shrewsbury 1-1 Burton Barnsley 2-1 Wycombe Barnsley v Wycombe is still going...it\u2019s 2-1 to the Tykes with Joe Jacobson scoring in the 100th minute, and Adam El-Abd being sent off in the 95th minute... it finished after nearly 103 minutes. Aston Villa 0-2 West Brom Bolton 0-4 Norwich Ipswich 1-1 Stoke Preston 0-0 Nottingham Forest Rotherham 2-2 Sheff Wed Sheffield United 4- Reading Luton make it 20 league games unbeaten by winning 2-1 at Fleetwood. A late goal at Lincoln. Ilias Chair has got his second for Stevenage to make it 2-2. Lincoln no longer able to sit so pretty at the top of League Two. Still plenty of time to be played, too, with eight minutes added on. Ipswich managed to get a late goal, and equalise against Stoke, with Will Keane making it 1-1 deep into injury time. Preston and Nottingham Forest drew 0-0, as the MONKeano revolution struggles to get going at Forest. And that\u2019s Millwall into the quarter-final draw after Murray Wallace\u2019s early goal. Scott Wagstaff\u2019s beard didn\u2019t get its run-out and AFC Wimbledon\u2019s cup run is at its end. Up in Scotland, it has to be mentioned that Rangers have drawn 0-0 with St Johnstone, having badly missed Alfredo Morelos, the Luis Suarez of Govan. It\u2019s full time at Bramall Lane, where Sheffield United have won 4-0 against Reading and will go second in the Championship. Stevenage have got one back against Lincoln. Ilias Chair\u2019s goal means the League One leaders can\u2019t sit easy on this one. Into the last minute of the FA Cup tie at the Cherry Red, and AFC are piling forward in chase of the equaliser. Oh no, poor David Beckham. Dover are 3-1 up at Salford City. Jai Reason scored the third for the White Cliffs outfit. Do they sing \u201cLove Me For A Reason\u201d at the Crabble Athletic Ground? Good piece of crestfallen, literal tweeting here. Just the facts. And the hashtag. Millwall have twice gone close against Wimbledon, with it taking a last-gasp tackle from Andy Barcham to stop Lee Gregory scoring what would have been a certain goal. Aaron Ramsdale has just made a fine save from Ryan Leonard. A second Millwall goal is more likely than an equaliser. Manchester City are not taking Newport County lightly in this evening\u2019s game, judging by this team selection. Lincoln City are now 2-0 up on Stevenage, with Bruno Andrade scoring his second of the day. Geoff Wignall, definitely a fellow head, emails in: \u201cHi, I can\u2019t imagine how I ever came to know this, but besides being a Groundhogs song Cherry Red was (like Purple Haze, Blue Cheer, Orange Sunshine and Strawberry Field) a variety of LSD during the late 60s/ early 70s.\u201d Blue Cheer were also a band, known in the psychedelic era as the loudest around, the story being that a passing dog was killed by the sheer force of their amps. Norwich/Monaco juxtapositional stat here from Richard Jolly. Norwich could have made it five, but, after Pukki was brought down in the box, but Kenny McLean has had his penalty saved. Norwich have an atrocious record with spot-kicks, and they might need them should the play-offs loom in May. David Beckham has just seen another Dover Athletic goal in his Salford City magic kingdom. That\u2019s 2-1 to the visitors. Chances being created at the Cherry Red, with Millwall keeper Jordan Archer forced to make a save from Michael Folivi, and Jake Cooper firing in a shot for Millwall. Scott Wagstaff, he of the multi-coloured beard, will take no part as the Dons have made all their substitutions; there is something a little sad about that....Or will he get a chance after all? If it goes to extra-time, an extra sub is allowed. Fifth round ties have no replays, remember. Norwich have another! It\u2019s 4-0, with Teemu Pukki burying Bolton with a cool lob for the fourth. And Daniel Farke\u2019s team will clamber above Leeds. And so will Sheffield United, who are also 4-0 up in their game with Reading. Luton, streaking clear at the top of League One, are now 2-0 up on Fleetwood. Pelly Ruddock got the goal and a 20-match unbeaten run is being closed in on. League Two leaders Lincoln are 1-0 up on Stevenage, with Bruno Andrade looping in a header, his third goal in three games. Mansfield, in second, lost earlier to Notts County. Sheffield United are now 4-0 up, with a deflected strike from John Fleck meaning that Reading are being further put to the sword. Macc Town\u2019s lead lasted just moments of actual play as Colchester have equalised, with Frank Nouble scoring from the penalty spot. The second halves are back underway, with the first goal coming north of the border with Dunfermline scoring against Inverness through Joe Thomson. Louise Taylor spoke to Doncaster Rovers\u2019 nobleman ahead of their tie with Crystal Palace. The earlier FA Cup game ended up with Chris Hughton\u2019s men squeaking through to the last eight. Half-time scores in the Championship: Rotherham United 2-2 Sheffield Wednesday (full-time score) Aston Villa 0-2 West Bromwich Albion Bolton Wanderers 0-3 Norwich City Ipswich Town 0-1 Stoke City Preston North End 0-0 Nottingham Forest Sheffield United 3-0 Reading It\u2019s half-time at the Cherry Red, and the score remains AFC Wimbledon 0-1 Millwall. With Notts County breathing down their necks at the bottom of League Two, Macclesfield Town are 1-0 up on Colchester, having scored on the stroke of half-time through Scott Wilson. Meanwhile, West Brom are now 2-0 up on Aston Villa. Jay Rodriguez got that one with a long-range effort. Both Sheffield United and Norwich City are now 3-0 up Gary Madine, the goal machine, has got another for Blades, while Emiliano Buend\u00eda has scored Norwich\u2019s third. In the Brum derby, Hal Robson-Kanu has scored for West Brom, who lead Aston Villa 1-0. Altrincham are playing in rainbow colours modelled on the LGBT Pride Flag. They lead Bradford Park Avenue 1-0. Wimbledon coming back into the game against Millwall. Toby Sibbick has had the best chance so far for them, and there has been a penalty appeal. David Beckham has just seen his first Salford concession, with Dan McNamara, on loan from Millwall, scoring for Dover. Norwich, by the way, are 2-0 up at Bolton. Marco Stiepermann got it and Daniel Farke\u2019s team should be top at the end of tonight, barring a Portsmouth-esque collapse. Paul Scholes\u2019 Oldham Athletic, as they will be known for now, have taken the lead against Crewe; Callum Lang got the goal. Down at the Cherry Red, it\u2019s still 1-0 to Millwall, who have been bossing things since Murray Wallace\u2019s goal. Duncan Edwards, clearly a fellow head, emails in: \u201cI have the album Split by the Groundhogs and that Cherry Red compilation which features a memorable short rant by Quentin Crisp about the dangers of popular music and mentions the football terraces!\u201d Yes, and here it is. Simon McMahon emails in: \u201cGood afternoon, John. So, Watford and Brighton through to the FA Cup quarter finals, Millwall looking like joining them, the country seemingly on the verge of economic and social collapse. Have I fallen asleep and woken up in 1984?\u201d Yes, Threads is on Channel 4 tonight. Up in Scotland, Hibs, under the new management of Paul Heckingbottom, have taken the lead against Albion. Sheffield United have scored again. It\u2019s 2-0 against Reading, with Gary Madine getting that. Billy Sharp has been left on the bench and it looks like he will not be required. That was Madine\u2019s first ever goal for Blades; he used to be an Owl, of course. David Beckham has just seen his first Salford goal, scored by Dennis Politic, whose nickname is probably not \u201cThe Governor\u201d. Norwich have taken the lead, and it\u2019s Teemu Pukki again, with a smart finish at Bolton. The Canaries flying to the top of the league. Bad news for Sheffield Wednesday fans amid that late goal joy. An early goal for the Championship team as Wallace the Scotsman heads home. By the way, they are off and running in the FA Cup. An early goal in the Championship 3pm kick-offs, where Sheffield United have taken the lead through Kieron Freeman....time still ticks on at Rotherham...and it\u2019s 2-2! Dominic Iorfa scores it and Fernando Forestieri is red-carded for over-celebrating. That\u2019s now a final score. All happening in the Steel City. Into the ninth minute of added time now... There\u2019s a lengthy amount of injury time being played at the New York Stadium, where Rotherham are still leading Sheffield Wednesday 2-1. Notts County held on for a famous win in beating local rivals Mansfield 1-0 and to climb to a point behind second-bottom Macclesfield. Here\u2019s David again, with Class of \u201895 member Phil Neville. In that South Yorkshire derby, Richard Towell has scored for Rotherham to put them 2-1 up against Sheffield Wednesday. That\u2019s put a dampener on things for Steve Bruce... Here\u2019s the report from the Amex from Paul Doyle. And Brighton march on to the sixth round after holding off Derby\u2019s late surge: it finished 2-1 to the Albion. Full-time at Roots Hall where it\u2019s finished 3-3 between Southend and Portsmouth. Some game, that. Great advert for League Two. Look who\u2019s at Salford City. None other than co-owner (Not Sir) David Beckham. It\u2019s now 3-3 between Southend and Portsmouth. It was 3-0 to Portsmouth. Simon Cox got the equaliser and did a very silly dance to celebrate. In the FA Cup, it\u2019s now 2-1 to Brighton against Derby, and Ashley Cole has just scored his first ever FA Cup goal. Here\u2019s the Bolton v Norwich teams. Kingsmeadow is known these days as the Cherry Red Stadium, after the August record label that gave the world Felt, Everything But The Girl, The Nightingales, plus the last incarnation of The Fall. They also released the Pillows &amp; Prayers compilation LP. It used to retail at 99p, but will cost you about \u00a38 from your local unfriendly second-hand record store. Cherry Red comes from a song by the Groundhogs, fact fans. Here are the teams are Kingsmeadow. Some latest scores from the EFL: HT: Rotherham 1-1 Sheff Wed in the South Yorkshire derby. Southend 1-3 Portsmouth in League One, and they are deep into the second half. HT: Notts County 1-0 Mansfield - County, bottom of the league, are reviving. That\u2019s bad news for Macclesfield, Morecambe and Yeovil. Fancy some Golden Goal action? Sachin Nakrani is your man for that. Insert obligatory Womble tweet here. The spirit of Elizabeth Beresford and Mike Batt lives on (as does Mike Batt, come to think of it). Such is the magic of the modern FA Cup that there is but one fifth round tie to be played at 3pm on a Saturday. And it\u2019s a London derby, if Wimbledon is in London; it used to be classed as Surrey. Millwall are the visitors to the club that knocked out West Ham in the last round in a superb match. Kingsmeadow is the venue, and Wally Downes, original member of the Crazy Gang, is plotting the downfall of those loveable Lions. That is not the only action in good old Albion. The Championship has an anaemic look about it, with Leeds not in action, but Norwich have chance to bite back after that shock 3-1 loss at Preston in midweek when they face strugglers - both on and off the field - Bolton. It seems old school, but Aston Villa v West Brom is a Saturday, 3pm kick-off, too, while Sheffield United have chance to climb into the top two when they take on Reading at Bramall Lane. Further down, Luton are at Joey Barton\u2019s Fleetwood - yes, he is still the manager, in League One, while at the Valley, Charlton welcome Blackpool, newly rid of Owen Oyston but staring a 12-point deduction in the face. League Two leaders Lincoln take on Stevenage.",

      "bodyText": "Democrats are seeking \u201cthe best way\u201d to force Donald Trump to reveal what he discussed in private meetings with Russian president Vladimir Putin, the chair of the powerful House intelligence committee said on Saturday. Adam Schiff of California told Politico he met the House general counsel, Douglas Letter, to \u201cdetermine the best way to find out what took place in those private meetings \u2013 whether it\u2019s by seeking the interpreter\u2019s testimony, the interpreter\u2019s notes, or other means\u201d. The House general counsel provides bipartisan legal advice and representation to members and committees. Letter was appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in December, becoming, in the words of the National Law Journal, \u201cchief point person for any litigation involving enforcement of subpoenas targeting Trump administration officials and others in the president\u2019s orbit\u201d. In January, the Washington Post reported that Trump had taken unusual steps to keep private translator\u2019s notes from meetings with Putin. After a meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg in 2017 that was also attended by then secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the paper reported, Trump took \u201cpossession of the notes of his own interpreter and instruct[ed] the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials\u201d. In Helsinki in July 2018, Trump and Putin met with only translators present. Debate over whether translators can or should be compelled to turn over their notes has risen following the Democratic takeover of the House, which put Schiff and other committee chairs in position to ramp up investigations of Trump and his administration. Last year, Schiff was among Democrats who called for Marina Gross, the translator in the Helsinki meeting, to testify before the House intelligence committee in private. Republicans who then controlled the panel rejected the request. On Saturday Elliott Engel of New York, chair of the House foreign affairs committee, told Politico: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m in favor of interpreters turning over all their notes, but I do think that it shouldn\u2019t be up to the president to hide the notes.\u201d He added: \u201cAll we want is for the American people to know the truth.

But, behind her smiles, she is worried.</p> <p>She fears that, like many other UK businesses that rely heavily on imports from Europe, this family-run florist, which has operated in the city\u2019s market square for the past 60 years, will have to increase its prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and might struggle to survive.</p> <p>\u201cWe do try to source flowers locally, but most of what we sell is imported. After Brexit there could be a big, big difference in the prices of what we buy.\u201d If the cost of imports does rise, it will have a knock-on effect on the prices she will charge, she says. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019ll still be here, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have the volume of flowers we have today, and our customers won\u2019t have as much choice.\u201d</p> <p>About 80% of the flowers sold in the UK are imported from the Netherlands which, in turn imports and auctions off flowers from across the world, according to the British Flower Association (BFA), the trade association for independent florists. Its chairman, Brian Wills-Pope, predicts that, in the worst-case scenario, following a no-deal Brexit the UK\u2019s 7,000 florists would have 50% fewer fresh flowers to sell.</p> <p>\u201cFlorists would have to be inventive,\u201d he says. \u201cI think in that scenario British growers would increase the amount of flowers available to florists. A lot of these flowers currently go to supermarkets.\u201d</p> <p>His main concern is border control and flowers getting stuck in transit. \u201cWe can\u2019t stockpile like other industries, because flowers are so perishable. The exchange rate also obviously affects us.\u201d</p> <p>But he is hopeful that the Dutch will get their flowers across, no matter what \u2013 even if it takes much longer. \u201cThe Dutch are not going to want to stop exporting \u00a3800m-\u00a3900m of flowers to us.

Chococino roses, green chrysanthemums, hyacinths, flax flowers, clematis and anemones line the shelves, filling the air with scent, and a dozen bouquets of red roses are waiting for delivery by the door.

During the aftermath of the yellow vests harassment of Anna Soubry MP outside parliament in January this year, much of the media referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/09/top-pro-brexit-yellow-vest-activist-said-all-muslims-should-be-removed-from-uk\" title=\"\">protester James Goddard</a> as the group\u2019s leader, prompting him to tweet: \u201cThe #YellowVestsUK has no leader or political affiliation.

He added: \u201cWe cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now.\u201d</p>",

A survey of UK attitudes, commissioned by anti-fascist group Hope not Hate, found that 68% of people felt there was not a political party that represented them, up from 61% when the same question was posed last July. Other findings reveal that more than half of respondents believe the UK\u2019s political system is broken, with just a third expressing confidence it is working. The results coincide with warnings from Hope not Hate of a broad far-right movement which has coalesced under the \u201canti-mainstream politics\u201d sentiment and is active online and through street protest, but is non-party or organisation-defined. The polling, released by the group ahead of publishing its annual report on Monday on the state of the far right, also found that less than 10% of people closely identify with any leading political figure. By contrast, the reach of far-right personalities can be large, with nearly four in 10 revealing that they had watched or heard one of Tommy Robinson\u2019s videos on social media, although only 6% of Britons have a positive view of the former English Defence League (EDL) leader, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. \u201cWe are facing a crisis of growing political mistrust across all sections of the population, with no figure able to galvanise the support they need to overcome this disconnect,\u201d said Nick Lowles, chief executive of Hope not Hate. He added: \u201cA mistrust in political representatives adds potency to a mix of unmet expectations, broken promises, and possible further decline and anger.\u201d This week\u2019s report will warn that this year may see increased support for far-right groups, following 2018, when demonstrations in London attracted up to 10,000, numbers not seen in decades and potentially not since the interwar period of the 1930s. The demonstrations were notable, says the report, because they brought together activists from across the far right, including the EDL, Britain First, supporters of the youth movement Generation Identity, the British National party and National Front veterans, as well as Ukip and alt-right figureheads. \u201cThey are happy to march shoulder to shoulder, whatever the cause; something approaching a far-right popular front,\u201d said Lowles. Although Robinson is an important figurehead, observers have been intrigued that he has not attempted to launch a formal group, or adopted a formalised leadership position within one, as he did with the anti-Islam EDL and Pegida UK in the past. Lowles also points out that the new far-right grouping is so far at pains to remain leaderless and amorphous. During the aftermath of the yellow vests harassment of Anna Soubry MP outside parliament in January this year, much of the media referred to protester James Goddard as the group\u2019s leader, prompting him to tweet: \u201cThe #YellowVestsUK has no leader or political affiliation. They can\u2019t silence us all!\u201d Aside from Goddard and Robinson, other far-right influencers named in the report include former Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam, Carl Benjamin (aka Sargon of Akkad) and Markus Meechan, who infamously trained a dog to give a Nazi salute. Further findings from the poll, conducted by YouGov, found that three-quarters of people think politicians put the interests of big business before people like them, whereas only 7% think that \u201cpoliticians generally work to represent the views and interests of people like me above big businesses\u201d. Lowles said that one possible development during the year ahead could be the movement evolving from its current leaderless form to a \u201cmore formalised\u201d group under the leadership of someone like Robinson. He added: \u201cWe cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now.\u201d",

The past fortnight has seen a concerted lobbying drive by two of the leading shale companies calling for the government to review rules on earthquakes caused by their operations. The country\u2019s richest person, Jim Ratcliffe, founder of the petrochemicals firm Ineos, branded the regulations \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cunworkable\u201d, and implied the government should consider limits closer to those in the US.

      "body": "<p>Nadine Labaki is a Lebanese actor and director whose latest film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/capernaum-review-cannes-film-festival\" title=\"\">Capernaum</a></em> (meaning confusion or chaos in Arabic), won the jury prize at the 2018 Cannes film festival and has since been nominated for a Bafta (beaten by Roma) and an Academy Award. The film tells the story of a 12-year-old boy, Zain, who lives in a Beirut slum and whose parents are incapable of taking care of him. Having run away from home, he lives for a while with an illegal immigrant from Ethiopia, Rahil. None of those who appear in the film is a professional actor.</p> <p><strong>How did you come to start thinking about </strong><em><strong>Capernaum</strong></em><strong>? </strong><br>In Lebanon, we are exposed to the sight of children suffering on a daily basis. They are there on the streets, selling gum or flowers or carrying heavy loads, such as gas tanks. Sometimes, they\u2019re just lying there. I once saw this kid on a cement block in the middle of the road at one o\u2019clock in the morning. He wanted to sleep, but he couldn\u2019t. It began with feeling responsible, with wanting to become the voice of these kids. I thought: if I stay silent, I\u2019m complicit in this crime \u2013 and it is a crime that we allow this to happen. I don\u2019t know how we live with ourselves. These children are in perpetual danger. So I started going out with my co-writers to the most difficult neighbourhoods \u2013 to the slums, to the detention centres, to the courts \u2013 just watching.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I asked the children I spoke to if they were happy to be\u00a0alive, and for the most part the answer was no</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The boy at the centre of the film, Zain, decides to </strong><strong>sue his parents. Where did you get that idea? </strong><br>I asked the children I spoke to if they were happy to be alive and for most the answer was no. One of them told me: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was born if no one is going to love me, if no one is going to kiss me before I go to sleep, if I\u2019m going to be beaten up every day.\u201d</p> <p>One day, it hit me. This is going to be the story of a child who says: no more. For the character of Zain\u2019s mother, I was inspired by a woman who\u2019d had 16 children, seven of whom died from neglect.</p> <p><strong>How did you find </strong><strong>Zain Al Rafeea</strong><strong>, the boy who plays Zain? His is a truly remarkable performance. </strong><br>We did a street casting and one of my team found him. He was a Syrian refugee, an angry child, but very wise. He didn\u2019t go to school. He was very small because of malnutrition. He\u2019s in Norway now, with his family, and we\u2019re making a documentary about that. What\u2019s amazing is how many of the things in the film became true. When Rahil is arrested in the film, for instance: we shot that and two days later Yordanos Shiferaw, who plays her, was arrested in real life because, like her character, she, too, didn\u2019t have any papers.</p> <p><strong>How have people in Lebanon responded to the film? </strong><br>In two ways. Some are ashamed. They knew it was happening, but perhaps not the extent of it. They are shocked and it\u2019s creating a huge discussion, a movement for change. Then there\u2019s the other reaction, the people who say: no, this doesn\u2019t exist. This isn\u2019t our country.

      "bodyText": "Nadine Labaki is a Lebanese actor and director whose latest film, Capernaum (meaning confusion or chaos in Arabic), won the jury prize at the 2018 Cannes film festival and has since been nominated for a Bafta (beaten by Roma) and an Academy Award. The film tells the story of a 12-year-old boy, Zain, who lives in a Beirut slum and whose parents are incapable of taking care of him. Having run away from home, he lives for a while with an illegal immigrant from Ethiopia, Rahil. None of those who appear in the film is a professional actor. How did you come to start thinking about Capernaum? In Lebanon, we are exposed to the sight of children suffering on a daily basis. They are there on the streets, selling gum or flowers or carrying heavy loads, such as gas tanks. Sometimes, they\u2019re just lying there. I once saw this kid on a cement block in the middle of the road at one o\u2019clock in the morning. He wanted to sleep, but he couldn\u2019t. It began with feeling responsible, with wanting to become the voice of these kids. I thought: if I stay silent, I\u2019m complicit in this crime \u2013 and it is a crime that we allow this to happen. I don\u2019t know how we live with ourselves. These children are in perpetual danger. So I started going out with my co-writers to the most difficult neighbourhoods \u2013 to the slums, to the detention centres, to the courts \u2013 just watching. The boy at the centre of the film, Zain, decides to sue his parents. Where did you get that idea? I asked the children I spoke to if they were happy to be alive and for most the answer was no. One of them told me: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was born if no one is going to love me, if no one is going to kiss me before I go to sleep, if I\u2019m going to be beaten up every day.\u201d One day, it hit me. This is going to be the story of a child who says: no more. For the character of Zain\u2019s mother, I was inspired by a woman who\u2019d had 16 children, seven of whom died from neglect. How did you find Zain Al Rafeea, the boy who plays Zain? His is a truly remarkable performance. We did a street casting and one of my team found him. He was a Syrian refugee, an angry child, but very wise. He didn\u2019t go to school. He was very small because of malnutrition. He\u2019s in Norway now, with his family, and we\u2019re making a documentary about that. What\u2019s amazing is how many of the things in the film became true. When Rahil is arrested in the film, for instance: we shot that and two days later Yordanos Shiferaw, who plays her, was arrested in real life because, like her character, she, too, didn\u2019t have any papers. How have people in Lebanon responded to the film? In two ways. Some are ashamed. They knew it was happening, but perhaps not the extent of it. They are shocked and it\u2019s creating a huge discussion, a movement for change. Then there\u2019s the other reaction, the people who say: no, this doesn\u2019t exist. This isn\u2019t our country. They don\u2019t want to look in the mirror and see their flaws. What is it like, making a film in Lebanon? How did you fund Capernaum, for instance? You\u2019re on your own. My husband [the musician and composer Khaled Mouzanar] produced it, as well as writing the score. He mortgaged our house without even telling me. We shot for six months.

      "body": "<p>Mike Ashley, the high street\u2019s most voracious corporate shopper, underlined his power over British retail last week when he was allowed to peruse the books of a long-coveted target: Debenhams.</p> \n<p>As the 54-year-old entrepreneur scrutinised the struggling chain\u2019s finances, he also managed a tilt at two failed retailers over the past fortnight. HMV was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/05/hmv-bought-doug-putman-stores-jobs\" title=\"\">ultimately sold to a Canadian entrepreneur</a> and Patisserie Valerie went to a management buyout, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/10/mike-ashley-withdraws-his-surprise-bid-for-patisserie-valerie\" title=\"\">blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it proposal</a> from Ashley.</p> \n<p>Ashley means business: he has hundreds of millions at his fingertips thanks to strong cash generation by his companies and banking arrangements that let him borrow up to \u00a31bn. His Sports Direct group runs 650 stores of its own in the UK, from Sports Direct branches to House of Fraser outlets, and it has interests in a further 500 stores through its shareholdings \u2013 which include nearly 30% of Debenhams. Sofa.com and Evans Cycles have also recently been added to the empire. The Sports Direct conglomerate accounts for 3p in every pound spent on non-food purchases in the UK, according to GlobalData.</p> \n<p>The reason that Ashley\u2019s name is attached to every high-street deal on the table is because potential sellers know he is one of few investors currently prepared to look at the sector, says one retail industry observer.</p> \n<p>\u201cMike Ashley\u2019s about making money,\u201d says Richard Hyman, an independent consultant. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has got a strategy to take over the high street or save the high street or rescue businesses. He\u2019s a trader and sees that, in periods of great distress, there are opportunities.\u201d</p> \n<p>His strategy can seem hard to discern, but Debenhams is certainly taking him seriously as the board tries to keep the store afloat. It has handed over key financial data to Sports Direct in the hope that he will play a part in refinancing its \u00a3520m of debt, which must be repaid by next year. Debenhams wants to bring Ashley into the fold after a clash with chair Ian Cheshire led the retail tycoon to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/debenhams-chairman-ousted-by-mike-ashley\" title=\"\">oust Cheshire </a>at the annual meeting last month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3eb63b09-6885-4393-ab2e-6a9cda00769e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sports Direct UK<br></b>The main unit in the Sports Direct group \u2013 its UK business - comprises more than 480 stores including Sports Direct, the Lillywhites department store, 38 USC streetwear stores and 30 gyms. Sales were steady at \u00a32.18bn in the latest financial year, as the group closed about 13 sports stores in the UK and seven USC outlets. The company traded well during the World Cup but is suffering amid a general slowdown in high street spending.</p>\n    <p><b>Designer brand stores<br></b>Sales rose nearly 43%to \u00a3162m in the year to 29 April as the group\u2019s Flannels chain, which sells brands including Gucci, Kenzo and Canada Goose, nearly doubled in size and did well online. The designer brand unit has more than 40 stores, including 25 Flannels outlets and eight Cruise stores.</p>\n    <p><b>Brands<br></b>Sports Direct\u2019s wide range of brands, from Campri skiwear to Karrimor outdoor gear, Slazenger and the Lonsdale boxing brand had a tough time last year, with income from wholesale and licensing falling 23% to \u00a3186.3m.</p>\n    <p><b>House of Fraser<br></b>Sports Direct bought House of Fraser for \u00a390m in August last year after the department store fell into administration. Three stores were closed, leaving 56 open, although at least nine more could close. In its latest financial results, the chain dived to a \u00a343.9m loss on sales of \u00a3788m. Some key brands, such as Jigsaw and Jaeger, have pulled out. The company has filled some gaps in stores with sportswear, raising scepticism about Ashley\u2019s aim to turn the chain into the 'Harrods of the High Street'.</p>\n    <p><b>Evans Cycles<br></b>Evans fell into administration in October amid heavy price competition. Sports Direct bought it for \u00a38m, which was good news for its 1,300 staff. But the company has warned it may have to shut half of Evans\u2019s 62 stores. Just three have closed so far. Evans made a loss of \u00a32.5m last year.</p>\n    <p><b>Debenhams \u2013 29.7% stake owned by Sports Direct<br></b>The ailing department store which has sales of about \u00a32.9bn is to close up to 50 outlets \u2013 almost a third of the chain \u2013 and downsize up to 30 site as it battles the rise of online shopping and lacklustre clothing and homewares markets. The company is trying to refinance after issuing three profits warnings last year sending shares down by about 90%.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ashley is currently mulling his next move, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/under-fire-sports-direct-chairman-keith-hellawell-to-step-down\" title=\"\">six-month block</a> on Sports Direct making a hostile bid for the department store (unless there is a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d) comes to an end next month. Debenhams is certainly cheap: at just 3.35p, its share price has slumped 90% in a year. But the company has bought itself more time to improve trading by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/12/debenhams-hopes-rise-as-major-supplier-adds-support-to-cash-fillip\" title=\"\"> securing a \u00a340m overdraft</a> from its bankers and the backing of a key supplier that will get it through the next six months.</p> \n<p>The cash injection came after Debenhams turned down Sports Direct\u2019s offer of a \u00a340m interest-free loan before Christmas because it came with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/11/sports-direct-hits-out-at-debenhams-for-rejecting-40m-loan\" title=\"\">too many strings attached</a>. That offer was a typical play by Ashley, who has used power over a company\u2019s debt to secure ownership in the past, most recently at US retailers Bob\u2019s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports. He has made no secret of his desire to bring Debenhams closer together with House of Fraser, which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/house-of-fraser-calls-in-administrators-as-rescue-talks-fail\" title=\"\">rescued from administration</a> at a cost of \u00a390m in August last year.</p> \n<p>Ashley-watchers say he is unlikely to launch a bid for the company, as he probably only wants fewer than 100 of its 165 stores. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pay full price for anything: he\u2019s a promiscuous bargain hunter,\u201d says one industry expert who knows Ashley well. \u201cHe wants to push the car over the edge and pick it up and reassemble it.\u201d</p> \n<p>It might be asked why Ashley is so keen to snap up an ailing department store when these businesses appear to be suffering more than most from the switch to online shopping. But <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/in-full-mike-ashley-on-the-future-of-the-high-streets-11571037\" title=\"\">Ashley himself has explained</a> the opportunities to cut costs if Debenhams pooled its distribution network, purchasing and property management with House of Fraser.</p> \n<p>His acquisition of Fraser can also be seen an extension of a long-term strategy of buying up bust brands to gain access to labels that can help expand his empire. The buyout of Flannels in 2012 helped build relationships with designer labels that took him into a world more upmarket than Sports Direct. House of Fraser is the next step.</p> \n<p>Unlike financial investors, who base their strategy on property assets, which are difficult to value in a falling market, Ashley is a trader who can see how different brands might fit into his overall portfolio.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ac4a0b23a0fd821f8cc29f97cf3c7ae3c0b6fa0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac4a0b23a0fd821f8cc29f97cf3c7ae3c0b6fa0/0_234_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Debenhams store in the rain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debenhams turned down a \u00a340m loan from Sports Direct before Christmas, but has now opened its books to Ashley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The way Ashley has taken on House of Fraser gives an insight into the Sports Direct machine. Since buying it, Ashley has reduced costs by slashing the number of head-office staff and moved the remaining team into Sports Direct\u2019s London head office, where Flannels is also based. The department store\u2019s dated technology has been overhauled using Sports Direct systems and suppliers say he has kept them happy by improving their terms, halving the time it takes them to get paid.</p> \n<p>One says: \u201cIt\u2019s much easier now, discussions are just quicker. People are still watching how things are happening, but there is not lots of negativity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ashley has also gone into battle with landlords and councils, demanding rent cuts and help to improve the look and feel of stores. At least three House of Fraser stores have closed, but negotiations continue on about 18 sites and new deals have been signed on about 37. The vast majority are now on leases of only a year, giving Ashley time to see if he can build a winning formula for the chain.</p> \n<p>If things don\u2019t work out, he can leave without pain. For retailers like House of Fraser, the Ashley way is one of the few viable options left.</p>",

Ashley-watchers say he is unlikely to launch a bid for the company, as he probably only wants fewer than 100 of its 165 stores. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pay full price for anything: he\u2019s a promiscuous bargain hunter,\u201d says one industry expert who knows Ashley well. \u201cHe wants to push the car over the edge and pick it up and reassemble it.\u201d It might be asked why Ashley is so keen to snap up an ailing department store when these businesses appear to be suffering more than most from the switch to online shopping. But Ashley himself has explained the opportunities to cut costs if Debenhams pooled its distribution network, purchasing and property management with House of Fraser. His acquisition of Fraser can also be seen an extension of a long-term strategy of buying up bust brands to gain access to labels that can help expand his empire. The buyout of Flannels in 2012 helped build relationships with designer labels that took him into a world more upmarket than Sports Direct. House of Fraser is the next step. Unlike financial investors, who base their strategy on property assets, which are difficult to value in a falling market, Ashley is a trader who can see how different brands might fit into his overall portfolio. The way Ashley has taken on House of Fraser gives an insight into the Sports Direct machine. Since buying it, Ashley has reduced costs by slashing the number of head-office staff and moved the remaining team into Sports Direct\u2019s London head office, where Flannels is also based. The department store\u2019s dated technology has been overhauled using Sports Direct systems and suppliers say he has kept them happy by improving their terms, halving the time it takes them to get paid. One says: \u201cIt\u2019s much easier now, discussions are just quicker. People are still watching how things are happening, but there is not lots of negativity.\u201d Ashley has also gone into battle with landlords and councils, demanding rent cuts and help to improve the look and feel of stores. At least three House of Fraser stores have closed, but negotiations continue on about 18 sites and new deals have been signed on about 37. The vast majority are now on leases of only a year, giving Ashley time to see if he can build a winning formula for the chain. If things don\u2019t work out, he can leave without pain. For retailers like House of Fraser, the Ashley way is one of the few viable options left.",

Music was the factor that united the diversity of Paris and London, especially in the struggle against racism,\u201d Malfettes added.</p> <p>\u201cAt different moments of this history between the 60s and 80s, music played a fundamental role in integration. It was about cultural pride and also resistance, and it allowed communities to counter racist ideas during the period of strong racism in the 60s and 70s. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a feeling that ground has been lost since the 1980s, and this idea of utopia and <em>vivre ensemble</em> is receding .When we speak of music in France, we rarely speak of those influences from the Caribbean and north and sub-Saharan Africa that are so much part of French heritage.

Moving into the 1980s, the exhibition covers the emergence of rap, bhangra, Asian underground, R&amp;B and modern ra\u00ef. \u201cThe 60s to the 80s are three decades where music progressively occupied a more important place in the battle for and construction of identity and the idea of vivre ensemble, living together. Music was the factor that united the diversity of Paris and London, especially in the struggle against racism,\u201d Malfettes added. \u201cAt different moments of this history between the 60s and 80s, music played a fundamental role in integration. It was about cultural pride and also resistance, and it allowed communities to counter racist ideas during the period of strong racism in the 60s and 70s. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a feeling that ground has been lost since the 1980s, and this idea of utopia and vivre ensemble is receding .When we speak of music in France, we rarely speak of those influences from the Caribbean and north and sub-Saharan Africa that are so much part of French heritage. But music remains something that unites different peoples.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Orain, the Paris museum\u2019s director, said the exhibition celebrated a \u201cpost-colonial turning point\u201d in Britain and France that saw migrant communities using music to express their \u201cgrievances, visions and hopes\u201d. With Brexit looming large, however, she said it had another important message. \u201cThe destinies of our two countries may be separating, but we are still linked and we will continue to recount our common history.\u201d Paris-Londres: Music Migrations (1962-1989) is from 12 March 2019-5 January 2020",

      "body": "<p>Back in the middle of the first decade of this century, a new movement was heralded by the publication of several books on the same subject. The main four authors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopherhitchens\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dennett\" title=\"\">Daniel Dennett</a> and Sam Harris. And the movement was called the New Atheism.</p> <p>At the time, Harris, who was actually the first to publish, with his book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/feb/06/society\" title=\"\">The End of Faith</a></em>, was unquestionably the junior partner. The others had global reputations in their fields \u2013 Dawkins in evolutionary biology, Hitchens in journalism and public speaking, and Dennett in philosophy and cognitive science. All Harris had was his book and a BA in philosophy. The four, who would become known as the Four Horsemen, got together in 2007 at Hitchens\u2019s apartment in Washington to discuss arguments for atheism or, more accurately, against faith. The event was recorded and is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7IHU28aR2E\" title=\"\">available to watch on Youtube</a>.</p> <p>By some way the youngest, Harris looks a little as if Ben Stiller, whom he physically resembles, had joined a meeting of great minds and made a good fist of being serious. He could easily have been the Ringo Starr of the quartet, but he more than holds his own.</p> <p>Now that conversation has been published in a book entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/31/four-horsemen-review-what-happened-to-new-atheism-dawkins-hitchens\" title=\"\">The Four Horsemen</a></em>, with a glowing foreword by Stephen Fry. It\u2019s an odd moment in history to revisit. The New Atheism has rather faded from prominence, partly because, as its proponents acknowledged, it was not very different from the old atheism. And partly because it was a product of the \u2018war on terror\u2019, or at least an intellectual response to what that war was ostensibly targeting: namely, radical Islam.</p> <p>Today, Dawkins and Dennett are in their late 70s, and no longer quite as active, and Hitchens, the most charismatic of them all, is dead. That leaves Harris to uphold the cause, which he has done with great energy. Today he is one of the best-known public intellectuals in America, thanks to a series of bestsellers, his podcast, and a celebrated altercation with the Hollywood actor Ben Affleck, of which more later.</p> <p>But first, on the phone to Los Angeles, I ask Harris how well he knew his fellow Horsemen.</p> <p>\u201cI think I met Hitch in 2007, when <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/01/society2\" title=\"\">God Is Not Great</a></em> was just about to launch,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in person very many times. I knew Richard and Dan longer than that \u2013 mostly an email relationship. As I say in my introduction to the book [<em>The Four Horsemen</em>], I was surprised that that was in fact the only conversation the four of us had ever had.\u201d</p> <p>Its uniqueness is a selling point of the book, which is subtitled: <em>The Discussion that Sparked an Atheist Revolution</em>. That may be a little hyperbolic, but it\u2019s true that the gathering has gained a certain historical significance, not to mention mythology. The four men \u2013 or should we, in the era of identity politics, say the four white, heterosexual men \u2013 have become heroes, less to an atheist movement than to an outspokenly rationalist one.</p> <p>There is a growing divide between those who trumpet empirical evidence and those who question the cultural and social conditions to which empiricism remains blind. Harris is very definitely located at the forefront of the former group, and is widely loathed by those who are in the latter \u2013 a designation that would include many on the postmodern left. On internet chatrooms and in online debates, he is a ubiquitous reference point, a lightning conductor in many contemporary social and intellectual disagreements. He is often referred to as a racist, an Islamophobe and a prime example of white entitlement. He contests all the accusations, but they haven\u2019t gone away.</p> <p>Perhaps the moment that Harris became identified in the wider American public\u2019s eye as a contentious figure was his run-in four years ago with Affleck on the satirical TV show <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60\" title=\"\">Real Time With Bill Maher</a></em>. During a debate on Islam, the Hollywood star accused Harris of Islamophobia and racism. The powerfully built Affleck was full of righteous passion and, although Harris remained calm and tried to get his point across, the smaller man appeared intimidated by the actor\u2019s physical and celebrity presence. Harris says it wasn\u2019t until they were walking off stage that he really found his voice.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018You know that if we decided to burn a Bible on live television tonight it would be controversial, but it wouldn\u2019t ruin our lives. If we decided to burn a Qur\u2019an on the show tonight, the rest of our lives would be spent dealing with the aftermath, and you know that and you\u2019re lying about it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was a very Harris-like observation: a telling comparison, a vivid image and a stark moral challenge. These are his stock in trade methods, the kind of debating points that rally his fans and enrage his enemies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The moment it became clear what had happened on 9/11, it was clear that I needed to write that book</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris was something of a frustrated writer and a failed novelist when he found his subject. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 turned him into a nonfiction writer overnight.</p> <p>\u201c<em>The End of Faith</em> was a direct response to those events,\u201d he says. \u201cI literally began writing it on 9/12 or 9/13. The moment it became clear what had happened, it was clear that I needed to write that book.\u201d</p> <p>He had not long before completed a philosophy degree at Stanford University, having taken an 11-year break from an English degree he had been doing. In that earlier university stint he had experimented with MDMA, which led to an interest in meditation, studying in India and Nepal and two years on silent retreat in one-week to three-month increments. His life in those days sounds like something from a Herman Hesse novel \u2013 lots of reading philosophy, contemplation, and nothing so dull as a day job. Throughout his long educational and professional lacuna, he was supported by his parents, the actor Berkeley Harris and the TV producer Susan Harris, who created <em>The Golden Girls</em> (his parents divorced when he was two).</p> <p>\u201cIt was a blessing and a curse,\u201d he says of their financial backing, because while he was able to read, write and do what he wanted, he neglected to build a career in writing.</p> <p><em>The End of Faith</em> changed all that. Its core thesis was quite simple. Ideologies or belief systems, Harris argued, inform actions. You can look at social, ethnic, class and cultural backgrounds of the people who, for example, commit suicide bombings and no unifying pattern will emerge. But what they overwhelming share is a belief system or, more specifically, a faith. It\u2019s an argument he has made many times, and most particularly directed towards the faith of Islam. He repeats it again to me.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one religion on Earth that poses this problem to civil society. The Mormons don\u2019t do this. The fundamentalist Christians don\u2019t do this. I mean, they do it in places like Uganda, but they don\u2019t do it in many places, even in a developing world.\u201d</p> <p>Statistically speaking, Harris is on strong ground, though there are many other factors that could be taken into account. But it\u2019s when he strays from strict definitions to general assertions that he gets into trouble, and that has led to the accusations of Islamophobia. He rejects the term, drawing a distinction between attacking Islam, a set of codified beliefs, and demonising Muslims, an enormous and varied group of people.</p> <p>I quote him something he wrote in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/31/religion.saudiarabia\" title=\"\">the Danish cartoons crisis</a> back in 2006:</p> <p>\u201cThroughout western Europe, Muslim immigrants show little inclination to acquire the secular and civil values of their host countries, and yet exploit these values to the utmost \u2013 demanding tolerance for their backwardness, their misogyny, their antisemitism, and the genocidal hatred that is regularly preached in their mosques.\u201d</p> <p>Although it was an emotional time, that sounds more like he\u2019s damning Muslims in total rather than Islam itself. \u201cIt <em>was</em> an emotional time,\u201d he replies, \u201cand that [passage] has a fair amount of topspin and it\u2019s not caveated at all, but it is, nonetheless, descriptively true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed6e322cb11918c34ac0b574a0d51d36526c071e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed6e322cb11918c34ac0b574a0d51d36526c071e/88_0_1793_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Four Horsemen: Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Four Horsemen: Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em>The Four Horsemen,</em> the incompatibility of Islam and secular humanist values comes up in one of the few moments of group dispute. The discussion turns to the issue of comparative religious malevolence. Dawkins characterises this as \u201cwhether Islam is worse than Christianity\u201d. Hitchens takes the view that all religions are \u201clatently\u201d equally dangerous. But Harris rejects this pussyfooting egalitarianism.</p> <p>\u201cThe mayhem that\u2019s going on under the aegis of Islam just cannot be compared to the fact that we have two people a decade who kill abortionists,\u201d he tells the other three.</p> <p>That a great deal of the mayhem then going on was in Iraq, which had just been devastated by the US-led invasion, is left aside. There is an air of bristling doom that hangs over the original discussion and can still be detected in the book. It\u2019s as if the participants, rather like their religious foes, expect a great catastrophic showdown between the secular and religious worlds.</p> <p>At the end, there\u2019s a rather bleak moment, when Harris asks what their hopes and fears are for the future, and what can be achieved in their children\u2019s lifetimes. Hitchens says that while they may be winning the argument intellectually, in global terms he and his fellow secularists are in \u201ca tiny, dwindling minority that\u2019s going to be defeated by the forces of theocracy\u201d. The true defenders of secularism, proclaims Hitchens, are the 82nd Airborne infantry division.</p> <p>Does Harris share that militaristic appraisal?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that we can lose sight of for months or even years at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to erupt at some point. It\u2019s hard to see how this violence is ever going to resolve itself without a fundamental reformation in the Muslim community. That\u2019s hard to imagine at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>After that meeting of the Horsemen, Harris went on to complete a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. He has since written about consciousness from a materialist, scientific perspective, making the case that what we think of as free will is an illusion. But he has also explored it from what, for want of a better phrase, can only be described as a spiritual outlook. As a longtime exponent of meditation, as well as a practitioner of the martial art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Harris has a side to his character that, by comparison with his three collaborators, makes him look less like a New Atheist than some Californian New Ager. In the discussion he tells them that there is \u201ca place for the sacred in our lives\u201d, and Dawkins looks askance, as if Harris were about to get out a prayer mat.</p> <p>Yet for such a combative rationalist, he remains incongruously keen on what the besandalled used to call self-transcendence. One of his more recent books was entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/24/spiritualism-happiness-oliver-burkeman\" title=\"\">Waking Up: </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/24/spiritualism-happiness-oliver-burkeman\" title=\"\">Searching for Spirituality Without Religion</a></em>. Harris sees no contradiction between his objective studies of the mind and the subjective experience of escaping its perpetual noise. They\u2019re both means of understanding consciousness, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat we\u2019re here and experiencing the world at each moment in the light of our consciousness is a deeply mysterious and profound fact, which, the more you pay attention to it, the more your experience begins to echo some of the claims of religious patriarchs and matriarchs down the ages.\u201d</p> <p>He says the west could learn a lot from the east \u2013 not Islam, but the traditions of meditation found in Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With meditation you recognise there is another possibility. It's the practice of learning to break the spell and wake up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are sleepwalking, and when you learn how to meditate, you recognise that there is another possibility, which is to be vividly aware of your experience in each moment in a way that frees you from routine misery. Meditation is simply the practice of learning to break the spell and wake up.\u201d </p> <p>Harris, no slouch when it comes to the commercial possibilities of new tech, has just released a meditation app. Despite all this, when I ask him what this spirituality answers to in his character, he says something I find quite unexpected.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to live our lives with more than just understanding facts,\u201d he says. \u201cNot being wrong is not the ultimate state of being for people in this life.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s right, or ought to be, but it\u2019s hard to think of someone who seems more determined not to be wrong than Harris. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s bombastic or overbearing, but in his understated delivery, he is remarkably persistent in making his case. Listeners to his highly popular <em><a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcast/\" title=\"\">Making Sense</a></em><a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcast/\" title=\"\"> podcast</a> (previously called <em>Waking Up</em>) will be familiar with this quality.</p> <p>He is talented at guiding his guests \u2013 people such as Stephen Fry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-pinker\" title=\"\">Steven Pinker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ynharari.com/\" title=\"\">Yuval Noah Harari</a> \u2013 into deep reflection on their subject matters. But he can also get pedantically confrontational if he thinks he has been misinterpreted. One example was an argument that Harris conducted with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein\" title=\"\">Ezra Klein, editor-at-large of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein\" title=\"\">Vox</a></em>, and a persistent critic of Harris\u2019s. The cause of the dispute was the fact that Harris had invited Charles Murray on to his podcast, and given him what Klein thought was a soft ride.</p> <p>Murray is the co-author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/06/bell-curve-author-charles-murray-speaks-out-after-speech-cut-short-by-protests\" title=\"\">The Bell Curve</a></em>, one of the most controversial books of the past few decades, which, among other things, examined the average difference of intelligence between blacks and whites in America. Murray has been accused of racism, of making the case for eugenics and a range of other unpleasant charges, and he is routinely no-platformed at universities and in many areas of the media.</p> <p>Intriguingly, in <em>The Four Horsem</em><em>en</em>, during a conversation about things that might be true but should not be discussed, Harris idly cites <em>The Bell Curve</em> as a potential example. Hitchens dismisses the idea, by saying that no one among them agreed with the book\u2019s findings, and the conversation comes to an abrupt end. What had changed that caused Harris to invite Murray on to his show?</p> <p>\u201cI had accepted this fairly widespread impression that <em>The Bell Curve</em> was, on some level, a racist monstrosity,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI hadn\u2019t read it. I had never interacted with Murray, and so I accepted all the bad press that he got.\u201d</p> <p>But having gone through his own monstering, after the Affleck incident, Harris decided to find out if Murray deserved his, and concluded that he didn\u2019t. Klein disagreed, and, after Harris published their angry email exchange, they went at each other for two hours of unyielding debate on the podcast. </p> <p>But Harris insists he\u2019s concerned about social justice and says that if we want to converge on what\u2019s fair we must \u201cstep outside of our identities\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Back in the middle of the first decade of this century, a new movement was heralded by the publication of several books on the same subject. The main four authors were Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris. And the movement was called the New Atheism. At the time, Harris, who was actually the first to publish, with his book The End of Faith, was unquestionably the junior partner. The others had global reputations in their fields \u2013 Dawkins in evolutionary biology, Hitchens in journalism and public speaking, and Dennett in philosophy and cognitive science. All Harris had was his book and a BA in philosophy. The four, who would become known as the Four Horsemen, got together in 2007 at Hitchens\u2019s apartment in Washington to discuss arguments for atheism or, more accurately, against faith. The event was recorded and is available to watch on Youtube. By some way the youngest, Harris looks a little as if Ben Stiller, whom he physically resembles, had joined a meeting of great minds and made a good fist of being serious. He could easily have been the Ringo Starr of the quartet, but he more than holds his own. Now that conversation has been published in a book entitled The Four Horsemen, with a glowing foreword by Stephen Fry. It\u2019s an odd moment in history to revisit. The New Atheism has rather faded from prominence, partly because, as its proponents acknowledged, it was not very different from the old atheism. And partly because it was a product of the \u2018war on terror\u2019, or at least an intellectual response to what that war was ostensibly targeting: namely, radical Islam. Today, Dawkins and Dennett are in their late 70s, and no longer quite as active, and Hitchens, the most charismatic of them all, is dead. That leaves Harris to uphold the cause, which he has done with great energy. Today he is one of the best-known public intellectuals in America, thanks to a series of bestsellers, his podcast, and a celebrated altercation with the Hollywood actor Ben Affleck, of which more later. But first, on the phone to Los Angeles, I ask Harris how well he knew his fellow Horsemen. \u201cI think I met Hitch in 2007, when God Is Not Great was just about to launch,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in person very many times. I knew Richard and Dan longer than that \u2013 mostly an email relationship. As I say in my introduction to the book [The Four Horsemen], I was surprised that that was in fact the only conversation the four of us had ever had.\u201d Its uniqueness is a selling point of the book, which is subtitled: The Discussion that Sparked an Atheist Revolution. That may be a little hyperbolic, but it\u2019s true that the gathering has gained a certain historical significance, not to mention mythology. The four men \u2013 or should we, in the era of identity politics, say the four white, heterosexual men \u2013 have become heroes, less to an atheist movement than to an outspokenly rationalist one. There is a growing divide between those who trumpet empirical evidence and those who question the cultural and social conditions to which empiricism remains blind. Harris is very definitely located at the forefront of the former group, and is widely loathed by those who are in the latter \u2013 a designation that would include many on the postmodern left. On internet chatrooms and in online debates, he is a ubiquitous reference point, a lightning conductor in many contemporary social and intellectual disagreements. He is often referred to as a racist, an Islamophobe and a prime example of white entitlement. He contests all the accusations, but they haven\u2019t gone away. Perhaps the moment that Harris became identified in the wider American public\u2019s eye as a contentious figure was his run-in four years ago with Affleck on the satirical TV show Real Time With Bill Maher. During a debate on Islam, the Hollywood star accused Harris of Islamophobia and racism. The powerfully built Affleck was full of righteous passion and, although Harris remained calm and tried to get his point across, the smaller man appeared intimidated by the actor\u2019s physical and celebrity presence. Harris says it wasn\u2019t until they were walking off stage that he really found his voice. \u201cI said: \u2018You know that if we decided to burn a Bible on live television tonight it would be controversial, but it wouldn\u2019t ruin our lives. If we decided to burn a Qur\u2019an on the show tonight, the rest of our lives would be spent dealing with the aftermath, and you know that and you\u2019re lying about it.\u2019\u201d It was a very Harris-like observation: a telling comparison, a vivid image and a stark moral challenge. These are his stock in trade methods, the kind of debating points that rally his fans and enrage his enemies. Harris was something of a frustrated writer and a failed novelist when he found his subject. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 turned him into a nonfiction writer overnight. \u201cThe End of Faith was a direct response to those events,\u201d he says. \u201cI literally began writing it on 9/12 or 9/13. The moment it became clear what had happened, it was clear that I needed to write that book.\u201d He had not long before completed a philosophy degree at Stanford University, having taken an 11-year break from an English degree he had been doing. In that earlier university stint he had experimented with MDMA, which led to an interest in meditation, studying in India and Nepal and two years on silent retreat in one-week to three-month increments. His life in those days sounds like something from a Herman Hesse novel \u2013 lots of reading philosophy, contemplation, and nothing so dull as a day job. Throughout his long educational and professional lacuna, he was supported by his parents, the actor Berkeley Harris and the TV producer Susan Harris, who created The Golden Girls (his parents divorced when he was two). \u201cIt was a blessing and a curse,\u201d he says of their financial backing, because while he was able to read, write and do what he wanted, he neglected to build a career in writing. The End of Faith changed all that. Its core thesis was quite simple. Ideologies or belief systems, Harris argued, inform actions. You can look at social, ethnic, class and cultural backgrounds of the people who, for example, commit suicide bombings and no unifying pattern will emerge. But what they overwhelming share is a belief system or, more specifically, a faith. It\u2019s an argument he has made many times, and most particularly directed towards the faith of Islam. He repeats it again to me. \u201cThere\u2019s only one religion on Earth that poses this problem to civil society. The Mormons don\u2019t do this. The fundamentalist Christians don\u2019t do this. I mean, they do it in places like Uganda, but they don\u2019t do it in many places, even in a developing world.\u201d Statistically speaking, Harris is on strong ground, though there are many other factors that could be taken into account. But it\u2019s when he strays from strict definitions to general assertions that he gets into trouble, and that has led to the accusations of Islamophobia. He rejects the term, drawing a distinction between attacking Islam, a set of codified beliefs, and demonising Muslims, an enormous and varied group of people. I quote him something he wrote in the wake of the Danish cartoons crisis back in 2006: \u201cThroughout western Europe, Muslim immigrants show little inclination to acquire the secular and civil values of their host countries, and yet exploit these values to the utmost \u2013 demanding tolerance for their backwardness, their misogyny, their antisemitism, and the genocidal hatred that is regularly preached in their mosques.\u201d Although it was an emotional time, that sounds more like he\u2019s damning Muslims in total rather than Islam itself. \u201cIt was an emotional time,\u201d he replies, \u201cand that [passage] has a fair amount of topspin and it\u2019s not caveated at all, but it is, nonetheless, descriptively true.\u201d In The Four Horsemen, the incompatibility of Islam and secular humanist values comes up in one of the few moments of group dispute. The discussion turns to the issue of comparative religious malevolence. Dawkins characterises this as \u201cwhether Islam is worse than Christianity\u201d. Hitchens takes the view that all religions are \u201clatently\u201d equally dangerous. But Harris rejects this pussyfooting egalitarianism. \u201cThe mayhem that\u2019s going on under the aegis of Islam just cannot be compared to the fact that we have two people a decade who kill abortionists,\u201d he tells the other three. That a great deal of the mayhem then going on was in Iraq, which had just been devastated by the US-led invasion, is left aside. There is an air of bristling doom that hangs over the original discussion and can still be detected in the book. It\u2019s as if the participants, rather like their religious foes, expect a great catastrophic showdown between the secular and religious worlds. At the end, there\u2019s a rather bleak moment, when Harris asks what their hopes and fears are for the future, and what can be achieved in their children\u2019s lifetimes. Hitchens says that while they may be winning the argument intellectually, in global terms he and his fellow secularists are in \u201ca tiny, dwindling minority that\u2019s going to be defeated by the forces of theocracy\u201d. The true defenders of secularism, proclaims Hitchens, are the 82nd Airborne infantry division. Does Harris share that militaristic appraisal? \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that we can lose sight of for months or even years at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to erupt at some point. It\u2019s hard to see how this violence is ever going to resolve itself without a fundamental reformation in the Muslim community. That\u2019s hard to imagine at the moment.\u201d After that meeting of the Horsemen, Harris went on to complete a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. He has since written about consciousness from a materialist, scientific perspective, making the case that what we think of as free will is an illusion. But he has also explored it from what, for want of a better phrase, can only be described as a spiritual outlook. As a longtime exponent of meditation, as well as a practitioner of the martial art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Harris has a side to his character that, by comparison with his three collaborators, makes him look less like a New Atheist than some Californian New Ager. In the discussion he tells them that there is \u201ca place for the sacred in our lives\u201d, and Dawkins looks askance, as if Harris were about to get out a prayer mat. Yet for such a combative rationalist, he remains incongruously keen on what the besandalled used to call self-transcendence. One of his more recent books was entitled Waking Up: Searching for Spirituality Without Religion. Harris sees no contradiction between his objective studies of the mind and the subjective experience of escaping its perpetual noise. They\u2019re both means of understanding consciousness, he says. \u201cThat we\u2019re here and experiencing the world at each moment in the light of our consciousness is a deeply mysterious and profound fact, which, the more you pay attention to it, the more your experience begins to echo some of the claims of religious patriarchs and matriarchs down the ages.\u201d He says the west could learn a lot from the east \u2013 not Islam, but the traditions of meditation found in Hinduism and Buddhism. \u201cWe are sleepwalking, and when you learn how to meditate, you recognise that there is another possibility, which is to be vividly aware of your experience in each moment in a way that frees you from routine misery. Meditation is simply the practice of learning to break the spell and wake up.\u201d Harris, no slouch when it comes to the commercial possibilities of new tech, has just released a meditation app. Despite all this, when I ask him what this spirituality answers to in his character, he says something I find quite unexpected. \u201cWe need to live our lives with more than just understanding facts,\u201d he says. \u201cNot being wrong is not the ultimate state of being for people in this life.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s right, or ought to be, but it\u2019s hard to think of someone who seems more determined not to be wrong than Harris. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s bombastic or overbearing, but in his understated delivery, he is remarkably persistent in making his case. Listeners to his highly popular Making Sense podcast (previously called Waking Up) will be familiar with this quality. He is talented at guiding his guests \u2013 people such as Stephen Fry, Steven Pinker, Yuval Noah Harari \u2013 into deep reflection on their subject matters. But he can also get pedantically confrontational if he thinks he has been misinterpreted. One example was an argument that Harris conducted with Ezra Klein, editor-at-large of Vox, and a persistent critic of Harris\u2019s. The cause of the dispute was the fact that Harris had invited Charles Murray on to his podcast, and given him what Klein thought was a soft ride. Murray is the co-author of The Bell Curve, one of the most controversial books of the past few decades, which, among other things, examined the average difference of intelligence between blacks and whites in America. Murray has been accused of racism, of making the case for eugenics and a range of other unpleasant charges, and he is routinely no-platformed at universities and in many areas of the media. Intriguingly, in The Four Horsemen, during a conversation about things that might be true but should not be discussed, Harris idly cites The Bell Curve as a potential example. Hitchens dismisses the idea, by saying that no one among them agreed with the book\u2019s findings, and the conversation comes to an abrupt end. What had changed that caused Harris to invite Murray on to his show? \u201cI had accepted this fairly widespread impression that The Bell Curve was, on some level, a racist monstrosity,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI hadn\u2019t read it. I had never interacted with Murray, and so I accepted all the bad press that he got.\u201d But having gone through his own monstering, after the Affleck incident, Harris decided to find out if Murray deserved his, and concluded that he didn\u2019t. Klein disagreed, and, after Harris published their angry email exchange, they went at each other for two hours of unyielding debate on the podcast. But Harris insists he\u2019s concerned about social justice and says that if we want to converge on what\u2019s fair we must \u201cstep outside of our identities\u201d. He believes that it\u2019s when identity forms the basis for political activism that society suffers. \u201cThat\u2019s guaranteed to amplify almost everything we don\u2019t want,\u201d he says. Identity, consciousness, faith, reason: they\u2019re the capital-letter concepts that are at the centre of so many contemporary debates. And never far away, reliably dividing opinion, is the quietly spoken Harris, the fourth horseman riding confidently out on his own. \u2022 The Four Horsemen: The Discussion That Sparked an Atheist Revolution is published by Bantam Press (\u00a39.99).

In Berlin, however, we\u2019ve learned to expect something more like a tofu bratwurst with extra broccoli. This festival tends to be stodgy and not obviously appetising, but you generally hope that it will at least be good for you. This year it was barely that, and the broccoli was decidedly wilted.</p> <p>Everyone expected that festival director Dieter Kosslick, in his 18th and final Berlinale, would pull out some farewell fireworks. Yet 2019 gave us the dreariest competition anyone could remember. You can only feel sympathy for the jury, headed by Juliette Binoche. The opening film was shockingly insipid. Lone Scherfig (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/01/an-education-review\" title=\"\">An Education</a></em>) came a cropper with <em>The Kindness of Strangers</em>, an ensemble story about a bunch of outsiders crossing paths in New York and generally being endearingly nice to each other.</p> <p>They include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/14/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Zoe Kazan</a> as a mother on the run from her abusive husband, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrea-riseborough\" title=\"\">Andrea Riseborough</a> as a nurse who wears herself out helping others, but neglects to be good to herself. Bill Nighy does one of his languidly offhand comedy routines as a Russian called Timofey, later revealed as plain Tim; you suspect it became apparent in mid-shoot that Nighy\u2019s bizarre accent was fooling no one.</p> <p>Among other clunkers, Yuval Adler\u2019s non-competing thriller <em>The Operative</em> starred Diane Kruger as an undercover Mossad agent in Iran, and Martin Freeman as her increasingly flustered handler: an altogether indigestible platter of Le Carr\u00e9-wurst. And Spanish director Isabel Coixet offered the dramatically inert, clunkily prettified black-and-white <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qMqZzBTDmA\" title=\"\">Elisa </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qMqZzBTDmA\" title=\"\">y Marcela</a></em>, the true story of a fin-de-siecle lesbian couple, garnished with sex scenes that were all white-lace decorum \u2013 even with an octopus on hand to spice things up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2294ff80138e2dd38b02a563c024bc1b6399e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2294ff80138e2dd38b02a563c024bc1b6399e88/64_0_1438_863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Kruger and Martin Freeman in The Operative.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Clunker\u2019: Yuval Adler\u2019s The Operative, with Diane Kruger and Martin Freeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kolja Brandt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also something genuinely abhorrent on offer: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1PWtwUDpdQ\" title=\"\">The Golden Glove</a></em> by Fatih Akin, the German director who won the Golden Bear here in 2004 with his <em>Head-On</em>. The subject was serial killer Fritz Honka, who chose his female victims from the alcoholic regulars at a Hamburg bar in the 1970s. With its meticulously art-directed squalor, the film revels in ugliness and ostensibly black-comic nausea, and generally shows leering contempt for its characters. With its plethora of schnapps and sausage, and kitsch soundtrack of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music\" title=\"\">schlager ballads</a>, it also comes across as an expression of loathing for working-class German culture, making it both queasy and condescending.</p> <p>There was a different kind of controversy in the last-minute withdrawal of <em>One Second</em>, by the Chinese maestro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/zhang-yimou\" title=\"\">Zhang Yimou</a>, on the grounds of \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d. That is understood to be a euphemism covering disapproval by the Chinese authorities, here most likely because the film addresses the sensitive topic of the Cultural Revolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d6468db5095f96b0353c363c417eb3ca020317a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6468db5095f96b0353c363c417eb3ca020317a/186_0_2767_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seu Jorge stars in Wagner Moura\u2019s Marighella:  a \u2018timely call to arms\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seu Jorge stars in Wagner Moura\u2019s Marighella: <br> a \u2018timely call to arms\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: o2 films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet another Chinese competition film, Wang Xiaoshuai\u2019s <em>So Long, My Son</em>, addresses the aftermath of that period in a complex and provocative manner. Set over several decades, it\u2019s a labyrinthine family chronicle tracing the social and psychic repercussions of China\u2019s one-child policy. Narratively perplexing and, at three hours, a daunting watch, this was nevertheless the one truly ambitious title I saw in competition.</p> <p>By contrast, two major names offered watchable but rather academic items. The prolific <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/francois-ozon\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Ozon</a> put his impishness aside with the solid but unthrilling <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JywE77VYpWc\" title=\"\">By the Grace of God</a></em>, a docudrama about a group of men seeking redress for childhood abuse by a priest. Agnieszka Holland\u2019s <em>Mr </em><em>Jones</em> told the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, whose report on the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s inspired George Orwell\u2019s <em>Animal Farm</em>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/02/james-norton-tv-producers-also-typecast-against-posh-actors\" title=\"\">James Norton</a> excels in an unshowy lead performance, and the section detailing his journey is a panorama of wintry bleakness and genuine lived horror.</p> <p>There was also one out-of-competition blast: <em>Marighella</em>, by the Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/16/narcos-mexico-review-netflix-series-michael-pena-diego-luna-felix-gallardo\" title=\"\">Narcos</a></em> and favela drama <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb-rUfBTQ1g\" title=\"\">Elite Squad</a></em>, Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear of 2008. Its subject is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Marighella\" title=\"\">Carlos Marighella</a>, who led a militant cell against Brazil\u2019s dictatorship in the 60s.

      "bodyText": "If film festivals were banquets, the signature dish of a vintage Cannes would be a rich, piquant bouillabaisse; of a good Sundance, a juicy burger dripping with relish. In Berlin, however, we\u2019ve learned to expect something more like a tofu bratwurst with extra broccoli. This festival tends to be stodgy and not obviously appetising, but you generally hope that it will at least be good for you. This year it was barely that, and the broccoli was decidedly wilted. Everyone expected that festival director Dieter Kosslick, in his 18th and final Berlinale, would pull out some farewell fireworks. Yet 2019 gave us the dreariest competition anyone could remember. You can only feel sympathy for the jury, headed by Juliette Binoche. The opening film was shockingly insipid. Lone Scherfig (An Education) came a cropper with The Kindness of Strangers, an ensemble story about a bunch of outsiders crossing paths in New York and generally being endearingly nice to each other. They include Zoe Kazan as a mother on the run from her abusive husband, and Andrea Riseborough as a nurse who wears herself out helping others, but neglects to be good to herself. Bill Nighy does one of his languidly offhand comedy routines as a Russian called Timofey, later revealed as plain Tim; you suspect it became apparent in mid-shoot that Nighy\u2019s bizarre accent was fooling no one. Among other clunkers, Yuval Adler\u2019s non-competing thriller The Operative starred Diane Kruger as an undercover Mossad agent in Iran, and Martin Freeman as her increasingly flustered handler: an altogether indigestible platter of Le Carr\u00e9-wurst. And Spanish director Isabel Coixet offered the dramatically inert, clunkily prettified black-and-white Elisa y Marcela, the true story of a fin-de-siecle lesbian couple, garnished with sex scenes that were all white-lace decorum \u2013 even with an octopus on hand to spice things up. There was also something genuinely abhorrent on offer: The Golden Glove by Fatih Akin, the German director who won the Golden Bear here in 2004 with his Head-On. The subject was serial killer Fritz Honka, who chose his female victims from the alcoholic regulars at a Hamburg bar in the 1970s. With its meticulously art-directed squalor, the film revels in ugliness and ostensibly black-comic nausea, and generally shows leering contempt for its characters. With its plethora of schnapps and sausage, and kitsch soundtrack of schlager ballads, it also comes across as an expression of loathing for working-class German culture, making it both queasy and condescending. There was a different kind of controversy in the last-minute withdrawal of One Second, by the Chinese maestro Zhang Yimou, on the grounds of \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d. That is understood to be a euphemism covering disapproval by the Chinese authorities, here most likely because the film addresses the sensitive topic of the Cultural Revolution. And yet another Chinese competition film, Wang Xiaoshuai\u2019s So Long, My Son, addresses the aftermath of that period in a complex and provocative manner. Set over several decades, it\u2019s a labyrinthine family chronicle tracing the social and psychic repercussions of China\u2019s one-child policy. Narratively perplexing and, at three hours, a daunting watch, this was nevertheless the one truly ambitious title I saw in competition. By contrast, two major names offered watchable but rather academic items. The prolific Fran\u00e7ois Ozon put his impishness aside with the solid but unthrilling By the Grace of God, a docudrama about a group of men seeking redress for childhood abuse by a priest. Agnieszka Holland\u2019s Mr Jones told the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, whose report on the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s inspired George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm. James Norton excels in an unshowy lead performance, and the section detailing his journey is a panorama of wintry bleakness and genuine lived horror. There was also one out-of-competition blast: Marighella, by the Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, of Narcos and favela drama Elite Squad, Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear of 2008. Its subject is Carlos Marighella, who led a militant cell against Brazil\u2019s dictatorship in the 60s. Singer/actor Seu Jorge is intensely authoritative in the lead, Moura directs with vim and commitment, in the vein of The Battle of Algiers, and Marighella comes across as a timely, impassioned call to arms as the Bolsonaro regime sets up shop. Finally, Varda by Agn\u00e8s was essentially a filmed masterclass, with French doyenne Agn\u00e8s Varda, now 90, proving that it\u2019s possible both to have longevity and to constantly reinvent yourself. With the festival\u2019s new artistic director, Carlo Chatrian, coming in next year from experimentally leaning festival Locarno, it\u2019s a lesson that the Berlinale is likely to take to heart. The best of Berlin Best discovery A hit direct from Sundance: Alejandro Landes\u2019s Monos, a fiery Colombian drama, realist but with a hallucinatory twist, about a group of teenage guerrillas stationed in the wilderness. British composer Mica Levi (Under the Skin) offers a score heavy with timpani and \u2019copter-blade throbs, to match the intensity of this junior Apocalypse Now. Best performances In competition: Valerie Pachneras an executive unravelling in The Ground Beneath My Feet, a promising Austrian psychodrama by Marie Kreutzer.

Major culprits are the fistfuls of rice or oily flatbreads that accompany virtually every traditional meal, Joseph says. \u201cI realised that one cup of jackfruit has 40% less carbohydrate than a cup of rice, and four times the fibre,\u201d he says. He signals for a waiter, who brings a plate of fish fried in batter made with one-quarter jackfruit flour. The main course is pizza, the base of which is also partly jackfruit flour. I can\u2019t taste the fruit in either dish. \u201cExactly,\u201d Joseph says excitedly. \u201cYou are eating a green fruit that behaves like bread.\u201d He is working with doctors to check out other health benefits. One paper he has co-authored with an oncologist, and which will be presented at a cancer conference in Spain in July, claims that a jackfruit diet can help to maintain white blood cell levels in people undergoing chemotherapy. Another study, to be presented in Rome in April, claims the use of diabetes medication fell in Kerala during jackfruit season last year, when the government was heavily promoting the consumption of its new state fruit. Joseph quit his job at Microsoft and now works in the jackfruit business full-time. \u201cThe company kept asking me to come back, but I said, look, I can\u2019t stop this any more,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have something of this impact, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d",

Maybe it\u2019s because they can scent silverware on the February breeze. It certainly feels that way with Brighton who, Chris Hughton says, will use the Cup as a welcome \u201cdistraction\u201d from their nosediving form in the Premier League. With big Premier League clubs such as Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs having been dumped out already \u2013 and one of Chelsea or Manchester United to follow \u2013 does Hughton think the draw has opened up a bit? </p> <p>\u201cIf we start thinking beyond that then we won\u2019t get past a very good Derby side,\u201d said the Seagulls\u2019 ever-respectful boss. \u201cBut it is definitely a great opportunity for somebody. And we are part of that group of teams. It\u2019s unusual for so many Premier League teams to be out at this stage. There\u2019s a really good opportunity for somebody to get through to the latter stages, which for a club like ourselves is deemed a success.\u201d</p> <p>Hughton will have the advantage, like every other manager who Derby face these days, of having been given a Marcelo Bielsa masterclass in how to pick the Rams apart. Though actually putting a Bielsa lesson in tactics into practice is another thing altogether \u2013 and Derby have actually gone unbeaten since losing at Leeds on 11 January so are feeling pretty perky.

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s all from me. Brighton are into the quarter-finals. Derby\u2019s FA Cup run is done. I\u2019ll be back later to see if Newport can cause a PROPER FA CUP SHOCK against Man City. Join me if you like. Bye. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from the Amex: A Cole goal stat! Anthony Knockaert speaks. He says that the Cup win should hopefully give them some momentum for their next Premier League game, against Leicester. \u201cWe know it won\u2019t be an easy game against Leicester but it is always better to go there with a victory.\u201d Bruno joins him on the pitch too. He says that his team will look to go deep in the competition now. Well, they\u2019re one win away from a Wembley semi-final. Derby were much better in the second half, with Cole bringing a bit of assuredness to their play and helping them get forwards. His goal was a very good header too. But Brighton deservedly go through. They were the better team, despite the late jitters. It will givep Chris Hughton\u2019s side some confidence going into their relegation battle too. 90+4 min: Derby win a free-kick. It\u2019s last chance-saloon time. Roos races up from goal for it. Cole swings it in, but it\u2019s over Roos and Brighton clear. Peep! 90+3 min: There\u2019s an almighty stramash in the Derby penalty area after Brighton break and a collection of players converge only for Roos to emerge with the ball. Bruno calls for VAR to be used as he believes there was a foul but I couldn\u2019t tell you what happened if I watched it 10 times over. 90+2 min: Derby win a corner but Brighton defend it diligently. It\u2019s floated back into the box by Bogle and Tomori forgets that he\u2019s a centre-back and tries the acrobatics, hooking the ball over his shoulder but getting little contact and watching it dribble through to Button. 90 min: Button drops a clanger! But gets away with it. he drops a routine cross from the right, with Waghorn sniffing. But it drops kindly for the keeper who paws it away just as Wilson\u2019s eyes had lit up. 88 min: Wilson thuds the ball into Duffy\u2019s head again! Doink! Another brain-rattler for the big centre-back to shake off. And the ball drops kindly for Brighton to break, Knockaert finding Gyokeres, who sprints through on goal in the inside-left channel before sidefooting into the midriff of Roos. That could have been game, set, match but Derby are still in this. 86 min: A bit of housekeeping. Locadia was replaced by Gyokeres. And Bissouma, who has had a fine game, is taken off and in his stead trots Pascal Gross. Not a bad replacement. Hughton will hope this substitution upsets Derby\u2019s rhythm. 84 min: Brighton have the jitters all right now. Under no pressure, Bruno, who has oodles of experience but shows little of it here, heads out for a corner. From that the ball is headed at goal by Tomori and tipped over by Button. Yes, Ashley Cole! Huddlestone pings another beauty in behind the Brighton defence to the onrushing Bogle. He knocks the ball into the six-yard box first-time, where Burn makes a hash of clearing it, poking the ball at Cole, who heads into the empty goal as Button had rushed out. Well, well, well. Game on! 79 min: Locadia is thankfully able to hobble off. Replays showed his left ankle rolled over on the touchline. 78 min: Locadia has just screamed out above the din of the crowd after crumbling to the floor with no one around him. the Brighton physios are straight over to him and play continues, as he is just about off the pitch. While that goes on, Cole looks for Marriott at the back post with a beautifully curled in cross, but Burn hooks the ball against Waghorn and out for a goal-kick. 76 min: The corner is swung in deep, where Duffy knocks it down towards Locadia, who arcs his back and wallops a volley over his shoulder and straight at Roos, whose palms must be stinging violently after staying strong and keeping that out. A great stop. 75 min: Cole hooks the ball away from Bruno, who was on the overlap behind him. It\u2019s a corner for Brighton. What a matchup that was. There are 76 years shared by the Brighton captain and Cole. 72 min: Nugent is replaced by Jozefzoon, who should have a bit more zip about his game than the departing old-timer. 70 min: Locadia turns Tomori much too easily on the halfway line and releases Knockaert, who has clear grass ahead of him. He scurries to the edge of the penalty area and tries to curl a low left-footer around Roos, who does well to stretch ever sinew to tip the ball around the post. 68 min: Cole has definitely helped Derby to get the ball out from the back in the patient manner Lampard prefers. He\u2019s more often than not finding a pass inside or down the line. Duffy has just made a wonderful sliding interception to nick the ball away from Waghorn, who was trying to nip in ahead of him on the inside-right channel. Duffy has been rock-solid. 66 min: \u201cYou would think that having a Marriott on the pitch would at least bring Derby rewards,\u201d honks Ian Copestake, who may be on commission. 64 min: Huddlestone drills a glorious ball out wide to Nugent, who holds the ball up well, then finds support before the ball is shuffled back to the Hud once more. This time he pings the ball out to Cole on the left, who wins a corner. The corner, like most, comes to nothing but Huddlestone was majestic there, like a magnetic planet-sized passmaster. His pings are so accurate. If only they could get him on the ball more. 62 min: Wilson picks out Marriott on the overlap. The substitute skidaddles into the box and cuts back inside, but he wallops his shot at Burn and Brighton clear. Promising for Derby, though. 61 min: Duffy meanders his way into the Derby penalty area. He\u2019s got five goals this season and he senses another, but Tomori is all over him like a nasty rash. He nicks the ball away and eventually clears over near the touchline. 60 min: While there is bugger all happening, I\u2019ll let Sean Cole ask you a question: Do you appreciate Ashley Cole enough? 59 min: Knockaert swings it in and Roos collects it on his goal-line under no pressure. 58 min: \u201cThe seagulls here in Brighton are aggressive scavengers \u2013 glad to see their footballing namesakes are letting no opportunity pass them by,\u201d writes Andrew Benton. \u201cBut the stadium was very quiet when I passed through the railway station next door a few mins ago - quiet confidence, must be.\u201d Or perhaps it was half-time. Brighton have won a corner. It could get noisy now. 56 min: Waghorn slides past Kayal and clips him on his way. The pace has completely dropped off now that Brighton are sitting back. It\u2019s up to Derby to raise it. 54 min: Brighton have stopped pressing Derby high up the pitch. The away side are now finding it much easier to work the ball forwards. It always fascinates me that teams invariably sit back when they get a comfortable lead. I know they fear being caught on the break but not being in possession is a dangerous tactic in itself. Perhaps Brighton are more comfortable playing that way. 52 min: The Derby fans are in good voice after that attack. They\u2019re giving it some welly in the away end. Cole responds and tries to roll back the years and dribble past Knockaert, who sticks to his task and wins back possession diligently. 49 min: Huddlestone pings a crossfield ball to Bogle on the right. He sidefoots a cross towards Waghorn on the edge of the box, but he feints to shoot and lets the ball fall behind him to Wilson, who drills a shot at goal that Duffy clears with his head. He\u2019ll be seeing stars after that. It thumped into his forehead. 47 min: Marriott will play up front alongside Nugent and Cole will perhaps help Derby to play the ball out from the back with a little more calm assurance. Brighton have a little run up the right and win a corner but it comes to nothing. 45 min: Two changes for Derby. Jack Marriott is on for Duane Holmes and Ashley Cole is on for Scott Malone. \u201cNaively I hoped this might be on actual TV,\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cAlas the nearest I could find was Man v Food.\u201d Brighton v Derby could turn into Man v Food, Ian. Derby have put the ball on a plate for Brighton in midfield on more than one occasion. They just need to be hungrier in front of goal and gobble up their chances when they get them. I\u2019m off to get a half-time cuppa. Gawp at the lovely pictures here while I\u2019m gone. And if you fancy a night out in that there London on Friday 15 March, come and watch Guardian Football Weekly Live. I happen to be on it, but that\u2019s not why you should come. David Squires will be making a rare appearance. Maybe he\u2019ll bring his pens. And Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning will be doing their thing, as always, too. A fair scoreline. Derby haven\u2019t been at it, whereas Brighton\u2019s much-changed team have been full of beans and have jumped at the chance to show their manager that they deserve to play every week. Hughton will be delighted. Lamps will be reaching for the hairdryer. Brighton break and Bissouma has the ball on the edge of the box. He stands his man up and then touches the ball through Huddlestone\u2019s legs (I think), emerging on the other side with the ball before curling a wonderful left-footed effort towards the far post that has Roos stranded. It clatters the post and falls right in front of Locadia, who stabs home. Brilliant from Bissouma. 45+1 min: Waghorn only half connects with a shot at goal and then \u2026 44 min: At last Huddlestone has a second on the ball and carves open Brighton\u2019s defence with a fizzed in pass behind Bernardo to the onrushing Holmes. The Derby wide man looks up and has options in the box if he can ping it in first time, but the ball slams off his shin and whizzes out for a goal-kick. That was awful. What a waste. 42 min: Derby have a rare foray forwards and a hopeful cross is punched clear by Button. Brighton work it out to Jahanbakhsh on the left, who cuts inside and is brought down by Tomori, who slips into him having been bamboozled more than fouling him in the cynical fashion. The Brighton fans don;t see it that way. They call for a red card as Tomori is already on a booking. But David Coote is having none of it. He\u2019s having a good game. The free-kick is aimed at Duffy, but it\u2019s too high for him and bounces off his head and away to safety. 38 min: If Ashley Cole comes on at some point, we will have two 38-year-old full-backs on the pitch. Bruno is the other one. That can\u2019t have happened too often in any professional match. Full-backs have to cover the ground \u2013 you can\u2019t slack off in that position. 36 min: Brighton deserve that goal. They\u2019ve been the most energetic team \u2013 and the most pragmatic too. Derby\u2019s persistence in playing out from the back has been laudable but if the players aren\u2019t able to keep possession, they need to find another way to bring the ball out. Too often it is going to the full-backs, who are very quickly hassled out of possession. What a lovely goal. Bissouma, who has been Brighton\u2019s most lively player, plays a one-two with Jahanbakhsh on the left, before drilling a right footed cross low to the edge of the box. The one man Derby don\u2019t want running on to it, Knockaert, is the man running on to it \u2026 and he curls it low and sweet into Roos\u2019s bottom left corner with his right foot. What a delightful strike and a rare moment of quality at last. 30 min: Knockaert cuts in from the right and whips a shot round a defender and towards the far post with his cultured left foot that Roos does well to tip away. Brighton keep possession and Knockaert gets on the ball again, but Nugent shows his age as he gets beaten easily on the right and claws at Knockaert to bring him down. Free-kick. It\u2019s a decent ball in but Derby defend it admirably. 28 min: Wilson is booked for a hefty challenge on Kayal. But there\u2019s a VAR review to see if it should in fact be a red. It was a wild kick but his intention was to make contact with the ball and VAR agrees a yellow is adequate punishment. Quite right too. 25 min: Brighton race forwards in numbers and Jahanbakhsh finds Bissouma on the overlap. The midfielder hares into the box and his eyes light up as he sees a sliver of the goal from around 18 yards out \u2026 but he wallops a horrible right-footed effort well wide. Deary me. 22 min: \u2026 but it\u2019s Bissouma who mishits a daisycutter under the wall that bobbles towards Roos\u2019s bottom-left corner and requires him to palm it away at full stretch. What an odd free-kick. It would have been the simplest of saves had their been no wall. I still think more teams should try doing away with the wall. Maybe Pep will do it one day. He loves to be loved for innovation \u2026 20 min: Tomori is booked after clattering into Locadia from behind. It\u2019s the kind of challenge that was outlawed around 30 years ago. Locadia needs treatment. It\u2019s a concern for Hughton, as he has very little on the bench. Locadia\u2019s sock has been torn in that challenge. It\u2019s a sore one, all right. Brighton will have a free-kick absolutely smack, bang in the middle around 30 yards out. Knockaert is licking his lips again \u2026 17 min: Roos wallops a goal-kick clear and Burn gets caught out of possession, allowing Waghorn to race in behind him in the inside-right channel. He pops a short pass into Nugent\u2019s feet but his lay-off, intended for Waghorn, arrives at the feet of Holmes, who drills a cross into the box that is about 15 yards away rom the nearest Derby player. 15 min: Brighton are beginning to get on top now. Derby are playing it out from the back at every opportunity and the home side are cranking up the press in midfield and winning back possession with ease. Kayal stretches his legs down the left but his low cross is cut out and Derby clear \u2026 but only into midfield where Brighton win it back again. 13 min: Knockaert curls the free-kick left-footed towards Roos\u2019s top-right corner, where Roos is standing right under neath it. The Dutch keeper could probably catch it but opts to tip it over instead. Brighton\u2019s corner is slightly overhit and Bruno can\u2019t get a good connection on it with his forehead at the back post. It\u2019s still to take off this Cup tie. 12 min: Locadia is bundled over on the edge of the Derby box. Knockaert\u2019s eyes light up. It\u2019s 25 yards out on the right side of the D. 10 min: Huddlestone has a few touches of the ball. Each one delicate, like he is welcoming an old friend. 7 min: Bissouma races out of his own half with the ball like he means business. He picks up pace with Holmes tracking him as best he can. The Derby midfielder has a few nibbles and knocks Bissouma out of his stride as he enters the box. The home fans call for a penalty but there wasn\u2019t enough contact in my opinion. Bissouma was put off as much by the defenders approaching him in the box than Holmes behind him. It was a powerful run by the Brighton player though. More of that please and we may have ourselves a game. 6 min: Nugent is nudged off the ball by Duffy after the ball was drilled into him from midfield. Brighton break with Kayal but Derby harry and press and force the home side back into their own half. That was impressive defensive work by the Derby midfield. 4 min: Derby get on the ball and give the home side an impressive display of their comfortable short passing possession football, going sideways and backwards with ease but not finding the forward pass to trouble Brighton. 2 min: Brighton win a corner and play it short. Bissouma touches the ball past his man and whips in a cross towards Duffy on the back post, but it\u2019s just too high for the towering centre-back. 1 min: Brighton, in their customary blue and white stripes, get us under way. They\u2019re shooting from left to right on my TV, so build a picture of that in your heads. Derby, in a dark purple away strip, are going the other way. Brighton have the best of possession in the first throes of this Cup tie. There is a generous and warmly embraced minute\u2019s applause for Gordon Banks. What a goalkeeper. Richard Williams wrote a lovely tribute to a man who was the best goalie in the world at his peak. There could be extra-time and penalties today. Oh, and we have VAR. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t need much use of that particular technological advancement today. Let\u2019s keep it nice and simple. I stand by my prediction of 2-2 but I\u2019m not telling you which way I\u2019d sway if we do have spot-kicks. The teams emerge from the tunnel at the Amex. There\u2019s a decent crowd and the atmosphere\u2019s building nicely considering the early kick-off time. Brighton fans aren\u2019t taking the Cup lightly. They\u2019d love to see this flock of Seagulls emulate the Class of 83. Did I just say Flock of Seagulls? Ah, go on then. Alternative entrance music right here! I\u2019m intrigued to see how Huddlestone plays today. He\u2019s 32 now but even when he was 21 he played at the same leisurely pace that he does now. He can knock the ball around for fun if given time and space but if Brighton sit on him and stop him playing it could go a long way to upsetting Derby\u2019s rhythm. Frank Lampard was asked about this match earlier. Here\u2019s what he had to say: \u201cThe players enjoy testing themselves against Premier League sides. What we have done against Premier League teams is step up. We did it against Manchester United and Chelsea [in the League Cup] and the two games against Southampton. It\u2019s a nice test. Can we go one step further? We\u2019re getting closer to a dream of playing at Wembley. I\u2019ve really enjoyed working [with these players]. I think I\u2019ve changed. It\u2019s been an absolute bundle of experience. I\u2019m dealing with things better, prioritising and filtering out what\u2019s not important and what is. The \u2018what if\u2019 is round by round. Can we go one step further?\u201d Lampard Derby has restored midfielders Tom Huddlestone and Craig Bryson and forward David Nugent to his starting line-up. The trio came in for Bradley Johnson, the cup-tied Andy King and injured forward Tom Lawrence, while Jack Marriott was back on the bench after missing the last four games with illness and injury. Chris Hughton speaks. Glenn Murray is injured, apparently. \u201cWe have a few injuries which have been unfortunate. It\u2019s affected the bench we have. But it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to get to the next round. Yes, we\u2019re hopeful for [Glenn] for the next game. Occasionally [injuries] go against you and unfortunately it\u2019s this week. He was instrumental in the last round.\u201d On Derby: \u201cThey\u2019re in very good form, the fact that they\u2019ve knocked out who they have knocked out [Southampton in the last round], Frank has got them playing in a very exciting way. It\u2019s exactly the same as every other game we have here. We expect a tough game.\u201d Lewis Dunk is also unavailable due to a slight knocks, while Holland midfielder Davy Propper is suffering with illness. Only one of these teams have won the FA Cup before \u2026 Derby County in 1946, who beat Charlton 4-1 at Wembley in the first Cup final after the war. What a joyous day that must have been! Brighton made it to the final in 1983 and took Manchester United to a replay, which they lost 4-0. I hope they\u2019re not playing with those footballs in the main image. The one on the left looks like a 99p flyaway. Could cause havoc in the seaside breeze. As for Derby, Frank Lampard fields a strong team with only Tom Lawrence missing through injury and Andy King cup-tied. Ashley Cole, who has won the FA Cup more times than any other player, is on the bench. So Brighton make eight changes from the 3-1 defeat by Burnley and Glenn Murray is not in the squad. Where are the goals going to come from? It\u2019s time for Locadia and Knockaert to step up. Brighton: Button, Bruno, Duffy, Burn, Bernardo, Kayal, Stephens, Bissouma, Knockaert, Locadia, Jahanbakhsh. Subs: Sanchez, Montoya, Ostigard, Bong, Gross, Molumby, Gyokeres. Derby: Roos, Bryson, Tomori, Keogh, Wilson, Waghorn, Holmes, Nugent, Bogle, Huddlestone, Malone. Subs: Ravas, Wisdom, Jozefzoon, Marriott, Johnson, Evans. Cole. Referee: David Coote Hello readers! It\u2019s the fifth round of the FA Cup, when it starts to feel a bit more serious for clubs who perhaps haven\u2019t been fully invested in it until now. Maybe it\u2019s because they can scent silverware on the February breeze. It certainly feels that way with Brighton who, Chris Hughton says, will use the Cup as a welcome \u201cdistraction\u201d from their nosediving form in the Premier League. With big Premier League clubs such as Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs having been dumped out already \u2013 and one of Chelsea or Manchester United to follow \u2013 does Hughton think the draw has opened up a bit? \u201cIf we start thinking beyond that then we won\u2019t get past a very good Derby side,\u201d said the Seagulls\u2019 ever-respectful boss. \u201cBut it is definitely a great opportunity for somebody. And we are part of that group of teams. It\u2019s unusual for so many Premier League teams to be out at this stage. There\u2019s a really good opportunity for somebody to get through to the latter stages, which for a club like ourselves is deemed a success.\u201d Hughton will have the advantage, like every other manager who Derby face these days, of having been given a Marcelo Bielsa masterclass in how to pick the Rams apart. Though actually putting a Bielsa lesson in tactics into practice is another thing altogether \u2013 and Derby have actually gone unbeaten since losing at Leeds on 11 January so are feeling pretty perky. They\u2019re not flying going forwards, but they\u2019re hard to beat and in form compared to Brighton since the turn of the year. This could be interesting. My prediction: Brighton 2-2 Derby Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT",

      "body": "<p>Philip Hammond is not going to China this weekend for trade talks, following reports that Beijing scuppered advanced preparations for a meeting after the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, threatened to deploy a warship in the Pacific.</p> <p>The UK chancellor was expected to meet the Chinese vice premier, Hu Chunhua, but Treasury sources said the trip was never confirmed. It is believed that there is an internal row brewing between the Treasury and the defence department over Williamson\u2019s remarks, which the former chancellor George Osborne described as a throwback to an era of \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d.</p> <p>The Sun said China had been expected to lift its bans on British poultry and cosmetics not tested on animals, which could have opened up access to markets worth around \u00a310bn over five years.</p> <p>A Treasury spokeswoman stopped short of confirming that the trip, preparations for which were reportedly well advanced, had been cancelled. \u201cThe chancellor is not travelling to China at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cNo trip was ever announced or confirmed.\u201d</p> <p>The department refused to comment further, but the Press Association said a source suggested the visit would be rescheduled and it is understood there is intense irritation within the Treasury following Williamson\u2019s speech.</p> <p>Hu reportedly scrapped the plans hours after Williamson announced that the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sent to the Pacific, where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea, for its first operational cruise, expected to be in 2021. </p> <p>He said the UK was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flout international law, in an apparent reference to Chinese expansion.</p> <p>Last September another British warship, HMS Albion, sailed near islands claimed by China in an effort to demonstrate that the UK does not recognise claims beyond the internationally agreed 12-mile limit.

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond is not going to China this weekend for trade talks, following reports that Beijing scuppered advanced preparations for a meeting after the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, threatened to deploy a warship in the Pacific. The UK chancellor was expected to meet the Chinese vice premier, Hu Chunhua, but Treasury sources said the trip was never confirmed. It is believed that there is an internal row brewing between the Treasury and the defence department over Williamson\u2019s remarks, which the former chancellor George Osborne described as a throwback to an era of \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d. The Sun said China had been expected to lift its bans on British poultry and cosmetics not tested on animals, which could have opened up access to markets worth around \u00a310bn over five years. A Treasury spokeswoman stopped short of confirming that the trip, preparations for which were reportedly well advanced, had been cancelled. \u201cThe chancellor is not travelling to China at this time,\u201d she said. \u201cNo trip was ever announced or confirmed.\u201d The department refused to comment further, but the Press Association said a source suggested the visit would be rescheduled and it is understood there is intense irritation within the Treasury following Williamson\u2019s speech. Hu reportedly scrapped the plans hours after Williamson announced that the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sent to the Pacific, where Beijing has been involved in a dispute over territorial claims in the South China Sea, for its first operational cruise, expected to be in 2021. He said the UK was prepared to use lethal force to deter countries that flout international law, in an apparent reference to Chinese expansion. Last September another British warship, HMS Albion, sailed near islands claimed by China in an effort to demonstrate that the UK does not recognise claims beyond the internationally agreed 12-mile limit. China described the action as provocative. The Financial Times reported that British officials said the Chinese ambassador had raised Williamson\u2019s apparent threat in a \u201cscheduled call\u201d with the Foreign Office. The paper said that Downing Street had not denied that Beijing had expressed its displeasure with the minister\u2019s speech. A government official was reported to have branded Williamson\u2019s speech, in which he also claimed Brexit represented an opportunity for Britain to enhance its military threat, as \u201cidiotic\u201d, while the defence secretary was also criticised by Osborne, now the Evening Standard editor, for sending mixed messages. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Week in Westminster that the government appeared unable to decide whether China was an economic partner or a military threat. \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult to work out what the British government\u2019s China policy is at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the defence secretary engaging in gunboat diplomacy of a quite old-fashioned kind, at the same time as the chancellor of the exchequer and the foreign secretary are going around saying they want a close economic partnership with China.\u201d Osborne, who attempted to forge closer economic relations with China during his time in government, added: \u201cUltimately it\u2019s the responsibility of Theresa May to sort this out. At the moment it looks all at sea.\u201d China is one of the UK\u2019s largest trading partners, and the second largest non-EU partner after the US. In 2017, the UK ran a trade deficit of around \u00a323bn with China, making up 7% of its imports.

The corporate bonuses come after the Trump administration introduced its Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which sharply cut federal corporate tax rates and expanded others. \u201cThis is not their first rodeo,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, ITEP senior fellow. \u201cMore than any company I have ever seen they have built their company around tax avoidance.\u201d One central idea of Trump\u2019s tax cuts was to cut corporate tax rates from 35% to 21% but as the tax filings come in it is becoming increasingly clear that many companies are not even paying the lower rate, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t lay the blame too much on Congress,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Congress that came up with these ideas. They are the product of a lobbying blitz from these companies. These companies wrote the law in many cases.\u201d In a statement sent to the Guardian after the publication of this article, Amazon said it \u201cpays all the taxes we are required to pay in the US and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6bn in corporate tax and reporting $3.4bn in tax expense over the last three years. \u201cCorporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment.\u201d",

One source is described as \u201ca very high level\u201d official in the president\u2019s office. SCS undertook the intelligence work for Alexander Adamescu, a media and property tycoon who heads one of Romania\u2019s wealthiest families.</p> <p>Adamescu is awaiting extradition to Romania from the UK after Romanian prosecutors accused him of bribery and money laundering. The businessman has denied the allegations.</p> <p>Lawyers for Adamescu filed the 36-page report as expert evidence in extradition proceedings held in London in 2017. Written by Carlile, who is a senior QC and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the report bolstered the businessman\u2019s claims that the Romanian prosecution is politically motivated.</p> <p>The document provides a rare glimpse into the world of private intelligence and sheds light on the activities of two distinguished former public servants and their discreet, well-connected British company.</p> <p>Responding to the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s queries, Carlile insisted SCS used \u201centirely lawful means\u201d to obtain legal information. \u201cThat we obtain useful information is a result of our knowing how to conduct effective investigations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The peer categorically rejected any suggestion that either he or Scarlett might have drawn on contacts made while working in the security and intelligence field for the UK government, or that SCS had engaged in a form of espionage in Romania that might have undermined state institutions.</p> <p>\u201cThe assertion is nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cSCS investigated a case in which the client alleges that he has been subject to unjust procedures outside the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, however, the judge in Adamescu\u2019s extradition case refused to admit Scarlett and Carlile\u2019s report as expert evidence, citing concerns about the lack of information about the identities of the company\u2019s \u201cunnamed but trusted Romanian agents\u201d and the circumstances in which SCS\u2019s operatives \u2013 identified in court as \u201cretired intelligence officers\u201d \u2013 collected the information.</p> <p>The report illustrates how high-profile anti-corruption cases in Romania \u2013 a major political issue in the EU member state \u2013 have generated business opportunities for private investigators and outside consultants. According to Romanian media reports, Adamescu\u2019s family-owned company previously explored hiring controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/07/israel-intel-firm-black-cube-trump-obama-iran-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\">Israeli private intelligence firm Black Cube</a> and retained a consultancy run by former FBI director Louis Freeh.</p> <p>After publication of this article, a written statement from James R. Bucknam, CEO of Freeh Group International Solutions, said: \u201cNeither Dan Adamescu nor Alexander Adamescu have been clients of Mr Freeh or of our consultancy.\u201d A Romanian media assertion that Louis Freeh was Alexander Adamescu\u2019s lawyer was incorrect, Bucknam wrote in an email.</p> <p>Romania\u2019s anti-corruption directorate, the DNA, which investigated Adamescu and his father for offences including bribing judges, has brought scores of cases against senior politicians and business figures in recent years. But prosecutors have come under intense pressure from opponents, including the government, which last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/romania-braced-for-huge-protests-amid-big-step-backwards-on-rule-of-law\" title=\"\">curtailed the DNA\u2019s powers</a> and forced its chief from office.</p> <p>A key section of SCS\u2019s report, entitled \u201cproduct of sensitive inquiries\u201d, describes a series of extraordinary allegations about the conduct of the DNA and Romania\u2019s domestic intelligence service in relation to the Adamescu investigation.</p> <p>The allegations, which include falsified charges and blackmailing witnesses, are attributed to sources close to the DNA including a \u201cwell-placed official with direct knowledge and experience\u201d of the Adamescu case.</p> <p>Citing numerous \u201cwell-placed\u201d sources, the section also includes an account of a national security meeting in the prime minister\u2019s office in 2013 and details from diplomatic negotiations between senior Romanian and German officials in 2015.</p> <p>SCS partly relied on the intelligence to support its conclusion that the DNA\u2019s prosecutions of Adamescu and his father \u201cbear all the hallmarks of a politically motivated campaign using the criminal law\u201d.</p> <p>Romania\u2019s judicial authorities rejected the information attributed to SCS\u2019s sources and objected to the admissibility of the report in extradition proceedings, expressing concern at its reliance on unnamed sources said to have provided information in \u201cunknown circumstances to unnamed intermediaries\u201d.</p> <p>Carlile told the court that anonymity was necessary as its sources feared reprisals should their identities be revealed. Three were said to fear for their lives.Details about SCS\u2019s high-stakes work in Romania paint a notably different picture of the company\u2019s business activities to the description in Carlile\u2019s disclosures in the House of Lords register of interests, which describes SCS as a company that provides \u201cstrategic advice on UK public policy, regulation, and business practice\u201d to inward investors. Carlile told the Observer his entries in the register \u201ccomply with the registration requirements.\u201d</p> <p>In the report for Adamescu, SCS provides a clearer picture of the company\u2019s expertise in foreign intelligence and other \u201csensitive matters\u201d concerning companies and governments. The firm boasts of an \u201cextensive cadre of trusted outside advisers\u201d including \u201cformer intelligence chiefs from the USA and elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Carlile and Scarlett \u2014 lifelong friends since attending elite private school Epsom College \u2014 formed SCS in 2012. Scarlett retired as chief of MI6 in 2009 after a 38-year career in British intelligence.</p> <p>SCS\u2019s only disclosed client is the government of Qatar, but court records show the firm has worked for two high-profile Russian businessmen in London, including oligarch and former Kremlin minister Vladimir Chernukhin in connection to a dispute involving the oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. Last year, Scarlet and Carlile formed a new company, Manet Solutions, specifically to provide advice on extradition cases.</p> <p>Asked about the pair\u2019s clients, Carlile said: \u201cWe never discuss our work unless it is a matter of legitimate public record. Many other companies gather intelligence in a lawful way, as do we.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019 to add the comment from James R. Bucknam.</p>",

Lawyers for Adamescu filed the 36-page report as expert evidence in extradition proceedings held in London in 2017. Written by Carlile, who is a senior QC and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the report bolstered the businessman\u2019s claims that the Romanian prosecution is politically motivated. The document provides a rare glimpse into the world of private intelligence and sheds light on the activities of two distinguished former public servants and their discreet, well-connected British company. Responding to the Observer\u2019s queries, Carlile insisted SCS used \u201centirely lawful means\u201d to obtain legal information. \u201cThat we obtain useful information is a result of our knowing how to conduct effective investigations,\u201d he said. The peer categorically rejected any suggestion that either he or Scarlett might have drawn on contacts made while working in the security and intelligence field for the UK government, or that SCS had engaged in a form of espionage in Romania that might have undermined state institutions. \u201cThe assertion is nonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cSCS investigated a case in which the client alleges that he has been subject to unjust procedures outside the rule of law.\u201d Ultimately, however, the judge in Adamescu\u2019s extradition case refused to admit Scarlett and Carlile\u2019s report as expert evidence, citing concerns about the lack of information about the identities of the company\u2019s \u201cunnamed but trusted Romanian agents\u201d and the circumstances in which SCS\u2019s operatives \u2013 identified in court as \u201cretired intelligence officers\u201d \u2013 collected the information. The report illustrates how high-profile anti-corruption cases in Romania \u2013 a major political issue in the EU member state \u2013 have generated business opportunities for private investigators and outside consultants. According to Romanian media reports, Adamescu\u2019s family-owned company previously explored hiring controversial Israeli private intelligence firm Black Cube and retained a consultancy run by former FBI director Louis Freeh. After publication of this article, a written statement from James R. Bucknam, CEO of Freeh Group International Solutions, said: \u201cNeither Dan Adamescu nor Alexander Adamescu have been clients of Mr Freeh or of our consultancy.\u201d A Romanian media assertion that Louis Freeh was Alexander Adamescu\u2019s lawyer was incorrect, Bucknam wrote in an email. Romania\u2019s anti-corruption directorate, the DNA, which investigated Adamescu and his father for offences including bribing judges, has brought scores of cases against senior politicians and business figures in recent years. But prosecutors have come under intense pressure from opponents, including the government, which last year curtailed the DNA\u2019s powers and forced its chief from office. A key section of SCS\u2019s report, entitled \u201cproduct of sensitive inquiries\u201d, describes a series of extraordinary allegations about the conduct of the DNA and Romania\u2019s domestic intelligence service in relation to the Adamescu investigation. The allegations, which include falsified charges and blackmailing witnesses, are attributed to sources close to the DNA including a \u201cwell-placed official with direct knowledge and experience\u201d of the Adamescu case. Citing numerous \u201cwell-placed\u201d sources, the section also includes an account of a national security meeting in the prime minister\u2019s office in 2013 and details from diplomatic negotiations between senior Romanian and German officials in 2015. SCS partly relied on the intelligence to support its conclusion that the DNA\u2019s prosecutions of Adamescu and his father \u201cbear all the hallmarks of a politically motivated campaign using the criminal law\u201d. Romania\u2019s judicial authorities rejected the information attributed to SCS\u2019s sources and objected to the admissibility of the report in extradition proceedings, expressing concern at its reliance on unnamed sources said to have provided information in \u201cunknown circumstances to unnamed intermediaries\u201d. Carlile told the court that anonymity was necessary as its sources feared reprisals should their identities be revealed. Three were said to fear for their lives.Details about SCS\u2019s high-stakes work in Romania paint a notably different picture of the company\u2019s business activities to the description in Carlile\u2019s disclosures in the House of Lords register of interests, which describes SCS as a company that provides \u201cstrategic advice on UK public policy, regulation, and business practice\u201d to inward investors. Carlile told the Observer his entries in the register \u201ccomply with the registration requirements.\u201d In the report for Adamescu, SCS provides a clearer picture of the company\u2019s expertise in foreign intelligence and other \u201csensitive matters\u201d concerning companies and governments. The firm boasts of an \u201cextensive cadre of trusted outside advisers\u201d including \u201cformer intelligence chiefs from the USA and elsewhere.\u201d Carlile and Scarlett \u2014 lifelong friends since attending elite private school Epsom College \u2014 formed SCS in 2012. Scarlett retired as chief of MI6 in 2009 after a 38-year career in British intelligence. SCS\u2019s only disclosed client is the government of Qatar, but court records show the firm has worked for two high-profile Russian businessmen in London, including oligarch and former Kremlin minister Vladimir Chernukhin in connection to a dispute involving the oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. Last year, Scarlet and Carlile formed a new company, Manet Solutions, specifically to provide advice on extradition cases. Asked about the pair\u2019s clients, Carlile said: \u201cWe never discuss our work unless it is a matter of legitimate public record. Many other companies gather intelligence in a lawful way, as do we.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019 to add the comment from James R. Bucknam.",

Frankly, if you have a problem, if you have a headache, it is better to come and talk about it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The US Department of Commerce is due to decide shortly if tariffs should be imposed on German cars.</p> <p>Merkel also challenged Trump on his unilateral decision to immediately withdraw US troops from north-west Syria, asking whether the policy will strengthen Russia and Iran\u2019s hand to influence the situation on the ground.</p> <p>Merkel said she was criticised every day over her support for the Iran nuclear deal, but asked whether it was helpful to the west\u2019s common goal of containing Iran\u2019s wider negative behaviour, including in Yemen, \u201cto cancel the only existing agreement with Iran, or it is a small lever to maintain pressure on other issues? This is a tactical question.\u201d</p> <p>She urged the US not to decide alone on a possible troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. It took a lot of effort to convince the German public about the Afghanistan Bundeswehr mission, she explained, adding a US withdrawal might force a German withdrawal due to the integration of forces.</p> <p>The German government decided a few days ago to extend the mission by one year, a decision that will be put to the Bundestag in March. Almost 1,300 German soldiers are currently stationed in the Hindu Kush, north Afghanistan.</p> <p>Discussing the Russian and American decision to cancel the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty (INF), she said: \u201cDisarmament is something that concerns us all, and where we would, of course, be delighted if such talks were held not just between the United States, Europe and Russia, but also with China.\u201d</p> <p>She accepted the US justification for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\">pulling out of the INF</a> this month in response to Moscow\u2019s deployment of the 9M729 missile.

We need to cooperate.\u201d Merkel quoted the US Republican senator Lindsey Graham as saying: \u201cMultilateralism may be complicated, but it\u2019s better than simply staying at home alone.\u201d \u201cNow that we see great pressure on the classic order we are used to, the question now is: do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?\u201d Merkel said, adding that it\u2019s better to \u201cput yourself in the other\u2019s shoes ... and see whether we can get win-win solutions together\u201d. She was speaking at the Munich security conference on Saturday, immediately before the US vice-president Mike Pence, who insisted: \u201cAmerica first never meant America alone.\u201d Pence repeatedly challenged Europe, saying it was time to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and accusing Iran of trying to commit a fresh Holocaust. He also demanded the EU step forward for freedom and recognise Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the sole legitimate representative of Venezuela. In an uncompromising speech, he also called on Germany to increase its defence spending, and abandon its plan to build a new gas pipeline from Russia \u2013 Nord Stream 2. In Merkel\u2019s speech, punctuated by warm applause largely absent from Pence\u2019s address, the outgoing chancellor effectively challenged Trump\u2019s world vision with a practical, point-by-point rebuttal of nationalist isolationism. She revealed that Germany is shocked when it hears the US administration describe German BMWs as a threat to US national security, pointing out the largest BMW car plant was not in Bavaria, but South Carolina, supplying cars to China. \u201cWe are proud of our cars and we are allowed to be that. Frankly, if you have a problem, if you have a headache, it is better to come and talk about it,\u201d she said. The US Department of Commerce is due to decide shortly if tariffs should be imposed on German cars. Merkel also challenged Trump on his unilateral decision to immediately withdraw US troops from north-west Syria, asking whether the policy will strengthen Russia and Iran\u2019s hand to influence the situation on the ground. Merkel said she was criticised every day over her support for the Iran nuclear deal, but asked whether it was helpful to the west\u2019s common goal of containing Iran\u2019s wider negative behaviour, including in Yemen, \u201cto cancel the only existing agreement with Iran, or it is a small lever to maintain pressure on other issues? This is a tactical question.\u201d She urged the US not to decide alone on a possible troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. It took a lot of effort to convince the German public about the Afghanistan Bundeswehr mission, she explained, adding a US withdrawal might force a German withdrawal due to the integration of forces. The German government decided a few days ago to extend the mission by one year, a decision that will be put to the Bundestag in March. Almost 1,300 German soldiers are currently stationed in the Hindu Kush, north Afghanistan. Discussing the Russian and American decision to cancel the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty (INF), she said: \u201cDisarmament is something that concerns us all, and where we would, of course, be delighted if such talks were held not just between the United States, Europe and Russia, but also with China.\u201d She accepted the US justification for pulling out of the INF this month in response to Moscow\u2019s deployment of the 9M729 missile. The move prompted Russia to announce its own withdrawal, something that will greatly effect European security. While blaming one another for the treaty breakdown, both Washington and Moscow have also voiced concern that the INF \u2013 a bilateral treaty between the US and Russia \u2013 does nothing to constrain the rapidly growing military power of China. According to a new report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, up to 95% of China\u2019s arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles would be in breach of the INF if Beijing were party to it. Merkel defended levels of German defence spending, saying it was due to reach 1.5% by 2024, well below the 2% target set collectively by Nato, the transatlantic defence alliance. \u201cFor us, it is very much an essential big step forward.\u201d She also queried spending measured against GDP as the best reference point for judging defence spending, adding that European development spending in Africa also brought greater security, by providing jobs that reduced the impulse of African youth to migrate to Europe. Merkel urged Trump to understand the importance of Nato as a symbol of something deeper than security. \u201cWe have to think in networked structures. The military component is one of them. We need Nato as a stability anchor in stormy times. We need it as a community of values.\u201d",

It is a question posed by the white academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/racial-inequality-niceness-white-people\" title=\"\">Robin DiAngelo, whose book </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/racial-inequality-niceness-white-people\" title=\"\">White Fragility</a></em> has now spent seven months hovering at the top end of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and has just been published in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with white people,\u201d she says, \u201cis that they just don\u2019t listen.

There is a refusal to know or see, or to listen or hear, or to validate.\u201d</p> <p>Over a video call from her home in Seattle, DiAngelo is emphatic and forthright. As a sociologist, she has worked as a diversity trainer across the US for more than 20 years and has a PhD in multicultural education. More recently, however, she has received abuse and criticism for starting a conversation that she felt \u201cmy people were not having\u201d. \u201cI got a death threat recently that called me a bully, and I thought, \u2018Wow, do you not see the irony here? You just threatened to kill me over some words that I say.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>But, of course, DiAngelo\u2019s words provoke. They cause discomfort and defensiveness. She picks at the disbelief and sensitivity white people exhibit when they are told they are complicit in society\u2019s institutional racism. She challenges rather than gives solutions. Her book is a harsh wake-up call for white liberals, who she thinks could be much more progressive if they first listened.</p> <p>DiAngelo says she encounters a lot of \u201ccertitude from white people \u2013 they insist \u2018Well, it\u2019s not me\u2019, or say \u2018I\u2019m doing my best, what do you want from me?\u2019 \u201d. She defines this as white fragility \u2013 the inability of white people to tolerate racial stress. This, she says, leads to white people \u201cweaponising [their] hurt feelings\u201d and being indignant and defensive when confronted with racial inequality and injustice. This creates a climate where the suggestion or accusation of racism causes more outrage among white people than the racism itself. \u201cAnd if nobody is racist,\u201d she asks, \u201cwhy is racism still America\u2019s biggest problem? What are white people afraid they will lose by listening? What is so threatening about humility on this topic?\u201d</p> <p>DiAngelo\u2019s book is a radical statement at a time when the debate is so polarised. It seems we are forever talking about race. Or talking about why we can\u2019t talk about race. So the problem isn\u2019t a lack of conversation about racism but the different levels of understanding about what it is.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to stop thinking about racism simply as someone who says the N-word,\u201d she says. \u201cThis book is centred in the white western colonial context, and in that context white people hold institutional power.\u201d This means understanding that racism is a system rather than just a slur; it is prejudice plus power. And in Britain and the US at least, it is designed to benefit and privilege whiteness by every economic and social measure. Everyone has racial bias but, as DiAngelo is determined to establish, \u201cwhen you back a group\u2019s collective bias with lingering authority and institutional control, it is transformed\u201d.</p> <p>That is why she is scathing of those who claim \u201creverse racism\u201d exists; after all, people of colour can show prejudice against white people. It is equally condemnable, but this form of discrimination does not come with systemic privilege and so is not racism as per the modern definition. </p> <p>\u201cReverse is an interesting term,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy not just say racism is racism? Reverse suggests it is going in the wrong direction. People who complain about reverse racism never seem to complain about racism otherwise. These are not racial justice advocates.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzLT54QjclA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kzLT54QjclA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The youngest of three daughters, DiAngelo grew up in poverty.

      "body": "<p>My worry was that <strong><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/all-about-eve/\" title=\"\">All About Eve</a></strong> would actually be all about Ivo. Let loose the wild cannon and canon-busting director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/06/ivo-van-hove-i-give-it-all-like-bowie-gave-it-all-in-a-masked-way-lazarus-interview\" title=\"\">Ivo van Hove</a> on Joseph L Mankiewicz\u2019s alluring, dark 1950 movie and what or who would end up as the central force? Gillian Anderson, in the Bette Davis role of Margo Channing, the actress on the slide, going from wisecrack to crack-up? Lily James as the young actress of the title, hell-bent (literally) on supplanting her and becoming a star? Or Van Hove\u2019s elaborate mechanics?</p> <p>It\u2019s a fine balance. Van Hove\u2019s paraphernalia is there \u2013 the cameras circling the stage, the video screen capturing and magnifying the action. But Anderson is a strong enough actress not to be lost in all that. She doubly proves her strength: she is not, like Davis, a swaggerer; she is a scalpel, who does not volcanically implode but slowly peels away her defensive layers. I hope, though, she is not forever going to be seen unravelling and throwing up in a lav. The last time I saw her on stage, magnificent in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/gillian-anderson-compelling-streetcar-named-desire-observer-review\" title=\"\">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></em>, she was doing both; now Van Hove shows her head-down in a vomit-streaked pan. Surely it\u2019s time someone used her subtlety in a comedy?</p> <p>In the title role, James fares less well. She exhibits presence but small range. She is too obviously manipulative at the beginning, too simply nasty at the end; her mouth too constantly on the curl.</p> <p>The play seems to suggest that any two women are always going to be rivals, and that the only thing that worries them is being delectable. Van Hove concentrates on the least interesting aspect of the movie: a woman\u2019s preoccupation with ageing. He thumps it home. In a sequence that throws to the crowds the idea that there could be no worse thing than getting wrinkles, Anderson is shown in front of a mirror, clawing at her face as she imagines becoming old.</p> <p>Ageing certainly nags at Channing in the movie. Can she hold on to her younger lover? Eve is snapping at the heels she feels may be losing their spring. But it\u2019s a focus rather than the overpowering propulsion; the film is powered by a freewheeling neurosis. Channing is not the only person who is scared. Her friend Karen, performed here with marvellous, blurting frankness by Monica Dolan, is a clever creature worried about her status and her husband. And little Eve needs applause to prove that she exists; she wants not simply to crush her heroine, but to be her. Here is one of the great American literary preoccupations, brought to its apogee in Patricia Highsmith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/09/the-talented-mr-ripley-crimes-psychology-patricia-highsmith-reading-group\" title=\"\">lacerating Ripley books</a>: the twisting mixture of hostility and adoration that makes up the stalker.</p> <p>Van Hove\u2019s staging lines up the ingredients to illuminate this. PJ Harvey\u2019s unarresting score rings the action with hollow tones of menace; huge photos of Anderson loom over the stage; the action is patrolled by cameras. An acerbic critic \u2013 played with silky-voiced nastiness by Stanley Townsend \u2013 could, like all critics, be considered something of a stalker. Yet the production is too entranced with glamour to be sinister, the space insufficiently claustrophobic for quarrels to be threatening.

      "bodyText": "My worry was that All About Eve would actually be all about Ivo. Let loose the wild cannon and canon-busting director Ivo van Hove on Joseph L Mankiewicz\u2019s alluring, dark 1950 movie and what or who would end up as the central force? Gillian Anderson, in the Bette Davis role of Margo Channing, the actress on the slide, going from wisecrack to crack-up? Lily James as the young actress of the title, hell-bent (literally) on supplanting her and becoming a star? Or Van Hove\u2019s elaborate mechanics? It\u2019s a fine balance. Van Hove\u2019s paraphernalia is there \u2013 the cameras circling the stage, the video screen capturing and magnifying the action. But Anderson is a strong enough actress not to be lost in all that. She doubly proves her strength: she is not, like Davis, a swaggerer; she is a scalpel, who does not volcanically implode but slowly peels away her defensive layers. I hope, though, she is not forever going to be seen unravelling and throwing up in a lav. The last time I saw her on stage, magnificent in A Streetcar Named Desire, she was doing both; now Van Hove shows her head-down in a vomit-streaked pan. Surely it\u2019s time someone used her subtlety in a comedy? In the title role, James fares less well. She exhibits presence but small range. She is too obviously manipulative at the beginning, too simply nasty at the end; her mouth too constantly on the curl. The play seems to suggest that any two women are always going to be rivals, and that the only thing that worries them is being delectable. Van Hove concentrates on the least interesting aspect of the movie: a woman\u2019s preoccupation with ageing. He thumps it home. In a sequence that throws to the crowds the idea that there could be no worse thing than getting wrinkles, Anderson is shown in front of a mirror, clawing at her face as she imagines becoming old. Ageing certainly nags at Channing in the movie. Can she hold on to her younger lover? Eve is snapping at the heels she feels may be losing their spring. But it\u2019s a focus rather than the overpowering propulsion; the film is powered by a freewheeling neurosis. Channing is not the only person who is scared. Her friend Karen, performed here with marvellous, blurting frankness by Monica Dolan, is a clever creature worried about her status and her husband. And little Eve needs applause to prove that she exists; she wants not simply to crush her heroine, but to be her. Here is one of the great American literary preoccupations, brought to its apogee in Patricia Highsmith\u2019s lacerating Ripley books: the twisting mixture of hostility and adoration that makes up the stalker. Van Hove\u2019s staging lines up the ingredients to illuminate this. PJ Harvey\u2019s unarresting score rings the action with hollow tones of menace; huge photos of Anderson loom over the stage; the action is patrolled by cameras. An acerbic critic \u2013 played with silky-voiced nastiness by Stanley Townsend \u2013 could, like all critics, be considered something of a stalker. Yet the production is too entranced with glamour to be sinister, the space insufficiently claustrophobic for quarrels to be threatening. There is a more haunting show circling this enjoyable, glitzy one. This year, London is splurging on Arthur Miller plays: are we reaching for his political certainty in a time of flux? Jonathan Church\u2019s rich revival of The Price has just arrived in London from Bath.

There\u2019s an app for that! Over the past week Apple and Google have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/693994447/apple-google-criticized-for-carrying-app-that-lets-saudi-men-track-their-wives\">criticized</a> for carrying a Saudi government app called Absher that lets men restrict the movements of women under their guardianship. Men can choose to get text alerts when their wife or a female relative goes through an airport, and can revoke the woman\u2019s right to travel with a few easy clicks. Apple and Google have both said they will look into whether the app violates their policies and should be pulled from their <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-joins-apple-probe-saudi-absher-app-2019-2\">app stores</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Absher isn\u2019t the real problem here. The problem is Saudi Arabia\u2019s abhorrent male guardianship system under which women are treated as minors and need permission from a man to do everything from renting an apartment to accessing healthcare. However, digital tools like Absher make it easier for men to apply these repressive laws.</p> <p>On Monday, Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote a letter to Apple and Google stating that American companies shouldn\u2019t enable or \u201cfacilitate the Saudi government\u2019s patriarchy \u2026 [you] are making it easier for Saudi men to control their family members from the convenience of their smartphones and restrict their movements.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday the Democratic party caucus\u2019s vice-chair, Massachusetts representative Katherine Clark, similarly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepKClark/status/1095775217182560262\">tweeted</a>: \u201cAbsher is a patriarchal weapon \u2026 #Apple and #Google must stop facilitating this dangerous tool of control.\u201d</p> <p>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Absher is awful and I\u2019m glad that Saudi Arabia\u2019s repressive gender laws are getting coverage. However some of the kneejerk outrage about what has been dubbed the \u201cwife-tracking app\u201d lacks nuance and could end up being counterproductive. Mona Eltahawy, a prominent Egyptian American feminist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monaeltahawy/status/1095360734798721025\">tweeted a message</a> from a Saudi woman explaining that while Absher is awful, having it removed will further restrict women. Before it came along, she said, granting travel restrictions was burdensome so guardians would use that as excuse to keep women at home.</p> <p>Noura Altamimi, a Saudi woman who works at the Arabia Foundation in Washington DC, gave me similar feedback. \u201cIn some instances, Absher can make it easier for Saudi women to navigate male guardianship law,\u201d she told me over Twitter direct message. \u201cIt allows guardians to completely waive travel restrictions, permitting women to travel without a guardian or guardian\u2019s approval in every instance. The focus ought to be on the restrictive laws, not the interface. In fact, the app has been available since 2015, but is only now getting attention because of the heightened scrutiny surrounding all things Saudi.\u201d</p> <p>Heightened scrutiny of all things Saudi, in my opinion, is a good thing; the west has cozied up to Saudi Arabia for far too long, ignoring egregious human rights violations because the kingdom was a profitable ally. While Apple and Google may be facilitating guardianship laws by carrying the Absher app, this is nothing compared to how western governments have enabled the kingdom\u2019s repressive leaders for decades. So it feels more than a little hypocritical for politicians to be outraged about an app when both Democrats and Republicans have a long history of ignoring gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia. By all means let\u2019s put pressure on Apple and Google to think more carefully about the impact of the apps they carry, but let\u2019s not let politicians off the hook for their complicity in how Saudi Arabia\u2019s women are treated.</p> <h2><strong>William Barr confirmed as US attorney general</strong></h2> <p>Barr, who served as attorney general under former president George HW Bush, was confirmed by the senate on Thursday.

On Monday, Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote a letter to Apple and Google stating that American companies shouldn\u2019t enable or \u201cfacilitate the Saudi government\u2019s patriarchy \u2026 [you] are making it easier for Saudi men to control their family members from the convenience of their smartphones and restrict their movements.\u201d On Wednesday the Democratic party caucus\u2019s vice-chair, Massachusetts representative Katherine Clark, similarly tweeted: \u201cAbsher is a patriarchal weapon \u2026 #Apple and #Google must stop facilitating this dangerous tool of control.\u201d Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Absher is awful and I\u2019m glad that Saudi Arabia\u2019s repressive gender laws are getting coverage. However some of the kneejerk outrage about what has been dubbed the \u201cwife-tracking app\u201d lacks nuance and could end up being counterproductive. Mona Eltahawy, a prominent Egyptian American feminist, tweeted a message from a Saudi woman explaining that while Absher is awful, having it removed will further restrict women. Before it came along, she said, granting travel restrictions was burdensome so guardians would use that as excuse to keep women at home. Noura Altamimi, a Saudi woman who works at the Arabia Foundation in Washington DC, gave me similar feedback. \u201cIn some instances, Absher can make it easier for Saudi women to navigate male guardianship law,\u201d she told me over Twitter direct message. \u201cIt allows guardians to completely waive travel restrictions, permitting women to travel without a guardian or guardian\u2019s approval in every instance. The focus ought to be on the restrictive laws, not the interface. In fact, the app has been available since 2015, but is only now getting attention because of the heightened scrutiny surrounding all things Saudi.\u201d Heightened scrutiny of all things Saudi, in my opinion, is a good thing; the west has cozied up to Saudi Arabia for far too long, ignoring egregious human rights violations because the kingdom was a profitable ally. While Apple and Google may be facilitating guardianship laws by carrying the Absher app, this is nothing compared to how western governments have enabled the kingdom\u2019s repressive leaders for decades. So it feels more than a little hypocritical for politicians to be outraged about an app when both Democrats and Republicans have a long history of ignoring gender apartheid in Saudi Arabia. By all means let\u2019s put pressure on Apple and Google to think more carefully about the impact of the apps they carry, but let\u2019s not let politicians off the hook for their complicity in how Saudi Arabia\u2019s women are treated. William Barr confirmed as US attorney general Barr, who served as attorney general under former president George HW Bush, was confirmed by the senate on Thursday. This is a blow to women\u2019s rights activists: Barr has said that he thinks Roe v Wade will be overturned and doesn\u2019t believe the right to privacy extends to abortion. One imagines that he also thinks the Saudi Arabian wife-tracking app is a brilliant idea. FBI investigates Ryan Adams The FBI is looking into whether singer-songwriter Ryan Adams committed a crime by sending sexually explicit texts to a teenage girl. The Guardian\u2019s Laura Snapes has a great piece about how the Adams allegations are the \u201ctip of an indie-music iceberg\u201d. Snapes writes: \u201cThe [music] industry has been slower to reckon with its abusers post-#MeToo than other art forms, partly because it is built on a generally permissive culture of excess and blurred lines between work and leisure \u2013 but also because the myth of the unbridled male genius remains at its core.\u201d Facebook sex-based search quirk Facebook\u2019s search function lets you look for photos of your female friends but not your male ones, a Belgian security researcher has discovered. It\u2019s not clear whether this is a bug or a feature. Nothing funny about #LigueduLOL French media had a big #MeToo moment this week when it became public that Ligue du LOL, a Facebook group full of prominent male journalists, had been harassing female journalists for years. On Thursday the French government said it was going to improve its internet abuse laws following the scandal. Les Glorieuses, a French feminist newsletter, covers the issue here. A pink tax on perfume Some brands are charging up to \u00a320 ($26) more for perfumes marketed at women, versus their male equivalents, a study has found. Yet more evidence the patriarchy stinks.",

      "body": "<p>Roger McNamee is an American fund manager and venture capitalist who has made investments in, among others, Electronic Arts, Sybase, Palm Inc and Facebook. In 2004, along with Bono and others, he co-founded Elevation Partners, a private equity firm. He has recently published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/zucked-waking-up-to-facebook-catastrophe\" title=\"\">Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>What is your history with Facebook?</strong><br>I\u2019ve been a technology investor since 1982, and a tech optimist until very recently. I first met Mark Zuckerberg in 2006, when he was 22 years old and I was 50. Even at that time it was already obvious to me that Facebook would be as successful eventually as Google was at that time, which was to say spectacularly successful. He had broken the code on the two things that historically had undermined all network-based companies: he had required authenticated identity, and he had provided genuine control of privacy.</p> <p>I thought that represented a staggering success. So I met him, and before he said anything I told him that I was afraid somebody was going to try to buy the company, they were going to pay a billion dollars and everybody was going to tell him to take the money. And I said, look, if you believe in your dream, I hope you\u2019ll tell them no.</p> <p>It turned out that the reason he was coming to see me was that a company had offered a billion dollars for Facebook and everyone had told him to accept it.</p> <p>He wanted a chief operating officer and I suggested Sheryl Sandberg, and persuaded her to meet with Mark. He sold her on the company and they became a team.</p> <p><strong>When did you first realise </strong><strong>that things had taken a turn for the worse?</strong><br>In January 2016 I saw things coming out of Facebook groups ostensibly associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign. The stuff they were spreading was uniformly inappropriate, it was misogynistic, it was disinformation.</p> <p>And then a month later, I saw a report that Facebook had expelled a company that was using its advertising tools to gather information about people interested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> and selling that data to police departments. That was a massive violation of civil rights and just completely horrible.</p> <p>Finally, I reached out to Mark and Sheryl with an opinion piece I\u2019d written, in which I suggested that there was a systemic problem with the algorithms and the business model that was allowing bad actors to harm innocent people. They very politely replied to me, but suggested that in their view what I\u2019d seen was isolated and they had taken care of it.</p> <p>So that\u2019s when I decided I\u2019d better figure out exactly what happened. I met <a href=\"http://www.tristanharris.com/\" title=\"\">Tristan Harris</a>, a design ethicist from Google, who talked about what he called \u201cbrain hacking\u201d, a term that he invented to describe the persuasive technologies used by internet platforms that enable them to develop habits in the minds of the people who use the products. Those habits evolve into addictions, and that situation makes [users] vulnerable to manipulation.</p> <p>Like a stroke of lightning, it made me see what it was that had potentially influenced the election in the US, and had potentially influenced Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Is this book the culmination of th</strong><strong>ose efforts?</strong><br>No, this is just the next step. We kept at this for a while and then, kaboom, the <em>Observer</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolecadwalladr\" title=\"\">Carole Cadwalladr</a> come out with the story about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a> and that changed everything.</p> <p>We\u2019d been banging the drum [but] the privacy angle was the first one that really [hit] home, with everyone, and it transformed everything.</p> <p>That\u2019s when I began working on the book, and the notion was very simple: there\u2019s only so much you can do in a tiny team of people going around and meeting small groups. So we needed to find a way of broadening the message. What I was really trying to do was to use my personal narrative to help people understand what matters, so that as new news came along, they could interpret it for themselves.</p> <p>My thought process was that this isn\u2019t a tech story. It\u2019s not a business story. This is an everybody story. This is a catastrophe that we\u2019re all facing, and we don\u2019t necessarily have a vocabulary for it, because the business model that Facebook and Google have created is something we\u2019ve never seen before.</p> <p>They were very much in the business of manipulating attention in order to get you to spend more time on [their services]. And that is a very dangerous business model for society. It\u2019s bad for the mental health of the people who use it. It\u2019s terrible for democracy. It\u2019s completely destroyed any sense of privacy, and it\u2019s undermined entrepreneurship in the United States, because these companies essentially pick off one industry at a time and disrupt it in a way that destroys the old without replacing it with something of equal value.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the reaction been inside Facebook to this book?</strong><br>One of the things that has been most surprising to me is that no one at Facebook has communicated with me since February 2017. I have known Sheryl since 2000 and she is one of the most politically savvy, exceptionally capable executives you could possibly meet. And the notion that they would not reach out to critics is astonishing. It\u2019s so harmful to them to be so closed-minded about criticism.</p> <p>The problems are not isolated. They are systemic. They\u2019re related to a business model that has worked extraordinarily well for investors and horrifically for everyone else. The failure to recognise that moderation would\u2019ve been a better long-term strategy for the company is ultimately going to be very costly, because they are leaving governments around the world no choice but to bring the hammer down.</p> <p><strong>Is this a Facebook problem</strong><strong> or</strong><strong> a Mark Zuckerberg problem?</strong><br>It\u2019s bigger than Facebook. This is a problem with the entire internet platform industry, and Mark is just one of the two most successful practitioners of it.</p> <p>This is a cultural model that infected Silicon Valley around 2003 \u2013 so, exactly at the time that Facebook and LinkedIn were being started \u2013 and it comes from a specific route.</p> <p>Silicon Valley spent the period from 1950 to 2003 first with the space programme, and then with personal computers and the internet. The cultures of those things were very idealistic: make the world a better place through technology. Empower the people who use technology to be their best selves. Steve Jobs famously characterised his computers as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=ob_GX50Za6c\" title=\"\">bicycles for the mind</a>.</p> <p>The problem with Google and Facebook is that their goal is to replace humans in many of the core activities of life. If you think about what they\u2019re doing with artificial intelligence, there are three markets that have proven to be incredibly lucrative: getting rid of white-collar work; telling people what to think with filter bubbles \u2013 that\u2019s what Facebook does; and recommendation engines that tell people what to enjoy or consume.</p> <p>Any list of the things that make us who we are is going include those three characteristics. Our work, the things we believe, and the things we enjoy are part of what makes us human. And to take those away and give those over to a computer instead strikes me as the opposite of bicycles for the mind.</p> <p><strong>Do you think there\u2019s a version of history in which we don\u2019t end up in this situation?</strong><br>The culture into which Facebook was born was this deeply libertarian philosophy that was espoused by their first investor, Peter Thiel, and the other members of the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia\" title=\"\">PayPal mafia</a>\u201d.</p> <p>They were almost single-handedly responsible for creating the social generation of companies. And their insights were brilliant. Their ideas about how to grow companies were revolutionary and extraordinarily successful. The challenge was that they also had a very different philosophy from the prior generations of Silicon Valley. Their notion was that disruption was perfectly reasonable because you weren\u2019t actually responsible for anybody but yourself, so you weren\u2019t responsible for the consequences of your actions.</p> <p>That philosophy got baked into their companies in this idea that you could have a goal \u2013 in Facebook\u2019s case, connecting the whole world on one network \u2013 and that goal would be so important that it justified whatever means were necessary to get there.</p> <p><strong>You said Brexit was a wake-up call. Why was that?</strong><br>It never occurred to me that there would be an asymmetry in the way that advertising works. That in order to command attention, you want to appeal to what [Tristan Harris] calls \u201cthe lizard brain\u201d, the things that provoke outrage and fear. Things that essentially create a perception of reward. Those things, when you put them into advertising, can really be bad for democracy. Suddenly a neutral centrist idea gets very little traction on Facebook, where really extreme, emotionally charged ideas are viral.</p> <p>There\u2019s evidence that in the US, the messages of the Trump campaign got 17 times the effective reach per dollar spent as Clinton\u2019s messages, and that\u2019s just a staggering advantage.</p> <p>With Brexit, because of the shocking outcome, I had to ask myself: had Facebook played a role? Because clearly Facebook had been part of the promotional strategies of the campaigns. And it was equally clear that in one case you had a very emotionally charged message, and in the other a very neutral message. So it was a pretty good test of that question. I didn\u2019t have the data so I didn\u2019t know. But the hypothesis occurred to me and in the context of the other things I had seen, raised more alarms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/12/digital-ad-market-competition-facebook-google\">Digital ad market under fresh scrutiny amid competition concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Can you see Facebook changing on issues like this without being forced to?</strong><br>Tristan and I have worked very hard to share our message with people at Facebook in a way that they could accept.

The number of personnel leaving the NHS because of a poor work-life balance has almost trebled in the last seven years, an analysis by the Health Foundation thinktank shows. Between June 2010 and June 2011, a total of 3,689 employees cited concerns over long working hours as the reason they had decided to stop working for the NHS in England. But 10,257 did so between June 2017 and June 2018 \u2013 an increase of 178%. Many of those who left were nurses. The numbers quitting over their work-life balance more than doubled from 1,069 to 2,910 over the seven years studied. The 270 doctors who quit for a better work-life balance in 2017-18 represented a 167% increase on the 101 who did so in 2010-11. Health unions have been warning for years that NHS personnel are cracking under the strain of heavy workloads, a relentless rise in demand for care and having to work harder as a result of widespread understaffing. Many staff report routinely working beyond their normal hours simply to ensure that they complete all their tasks related to patient care and administration. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP and policy fellow at the Health Foundation, said that while she loved her job, \u201cit does feel pressurised\u201d and that the NHS-wide lack of family doctors was making it impossible to have a normal life. \u201cThe sheer number of decisions you make in a day can feel frighteningly large, and we\u2019ve lost any concept of \u2018routine hours\u2019.

The NHS long-term plan, the blueprint for the service\u2019s future in England, published last month, highlighted that it would have to offer more staff flexible working in order to tackle its growing workforce crisis.

      "body": "<p>Marie Kondo is the latest<strong> </strong>in a long line of people put on this earth to make me feel bad about myself. I know, deep down, that everyone has problems, but on the surface Kondo very much appears to be someone who does not. I\u2019ve never seen a more capable or composed human being in my life. Watching her kneel on the floor, patiently teaching stressed out suburban parents how to fold a T-shirt, fills me with equal parts delight and sadness. She\u2019s exactly the sort of person I used to try to transform myself into every January, until I accepted I\u2019m simply too psychologically feeble.</p> <p>According to Kondo\u2019s worldview, an orderly home begets an orderly life. The KonMari method, outlined in her 2012 book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/life-changing-magic-of-tidying-362214.html\" title=\"\">The Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying</a> and this year\u2019s hit <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80209379\" title=\"\">Netflix serie</a>s, is designed to \u201cspark joy in the world through tidying\u201d. Once you\u2019ve thrown away every grotty holiday vest from the 90s and learned how to organise your knives, so it goes, order within your relationships, career and digestive tract will soon follow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having reduced my number of partners to one, I have already KonMari\u2019d my love life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This, I believe. I\u2019ve gone through enough depressive episodes to know that physically decluttering a room can have a mirror effect on your mental state \u2013 but unfortunately I love <em>things</em>. As a twentysomething on her eighth lease in an increasingly precarious rental market, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have learned to downsize, but I\u2019ve done the opposite. I haven\u2019t had dominion over more than 12 square feet of space in my entire life, and as long as that is the case I will continue to fill it with votive candles, matryoshka dolls and interesting sugar packets from Berlin cafes, and lug it all down endless flights of stairs in big plastic tubs marked \u201cBits\u201d every time a landlord decides to hike the rent up.</p> <p>But, in theory, couldn\u2019t the KonMari method be applied to anything? It\u2019s a way of life that involves going about, looking at stuff, and asking \u2013 like Hamlet to Yorick\u2019s unearthed skull \u2013 does this spark joy? The answer, according to Kondo, points the way to a life filled only with items we truly cherish. Who\u2019s to say the same approach can\u2019t work for our relationships or finances? To find out, I applied the KonMari method to four key areas of my life.</p> <p><strong>1. Friends. As a wretched people pleaser, can I cull some stragglers?</strong></p> <p>The Kondo method posits, \u201cThe more you own, the less it means\u201d, which translates to something along the lines of, \u201cOne pair of comfy jeans is better than eight pairs that make you feel body conscious\u201d, but could also work as a comment on the value of a few close friendships over lots of superficial ones. It seems like good practice to interrogate the dynamics of your relationships once in a while; separate your durable hoodies from your Topshop tunics circa 2006, so to speak.</p> <p>Exes you lied about wanting to stay friends? So long. That mouthy bloke you suffer because you rate his girlfriend, but with whom you always end up getting sucked into a two-hour debate about identity politics at someone\u2019s birthday drinks? Farewell. The person whose birthday drinks it was? Auf wiedersehen, didn\u2019t really know her anyway.</p> <p>After a week of culling stragglers, I don\u2019t notice much difference. I guess I\u2019m not widely known for my witty rapport or eagerness to go outside. Also, I don\u2019t tell anyone that\u2019s what I am doing, which is arguably bad form since one of Kondo\u2019s main rules is to thoughtfully consider an item and thank it for its service before letting it go. But it feels unnecessary to hit up someone I\u2019ve seen naked, after several months of silence, to inform them I won\u2019t be responding to their texts in future because they don\u2019t spark the requisite joy.</p> <p>Still, I feel better. As a wretched people pleaser, I find it difficult to liberate myself from the sense of obligation to be everywhere for everyone all the time, and the inevitable crush of guilt that comes with that impossible task. It is freeing to have a system imposed upon me that gives me permission to ignore a text asking me to listen to a friend of a friend\u2019s band; I can concentrate on more pleasurable activities instead, like watching YouTube documentaries about serial killers or doing a protein treatment on my hair.</p> <p>All this extra leisure time and free headspace makes me feel like a member of the aristocracy, or a regular man. The more I learn to appreciate doing things I actually want to do, the more everything else starts to feel like an imposition. Do I want to go out for a drink? Do I want to do emotional labour at 10pm on a Wednesday? Or, do I want to watch The Office while deleting every text that isn\u2019t a soup recipe from my mother?</p> <p>The more I shoot people down, the easier it becomes. It starts with loose acquaintances, but this reasoning begins to infiltrate my close friendships as well. Sorry, mate, can we see that film you like the look of another night? Sorry, mate, I know it\u2019s your wedding but the thing is: I don\u2019t feel like it. Sorry, mate, I can sense something heavy is about to come up in this conversation so I\u2019m going to excuse myself to go to the toilet for a really, really long time.</p> <p>After two weeks of indulging myself, I forget how to have a normal conversation. I feel strange and empty. Presumably someone less desperate for solace would benefit from this process. I, however, have spent more time with the big rabbit at my local museum than my own housemates, and now nobody speaks to me unless it\u2019s about bills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"055bc222af65a6406e7a2223597be3a01c56a05a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/055bc222af65a6406e7a2223597be3a01c56a05a/0_708_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Garland\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The first hurdle I encounter is that I don\u2019t have an end goal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2. Love. Can I reorganise my relationship and pinpoint our shared vision?</strong></p> <p>Having reduced my number of partners to one, I have already KonMari\u2019d my love life by acknowledging what sparks joy (someone who gives me compliments and laughs at my farts) and discarding the rest (Tinder matches whose ambivalence I overlooked in exchange for free pizza). But how does the method fare within the framework of heterosexual monogamy?</p> <p>The KonMari method does claim that couples can deepen their ties through tidying, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. My boyfriend is five years younger than me and we have enough of a borderline mother/son dynamic as it is, without getting into enforced room tidying. Instead, I decide to organise my relationship the way Kondo reckons I should organise my wardrobe: pinpoint my vision, pile everything up, then take each item in my hand and think about how it fits into my end goal.</p> <p>The first hurdle I encounter is that I don\u2019t have an end goal. I don\u2019t want to get married. I don\u2019t want kids until I know I\u2019ve hit my physical peak, and the only way we\u2019re getting a house in this economy is if we build it on The Sims. So we apply the KonMari method to the reliable constant we do have: sex.</p> <p>Just to clarify, when Kondo talks about \u201csparking joy\u201d she\u2019s referring to a warm and positive feeling. It\u2019s not a case of choosing what to discard, but of choosing what to keep. This philosophy fell flat on its arse as far as friendships were concerned, but came into its own when it involved spreading my nefarious paraphernalia out on a bed to see which things we wanted to take into our future. There is something beautiful about holding a knackered bullet vibrator tenderly in your hands, as a couple, and whispering, \u201cThank you for your service\u201d, before dropping it into a bin.</p> <p><strong>3. Food. Do I want to take this sausage roll into my future? Can I take two?</strong></p> <p>The KonMari method is about checking in with your feelings toward things. Whether it\u2019s a cushion or a cardigan, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When applied to food, this became complicated, because the eye of this beholder tends to be much larger than her stomach.</p> <p>I usually manage to curb myself from eating half a pint of ice-cream right before bed. What I want, however, is to eat the whole thing and wake up at 3am with acid reflux. So, in the noble pursuit of joy, I allow it. In goes the ice-cream, along with 1,000 almonds which I chain eat throughout the day, and an obscene amount of bread. Of course, I ask myself the difficult, soul-searching questions along the way: Do I want to take this sausage roll with me into my future? Or am I just bored? Obviously, the answer is always, \u201cCan I have <em>two</em> sausage rolls please.\u201d But said with feeling, which is what counts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This mainly involves asking everyone I come across if they have a biscuit, like a 15-year-old hustling for cigarettes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The biggest change I have to make is to my weekday work lunches. Typically, these consist of whatever I\u2019ve had the night before, reheated. I\u2019ve been vegan for seven years and I\u2019m the first to admit couscous is austere, especially when eaten three meals in a row after a 16-hour stint in the fridge. Unfortunately, my finances dictate that this is the life I must lead. So I try to break up the day by seeking out joy elsewhere. This mainly involves asking everyone I come across if they have a biscuit, like a 15-year-old hustling for cigarettes, and going to Pret a Manger every few hours. I have not eaten this poorly since year seven, when I developed a mistrust of the school canteen and spent all my lunch money on Galaxy Caramel.</p> <p><strong>4. Social </strong><strong>media. Can I take a moment each morning to thank the internet?</strong></p> <p>If you were to \u201ctidy up\u201d your social media \u2013 by posting only things that are \u201cmeaningful\u201d and deleting everything that is no longer of value, for example \u2013 you\u2019d quickly realise that what you have on your hands is the equivalent of five to 10 years\u2019 worth of knickers with the elastic gone out of the waist. This dank meme; this well-lit photograph of a mountain near your parents\u2019 house; this witty observation about Brexit \u2013 do they spark joy? </p> <p>The answer is no. To tidy my life accordingly, I would have to wipe it all. Erase my digital footprint. End up doing that thing grizzled white male actors do in films that are well received at Cannes, where they abandon society to rusticate in the mountains and raise their children outside the toxic grip of \u201cthe system\u201d. I would go mad, basically.</p> <p>Instead, I stop using apps unless I \u201cneed to\u201d. I delete Facebook, tweet only things that are work-related and unsubscribe from every Reddit community except one where people submit gifs of animals being brushed. I revert to life as it was at the dawn of social networking \u2013 where the only conversations you had were ones you sought out, where feelings were communicated through quotes from coming of age books and photos of Courtney Love.</p> <p>Scrolling through Instagram one evening towards the end of the experiment, I think about all the moments in Kondo\u2019s Netflix show where she gathers everyone together in one communal spot to thank it before the tidying process can begin. Everyone closes their eyes for a quiet moment of reflection, in which they acknowledge the space they\u2019ve made for themselves but probably take for granted every day. The result of this mini-meditation is often an overwhelming sense of appreciation \u2013 a feeling of warmth that clears a path for gratitude, illuminating everything around you even if it is a total shit tip. It\u2019s a touching moment \u2013 one that\u2019s antithetical to the way we operate normally, especially on social media, which is literally designed so that any object is instantly replaced by the next.</p> <p>I consider a future where I take a moment each morning to thank modern technology. Perhaps that small act of recognition would make the whole thing less horrid, less antagonistic, and it would become a force for good.</p> <p>Then I think about actually closing my eyes and saying, \u201cThank you, computer\u201d before logging on for a nice long day of smashing \u2018like\u2019 on criticisms of Winston Churchill, and how psychotic that would be. And it brings me joy.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

As a twentysomething on her eighth lease in an increasingly precarious rental market, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have learned to downsize, but I\u2019ve done the opposite. I haven\u2019t had dominion over more than 12 square feet of space in my entire life, and as long as that is the case I will continue to fill it with votive candles, matryoshka dolls and interesting sugar packets from Berlin cafes, and lug it all down endless flights of stairs in big plastic tubs marked \u201cBits\u201d every time a landlord decides to hike the rent up. But, in theory, couldn\u2019t the KonMari method be applied to anything? It\u2019s a way of life that involves going about, looking at stuff, and asking \u2013 like Hamlet to Yorick\u2019s unearthed skull \u2013 does this spark joy? The answer, according to Kondo, points the way to a life filled only with items we truly cherish. Who\u2019s to say the same approach can\u2019t work for our relationships or finances? To find out, I applied the KonMari method to four key areas of my life. 1. Friends. As a wretched people pleaser, can I cull some stragglers? The Kondo method posits, \u201cThe more you own, the less it means\u201d, which translates to something along the lines of, \u201cOne pair of comfy jeans is better than eight pairs that make you feel body conscious\u201d, but could also work as a comment on the value of a few close friendships over lots of superficial ones. It seems like good practice to interrogate the dynamics of your relationships once in a while; separate your durable hoodies from your Topshop tunics circa 2006, so to speak. Exes you lied about wanting to stay friends? So long. That mouthy bloke you suffer because you rate his girlfriend, but with whom you always end up getting sucked into a two-hour debate about identity politics at someone\u2019s birthday drinks? Farewell. The person whose birthday drinks it was? Auf wiedersehen, didn\u2019t really know her anyway. After a week of culling stragglers, I don\u2019t notice much difference. I guess I\u2019m not widely known for my witty rapport or eagerness to go outside. Also, I don\u2019t tell anyone that\u2019s what I am doing, which is arguably bad form since one of Kondo\u2019s main rules is to thoughtfully consider an item and thank it for its service before letting it go. But it feels unnecessary to hit up someone I\u2019ve seen naked, after several months of silence, to inform them I won\u2019t be responding to their texts in future because they don\u2019t spark the requisite joy. Still, I feel better. As a wretched people pleaser, I find it difficult to liberate myself from the sense of obligation to be everywhere for everyone all the time, and the inevitable crush of guilt that comes with that impossible task. It is freeing to have a system imposed upon me that gives me permission to ignore a text asking me to listen to a friend of a friend\u2019s band; I can concentrate on more pleasurable activities instead, like watching YouTube documentaries about serial killers or doing a protein treatment on my hair. All this extra leisure time and free headspace makes me feel like a member of the aristocracy, or a regular man. The more I learn to appreciate doing things I actually want to do, the more everything else starts to feel like an imposition. Do I want to go out for a drink? Do I want to do emotional labour at 10pm on a Wednesday? Or, do I want to watch The Office while deleting every text that isn\u2019t a soup recipe from my mother? The more I shoot people down, the easier it becomes. It starts with loose acquaintances, but this reasoning begins to infiltrate my close friendships as well. Sorry, mate, can we see that film you like the look of another night? Sorry, mate, I know it\u2019s your wedding but the thing is: I don\u2019t feel like it. Sorry, mate, I can sense something heavy is about to come up in this conversation so I\u2019m going to excuse myself to go to the toilet for a really, really long time. After two weeks of indulging myself, I forget how to have a normal conversation. I feel strange and empty. Presumably someone less desperate for solace would benefit from this process. I, however, have spent more time with the big rabbit at my local museum than my own housemates, and now nobody speaks to me unless it\u2019s about bills. 2. Love. Can I reorganise my relationship and pinpoint our shared vision? Having reduced my number of partners to one, I have already KonMari\u2019d my love life by acknowledging what sparks joy (someone who gives me compliments and laughs at my farts) and discarding the rest (Tinder matches whose ambivalence I overlooked in exchange for free pizza). But how does the method fare within the framework of heterosexual monogamy? The KonMari method does claim that couples can deepen their ties through tidying, but I can\u2019t be arsed with that. My boyfriend is five years younger than me and we have enough of a borderline mother/son dynamic as it is, without getting into enforced room tidying. Instead, I decide to organise my relationship the way Kondo reckons I should organise my wardrobe: pinpoint my vision, pile everything up, then take each item in my hand and think about how it fits into my end goal. The first hurdle I encounter is that I don\u2019t have an end goal. I don\u2019t want to get married. I don\u2019t want kids until I know I\u2019ve hit my physical peak, and the only way we\u2019re getting a house in this economy is if we build it on The Sims. So we apply the KonMari method to the reliable constant we do have: sex. Just to clarify, when Kondo talks about \u201csparking joy\u201d she\u2019s referring to a warm and positive feeling. It\u2019s not a case of choosing what to discard, but of choosing what to keep. This philosophy fell flat on its arse as far as friendships were concerned, but came into its own when it involved spreading my nefarious paraphernalia out on a bed to see which things we wanted to take into our future. There is something beautiful about holding a knackered bullet vibrator tenderly in your hands, as a couple, and whispering, \u201cThank you for your service\u201d, before dropping it into a bin. 3. Food. Do I want to take this sausage roll into my future? Can I take two? The KonMari method is about checking in with your feelings toward things. Whether it\u2019s a cushion or a cardigan, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When applied to food, this became complicated, because the eye of this beholder tends to be much larger than her stomach. I usually manage to curb myself from eating half a pint of ice-cream right before bed. What I want, however, is to eat the whole thing and wake up at 3am with acid reflux. So, in the noble pursuit of joy, I allow it. In goes the ice-cream, along with 1,000 almonds which I chain eat throughout the day, and an obscene amount of bread. Of course, I ask myself the difficult, soul-searching questions along the way: Do I want to take this sausage roll with me into my future? Or am I just bored? Obviously, the answer is always, \u201cCan I have two sausage rolls please.\u201d But said with feeling, which is what counts. The biggest change I have to make is to my weekday work lunches. Typically, these consist of whatever I\u2019ve had the night before, reheated. I\u2019ve been vegan for seven years and I\u2019m the first to admit couscous is austere, especially when eaten three meals in a row after a 16-hour stint in the fridge. Unfortunately, my finances dictate that this is the life I must lead. So I try to break up the day by seeking out joy elsewhere. This mainly involves asking everyone I come across if they have a biscuit, like a 15-year-old hustling for cigarettes, and going to Pret a Manger every few hours. I have not eaten this poorly since year seven, when I developed a mistrust of the school canteen and spent all my lunch money on Galaxy Caramel. 4. Social media. Can I take a moment each morning to thank the internet? If you were to \u201ctidy up\u201d your social media \u2013 by posting only things that are \u201cmeaningful\u201d and deleting everything that is no longer of value, for example \u2013 you\u2019d quickly realise that what you have on your hands is the equivalent of five to 10 years\u2019 worth of knickers with the elastic gone out of the waist. This dank meme; this well-lit photograph of a mountain near your parents\u2019 house; this witty observation about Brexit \u2013 do they spark joy? The answer is no. To tidy my life accordingly, I would have to wipe it all. Erase my digital footprint. End up doing that thing grizzled white male actors do in films that are well received at Cannes, where they abandon society to rusticate in the mountains and raise their children outside the toxic grip of \u201cthe system\u201d. I would go mad, basically. Instead, I stop using apps unless I \u201cneed to\u201d. I delete Facebook, tweet only things that are work-related and unsubscribe from every Reddit community except one where people submit gifs of animals being brushed. I revert to life as it was at the dawn of social networking \u2013 where the only conversations you had were ones you sought out, where feelings were communicated through quotes from coming of age books and photos of Courtney Love. Scrolling through Instagram one evening towards the end of the experiment, I think about all the moments in Kondo\u2019s Netflix show where she gathers everyone together in one communal spot to thank it before the tidying process can begin. Everyone closes their eyes for a quiet moment of reflection, in which they acknowledge the space they\u2019ve made for themselves but probably take for granted every day. The result of this mini-meditation is often an overwhelming sense of appreciation \u2013 a feeling of warmth that clears a path for gratitude, illuminating everything around you even if it is a total shit tip. It\u2019s a touching moment \u2013 one that\u2019s antithetical to the way we operate normally, especially on social media, which is literally designed so that any object is instantly replaced by the next. I consider a future where I take a moment each morning to thank modern technology. Perhaps that small act of recognition would make the whole thing less horrid, less antagonistic, and it would become a force for good. Then I think about actually closing my eyes and saying, \u201cThank you, computer\u201d before logging on for a nice long day of smashing \u2018like\u2019 on criticisms of Winston Churchill, and how psychotic that would be. And it brings me joy. \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

      "body": "<p>Bucket lists are often about travel: visit Petra or Angkor Wat, Oktoberfest or the Venice carnival. Or they include physical feats of derring-do: bagging Munros, run a marathon. Rarely do they involve art.</p> <p>When I was 20 I had no concept of a bucket list. However, I did set myself a goal: I decided to see in the flesh all of the paintings by the 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.</p> <p>In the autumn of the previous year, 1981, I first saw a poster of Vermeer\u2019s <em>Girl </em><em>With a Pearl Earring</em> at my sister\u2019s apartment. Smitten by the lovely girl with her blue and yellow turban, her wide eyes and her enigmatic expression, I bought myself a copy, which I have to this day. While knowing nothing about Vermeer, I decided to seek out more of his work.</p> <p>It turns out there is little to know. Vermeer lived his whole life in Delft, a small town just south of The Hague. He trained as an artist, traded in paintings, married a Catholic woman, had 11 surviving children, was in debt several times, and died, probably of a stress-induced heart attack or stroke, in 1675 at the age of 43. We have no letters to or from him, no other writing, not even any drawings. Just 35 paintings that we\u2019re certain of, plus two others that may or may not be by him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The paintings are beautifully lit and have a calm, transcendent quality that makes us want to climb inside to experience that feeling too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what paintings! Most are of people alone, often women, set apart from us, performing domestic activities like pouring milk, writing a letter, putting on a necklace, playing a lute. They are beautifully lit and have a calm, transcendent quality that makes us want to climb inside to experience that feeling too.</p> <p>At the National Gallery in my hometown, Washington DC, there were three Vermeers (and a \u201ccautiously attributed\u201d fourth). I had probably seen them before and just not clocked them \u2013 though it\u2019s hard to understand why not.</p> <p>In 1982 I was a student in Britain for four months and saw two Vermeers at the National Gallery in London. On a visit to Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum, I laid eyes on four. It was then that I turned my natural interest into a challenge to see all of his work. Compared with the hundreds by Rembrandt or the thousands by Picasso, 37 paintings seemed achievable.</p> <p>At first I didn\u2019t make special trips, but made sure to seek out Vermeer when I was visiting a city. Dublin, tick. Edinburgh, tick. Paris, tick tick. New York, where within a mile radius you can see eight: three at the Frick Collection, five at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Tick! It was like twitchers crossing off the birds they\u2019ve seen, or trainspotters with their books of engine numbers. I became a Vermeer spotter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2979e0732c4d789e7d972fd0a2f98dcc8fd820ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2979e0732c4d789e7d972fd0a2f98dcc8fd820ae/89_0_2963_3704/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of Painting Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The Art of Painting</em> by Vermeer<em> </em>at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johansen Krause/Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some visits were particularly memorable. At the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, I spent a blissful afternoon alone with <em>The Art of Painting</em>, in which an artist, thought to be Vermeer himself, wearing striking red stockings, paints with his back to us. Hundreds of unobservant visitors walked straight past it. At the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, a gorgeous house stuffed with art, I took for granted seeing <em>The Concert</em>; little did I know the painting would be stolen a few years later, never to resurface. From my London home, while writing a novel about Vermeer, I regularly walked a mile across Hampstead Heath to see <em>The Guitar Playe</em>r at Kenwood House, looking for inspiration.</p> <p> By spring 1996 I\u2019d seen 24 of the 37 possible paintings; then I hit the mother lode, going to a Vermeer retrospective at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, which was displaying 23 works. It was so popular I had to look at the paintings over a sea of shoulders and had only a few seconds in front of each before being jostled out of the way.</p> <p>That is not the ideal way to see a Vermeer. Preferably you want lots of time in a calm empty room. They feel distant at first, and you have to focus on them over time in order to enter into their worlds.</p> <p>There was no time or space at the 1996 exhibition, but at least I was able to cross off six more Vermeers from my list \u2013 including, fatefully for me, <em>Girl </em><em>With a Pearl Earring</em>, which has its home at the Mauritshuis. I had no idea that 20 months later I would be lying in bed looking at my poster and would suddenly wonder, \u201cWhat did Vermeer do to her to make her look at him like that?\u201d So began the creation of the story that became my novel. I based the plot on the few details we know about the painting: that Vermeer had a large household, that he had different women wear his wife\u2019s clothes in various works, that he painted slowly. A pretty girl wearing a borrowed earring, modelling for months in a studio away from the family, with that look on her face? The drama practically wrote itself.</p> <p>Twenty years after its publication and 5m copies later, I am still astonished by its success. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be. It turns out <em>Girl With a Pearl Earring</em> is a painting that has captured many people\u2019s hearts, and they want to know more about it. The paintings have become increasingly popular, with so many exhibitions since that 1996 show. Given the scarcity of his work, most create a theme \u2013 Vermeer and women, Vermeer and Delft, Vermeer and music \u2013 and add paintings by other Dutch artists. However good those are, the Vermeers always stand out from the rest, as if a spotlight is shining specially on them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Standing in his place, I feel closer to this artist I will never meet. I only ever experience the magic of that moment with a real painting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why see his paintings in the flesh, though? In the 80s when I began Vermeer-spotting, the only way you could view his work was through dubious reproductions.

It even includes a \u201cvirtual exhibition\u201d where all the Vermeers hang in augmented reality. Why bother to go to the Mauritshuis to see <em>Girl</em> in person, then?</p> <p>I always prefer to be in the room with a painting. For one thing, screens are backlit and display a souped-up version of the work that is not true to life. Screens are also in places surrounded by lots of distractions \u2013 in offices, on trains, in cafes. It\u2019s hard to focus on a painting with so much going on around it. Looking at an artwork in a gallery is rather like watching a film in a cinema: you are experiencing it in a space designed for this purpose. It gives you the physical and mental freedom to concentrate on the work. You can also move back and forth, in and out of a physical space, taking in the painting from different angles in a way that the \u201czooming\u201d button on a screen doesn\u2019t allow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59e81d2d70aaa13a62f54608aa0aa299c3cacb95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59e81d2d70aaa13a62f54608aa0aa299c3cacb95/0_0_1956_2554/766.jpg\" alt=\"Vermeer\u2019s Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window \" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vermeer\u2019s <em>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window. </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The three-dimensional aspect of a room also creates an atmosphere: the air around you, the soundscape, the light, even the smell \u2013 all of this contributes to how you experience a painting.

Of course, gallery atmosphere can be wrecked too by the arrival of a tour group or people taking selfies.

Standing in his place, I feel closer to this artist I will never meet. I only ever experience the magic of that moment with a real painting.</p> <p>Once Vermeer had become so popular, it was relatively easy for me to polish off my list of paintings. In 2003 when the Prado in Madrid contacted me about doing an event during their Vermeer exhibition, my first question was not, \u201cWhat would you like me to talk about?\u201d Instead I demanded, \u201cWhich Vermeers will be there?\u201d I said \u201cyes\u201d only because <em>Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window</em> was being shown. </p> <p>When I stood in front of that last painting, I felt a sense of satisfaction at completing my list, but also at a loss at having reached my goal.

Too hard: I adore him but there are more than 300. Caravaggio? Ninety-plus is more doable. But I don\u2019t have the same attachment to these artists that I have to Vermeer. I have not written books about them or talked about them over the past two decades. Choosing to spot them would feel more mechanical and less emotionally satisfying. Perhaps it\u2019s time to go to Petra instead. I\u2019ve booked my ticket.

      "body": "<h2>Joe Root</h2> <p>\u201cCut off the head and the rest will follow\u201d was a phrase often used in the dressing room of the great West Indies sides of the 80s. Their fast bowlers would make a point of targeting the opposition captain in the (usually justified) expectation that this would cause maximum distress. On this tour they managed this most successfully. After two Tests Joe Root had scored 55 runs. In Antigua the England captain received two brutish deliveries, which he could do little about. Job done. Series won.</p> <p>Root, by an increasingly disturbing margin, is England\u2019s best batsman. He will also be captain for the Ashes series and no doubt the Australians, too, will target him. His runs are more important to England than his captaincy, which is not a veiled suggestion to get rid of him but a reminder that his extra responsibilities should never cause him to neglect his own game.</p> <p>He is a conscientious, hands-on captain and there is a danger that he tries to do too much. Trevor Bayliss is clearly supportive and quite candid: \u201cI think he will be the first to admit he is not the finished article,\u201d says the England coach. \u201cBut I can see improvements since he started and more confidence in making decisions and talking to the guys. He is growing all the time. He will just get better.\u201d The more runs he scores, the better he will be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ben Stokes</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/15/mark-wood-england-you-feel-like-a-superhero-cricket\">Mark Wood: \u2018You almost feel like a superhero \u2026 you\u2019re absolutely flying\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stokes is the other obvious key man in the Ashes. His absence last time scuppered England\u2019s campaign before it started. His runs and wickets are important but in Australia especially being denied his competitive instincts on the field was even more critical. Once more Bayliss emphasised why after the series in the West Indies: \u201cHe will not back down from anything.\u201d</p> <p>This is a mild-mannered England side, which can be considered a virtue, and they aim to play the game properly, as outlined by Moeen Ali when musing about the Shannon Gabriel incident: \u201cWe want people to be attracted to the game. Put the mics up \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be swearing. Keep it funny. There\u2019s brilliant ways to sledge. Just don\u2019t go personal. It\u2019s time for people to behave themselves.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with that but, if it gets feisty against the Australians \u2013 and it often does \u2013 Stokes\u2019s presence on the field will be welcome.</p> <p>The encouraging aspect of this tour \u2013 so far \u2013 is that his body has survived the rigours of bowling more overs than expected and he has bowled well with hostility. There were also signs that he is rediscovering how to take the attack to the opposition bowlers, which is when he can cause havoc. It is not necessarily to England\u2019s benefit for Stokes to bat too responsibly. A random yet striking statistic from the series, given that England line up with so many of their one-day cavaliers: England hit four sixes, West Indies 24.</p> <h2>Rory Burns</h2> <p>One or two of the non-established players will have to kick on if England are to prevail this summer and Rory Burns falls into that category. At the moment his figures are no better than those of his recent predecessors: 300 Test runs at 25.00 in six Tests. A reminder on behalf of the top-order fraternity of batsmen may be worthwhile here: far more often than not, opening against a brand new hard ball is the toughest place to bat. It is no coincidence that among England\u2019s established batsmen no one wants to bat at No 3 or above and Root may be the only one capable of doing so.</p> <p>The selectors will soon be monitoring the County Championship closely but on 5 and 11 April, when the first two rounds commence, life will be far from straightforward for England\u2019s opening batsmen.

      "bodyText": "Joe Root \u201cCut off the head and the rest will follow\u201d was a phrase often used in the dressing room of the great West Indies sides of the 80s. Their fast bowlers would make a point of targeting the opposition captain in the (usually justified) expectation that this would cause maximum distress. On this tour they managed this most successfully. After two Tests Joe Root had scored 55 runs. In Antigua the England captain received two brutish deliveries, which he could do little about. Job done. Series won. Root, by an increasingly disturbing margin, is England\u2019s best batsman. He will also be captain for the Ashes series and no doubt the Australians, too, will target him. His runs are more important to England than his captaincy, which is not a veiled suggestion to get rid of him but a reminder that his extra responsibilities should never cause him to neglect his own game. He is a conscientious, hands-on captain and there is a danger that he tries to do too much. Trevor Bayliss is clearly supportive and quite candid: \u201cI think he will be the first to admit he is not the finished article,\u201d says the England coach. \u201cBut I can see improvements since he started and more confidence in making decisions and talking to the guys. He is growing all the time. He will just get better.\u201d The more runs he scores, the better he will be. Ben Stokes Stokes is the other obvious key man in the Ashes. His absence last time scuppered England\u2019s campaign before it started. His runs and wickets are important but in Australia especially being denied his competitive instincts on the field was even more critical. Once more Bayliss emphasised why after the series in the West Indies: \u201cHe will not back down from anything.\u201d This is a mild-mannered England side, which can be considered a virtue, and they aim to play the game properly, as outlined by Moeen Ali when musing about the Shannon Gabriel incident: \u201cWe want people to be attracted to the game. Put the mics up \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be swearing. Keep it funny. There\u2019s brilliant ways to sledge. Just don\u2019t go personal. It\u2019s time for people to behave themselves.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with that but, if it gets feisty against the Australians \u2013 and it often does \u2013 Stokes\u2019s presence on the field will be welcome. The encouraging aspect of this tour \u2013 so far \u2013 is that his body has survived the rigours of bowling more overs than expected and he has bowled well with hostility. There were also signs that he is rediscovering how to take the attack to the opposition bowlers, which is when he can cause havoc. It is not necessarily to England\u2019s benefit for Stokes to bat too responsibly. A random yet striking statistic from the series, given that England line up with so many of their one-day cavaliers: England hit four sixes, West Indies 24. Rory Burns One or two of the non-established players will have to kick on if England are to prevail this summer and Rory Burns falls into that category. At the moment his figures are no better than those of his recent predecessors: 300 Test runs at 25.00 in six Tests. A reminder on behalf of the top-order fraternity of batsmen may be worthwhile here: far more often than not, opening against a brand new hard ball is the toughest place to bat. It is no coincidence that among England\u2019s established batsmen no one wants to bat at No 3 or above and Root may be the only one capable of doing so. The selectors will soon be monitoring the County Championship closely but on 5 and 11 April, when the first two rounds commence, life will be far from straightforward for England\u2019s opening batsmen. When the ball is moving extravagantly the temptation is to have a swing and hope for the best, a strategy that seldom works at Test level. In fact in 2019 the championship fixture list actually includes some matches in the summer (primarily because of the World Cup). But in 2020 those matches will revert to the extremities of the season. Aspiring young batsmen will increasingly spurn the challenges of opening the batting. \u201cI want to be at No 5 and smash sixes in June, July and August in the Blast and the Hundred.\u201d For reasons of self-preservation the best players do not want to open.

      "body": "<p>It was a matter of universal agreement during the years of Harold Wilson\u2019s leadership of the Labour party that his private and political secretary, Marcia Williams, who has died aged 86, was the single most influential figure among his staff. She exerted an unrivalled degree of power throughout his four periods in office as prime minister and ran his office for 27 years, but became a source of conflict and division that clouded his years in Downing Street and ultimately diminished his political standing.</p> <p>The principal cause of damage to his reputation proved to be Wilson\u2019s resignation honours, which became infamous as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/from-lloyd-george-to-the-lavender-list-the-history-of-honours-scandals\">\u201clavender list\u201d</a>, so called because the original draft by Williams was on lavender-coloured notepaper. Roy Jenkins described the list as \u201cat best, eccentric\u201d, because among those rewarded with peerages and knighthoods were a number of adventurous businessmen who were close neither to Wilson nor to the Labour party and several of whom were later publicly disgraced. They included Lord Kagan, manufacturer of the Gannex raincoat favoured by Wilson, who had helped finance Williams\u2019s political office and the first of two neighbouring houses she owned in a Marylebone mews; he was subsequently jailed for currency offences.</p> <p>Another beneficiary was James Goldsmith, who received a knighthood even though he had financed the Conservative party in two recent elections. It was later disclosed that he had helped pay for the private education of Williams\u2019s two sons. Another knighthood was awarded to Eric Miller, a wealthy Labour party financier, who bought the second mews house for Williams. He took his own life when on the point of being declared bankrupt and shortly before a critical Department of Trade and Industry report into his business dealings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2017/jul/22/from-the-observer-archive-this-week-in-1967-harold-wilson-labour-party\">From the Observer archive: this week in 1967</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the ignominy heaped upon Wilson and, somewhat tragically, upon his political legacy as a consequence of this humiliating episode at the end of his long career, there was nevertheless no doubt among those who worked with him about the extraordinary debt he owed Williams for the loyalty and inspiration she had provided for him throughout his rise to the leadership of the Labour party. Roy Jenkins believed that she had the best judgment and the greatest courage among Wilson\u2019s advisers in what was then known as the \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d, and Richard Crossman noted in his diaries in 1967 that \u201cMarcia \u2026 has got more influence with Harold now than any single man\u201d.</p> <p>She had a sharp political insight, was admired for her ability to transform the prime minister\u2019s speeches with sheer brainpower, and was invaluable to Wilson because she understood the Labour party and recognised the importance of keeping him in line with the left wing.</p> <p>That she was imperious, impulsive and unpredictable could often prove difficult for the smooth running of the government operation, but the flip-side advantage was that she could also use the same characteristics to assert her political will over the stubborn resistance of the civil service bureaucracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec88b87bef4c6c3625f236d26c30640c5816b8f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec88b87bef4c6c3625f236d26c30640c5816b8f9/6_190_6949_4170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Falkender in 1981: imperious, impulsive and unpredictable\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Falkender in 1981: imperious, impulsive and unpredictable\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITN/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was particularly feared in the Treasury. She always played an important part in any government reshuffle, often deciding the fate of individual cabinet ministers. Tony Benn, who both liked her and appreciated her strategic skills, confided to his diary with some approval in 1973 that Wilson was being \u201crun\u201d by her. \u201cFix it up with Marcia\u201d was a watchword in Wilson\u2019s office from his earliest years at Westminster.</p> <p>She was born at Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, the daughter of Harry Field, a brickworks manager, and his wife, Dorothy. According to a story related to others by Wilson and believed by him but not otherwise authenticated, Dorothy, born in 1902, was an unacknowledged child of Edward VII, a prodigious womaniser during his many years as Prince of Wales who accepted no responsibility for any offspring. In Wilson\u2019s account, an aide de camp named Falkender was obliged to claim fatherhood of Dorothy, whose assumed surname her daughter would later take as her title in the House of Lords.</p> <p>Marcia was a pupil at Northampton high school, where she became an enthusiastic Labour supporter, influenced in her political awakening by her French teacher, Janet Margesson, the daughter of the former Conservative minister Lord Margesson, who had succeeded Anthony Eden as secretary of state for war in Churchill\u2019s war coalition government. She studied for an honours degree in history at Queen Mary College, London, topped it up with a secretarial course, and in 1955 took a job working for the then Labour party general secretary, Morgan Phillips, at Transport House.

She claimed later that she and Wilson first met shortly afterwards, when he recognised her at a bus stop as a member of the party staff, and gave her a lift. It was then that he discovered she was the anonymous author of notes sent to him about the poor state of Labour\u2019s organisation, when he was compiling a report into its \u201cpenny farthing\u201d operation, warning him about political moves against him on the party executive.</p> <p>He hired her to work in his private office in 1956 and swiftly imbued her with a huge degree of personal responsibility, which rapidly grew consistently with his career. They were both clever and ambitious, and he needed Williams to manage his relationship with the Labour party in the highly charged political atmosphere of the early 1960s, as he unsuccessfully challenged Hugh Gaitskell for the leadership in 1960 and then succeeded him in the contest that followed Gaitskell\u2019s death in 1963. Once inside 10 Downing Street, Williams began empire-building, with an office immediately opposite the cabinet room and a growing staff and sense of her own authority.</p> <p>There was always a certain sensitivity about their personal relationship in their early years working together. Marcia and Ed Williams\u2019s marriage had not been a success, and he emigrated to the US, settling in Seattle in 1957. Marcia had a number of affairs while working for Wilson and one reason for sensitivity was the widespread rumour that he was among her lovers. An account published later by Wilson\u2019s press secretary, Joe Haines, reported her claim to have had a brief affair with Wilson in 1956, something she apparently related unkindly and dismissively to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/08/acerbic-and-firm-mary-wilson-remembered-fondly-after-death-at-102\">his wife, Mary</a>, in 1972, in a deliberate attempt to cause offence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa39363647f9e8590c543156598156fee75c77e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa39363647f9e8590c543156598156fee75c77e/0_804_4950_2970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson and Falkender with Jeremy Thorpe in London in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson and Falkender with Jeremy Thorpe in London in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lord Archer of Sandwell, who as Peter Archer served as solicitor general under Wilson from 1974, commented once: \u201cI thought it was established years ago that this rumour wasn\u2019t true.

What is known is that when first challenging for the party leadership, Harold Wilson took particular care to avoid the difficult publicity that could have been caused by Ed Williams\u2019s wish to divorce his wife and he secretly visited him in Seattle to urge discretion. The divorce was successfully kept from the press when it was granted in 1961.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s private life certainly helped fuel her intense fear and dislike of the press, but it was inevitable, given her growing power and status in Downing Street in the first two Wilson governments from 1964 to 1970, in opposition until 1974, and then with Wilson unexpectedly once again in office, that she should be subject to considerable public attention. It was thus remarkable that she conducted her longest affair with the political journalist Walter Terry, political editor successively of the Conservative-supporting Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sun, and with whom she had two sons, in 1968 and 1969, without a whiff reaching the press for many years of what would have been a considerable, even government-threatening scandal.

      "bodyText": "It was a matter of universal agreement during the years of Harold Wilson\u2019s leadership of the Labour party that his private and political secretary, Marcia Williams, who has died aged 86, was the single most influential figure among his staff. She exerted an unrivalled degree of power throughout his four periods in office as prime minister and ran his office for 27 years, but became a source of conflict and division that clouded his years in Downing Street and ultimately diminished his political standing. The principal cause of damage to his reputation proved to be Wilson\u2019s resignation honours, which became infamous as the \u201clavender list\u201d, so called because the original draft by Williams was on lavender-coloured notepaper. Roy Jenkins described the list as \u201cat best, eccentric\u201d, because among those rewarded with peerages and knighthoods were a number of adventurous businessmen who were close neither to Wilson nor to the Labour party and several of whom were later publicly disgraced. They included Lord Kagan, manufacturer of the Gannex raincoat favoured by Wilson, who had helped finance Williams\u2019s political office and the first of two neighbouring houses she owned in a Marylebone mews; he was subsequently jailed for currency offences. Another beneficiary was James Goldsmith, who received a knighthood even though he had financed the Conservative party in two recent elections. It was later disclosed that he had helped pay for the private education of Williams\u2019s two sons. Another knighthood was awarded to Eric Miller, a wealthy Labour party financier, who bought the second mews house for Williams. He took his own life when on the point of being declared bankrupt and shortly before a critical Department of Trade and Industry report into his business dealings. Despite the ignominy heaped upon Wilson and, somewhat tragically, upon his political legacy as a consequence of this humiliating episode at the end of his long career, there was nevertheless no doubt among those who worked with him about the extraordinary debt he owed Williams for the loyalty and inspiration she had provided for him throughout his rise to the leadership of the Labour party. Roy Jenkins believed that she had the best judgment and the greatest courage among Wilson\u2019s advisers in what was then known as the \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d, and Richard Crossman noted in his diaries in 1967 that \u201cMarcia \u2026 has got more influence with Harold now than any single man\u201d. She had a sharp political insight, was admired for her ability to transform the prime minister\u2019s speeches with sheer brainpower, and was invaluable to Wilson because she understood the Labour party and recognised the importance of keeping him in line with the left wing. That she was imperious, impulsive and unpredictable could often prove difficult for the smooth running of the government operation, but the flip-side advantage was that she could also use the same characteristics to assert her political will over the stubborn resistance of the civil service bureaucracy. She was particularly feared in the Treasury. She always played an important part in any government reshuffle, often deciding the fate of individual cabinet ministers. Tony Benn, who both liked her and appreciated her strategic skills, confided to his diary with some approval in 1973 that Wilson was being \u201crun\u201d by her. \u201cFix it up with Marcia\u201d was a watchword in Wilson\u2019s office from his earliest years at Westminster. She was born at Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, the daughter of Harry Field, a brickworks manager, and his wife, Dorothy. According to a story related to others by Wilson and believed by him but not otherwise authenticated, Dorothy, born in 1902, was an unacknowledged child of Edward VII, a prodigious womaniser during his many years as Prince of Wales who accepted no responsibility for any offspring. In Wilson\u2019s account, an aide de camp named Falkender was obliged to claim fatherhood of Dorothy, whose assumed surname her daughter would later take as her title in the House of Lords. Marcia was a pupil at Northampton high school, where she became an enthusiastic Labour supporter, influenced in her political awakening by her French teacher, Janet Margesson, the daughter of the former Conservative minister Lord Margesson, who had succeeded Anthony Eden as secretary of state for war in Churchill\u2019s war coalition government. She studied for an honours degree in history at Queen Mary College, London, topped it up with a secretarial course, and in 1955 took a job working for the then Labour party general secretary, Morgan Phillips, at Transport House. In the same year she married George Williams, known as Ed, an engineer. The following year, shorthand pad at the ready, she encountered Wilson at a notorious dinner given by the Labour party for Nikita Khrushchev at which the Soviet leader had a shouting match with the future foreign secretary, George Brown. She claimed later that she and Wilson first met shortly afterwards, when he recognised her at a bus stop as a member of the party staff, and gave her a lift. It was then that he discovered she was the anonymous author of notes sent to him about the poor state of Labour\u2019s organisation, when he was compiling a report into its \u201cpenny farthing\u201d operation, warning him about political moves against him on the party executive. He hired her to work in his private office in 1956 and swiftly imbued her with a huge degree of personal responsibility, which rapidly grew consistently with his career. They were both clever and ambitious, and he needed Williams to manage his relationship with the Labour party in the highly charged political atmosphere of the early 1960s, as he unsuccessfully challenged Hugh Gaitskell for the leadership in 1960 and then succeeded him in the contest that followed Gaitskell\u2019s death in 1963. Once inside 10 Downing Street, Williams began empire-building, with an office immediately opposite the cabinet room and a growing staff and sense of her own authority. There was always a certain sensitivity about their personal relationship in their early years working together. Marcia and Ed Williams\u2019s marriage had not been a success, and he emigrated to the US, settling in Seattle in 1957.

      "body": "<p>If there is a phrase that sums up Steve McManaman\u2019s time at Real Madrid, a four-year spell in which the Spanish club won La Liga and the Champions League twice apiece, it was perhaps the one delivered by an unlikely source. \u201c<em>El socio del todos</em>\u201d \u2013 \u201ca partner to everyone on the pitch\u201d\u2013 is how Johan Cruyff described the Merseyside-born Madridista, and he meant it neither sarcastically nor begrudgingly.</p> <p>Cruyff\u2019s assessment was instead genuine and warm-hearted, underlining the understated yet important role the midfielder played in Madrid\u2019s success at the start of the millennium, linking defence to Gal\u00e1cticos attack. This was the era of Ra\u00fal, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and the original Ronaldo, and McManaman\u2019s role was to give them the ball as often as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/22/manchester-united-liverpool-class-of-92-spice-boys-eric-cantona\">Manchester United 2-2 Liverpool: the Class of 92, Spice Boys and Cantona\u2019s return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He did it well and was undeniably a success \u2013 Real\u2019s best player in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZpCWxrPgS4\">2000 Champions League final</a> and, by the time he departed for Manchester City in August 2003, admired by supporters and legendary observers alike. And what made McManaman\u2019s time at the Bernab\u00e9u particularly noteworthy was that it required him to not only adapt but retreat. Because at Liverpool, the club he left to join Real, McManaman was very much front and centre. A fundamental attacking presence during a nine-year period that stretched across the 1990s.</p> <p>Having joined Liverpool at the age of 14, McManaman made 364 appearances for the club, scoring 66 goals. He was man of the match in the two cup finals they won during the decade \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTh77Mt94Kc\">1992 FA Cup final</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHsMYY7ZjA4\">1995 Coca-Cup final</a> \u2013 as well as impressing in two different roles; as an out-and-out winger and a free-moving No10 under Roy Evans. He also scored arguably the Merseysiders\u2019 most eye-catching goal of the era: the late equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Celtic at Parkhead on 16 September 1997 that McManaman himself describes as \u201cprobably my best for Liverpool\u201d.</p> <p>Before getting on to what McManaman did on that autumn night in Glasgowit is worth reflecting on his Liverpool career, for it is a curious one. \u2018Macca\u2019 was Anfield\u2019s most consistent and crucial performer for the best part of a decade yet never received the adulation shown to some of the players who featured alongside him. Robbie Fowler was God while Michael Owen was the boy wonder. Steven Gerrard appeared right at the end of the 90s and was immediately hailed as a saviour. McManaman, meanwhile, was admired more than he was adored, then as well as now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98beac99d9861a30c384317be42a635694fd2fc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98beac99d9861a30c384317be42a635694fd2fc6/0_197_1414_935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McManaman with the Coca-Cola Cup trophy after his decisive goals against Bolton in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McManaman with the Coca-Cola Cup trophy after his decisive goals against Bolton in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was the local lad who never fully connected with the locals, which in part may have had something to do with his boyhood affiliation to Everton, although that was not an issue for Fowler, Owen or another Red who emerged in the 90s, Jamie Carragher. Certainly the manner of his departure from the club in 1999 left a sour taste in Kopites\u2019 mouth \u2013 a free transfer that saw McManaman take full advantage of the Bosman ruling and Liverpool miss out on a fee of around \u00a315m which, believe it or not kids, was a lot of money back then.</p> <p>It could also have had something to do with his demeanour.

      "bodyText": "If there is a phrase that sums up Steve McManaman\u2019s time at Real Madrid, a four-year spell in which the Spanish club won La Liga and the Champions League twice apiece, it was perhaps the one delivered by an unlikely source. \u201cEl socio del todos\u201d \u2013 \u201ca partner to everyone on the pitch\u201d\u2013 is how Johan Cruyff described the Merseyside-born Madridista, and he meant it neither sarcastically nor begrudgingly. Cruyff\u2019s assessment was instead genuine and warm-hearted, underlining the understated yet important role the midfielder played in Madrid\u2019s success at the start of the millennium, linking defence to Gal\u00e1cticos attack. This was the era of Ra\u00fal, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and the original Ronaldo, and McManaman\u2019s role was to give them the ball as often as possible. He did it well and was undeniably a success \u2013 Real\u2019s best player in the 2000 Champions League final and, by the time he departed for Manchester City in August 2003, admired by supporters and legendary observers alike. And what made McManaman\u2019s time at the Bernab\u00e9u particularly noteworthy was that it required him to not only adapt but retreat. Because at Liverpool, the club he left to join Real, McManaman was very much front and centre. A fundamental attacking presence during a nine-year period that stretched across the 1990s. Having joined Liverpool at the age of 14, McManaman made 364 appearances for the club, scoring 66 goals. He was man of the match in the two cup finals they won during the decade \u2013 the 1992 FA Cup final and the 1995 Coca-Cup final \u2013 as well as impressing in two different roles; as an out-and-out winger and a free-moving No10 under Roy Evans. He also scored arguably the Merseysiders\u2019 most eye-catching goal of the era: the late equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Celtic at Parkhead on 16 September 1997 that McManaman himself describes as \u201cprobably my best for Liverpool\u201d. Before getting on to what McManaman did on that autumn night in Glasgowit is worth reflecting on his Liverpool career, for it is a curious one. \u2018Macca\u2019 was Anfield\u2019s most consistent and crucial performer for the best part of a decade yet never received the adulation shown to some of the players who featured alongside him. Robbie Fowler was God while Michael Owen was the boy wonder. Steven Gerrard appeared right at the end of the 90s and was immediately hailed as a saviour. McManaman, meanwhile, was admired more than he was adored, then as well as now. He was the local lad who never fully connected with the locals, which in part may have had something to do with his boyhood affiliation to Everton, although that was not an issue for Fowler, Owen or another Red who emerged in the 90s, Jamie Carragher. Certainly the manner of his departure from the club in 1999 left a sour taste in Kopites\u2019 mouth \u2013 a free transfer that saw McManaman take full advantage of the Bosman ruling and Liverpool miss out on a fee of around \u00a315m which, believe it or not kids, was a lot of money back then. It could also have had something to do with his demeanour. Shaggy of hair and baggy of shirt, not particularly vocal and a bit of ambler; McManaman gave the impression of someone who saw football as a profession rather than a vocation, something he could take or leave. In other words, the type of player any support base would find it tough to get behind. Fowler is among those who vehemently disputes the notion that McManaman didn\u2019t particular care about playing for Liverpool, and he should know better than most given the close relationship he formed with his fellow academy graduate, on and off the pitch. As Fowler put it in his 2005 autobiography: \u201cMacca\u2019s got the look of someone who doesn\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s but believe me, he does. He always has. He\u2019s a great professional, never let anyone down. Intelligent enough to understand what was being asked of him in any situation, and an incredible athlete. He used to piss all of us off in training because he could run all day. It came so easy to him.\u201d That was the thing about McManaman; he made difficult things look easy, and nothing more so than dribbling. Out wide or through the middle, he was able to carry the ball with supreme control and speed. McManaman\u2019s 6ft-plus frame also provided him with a long stride that allowed him to cover big distances not only quickly but efficiently.

      "bodyText": "A former Roman Catholic archbishop and cardinal has been dismissed from the priesthood after the Vatican found him guilty of sexually abusing minors in a sign of an increasingly hardline stance taken by the church. Theodore McCarrick, 88, one of the prominent figures in the church, was defrocked just days before an unprecedented global summit of bishops to discuss child sexual abuse is convened by the Vatican. The Vatican\u2019s move makes McCarrick the most senior figure to be removed from the priesthood in modern times. He will no longer be permitted to act as a cleric, and is forbidden to celebrate the sacraments except to grant absolution for sins to a person close to death. Only excommunication is a more severe punishment. Pope Francis has approved the action as \u201cdefinitive\u201d, meaning McCarrick will not be allowed to appeal, the Vatican said on Saturday. An earlier Vatican hearing had found him guilty of soliciting for sex while hearing confession \u201cwith the aggravating factor of the abuse of power\u201d and ordered his \u201cdismissal from the clerical state\u201d. McCarrick, who retired as archbishop of Washington DC in 2006, was forced to resign as a cardinal last July after a man publicly alleged that he had been sexually abused by the cleric from 1971, when he was a 16-year-old altar boy in New York. McCarrick denied the claims, but the archdiocese of New York found the allegation \u201ccredible and substantiated\u201d and turned the case over to the Vatican for investigation. Another man subsequently claimed he had also been abused as a child by McCarrick, and several former trainee priests alleged they had been sexually harassed by the former cardinal at his New Jersey beach house. Since September, McCarrick has been living in a friary in rural Kansas after being ordered to a \u201clife of prayer and penance\u201d. Pope Francis became personally embroiled in the McCarrick case after a retired Vatican diplomat accused the pontiff of being aware of rumours about McCarrick\u2019s behaviour but failing to take action. In an 11-page testimony, archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, 77, a former Vatican ambassador to the US, said there was a \u201cconspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia\u201d. He called on the pope to step down, saying: \u201cCorruption has reached the very top of the church\u2019s hierarchy.\u201d The accusations were seized on by Francis\u2019s conservative enemies, plunging the pope into the worst crisis of his papacy. Next week, more than 100 bishops from around the world will meet in Rome for a four-day summit convened by the pope to address issues of sexual abuse and its cover-up. It comes after a disastrous year for the church, with abuse and cover-up scandals emerging in multiple countries, and the pope being accused of failing to grasp the seriousness and scale of the problem. Francis has sought to get on top of the issue. In December, he vowed that the church would \u201cspare no effort\u201d to bring perpetrators to justice.",

      "body": "<p>Ben Okri\u2019s impassioned fable is a vision of hell on Earth, a Stygian dystopia in which anyone who questions the regime is punished. We are in an unnamed city whose ancient myths have been travestied and censored, and where literature is outlawed. Catastrophes engulf the planet; capitalism runs wild; the state enforces a \u201cpost-truth\u201d culture. Anyone exhibiting a perceived anomaly is culled.</p> <p>The cover asks: \u201cWho is the prisoner?\u201d This question, daubed on the city\u2019s walls by dissidents, is thus also put to the reader. We are asked to recognise that we are all imprisoned sleepwalkers who must embrace, through a renewed culture of reading, our freedom.</p> <p>Okri suffuses his parable in the sonorously repetitious language of myth, mysticism and fairytale. Twin narrative centres alternate, between the boy Mirababa, inheritor-to-be of a bardic mantle, and Karnak, the questing lover of Amalanta, who has been arrested for asking forbidden questions. Karnak\u2019s name conjures the Egyptian mysteries of Isis, as may Mirababa\u2019s visionary enclosure in a sarcophagus in a pyramidal mountain. Okri\u2019s symbolism is syncretist: all mystery religions are one.</p> <p>But how do these arcana sustain the reader today? Satirical and carnivalesque elements entertain as one searches into the novel\u2019s obscurities. Okri\u2019s treatment of mass hysteria is inventive: the suppressed citizens start screaming in their sleep. The Sleep Police prowl, listening out for non-screamers \u2013 those more likely to be subversive. Citizens start breaking down in public. Surgeons, pilots, bank managers sob and wail. You don\u2019t have to be sleeping to be asleep.</p> <p>Okri is celebrated for the scintillating magic realism of his 1991 Booker-winning <em>The Famished Road</em>. <em>The Freedom Artist</em> prefers magic to realism. Character and setting lack specificity. He claims that this novel is \u201cwritten in three languages: the language of fable ... of truth ... and of our secret predicament\u201d. This lofty and nebulous claim is made by a magus-novelist who exults in a kind of totalising of enigma and riddle, practising \u201cthe conjuring power of the word\u201d. I confess that I often longed for the rationality of Samuel Johnson\u2019s <em>Rasselas</em>, the wit of Voltaire\u2019s <em>Candide</em>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Freedom Artist is published by Head of Zeus (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Ben Okri\u2019s impassioned fable is a vision of hell on Earth, a Stygian dystopia in which anyone who questions the regime is punished. We are in an unnamed city whose ancient myths have been travestied and censored, and where literature is outlawed. Catastrophes engulf the planet; capitalism runs wild; the state enforces a \u201cpost-truth\u201d culture. Anyone exhibiting a perceived anomaly is culled. The cover asks: \u201cWho is the prisoner?\u201d This question, daubed on the city\u2019s walls by dissidents, is thus also put to the reader. We are asked to recognise that we are all imprisoned sleepwalkers who must embrace, through a renewed culture of reading, our freedom. Okri suffuses his parable in the sonorously repetitious language of myth, mysticism and fairytale. Twin narrative centres alternate, between the boy Mirababa, inheritor-to-be of a bardic mantle, and Karnak, the questing lover of Amalanta, who has been arrested for asking forbidden questions. Karnak\u2019s name conjures the Egyptian mysteries of Isis, as may Mirababa\u2019s visionary enclosure in a sarcophagus in a pyramidal mountain. Okri\u2019s symbolism is syncretist: all mystery religions are one. But how do these arcana sustain the reader today? Satirical and carnivalesque elements entertain as one searches into the novel\u2019s obscurities. Okri\u2019s treatment of mass hysteria is inventive: the suppressed citizens start screaming in their sleep. The Sleep Police prowl, listening out for non-screamers \u2013 those more likely to be subversive. Citizens start breaking down in public. Surgeons, pilots, bank managers sob and wail. You don\u2019t have to be sleeping to be asleep. Okri is celebrated for the scintillating magic realism of his 1991 Booker-winning The Famished Road. The Freedom Artist prefers magic to realism. Character and setting lack specificity. He claims that this novel is \u201cwritten in three languages: the language of fable ... of truth ... and of our secret predicament\u201d. This lofty and nebulous claim is made by a magus-novelist who exults in a kind of totalising of enigma and riddle, practising \u201cthe conjuring power of the word\u201d. I confess that I often longed for the rationality of Samuel Johnson\u2019s Rasselas, the wit of Voltaire\u2019s Candide. \u2022 The Freedom Artist is published by Head of Zeus (\u00a314.99).

It\u2019s a cross between ivy (hedera) and fatsia with large evergreen leaves, but it won\u2019t cling like ivy and is more restrained at around 1.5 metres: you can tie it to supports or leave it as what\u2019s sometimes called a \u201cloose-limbed shrub\u201d. Outside, give it full sun or partial shade; inside, it will do well in gloomy corners.

It\u2019s a cross between ivy (hedera) and fatsia with large evergreen leaves, but it won\u2019t cling like ivy and is more restrained at around 1.5 metres: you can tie it to supports or leave it as what\u2019s sometimes called a \u201cloose-limbed shrub\u201d. Outside, give it full sun or partial shade; inside, it will do well in gloomy corners. Look out for variegated forms including the dappled \u2018Annemieke\u2019. Cut this As hellebores come into flower, it\u2019s easy to lose their nodding flowers among last year\u2019s leathery foliage. Cut the leaves away at the base. This is particularly important if the foliage has brown patches, as this is a sign of hellebore leaf spot. If leaves look infected, bin them rather than composting. Read this From the jade plant to the Aloe vera, cacti and succulents have never been more popular. If yours are a mushy mess, invest in the RHS Practical Cactus And Succulent Book by Zia Allaway and Fran Bailey (Dorling Kindersley). It has plant profiles and clever display ideas, so with this book your fleshy plant friends will thrive.",

When it came out in the US last October (as <em>The Witch Elm</em>, presumably because the tree in question is European and thus unfamiliar to her Stateside readership), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/books/review/tana-french-witch-elm.html\" title=\"\">Stephen King took to the New York Times</a> to pronounce it extraordinary, and to invoke the names of Thomas Hardy, James Ellroy and Ruth Rendell: \u201cThe prose, as fine as it is, as dense as it is, as obsessive as it is, remains in service to the story. This is good work by a good writer. For the reader, what luck.\u201d</p> <p>That final word is deliberately chosen; luck is one of <em>The Wych Elm</em>\u2019s abiding themes, and specifically the good fortune enjoyed by its narrator, Toby, throughout the first 28 years of his life. From a united, loving and affluent family, Toby tootles along doing PR for an art gallery, driving his BMW and enjoying his free time with nice-as-pie girlfriend Melissa, with whom he is fondly, if vaguely, considering settling down. Struggling millennial he is not. \u201cEverything has conspired to make him a person for whom the world is set up,\u201d explains French; but when disaster strikes, \u201che\u2019s not really equipped to cope with any of these things. I think I was thinking a lot about what happens if you\u2019re too lucky in life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese things\u201d would not, in truth, be easy for anyone to deal with. In a boozy snooze after a night on the lash with pals, Toby is woken by intruders in his plush flat; in the ensuing struggle, he receives a head injury that impairs his movement, his confidence and, crucially, his memory. In retreat from the world, and increasingly dependent on reality-skewing drugs, he goes to spend the summer caring for his dying uncle Hugo at the family pile on the outskirts of Dublin. This not entirely perfect plan \u2013 there are some deliciously creepy cousins knocking about too \u2013 goes startlingly awry when a skull turns up stuffed into a tree trunk in the garden.</p> <p>Slowly but surely, Toby\u2019s world begins to unravel, bringing to life parts of his past that he has either thoroughly repressed or never apprehended: \u201cHe\u2019s always taken for granted that his experience is the defining one \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing that counts or matters or has any bearing on reality.

French\u2019s childhood was marked by frequent moves \u2013 her father\u2019s career as a development economist took the family from Vermont to Florence when French was a baby, and later Malawi. By contrast, her husband, Anthony Breatnach, is \u201cstraight-up Dublin all the way\u201d and comes from the ancient inner-city district of the Liberties, so-called because for centuries it operated according to laws separate from the rest of the city. Fascinated by its difference from her own upbringing, French used it in her 2010 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/28/book-review-faithful-place-tana-french\" title=\"\">Faithful Place</a></em>. When she grew up, she didn\u2019t \u2013 as some kids do \u2013 rebel against her nomadic life by dashing towards the most stable career path she could find. Instead, she became an actor, working mainly in theatre, and supplementing her income with voiceovers and corporate work (\u201cClick on the icon below for more information,\u201d she instructs me, by way of demonstration. \u201cStill got it!\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidence that a lot of writers \u2013 a lot of actors too \u2013 are third-culture kids,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of it is that we\u2019re comfortable with the instability that goes with the arts life. We\u2019re at home with the idea that you don\u2019t have one solid job that lasts you for ever, it\u2019s not a big upheaval mentally.\u201d In a break between theatre jobs, she worked on an archaeological dig \u2013 another passion \u2013 and became captivated by a wood near the excavation site. She began to imagine the story of three young children playing there, and only one coming out, unable to remember what\u2019s happened and traumatised thereafter. She scribbled it down, found the piece of paper a year later and still wanted to know what happened. The only option was to write the story herself.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could do it, but I figured I could probably write one scene, and then another scene \u2013 and then, oh my God, I\u2019ve got a chapter, and then at a certain point I found myself turning down acting work \u2026 I realised I was pretty serious about it.\u201d She is, she thinks, \u201cthe only person who went into writing because it was a more stable career than what I was doing. Contracted for four years!

I guess that makes sense for an actor to say.\u201d She is an enormous fan of Tartt, declaring <em>The Secret History</em> \u201cone of the great mystery books of all time, and one of the great literary novels, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And she doesn\u2019t compromise on either one. She doesn\u2019t seem to see any reason why she should be limited by either set of genre expectations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe0b0de28a3d2ed7135ef68d0a9babb1aea41f14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe0b0de28a3d2ed7135ef68d0a9babb1aea41f14/0_202_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French is an enormous fan of Donna Tartt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French is an enormous fan of Donna Tartt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bas Czerwinski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kernel of <em>The Wych Elm</em>\u2019s plot comes from a grisly and sad unsolved crime, in which a group of boys found a woman\u2019s remains in a tree-trunk in Worcestershire in 1943. Her identity is still unknown, despite speculation that she was a wartime spy, but the year after the discovery a piece of graffiti asking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/14/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">\u201cWho put Bella in the wych elm?\u201d </a>appeared in Birmingham. French tells me that her brother sent her a link to the case, with the message \u201cThis sounds like a Tana French book\u201d; and the setting for her study of buried history that comes bursting into the present revealed itself.</p> <p>But that\u2019s about as recent a historical murder that French finds herself drawn to; she\u2019s not been swept up in the current vogue for rooting around in violent criminal cases, finding expression in podcasts such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/05/serial-podcast-third-season-tackle-us-criminal-justice-system\" title=\"\">Serial</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/murder-mystery-and-a-media-storm-in-west-cork\" title=\"\">West Cork</a></em>: \u201cI\u2019m not really interested by modern true crime, partly because there are people who are still in pain \u2026 and I find it very hard to see it as a fascinating story. But the historical stuff gives you a window into a time and place.\u201d She admires, for example, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/12/history.ianrankin\" title=\"\">The Suspicions of Mr Whicher</a></em> by Kate Summerscale, which examined the murder of a child but also put the class tensions of the mid 19th century, and the role of the police force, under the microscope.</p> <p>Nonetheless, French understands why our fascination with those who solve crime fuels popular podcasts and TV programmes, pointing out that they bring us one step closer to the feeling that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a professional detective to be someone who moves the solution forwards\u201d. I ask her about the problem that must face many writers of crime-related fiction: that real detective work is, necessarily, arduous and mundane. She agrees: \u201cYou have to write your way around the fact that a vast amount of this stuff is paperwork and crap and trying to get overtime out of a budget that\u2019s overstretched already and making sure you filled things in in triplicate.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I mess up at work, there\u2019s too many adjectives. Detectives have a bad day, somebody could die</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s something more existential at play: \u201cYou have to be the kind of person who\u2019s comfortable being right here face to face with the worst of reality. And it\u2019s in some ways the opposite of being a crime writer. I make stuff up all day. They\u2019ve got truth and justice and life and death on them doing it right. I mess up, there\u2019s too many adjectives. They have a bad day at work, somebody could die. The idea of somebody who\u2019s willing to take on something that high-stakes is fascinating to me. I\u2019m in awe.\u201d</p> <p>To get her stories straight, French has long conversations with a retired detective. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing guy, he\u2019s so generous with not just his time but his stories. He answers questions I didn\u2019t even know I needed to ask; about the atmosphere, and about the way the dynamics work, and the power plays.\u201d When she was working on her last book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/07/the-trespasser-tana-french-review-crime-novel\" title=\"\">The Trespasser</a></em>, she rang him to ask about a particular interview technique, and by way of answer, he began to grill her. \u201cThere was this mode switch. He went from this lovely, friendly, warm guy to this unstoppable force, who was just focused on me and was getting what he wanted and there was no way I was going to get away from it.\u201d</p> <p>I say that sounds a little bit like acting. \u201cYes, they\u2019re running everything, the atmosphere in the room, the rhythm of the conversation \u2013 they can speed it up, slow it down. They\u2019re experts at this. They\u2019re conductors, in a way, bringing things louder and softer. They\u2019re absolute experts in understanding people and bringing the right pressures to bear. And it\u2019s something against which civilians are completely unequipped.\u201d</p> <p>Has all that inside track made her think she might be able to commit a crime and get away with it? \u201cOh God, no!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt made me think that there\u2019s no way. I don\u2019t know how anybody manages to stay ahead of these people who are so trained and have skills that you haven\u2019t even thought about. Not just for practical reasons, though, but because I think probably nobody with a lot of imagination should ever commit a crime. Because you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the stress. You would be imagining all the possible ways you could be caught. You\u2019d go to pieces inside a week.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tana French will be in</em><em> conversation with John Boyne at <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/events/tana-french-in-conversation/london-piccadilly\" title=\"\">Waterstones Piccadilly</a></em><em>, London W1</em><em>, on </em><em> 21 February.

She\u2019s been imbibing mysteries since she was a child, her reading encompassing an Agatha Christie binge (\u201cThey\u2019re Pringles, aren\u2019t they? Once you pop you can\u2019t stop\u201d) and a love of Patricia Highsmith and \u201cthat scalpel sharp dissection of how somebody\u2019s psyche can disintegrate \u2026 The most emotionally powerful mysteries of all are other people. I guess that makes sense for an actor to say.\u201d She is an enormous fan of Tartt, declaring The Secret History \u201cone of the great mystery books of all time, and one of the great literary novels, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And she doesn\u2019t compromise on either one. She doesn\u2019t seem to see any reason why she should be limited by either set of genre expectations.\u201d The kernel of The Wych Elm\u2019s plot comes from a grisly and sad unsolved crime, in which a group of boys found a woman\u2019s remains in a tree-trunk in Worcestershire in 1943. Her identity is still unknown, despite speculation that she was a wartime spy, but the year after the discovery a piece of graffiti asking \u201cWho put Bella in the wych elm?\u201d appeared in Birmingham. French tells me that her brother sent her a link to the case, with the message \u201cThis sounds like a Tana French book\u201d; and the setting for her study of buried history that comes bursting into the present revealed itself. But that\u2019s about as recent a historical murder that French finds herself drawn to; she\u2019s not been swept up in the current vogue for rooting around in violent criminal cases, finding expression in podcasts such as Serial and West Cork: \u201cI\u2019m not really interested by modern true crime, partly because there are people who are still in pain \u2026 and I find it very hard to see it as a fascinating story. But the historical stuff gives you a window into a time and place.\u201d She admires, for example, The Suspicions of Mr Whicher by Kate Summerscale, which examined the murder of a child but also put the class tensions of the mid 19th century, and the role of the police force, under the microscope. Nonetheless, French understands why our fascination with those who solve crime fuels popular podcasts and TV programmes, pointing out that they bring us one step closer to the feeling that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a professional detective to be someone who moves the solution forwards\u201d. I ask her about the problem that must face many writers of crime-related fiction: that real detective work is, necessarily, arduous and mundane. She agrees: \u201cYou have to write your way around the fact that a vast amount of this stuff is paperwork and crap and trying to get overtime out of a budget that\u2019s overstretched already and making sure you filled things in in triplicate.\u201d But there\u2019s something more existential at play: \u201cYou have to be the kind of person who\u2019s comfortable being right here face to face with the worst of reality. And it\u2019s in some ways the opposite of being a crime writer. I make stuff up all day. They\u2019ve got truth and justice and life and death on them doing it right. I mess up, there\u2019s too many adjectives. They have a bad day at work, somebody could die. The idea of somebody who\u2019s willing to take on something that high-stakes is fascinating to me. I\u2019m in awe.\u201d To get her stories straight, French has long conversations with a retired detective. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing guy, he\u2019s so generous with not just his time but his stories. He answers questions I didn\u2019t even know I needed to ask; about the atmosphere, and about the way the dynamics work, and the power plays.\u201d When she was working on her last book, The Trespasser, she rang him to ask about a particular interview technique, and by way of answer, he began to grill her. \u201cThere was this mode switch. He went from this lovely, friendly, warm guy to this unstoppable force, who was just focused on me and was getting what he wanted and there was no way I was going to get away from it.\u201d I say that sounds a little bit like acting. \u201cYes, they\u2019re running everything, the atmosphere in the room, the rhythm of the conversation \u2013 they can speed it up, slow it down. They\u2019re experts at this. They\u2019re conductors, in a way, bringing things louder and softer. They\u2019re absolute experts in understanding people and bringing the right pressures to bear. And it\u2019s something against which civilians are completely unequipped.\u201d Has all that inside track made her think she might be able to commit a crime and get away with it? \u201cOh God, no!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt made me think that there\u2019s no way. I don\u2019t know how anybody manages to stay ahead of these people who are so trained and have skills that you haven\u2019t even thought about. Not just for practical reasons, though, but because I think probably nobody with a lot of imagination should ever commit a crime. Because you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the stress. You would be imagining all the possible ways you could be caught. You\u2019d go to pieces inside a week.\u201d \u2022 Tana French will be in conversation with John Boyne at Waterstones Piccadilly, London W1, on 21 February.

      "bodyText": "At first, John Marquis did not really warm to the idea of moving to Doncaster. \u201cI was umming and ahhing, I wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my agent kept saying: \u2018Just go up and have a chat, see what they\u2019ve got to say\u2019.\u201d That was nearly three years ago and it is no exaggeration to say he is now fully immersed in a club which has transformed his life and career. \u201cI love it here. It just shows you\u2019ve got to keep your mind open,\u201d says the free-scoring No 9, of whom Crystal Palace would be wise to be wary during Sunday\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round tie at the Keepmoat Stadium. \u201cDarren Ferguson was the manager back then. As soon as I left the room after meeting him, I knew I wanted to join Doncaster. I\u2019m really settled here now, so I\u2019ve got a lot to thank Darren for.\u201d Although Marquis spent the previous seven years as a Millwall player, nine loan moves took the south Londoner from Staines to Northampton and a few places in between. He craved stability, routine and familiarity. When Grant McCann replaced Ferguson last summer the striker felt a stab of fear that a return to the open road might beckon but instead the 26-year-old has scored 22 goals this season and hopes to propel Doncaster into the League One playoffs. \u201cI\u2019ve clicked really well with Grant,\u201d he says, leaning back in his chair in a corner of a large, otherwise deserted function room at the Keepmoat. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had a really good relationship with a manager and he leaves you do worry but I\u2019m scoring more goals, we\u2019re challenging for promotion and this club\u2019s in the fifth round for the first time in 63 years. \u201cI\u2019ve taken to Doncaster very well. It was a fresh challenge for me, on and off the pitch. I wanted to get away from where I was living and just concentrate properly on football. I had loads of friends in south London and I was going out socialising a lot but I decided I wanted to get the best out of myself.\u201d If a somewhat quieter South Yorkshire lifestyle with his wife and their one-year-old daughter marks a step change from that past, Marquis\u2019s game has evolved considerably since his goals guided Ferguson\u2019s Doncaster to promotion from League Two. \u201cGrant\u2019s changed the way we play a little bit, I\u2019m normally up front on my own now with two wide men and I\u2019ve kicked on again,\u201d he says. \u201cGrant\u2019s simplified my game, he\u2019s made it easier for me to concentrate on getting goals rather than all the other bits I was doing before. \u201cAt times last season I\u2019d maybe drop too deep to find the ball and I wasn\u2019t an outlet for the team. I was maybe working too hard in ineffective areas and ending up being wasteful. Grant\u2019s told me to concentrate on the areas where I can affect the game most, to keep making runs behind defenders, where they don\u2019t like it.\u201d Marquis may lack a little pace but McCann cannot stop praising his movement, not to mention the sort of edge honed in a hard school at the Den. Possibly the only thing that fazes him are wasps. \u201cAt Millwall you\u2019re taught to be tough-skinned from a young age,\u201d says the striker, who is so severely allergic to stings he has to carry an EpiPen at all times. \u201cIt was banged into me from a very young age that things wouldn\u2019t be perfect, that there\u2019d be ups and downs. \u201cI learned a lot from Millwall\u2019s senior players; they treated everyone the same and you had to gain their respect. It was quite daunting and quite tough but it, and the loans, matured me. There\u2019s a lot of financial pressure on lower-division players. People need to pay the mortgage, so every game means something. I learned that you can\u2019t take a day off.\u201d The young Marquis diversified, briefly, into modelling, promoting Rio Ferdinand\u2019s clothing range. \u201cI did a couple of shoots, hats, T-shirts, stuff like that. It was fun, a good experience and I still speak to Rio now and then but it\u2019s behind me now, I prefer being on the pitch.\u201d Off it, he follows in the footsteps of his hero, Alan Shearer, by indulging a penchant for practical jokes. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ve always been a bit of a class clown,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI just want to make sure everyone\u2019s having fun, having a giggle. I don\u2019t want to give too much away but my jokes involve cars, clothes, jumping out at people from hiding places, that sort of stuff. \u201cSome people take it better than others, some can laugh it off, some get a bit upset. But it\u2019s all in a good spirit, no one gets hurt and it\u2019s very good for team morale.\u201d On January\u2019s transfer deadline day Sunderland offered \u00a32m for Marquis but the response was unequivocal: \u201cGrant was absolutely adamant I wasn\u2019t for sale, for any price. That was fine by me.\u201d That left him to look forward to Doncaster\u2019s biggest FA Cup tie since 1956. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few Palace-supporting friends coming up but I won\u2019t be waving at them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably need to be at our best and Palace to have an off-day but, especially with no replay, anything can happen.\u201d",

Both centered on freshman representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who, not coincidentally, came to America as a Somali refugee and is now one of the two first Muslim women in Congress. Absent an open debate about the party\u2019s values on foreign policy, Democrats are hurtling toward an election more divisive than the one in 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/ilhan-omar-is-right-about-the-influence-of-the-israel-lobby\">Ilhan Omar is right about the influence of the Israel lobby | Alex Kotch</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>First, on Monday, Omar criticized the influence of pro-Israel lobbyists on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/1094747501578633216\">tweeting</a> that Congress\u2019s stance was \u201call about the Benjamins\u201d. She was swiftly rebuked by the party leadership in tandem with Republicans, prompting her to apologize. Then, less than 48 hours later, Omar <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4779974/representative-omar-clashes-elliott-abrams-us-military-role-central-america\">grilled</a> America\u2019s new envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, over his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/26/world/americas/el-salvador-el-mazote-massacre.html\">well-documented</a> <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n22/corey-robin/dedicated-to-democracy\">material</a> <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/upside-genocide/\">support</a> for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/elliott-abrams-venezuela-coup/\">multiple</a> Central American governments that committed mass killings and genocide in the 1980s. She also questioned his credibility, noting that Abrams had pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress as part of his participation in the Iran-Contra scandal.</p> \n<p>How did Democratic elites respond? Several pounced again \u2013 to defend the Trump administration\u2019s backer of death squads against Omar\u2019s pointed questioning. Kelly Magsamen, a senior official at the Center for American Progress, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenwertheim/status/1095849673485631489\">defended</a> Abrams on Twitter as a \u201cfierce advocate for human rights and democracy\u201d. Likewise, Nicholas Burns, a 27-year diplomat who most recently advised former secretary of state John Kerry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RNicholasBurns/status/1095835155271503877\">praised</a> Abrams as a \u201cdevoted public servant\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time to build bridges in America,\u201d Burns wrote, \u201cand not tear people down.\u201d</p> \n<p>If Democratic leaders were incredulous at Omar\u2019s statements, rank-and-file Democrats were just as incredulous at their party leaders. Why, many <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/13/real-lesson-controversy-over-rep-ilhan-omars-tweets\">asked</a>, is it routine to criticize the influence of NRA money but almost forbidden to question the influence of Aipac money? On top of that, how could Trump\u2019s neocon criminal be lauded as some sort of ally while Omar was treated as a pariah? A Twitter torrent caused Magsamen to delete her tweet and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kellymagsamen/status/1095839488721543169\">apologize</a>.</p> \n<p>Personalities aside, however, the episode is charged with significance for the Democratic party as a whole. Omar is not going away. She represents the party\u2019s younger generation, a more diverse and progressive cohort that came of age in the war on terror. In the election of 2016, such voters balked at Hillary Clinton\u2019s hawkish record and her courting of Never Trump neoconservatives. Now the divide is only wider and more entrenched. Democrats need to have a real conversation, immediately, about the party\u2019s values and goals in foreign policy. Squelch it now and watch it resurge in 2020, with Trump the beneficiary.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"...\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">...</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>\u201cWe share goals,\u201d Magsamen wrote</strong> of Abrams.

Ordinary citizens consistently display more skepticism of military intervention than do foreign policy elites. They are pushing their representatives to express the goal of peace. The election of Omar herself reflects this sentiment. And as a result of grassroots mobilization, the House this week, driven by progressives like Representative Ro Khanna, passed historic legislation to end US support for the Saudi war in Yemen.</p> \n<p>The shift in the Democratic base is not limited to one episode.

While elites assume that the US must maintain global military superiority as a matter of course, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/millennials-are-so-over-us-domination-of-world-affairs-99167\">less than half</a> of millennials deem it to be a very important goal. That is the lowest support on record, continuing a steady erosion since the second world war. Will political leaders engage the rising generation\u2019s doubts, or will they insist that armed domination is a self-evident virtue for a country that is hurting at home and often spreads violence abroad?</p> \n<p>On the Israel-Palestine conflict, it was Omar, more than her party elders, who represented the values of Democratic voters when she criticized the influence of money in politics and applied the point to America\u2019s virtually unconditional support for Israel. The <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/11/americans-are-increasingly-critical-of-israel/\">overwhelming majority</a> of Democrats, about 82%, now say the US should lean toward neither Israel nor Palestinians. Even more dramatically, 56% of Democrats favor imposing sanctions or harsher measures against Israel if its settlements keep expanding. The mounting disaffection with Israel comes as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, scorned Barack Obama and embraces Trump and other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/sunday/benjamin-netanyahu-embassy-gaza.html\">authoritarians</a>. Yet Democratic leaders leapt to denounce Omar, giving her no benefit of the doubt for a poorly worded tweet.

      "body": "<p>This week, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/14/amazon-new-york-news-cancels-hq-plans-ocasio-cortez-opposition\">abandoned a plan to open a second \u201cheadquarters\u201d</a> in New York City, after citizens rebelled against the idea of paying almost $3bn in subsidies and tax incentives to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations. But simply saying \u201cno\u201d to Amazon\u2019s coercive terms is not enough. New York citizens should now demand that the state\u2019s Attorney General Tish James begin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/amazons-retreat-from-new-york-represents-a-turning-point\">investigating the corporation for abusing its power</a> as a monopoly.</p> <p>One reason the idea of subsidizing Amazon with New York city and state tax monies was so galling is that the corporation is already extracting so much wealth from the region. Amazon for more than a decade has steadily battered the American book publishing industry, which is largely based in New York, and which employs tens of thousands of residents. The corporation has done so through thuggish negotiating tactics, including simply <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/technology/internet/18amazon.html\">refusing to sell</a> a publisher\u2019s inventory unless they agreed to a detailed list of concessions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/amazon-new-york-long-island-city-hq2-michael-gianaris\">'Amazon isn't bigger than New York': meet the man who killed the deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly, Amazon a few years ago used age-old predatory pricing tactics to essentially bankrupt Diapers.com, a business located in Jersey City, by underpricing its rivals. In the end Diapers.com sold itself to Amazon, which shut the operation down.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just New Yorkers who are suffering from Amazon\u2019s abuse of its monopoly control over many of America\u2019s most high-profile markets. Amazon\u2019s current business model is a threat to anyone who wants to make or sell things in America. Take the case of the small company, Fuse Chicken, one of the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that must sell their wares and services through Amazon, due to that corporation\u2019s dominance of online commerce.</p> <p>In this case the founder of Fuse Chicken, who had left his day job to design high-quality phone charging accessories, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2018/01/14/fuse-chicken-vs-amazon-is-the-david-vs-goliath-lawsuit-to-watch-in-2018/\">discovered</a> that Amazon was helping Chinese counterfeiters to sell knock-off versions of his product under the Fuse Chicken brand name. This is not uncommon; even large companies like Birkenstock and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nike-resisted-amazons-dominance-for-years-and-finally-capitulated-1498662435\">Nike</a> have reported big problems with counterfeits on Amazon\u2019s marketplace. In the case of Birkenstock, Amazon refused to stop counterfeiting unless the shoe maker agreed to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/birkenstock-quits-amazon-in-us-after-counterfeit-surge.html\">sell its whole catalogue through Amazon</a>. That sounds less like legitimate business tactics and more like mob extortion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New Yorkers should demand that their government punish Amazon for gangster-like business tactics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">legal scholar Lina Khan has observed</a>, Amazon\u2019s business model is predicated upon a suite of anti-competitive coercive tactics in which it exploits its power over the core infrastructure of commerce. The attempt to extort New York City was just the latest episode.</p> <p>The initial decision by Amazon to locate in New York was part of a Hunger-Games-style bidding contest in which the corporation asked for concessions and proposals from cities across North America for a supposed second headquarters. <br><br>Amazon\u2019s retreat was a setback for a host of politicians, none more so than Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York. Cuomo, who jokingly offered to change his name to Amazon Cuomo, lashed out at critics of the deal, attacking elected leaders who \u201cput their own narrow political interests above their community\u201d.</p> <p>Since the news that Amazon was pulling out, Governor Cuomo has led the attacks on the citizens who opposed his backroom deal with Amazon. But let\u2019s be clear. New York didn\u2019t say no to Amazon. What New York said no to was Amazon\u2019s outrageous terms, which were reached through a secret process with no input from the communities that will be most affected. The leader of the opposition to these terms, state Senator Mike Gianaris, actually argued that there were ways Amazon could make this deal work.

      "bodyText": "This week, Amazon abandoned a plan to open a second \u201cheadquarters\u201d in New York City, after citizens rebelled against the idea of paying almost $3bn in subsidies and tax incentives to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations. But simply saying \u201cno\u201d to Amazon\u2019s coercive terms is not enough. New York citizens should now demand that the state\u2019s Attorney General Tish James begin investigating the corporation for abusing its power as a monopoly. One reason the idea of subsidizing Amazon with New York city and state tax monies was so galling is that the corporation is already extracting so much wealth from the region. Amazon for more than a decade has steadily battered the American book publishing industry, which is largely based in New York, and which employs tens of thousands of residents. The corporation has done so through thuggish negotiating tactics, including simply refusing to sell a publisher\u2019s inventory unless they agreed to a detailed list of concessions. Similarly, Amazon a few years ago used age-old predatory pricing tactics to essentially bankrupt Diapers.com, a business located in Jersey City, by underpricing its rivals. In the end Diapers.com sold itself to Amazon, which shut the operation down. It\u2019s not just New Yorkers who are suffering from Amazon\u2019s abuse of its monopoly control over many of America\u2019s most high-profile markets. Amazon\u2019s current business model is a threat to anyone who wants to make or sell things in America. Take the case of the small company, Fuse Chicken, one of the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that must sell their wares and services through Amazon, due to that corporation\u2019s dominance of online commerce. In this case the founder of Fuse Chicken, who had left his day job to design high-quality phone charging accessories, discovered that Amazon was helping Chinese counterfeiters to sell knock-off versions of his product under the Fuse Chicken brand name. This is not uncommon; even large companies like Birkenstock and Nike have reported big problems with counterfeits on Amazon\u2019s marketplace. In the case of Birkenstock, Amazon refused to stop counterfeiting unless the shoe maker agreed to sell its whole catalogue through Amazon. That sounds less like legitimate business tactics and more like mob extortion. As legal scholar Lina Khan has observed, Amazon\u2019s business model is predicated upon a suite of anti-competitive coercive tactics in which it exploits its power over the core infrastructure of commerce. The attempt to extort New York City was just the latest episode. The initial decision by Amazon to locate in New York was part of a Hunger-Games-style bidding contest in which the corporation asked for concessions and proposals from cities across North America for a supposed second headquarters. Amazon\u2019s retreat was a setback for a host of politicians, none more so than Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York. Cuomo, who jokingly offered to change his name to Amazon Cuomo, lashed out at critics of the deal, attacking elected leaders who \u201cput their own narrow political interests above their community\u201d. Since the news that Amazon was pulling out, Governor Cuomo has led the attacks on the citizens who opposed his backroom deal with Amazon. But let\u2019s be clear. New York didn\u2019t say no to Amazon. What New York said no to was Amazon\u2019s outrageous terms, which were reached through a secret process with no input from the communities that will be most affected. The leader of the opposition to these terms, state Senator Mike Gianaris, actually argued that there were ways Amazon could make this deal work. And even without this deal, Amazon is hiring and expanding in New York. The pushback came from community activists, as well as courageous politicians like state Senators Michael Gianaris, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Jessica Ramos, and councilmen Corey Johnson and Jimmy Van Bremer. But the opposition to the deal did not only come from individual citizens, politicians, and grassroots groups. The former mayor Michael Bloomberg also attacked the Cuomo-DeBlasio deal as a na\u00efve giveaway, as did existing businesses in the city who opposed the unfair subsidies. It\u2019s easy to see why the deal is a bad idea on its own merits. These kinds of subsidies generally don\u2019t work as advertised; on average, only a quarter of the jobs promised by such bribes end up going to local residents who would otherwise be unemployed. If Governor Cuomo and Mayor DeBlasio want to invest $3bn in New York, they\u2019d get a much bigger bang for their citizens\u2019 bucks if they used it to create three times as many jobs in housing or transportation. And if they want to help New York business, they would stand up to predatory monopolies like Amazon, or deal with excessive rents from real estate interests. It\u2019s not only the citizens of New York who are waking up to the need to deal with Amazon\u2019s abuse of its monopoly middleman position. In India, the government recently banned the corporation from selling its own products in direct competition with the products of other companies.

      "bodyText": "Children\u2019s car seats that are made from flimsy material that breach EU safety rules, and have been shown to offer no protection at all for child passengers, can still be bought from some major online retailers, Which? has revealed. The consumer watchdog said the \u201ckiller\u201d seats gave children almost no protection from the force of crashes but were described as suitable for newborns and children up to five years of age in the online listings of some popular sites. The cloth seats lack any form of recognisable support or protection but researchers for Which? found them for sale on eBay, Amazon and AliExpress for as little as \u00a38. It said online martketplaces should have removed the obviously inadequate seats from sale as soon as they were listed to stop British consumers buying them in the mistaken belief they were safe to use. In 2014 Surrey trading standards and manufacturer Britax showed that the seats could be potentially lethal after carrying out tests that showed the material in the restraint disintegrating completely in a 30mph crash test. The devices were described as \u201ckiller car seats\u201d after a crash test dummy of a three-year-old child was thrown through the windscreen of the car when the straps snapped. Which? found evidence they had repeatedly reappeared for sale online despite the fact that only EU-approved child seats were legal to be sold in the UK. The watchdog, which recently claimed that the UK\u2019s consumer enforcement system is on the brink of collapse, is calling for a reformed inspection system to monitor sellers trying to flout safety regulations online. Alex Neill, head of Which? home products, said: \u201cMore needs to be done by big businesses and government to protect consumers from dangerous products.\u201d Ebay said it had asked the sellers involved to contact the buyers to organise a return and to pay for the return shipping. A spokeswoman from the company said: \u201cOur specialist teams work with regulators and trading standards to ensure our block filters stay up to date, using sophisticated software that monitors billions of listings a day to remove any prohibited items.\u201d Amazon removed the items from sale and in a statement said: \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don\u2019t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.

      "body": "<p>In the play <a href=\"https://www.theambassadorstheatre.co.uk/Online/\" title=\"\"><em>Songs for Nobodies</em></a>, currently on in London\u2019s West End, the remarkable Bernadette Robinson plays Beatrice Ethel Appleton, a young powder room attendant working in New York on a night in 1961. Her husband has walked out on her and, tearful, she is about to meet Judy Garland, whom Robinson vocally mimics in the musical. \u201cHappiness,\u201d Beatrice remarks dolefully, \u201cis the temporary illusion that nothing is about to change for the worse.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/happy-now-lessons-for-economic-policy-makers-from-a-focus-on-subjective-well-being/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation thinktank published a report</a> that analysed seven years of wellbeing surveys run by the Office for National Statistics since 2011. Respondents of a variety of ages rated their life satisfaction, self-worth, happiness and anxiety levels on a scale from one to 10. In a U-shaped curve, it showed that being in one\u2019s 50s is the pits, while the ages of 16 and 70 are the twin peaks of happiness. Bearing in mind that the average is indicative of a trend, not a universal truth \u2013 and that 16 and 70 can also mean, for some, poverty, loneliness and regret for what is lost or hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 according to the report, what contributes to happiness at 70 is, predictably, the good fortune to have health, a degree, a job, a partner and to own your home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39691cfb1098bad763517ef560e8c8e5280d5904\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39691cfb1098bad763517ef560e8c8e5280d5904/0_480_3601_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Roberts in the late 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Roberts in the late 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/Courtesy of Yvonne Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know seventysomethings who have all these in their lives and still rage \u2013 as if ageing can be shaken into submission, youth restored and mortality avoided. They resist change. Even for them, however, the face eventually pleats into wrinkles, friends and family die and invisibility becomes the norm. Whatever the surveys say, there is no illusion, at 70, that decline is not at hand. As American comedian George Carlin once said, \u201cAge is a hell of a price to pay for wisdom.\u201d So where is the joy?</p> <p>For feminist Lynne Segal, it lies partly in resistance to how society expects women to age, while, ironically, how we choose to live the final decades of life can bring a kind of liberation. Mark Twain was right. If we could be born at 80 and live our lives backwards, happiness would hit not twice over the decades but many more times in a less materialistic (though fairly paid) and more philosophically purposeful life. Hindsight is grand.</p> <p>Sir Richard Layard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/24/healthandwellbeing.schools\" title=\"\">\u201chappiness tsar\u201d</a> under New Labour, diagnosed us, as a nation, as suffering from lack of trust and excessive concern with status, materialism, envy and winning the rat race. This view is endorsed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/06/happiness-index-wellbeing-survey-uk-population-paul-dolan-happy-ever-after\" title=\"\">Professor Paul Dolan of the London School of Economics</a>: \u201cTo be happier we need to move from a culture of \u2018more please\u2019 to one of \u2018just enough\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Another thinktank, the New Economics Foundation, has proposed five ways to boost wellbeing \u2013 take notice, be active, connect, keep learning and give. At least two of these \u2013 connect (death of community services and public spaces) and keep learning (demise of adult education) have been hammered by cuts, and still wellbeing continues to rise \u2013 if only just. In April 2011, the ONS said the nation\u2019s average out of 10 for happiness was 7.29. Last year, it was 7.52. Eight years ago, the 16-19 age group (in spite of an anxiety epidemic) had the highest levels of satisfaction. Now, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing\" title=\"\">it\u2019s the 70-74s</a>, with women slightly higher than men. </p> <p>So what seems to be happening?</p> <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \u201cWhat lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared with what lies within us.\u201d But what lies within us is difficult to establish when life is one headlong rush. Family commitments multiply, and work and stress are too often twin companions. In contrast, at 70, for some, time may suddenly and unexpectedly become \u201cfree\u201d, less squeezed, less throttled by ambition.</p> <p>When I was in my 50s, I read a remarkable book, <em>Rowing Without Oars</em>, by a Swedish television presenter, Ulla-Carin Lindquist. In it, she magnificently celebrated her final months, having been diagnosed at the age of 50 with a form of motor neurone disease. She died in 2004, leaving her husband and four children. \u201cIt is now for the first time that I feel myself to be living in the present,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDeath brings me closer to life.\u201d</p> <p>On reading it, I felt gratitude for the profound meaning she drew from her existence \u2013 in spite of a body that had lost almost all function \u2013 and for her bravery. Fifteen years later, I\u2019m still grateful, but the sagacity of Lindquist\u2019s words now has a greater resonance: living in the present in the \u2013 hopefully long \u2013 shadow of death can make you infinitely more appreciative of the magical \u201cordinary\u201d incidents in everyday life.</p> <p>Ageing is problematised. Yes, it may mean less money, autonomy and energy, and poorer health. But, with luck, the failures and tough lessons over the years have also taught resilience, perspective, tolerance and patience. (Though they might equally have taught you to be grumpy, narrow-minded, tight-fisted and reactionary.)</p> <p>Best of all, perhaps, the true luxuries in life that we have less time to value when younger \u2013 relationships, family, community, giving back, the changing seasons, doing nothing, caring less what others think \u2013 will, if we are fortunate, finally receive due care and attention. And long may it last. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In the play Songs for Nobodies, currently on in London\u2019s West End, the remarkable Bernadette Robinson plays Beatrice Ethel Appleton, a young powder room attendant working in New York on a night in 1961. Her husband has walked out on her and, tearful, she is about to meet Judy Garland, whom Robinson vocally mimics in the musical. \u201cHappiness,\u201d Beatrice remarks dolefully, \u201cis the temporary illusion that nothing is about to change for the worse.\u201d Last week, the Resolution Foundation thinktank published a report that analysed seven years of wellbeing surveys run by the Office for National Statistics since 2011. Respondents of a variety of ages rated their life satisfaction, self-worth, happiness and anxiety levels on a scale from one to 10. In a U-shaped curve, it showed that being in one\u2019s 50s is the pits, while the ages of 16 and 70 are the twin peaks of happiness. Bearing in mind that the average is indicative of a trend, not a universal truth \u2013 and that 16 and 70 can also mean, for some, poverty, loneliness and regret for what is lost or hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 according to the report, what contributes to happiness at 70 is, predictably, the good fortune to have health, a degree, a job, a partner and to own your home. I know seventysomethings who have all these in their lives and still rage \u2013 as if ageing can be shaken into submission, youth restored and mortality avoided. They resist change. Even for them, however, the face eventually pleats into wrinkles, friends and family die and invisibility becomes the norm. Whatever the surveys say, there is no illusion, at 70, that decline is not at hand. As American comedian George Carlin once said, \u201cAge is a hell of a price to pay for wisdom.\u201d So where is the joy? For feminist Lynne Segal, it lies partly in resistance to how society expects women to age, while, ironically, how we choose to live the final decades of life can bring a kind of liberation. Mark Twain was right. If we could be born at 80 and live our lives backwards, happiness would hit not twice over the decades but many more times in a less materialistic (though fairly paid) and more philosophically purposeful life. Hindsight is grand. Sir Richard Layard, \u201chappiness tsar\u201d under New Labour, diagnosed us, as a nation, as suffering from lack of trust and excessive concern with status, materialism, envy and winning the rat race. This view is endorsed by Professor Paul Dolan of the London School of Economics: \u201cTo be happier we need to move from a culture of \u2018more please\u2019 to one of \u2018just enough\u2019.\u201d Another thinktank, the New Economics Foundation, has proposed five ways to boost wellbeing \u2013 take notice, be active, connect, keep learning and give. At least two of these \u2013 connect (death of community services and public spaces) and keep learning (demise of adult education) have been hammered by cuts, and still wellbeing continues to rise \u2013 if only just. In April 2011, the ONS said the nation\u2019s average out of 10 for happiness was 7.29. Last year, it was 7.52. Eight years ago, the 16-19 age group (in spite of an anxiety epidemic) had the highest levels of satisfaction. Now, it\u2019s the 70-74s, with women slightly higher than men. So what seems to be happening? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \u201cWhat lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared with what lies within us.\u201d But what lies within us is difficult to establish when life is one headlong rush. Family commitments multiply, and work and stress are too often twin companions. In contrast, at 70, for some, time may suddenly and unexpectedly become \u201cfree\u201d, less squeezed, less throttled by ambition. When I was in my 50s, I read a remarkable book, Rowing Without Oars, by a Swedish television presenter, Ulla-Carin Lindquist. In it, she magnificently celebrated her final months, having been diagnosed at the age of 50 with a form of motor neurone disease. She died in 2004, leaving her husband and four children. \u201cIt is now for the first time that I feel myself to be living in the present,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDeath brings me closer to life.\u201d On reading it, I felt gratitude for the profound meaning she drew from her existence \u2013 in spite of a body that had lost almost all function \u2013 and for her bravery. Fifteen years later, I\u2019m still grateful, but the sagacity of Lindquist\u2019s words now has a greater resonance: living in the present in the \u2013 hopefully long \u2013 shadow of death can make you infinitely more appreciative of the magical \u201cordinary\u201d incidents in everyday life. Ageing is problematised. Yes, it may mean less money, autonomy and energy, and poorer health. But, with luck, the failures and tough lessons over the years have also taught resilience, perspective, tolerance and patience. (Though they might equally have taught you to be grumpy, narrow-minded, tight-fisted and reactionary.) Best of all, perhaps, the true luxuries in life that we have less time to value when younger \u2013 relationships, family, community, giving back, the changing seasons, doing nothing, caring less what others think \u2013 will, if we are fortunate, finally receive due care and attention. And long may it last.",

      "body": "<p>I have never worn anything that could be considered \u201conline content\u201d. And, to the best of my knowledge, I have never gone viral. That is until one spring morning, enjoying a snack by the canal, alone save for the ducks, I realised someone on the bridge was taking a photograph of me. I glanced down at the dress I had on \u2013 less a dress, actually, and more a length of elegant bedding \u2013 and realised I had never looked more shareable.</p> <p>The elegant bedding in question was a vast, diaphanous day gown by London-based designer <a href=\"https://www.emiliawickstead.com/\" title=\"\">Emilia Wickstead</a>, from her spring/summer 2019 collection. It comes with a coif cap in the same 18th century-style print and there is a train, of sorts, which billows underfoot, and holes within the folds for my hands.</p> <p>It is gorgeous to wear, like weighted swaddling \u2013 until the breeze inflates the whole thing like a balloon. Still, with the right Photoshop tinkering, a pithy caption and an Instagram account, it could easily morph into a visual gag \u2013 a giant eiderdown, a pair of curtains or, with the headpiece, a chintzy version of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s</a> dress. In short, this is a dress that could become a meme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35489159c463d994366a92b2f66daac7bb9ca0a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35489159c463d994366a92b2f66daac7bb9ca0a2/0_171_6568_3941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morweena enjoying some Monster Munch in a very memeable Emilia Wickstead dress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morwenna enjoying some Monster Munch in a very memeable Emilia Wickstead dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you use social media, you will have seen a meme on Instagram or laughed at one on Facebook, even if you don\u2019t really know what it is. This is forgivable \u2013 it has become amorphous as a term \u2013 but the original concept dates back to 1976, when the word was coined by evolutionary biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> in his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/29/selfish-gene-40-years-richard-dawkins-do-ideas-stand-up-adam-rutherford\" title=\"\">The Selfish Gene</a>. He took it from the Greek root \u201cmimeme\u201d (\u201cthat which is imitated\u201d), shaved it into a neat monosyllabic word to make it snappier (you know, like a meme) and used it to describe a unit of cultural transmission that shows the spread of ideas or culture.</p> <p>Nowadays anything can become a meme, be it an idea, song or theory; a lolcat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/30/the-team-that-made-the-distracted-boyfriend-meme-have-split-up\" title=\"\">distracted boyfriend</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-college-dance-video-discredit-backfires\" title=\"\">dancing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. The successful ones are hard to predict \u2013 it\u2019s usually about flinging something against the wall and seeing what sticks. But occasionally one sticks so well, it goes viral. And often these come from fashion. Consider the following: Angelina Jolie in Versace at the 2012 Oscars, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2012/feb/28/angelina-jolie-right-leg-oscar\" title=\"\">flashing her right leg</a>, a stance that bore memorable memes such as \u201cJolie\u2019ing\u201d and leg-bombing. Or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/05/how-to-make-rihannas-met-ball-dress-stylewatch\" title=\"\">Rihanna\u2019s yolk-yellow 2015 Met Gala outfit</a>, dubbed \u201cthe omelette dress\u201d for its resemblance to breakfast. Quickly memeified, the viral attention put designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/18/guo-pei-chinese-designer-who-made-rihanna-omelette-dress\">Guo Pei</a> on the map.</p> <p>The fashion-meme industry relies on two things: designers to make meme-friendly pieces and social media whizzes to turn them into memes. If fashion finds beauty and profit in designing familiar objects in an unfamiliar way, then placing high-fashion in a non-fashion context is the next logical step. Accounts such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freddiemade/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@freddiemade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/siduations/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@siduations</a> are probably the best examples of fashion meme makers, with both using a sort of cut-and-paste recontextualisation method. Say model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/bella-hadid\" title=\"\">Bella Hadid</a> in Versace trainers \u201crunning\u201d a marathon, a plastic-caped Balenciaga model superimposed into that apartment scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/fiction.breteastonellis\" title=\"\">American Psycho</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtB1DsHn_dm/\" title=\"\">Viktor &amp; Rolf couture</a> Photoshopped with the head of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\" title=\"\">Fyre festival\u2019s Andy King</a> from the Netflix documentary. It\u2019s these gags that make their work chime with a demographic who live their lives \u2013 and tell their jokes \u2013 online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9d6fc362ed1816fbb6f619971ac473ec21a004b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6fc362ed1816fbb6f619971ac473ec21a004b6/0_0_1000_742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greggs own meme of the Rihanna Met Gala \u2018omelette dress\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greggs\u2019 meme of the Rihanna Met Gala \u2018omelette dress\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @GreggsOfficial/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It might seem cynical, but right now, if you were to pit the dress on the catwalk against the dress in some sort of witty meme-y context, you\u2019d get more likes for the latter. Humour is integral \u2013 partly because, to use the correct parlance, it provides that crucial \u201cif you know, you know\u201d lol. Instagram artist <a href=\"http://www.heyreilly.com/hello\" title=\"\">Hey Reilly</a>, who\u2019s had his illustrations on the catwalk through a collaboration with Fendi, explains: \u201cI look for a hit in the image that reflects a sense of almost subconscious recognition in the viewer. An effective route to this jolt is by playing around with recognised fashion and celebrity imagery: it gets me lolling and hopefully others, too.\u201d</p> <p>With the fashion landscape so crowded, the ability of these memes to cut through our daily barrage of images hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by brands. Now, the most successful designers aren\u2019t avoiding the viral end of pop culture. Instead, they\u2019re actively trying to create something meme-friendly, an \u201cit\u201d item that piques our interest and sets the internet on fire.</p> <p>Under Demna Gvasalia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\" title=\"\">Balenciaga</a> is a leader of memeable fashion \u2013 see last year\u2019s layered anoraks recalling a memorable Joey Tribbiani scene from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/friends\" title=\"\">Friends</a> \u2013 as many memes on social media happily pointed out. In 2017, Marc Jacobs even collaborated with Instagram bootlegger <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/avanope/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@avanope</a> on <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/38255/1/instagram-queen-avanope-teams-up-with-marc-jacobs-bootleg-new-york\" title=\"\">a T-shirt collection</a> that looked like bad market stall copies of Jacobs\u2019 work, and showcased her in-joke irony to a new \u2013 and in the know \u2013 audience. Gucci is in on it as well: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/21/gucci-moves-from-glamour-and-sex-to-philosophy-and-severed-heads-milan-fashion-week\" title=\"\">models carrying casts of their own heads</a>, as they did for SS18, were arguably more memorable \u2013 and certainly more memeable \u2013 than the clothes themselves.</p> <p>Even more sober houses such as Valentino have been pulled into the viral ecosystem. Any designer who showed a long red gown recently could have found their work superimposed on to a scene from the TV version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>, and became a totem for women\u2019s rights. For pre-fall, Valentino\u2019s collection had 33 head-to-toe red looks, begging for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/elisabeth-moss\" title=\"\">Elisabeth Moss</a>\u2019s bonneted head to be Photoshopped in. Whether or not it was designed with woke memes in mind is unclear, but it certainly lends itself to the genre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4fd6c5c0e55cd3706373a3d6c120d293e25c4b4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd6c5c0e55cd3706373a3d6c120d293e25c4b4e/0_0_1200_2026/592.jpg\" alt=\"An Angelina Jolie leg meme.\" width=\"592\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Angelina Jolie leg meme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tumblr (leave uncredited)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This season, meme-friendly fashion continued. See the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/05/micro-bags-big-handbag-comeback\" title=\"\">supersized bag</a> that dwarfed models at Jacquemus, a ginormous wide-brimmed hat at Valentino, giant bows at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/marc-jacobs\" title=\"\">Marc Jacobs</a> and half of Jeremy Scott\u2019s collection for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/moschino\" title=\"\">Moschino</a> \u2013 which reworked a sewing basket\u2019s contents into designer dresses.</p> <p>Intentional or not, creating clothes that become memes is a sure-fire way to set yourself apart from the old guard. With around 60% of luxury customers of a millennial age, clicks not only lead to sales: as a marketing strategy, they are arguably more important for getting your brand out there. \u201cDesigner brands are gradually realising they must lose their haughty image if they want to sell their clothes to a generation consumed by the internet,\u201d says Holly Friend, foresight writer at <a href=\"https://www.thefuturelaboratory.com/blog/author/holly-friend\" title=\"\">The Future Laboratory</a>.</p> <p>If comparing a coat or dress with a cat meme seems reductive, it certainly gives the label an edge. For Moschino designer Jeremy Scott, this is no bad thing. \u201cFor something to be meme-worthy, sure, it could be a negative,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what I do is playful. If you can\u2019t find something funny around it, well, oh dear you.\u201d</p> <p>For Simon Porte Jacquemus, of hip French label <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/20/jacquemus-first-autumnwinter-collection-focuses-on-reality-workwear\" title=\"\">Jacquemus</a>, it goes with the territory. \u201cI often start [designing] with a specific photograph,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I think of the silhouettes, I think of styling from the beginning. I also see how clothes would look through a screen. I come from a digital generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447ae53aad38c1656b61f9017ead3981b9d214e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447ae53aad38c1656b61f9017ead3981b9d214e1/0_0_640_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bella Hadid \u2018running\u2019 a marathon \u2026 the work of @siduations.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bella Hadid \u2018running\u2019 a marathon \u2026 the work of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/siduations/?hl=en\">@siduations</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @siduations/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With his giant hats and postcard-backdrop shows, Jacquemus is arguably the crown prince of meme-friendly fashion. His infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/15/giant-straw-giant-hat-summer-instagram-la-bomba-jacquemus-justin-bieber-oversized\" title=\"\">2018 La Bomba hat</a> is already a classic and he obviously approved of its online reception \u2013 if its sequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/05/micro-bags-big-handbag-comeback\">SS19\u2019s equally mega-bag</a>, is anything to go by. The element of absurdity, the fact that they photograph well and their being \u2013 like Wickstead\u2019s dress \u2013 larger than life helped make them deliciously memeable.</p> <p>Still, memes paraded on the catwalk, or your Instagram feed, are one thing. But let\u2019s not forget these are clothes and meant to be worn. If you put on that hat in public, you\u2019d probably block out the sun. As for the Jacquemus bag, imagine wedging it into an easyJet locker. This stuff looks funny, but isn\u2019t easy to wear.</p> <p>I should know, having spent the best part of the morning in a floor-length Moschino gown covered in three-inch gold needles. Sure it\u2019s elegant, and riffs on a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Franco-Moschino\" title=\"\">Franco Moschino</a> original, but, like the most memorable pieces from Scott\u2019s show, it is more than a dress: it\u2019s a cartoon, a commentary, riffing on the idea of fast fashion. It even comes with a thimble to wear on your head. And given it weighs 20kg and takes two people to lift it off the hanger, it\u2019s unwearable. The hat falls off as soon as you move. You carry the entire weight of the dress on your shoulders. But it is designed to be seen, and photographed, and shared on social media rather than to walk down the street. By wearing it, I\u2019m showing I\u2019m in on the joke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e35d48c5d30ec237424b8c83d4194852839dfc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e35d48c5d30ec237424b8c83d4194852839dfc2/3_0_10661_6400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morwenna\u2019s outfit gets turned into a silly meme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Moschino gown made of three-inch gold needles \u2026 designed to be photographed rather than worn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day, my shoulders still sore, I take it down a notch by moving from the Moschino dress into a monochrome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/erdem\" title=\"\">Erdem</a> look, which by contrast is normality itself. The cape hangs beautifully, allowing air to circulate. The trousers are stiff but wearable. The beekeeper\u2019s veil \u2013 yep \u2013 would be essential wearing if I worked in a hive. Standing on a street that is bee-free, I wonder what would compel me to wear a delicate veil like this in public and realise nothing, save a funeral. Until I see myself transplanted on to a meme, at which point it all makes sense.</p> <p>Scott was making a salient point about the fashion industry when he designed his collection but he\u2019s also well aware of the shareability of his designs. I put this point to Dawkins. He claims he had fashion in the back of his mind when he came up with the term meme. \u201cChanging styles and the epidemic spread of trends \u2013 people noticing what someone is wearing and copying it and that being repeated over and over \u2013 this is the ideal medium for illustrating how a meme works.\u201d </p> <p>Labels that meme well arguably do well, too. Kering, the conglomerate that owns Gucci and Balenciaga, gets over half its revenue from meme-happy millennials, suggesting there is financial method in them. In 2016, Instagram \u2013 where memes thrive \u2013 claimed a third of its then 500m users, 90% of whom are under 35, had bought clothing through the social network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554d4685731afef97029372ca4aec89801d25b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554d4685731afef97029372ca4aec89801d25b45/3_0_10661_6400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morwenna in Erdem\u2019s beekeeper hat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erdem\u2019s bee-keeper hat makes no sense at all \u2013 until you realise how meme-able it is.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s also about lifting clothes out of their safe space, into the gaze of a wider audience. Part of the reason Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga gets so much attention is because it turns fashion into a cultural moment, as with the recontextualising of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jan/18/balenciaga-paris-show-demna-gvasalia#img-2\" title=\"\">a Bernie Sanders logo on to a scarf</a> (AW17) or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/15/bows-ropes-and-comic-sans-style-trends-for-springsummer-2019\">computer font into a print (SS19)</a>. This is outward-facing fashion.

      "bodyText": "I have never worn anything that could be considered \u201conline content\u201d. And, to the best of my knowledge, I have never gone viral. That is until one spring morning, enjoying a snack by the canal, alone save for the ducks, I realised someone on the bridge was taking a photograph of me. I glanced down at the dress I had on \u2013 less a dress, actually, and more a length of elegant bedding \u2013 and realised I had never looked more shareable. The elegant bedding in question was a vast, diaphanous day gown by London-based designer Emilia Wickstead, from her spring/summer 2019 collection. It comes with a coif cap in the same 18th century-style print and there is a train, of sorts, which billows underfoot, and holes within the folds for my hands. It is gorgeous to wear, like weighted swaddling \u2013 until the breeze inflates the whole thing like a balloon. Still, with the right Photoshop tinkering, a pithy caption and an Instagram account, it could easily morph into a visual gag \u2013 a giant eiderdown, a pair of curtains or, with the headpiece, a chintzy version of a Handmaid\u2019s dress. In short, this is a dress that could become a meme. If you use social media, you will have seen a meme on Instagram or laughed at one on Facebook, even if you don\u2019t really know what it is. This is forgivable \u2013 it has become amorphous as a term \u2013 but the original concept dates back to 1976, when the word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. He took it from the Greek root \u201cmimeme\u201d (\u201cthat which is imitated\u201d), shaved it into a neat monosyllabic word to make it snappier (you know, like a meme) and used it to describe a unit of cultural transmission that shows the spread of ideas or culture. Nowadays anything can become a meme, be it an idea, song or theory; a lolcat, distracted boyfriend or dancing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The successful ones are hard to predict \u2013 it\u2019s usually about flinging something against the wall and seeing what sticks. But occasionally one sticks so well, it goes viral. And often these come from fashion. Consider the following: Angelina Jolie in Versace at the 2012 Oscars, flashing her right leg, a stance that bore memorable memes such as \u201cJolie\u2019ing\u201d and leg-bombing. Or Rihanna\u2019s yolk-yellow 2015 Met Gala outfit, dubbed \u201cthe omelette dress\u201d for its resemblance to breakfast. Quickly memeified, the viral attention put designer Guo Pei on the map. The fashion-meme industry relies on two things: designers to make meme-friendly pieces and social media whizzes to turn them into memes. If fashion finds beauty and profit in designing familiar objects in an unfamiliar way, then placing high-fashion in a non-fashion context is the next logical step. Accounts such as @freddiemade and @siduations are probably the best examples of fashion meme makers, with both using a sort of cut-and-paste recontextualisation method. Say model Bella Hadid in Versace trainers \u201crunning\u201d a marathon, a plastic-caped Balenciaga model superimposed into that apartment scene in American Psycho, or Viktor &amp; Rolf couture Photoshopped with the head of Fyre festival\u2019s Andy King from the Netflix documentary. It\u2019s these gags that make their work chime with a demographic who live their lives \u2013 and tell their jokes \u2013 online. It might seem cynical, but right now, if you were to pit the dress on the catwalk against the dress in some sort of witty meme-y context, you\u2019d get more likes for the latter. Humour is integral \u2013 partly because, to use the correct parlance, it provides that crucial \u201cif you know, you know\u201d lol. Instagram artist Hey Reilly, who\u2019s had his illustrations on the catwalk through a collaboration with Fendi, explains: \u201cI look for a hit in the image that reflects a sense of almost subconscious recognition in the viewer. An effective route to this jolt is by playing around with recognised fashion and celebrity imagery: it gets me lolling and hopefully others, too.\u201d With the fashion landscape so crowded, the ability of these memes to cut through our daily barrage of images hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by brands. Now, the most successful designers aren\u2019t avoiding the viral end of pop culture. Instead, they\u2019re actively trying to create something meme-friendly, an \u201cit\u201d item that piques our interest and sets the internet on fire. Under Demna Gvasalia, Balenciaga is a leader of memeable fashion \u2013 see last year\u2019s layered anoraks recalling a memorable Joey Tribbiani scene from Friends \u2013 as many memes on social media happily pointed out. In 2017, Marc Jacobs even collaborated with Instagram bootlegger @avanope on a T-shirt collection that looked like bad market stall copies of Jacobs\u2019 work, and showcased her in-joke irony to a new \u2013 and in the know \u2013 audience. Gucci is in on it as well: the models carrying casts of their own heads, as they did for SS18, were arguably more memorable \u2013 and certainly more memeable \u2013 than the clothes themselves. Even more sober houses such as Valentino have been pulled into the viral ecosystem. Any designer who showed a long red gown recently could have found their work superimposed on to a scene from the TV version of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and became a totem for women\u2019s rights. For pre-fall, Valentino\u2019s collection had 33 head-to-toe red looks, begging for Elisabeth Moss\u2019s bonneted head to be Photoshopped in. Whether or not it was designed with woke memes in mind is unclear, but it certainly lends itself to the genre. This season, meme-friendly fashion continued. See the supersized bag that dwarfed models at Jacquemus, a ginormous wide-brimmed hat at Valentino, giant bows at Marc Jacobs and half of Jeremy Scott\u2019s collection for Moschino \u2013 which reworked a sewing basket\u2019s contents into designer dresses. Intentional or not, creating clothes that become memes is a sure-fire way to set yourself apart from the old guard. With around 60% of luxury customers of a millennial age, clicks not only lead to sales: as a marketing strategy, they are arguably more important for getting your brand out there. \u201cDesigner brands are gradually realising they must lose their haughty image if they want to sell their clothes to a generation consumed by the internet,\u201d says Holly Friend, foresight writer at The Future Laboratory. If comparing a coat or dress with a cat meme seems reductive, it certainly gives the label an edge. For Moschino designer Jeremy Scott, this is no bad thing. \u201cFor something to be meme-worthy, sure, it could be a negative,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what I do is playful. If you can\u2019t find something funny around it, well, oh dear you.\u201d For Simon Porte Jacquemus, of hip French label Jacquemus, it goes with the territory. \u201cI often start [designing] with a specific photograph,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I think of the silhouettes, I think of styling from the beginning. I also see how clothes would look through a screen. I come from a digital generation.\u201d With his giant hats and postcard-backdrop shows, Jacquemus is arguably the crown prince of meme-friendly fashion. His infamous 2018 La Bomba hat is already a classic and he obviously approved of its online reception \u2013 if its sequel, SS19\u2019s equally mega-bag, is anything to go by. The element of absurdity, the fact that they photograph well and their being \u2013 like Wickstead\u2019s dress \u2013 larger than life helped make them deliciously memeable. Still, memes paraded on the catwalk, or your Instagram feed, are one thing. But let\u2019s not forget these are clothes and meant to be worn. If you put on that hat in public, you\u2019d probably block out the sun. As for the Jacquemus bag, imagine wedging it into an easyJet locker. This stuff looks funny, but isn\u2019t easy to wear. I should know, having spent the best part of the morning in a floor-length Moschino gown covered in three-inch gold needles. Sure it\u2019s elegant, and riffs on a Franco Moschino original, but, like the most memorable pieces from Scott\u2019s show, it is more than a dress: it\u2019s a cartoon, a commentary, riffing on the idea of fast fashion. It even comes with a thimble to wear on your head. And given it weighs 20kg and takes two people to lift it off the hanger, it\u2019s unwearable. The hat falls off as soon as you move. You carry the entire weight of the dress on your shoulders. But it is designed to be seen, and photographed, and shared on social media rather than to walk down the street. By wearing it, I\u2019m showing I\u2019m in on the joke. The next day, my shoulders still sore, I take it down a notch by moving from the Moschino dress into a monochrome Erdem look, which by contrast is normality itself. The cape hangs beautifully, allowing air to circulate. The trousers are stiff but wearable. The beekeeper\u2019s veil \u2013 yep \u2013 would be essential wearing if I worked in a hive. Standing on a street that is bee-free, I wonder what would compel me to wear a delicate veil like this in public and realise nothing, save a funeral. Until I see myself transplanted on to a meme, at which point it all makes sense. Scott was making a salient point about the fashion industry when he designed his collection but he\u2019s also well aware of the shareability of his designs. I put this point to Dawkins. He claims he had fashion in the back of his mind when he came up with the term meme. \u201cChanging styles and the epidemic spread of trends \u2013 people noticing what someone is wearing and copying it and that being repeated over and over \u2013 this is the ideal medium for illustrating how a meme works.\u201d Labels that meme well arguably do well, too. Kering, the conglomerate that owns Gucci and Balenciaga, gets over half its revenue from meme-happy millennials, suggesting there is financial method in them. In 2016, Instagram \u2013 where memes thrive \u2013 claimed a third of its then 500m users, 90% of whom are under 35, had bought clothing through the social network. But it\u2019s also about lifting clothes out of their safe space, into the gaze of a wider audience. Part of the reason Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga gets so much attention is because it turns fashion into a cultural moment, as with the recontextualising of a Bernie Sanders logo on to a scarf (AW17) or a computer font into a print (SS19). This is outward-facing fashion. Gvasalia actively wants to be part of the cultural conversation, and knows some of that is communicated through the language of memes. I suspect Wickstead \u2013 a designer more at home in the rarefied environs of Kensington Palace than a meme \u2013 would probably be horrified that I compared her dress to a duvet. But Gvasalia is regularly accused of trolling his own customers with designs such as the infamous T-shirt with a DHL logo, sold for \u00a3185, and his customers are A-OK with that. This sort of ironic publicity is the bread and butter of the industry now and we want to participate in it. \u201cBy creating, sharing or buying these products, we can demonstrate our alliance to internet culture,\u201d Friend says. \u201cAfter all, we want to be in on the joke.\u201d Even if that means we become the joke.",

But this is misleading: the consequences of local government austerity are anything but boring for those on the lowest incomes. The design of the council tax system \u2013 and recent reforms to it \u2013 hits the poorest hardest. Here\u2019s why. Since 2010, the central government grant to local government has been cut by almost 60%. This has had a devastating impact on local public services with spending falling in real terms by nearly one-fifth (excluding education and public health) since the start of the decade. So it\u2019s little surprise that council taxpayers in England face substantial increases in their bills, with nearly all councils set to increase them this April. Council tax was introduced in 1993 as a pragmatic fudge after the political disaster of the poll tax, which forced the poorest to contribute more than they had under the old rates system. Mass protests and riots ensued, as did a widespread campaign of nonpayment. Within seven months of it being introduced in England, Margaret Thatcher was forced to resign and her successor, John Major, quickly announced its abolition and replacement by the council tax. Since then the council tax system has been left largely unreformed. It is still based on property values from 1 April 1991.

The cheaper your property, the more you are likely to pay as a proportion of its value. What\u2019s more, the council tax now increasingly resembles the unpopular poll tax which it replaced. The devolution of council tax benefit in 2013, together with the cut in the funding provided for it, means that people on the very lowest incomes are paying council tax for the first time since the poll tax \u2013 and bills are rising. Research by the New Policy Institute found that 90% of councils in England have made changes to their schemes \u2013 with nearly a quarter asking working-age, low-income households to make a minimum payment of 20% and another fifth asking for more than 20%.

At times the stadium atmosphere can feel like football Twitter made flesh, one medium feeding another, learned habits seeping in from an increasingly angry and fractured public discourse, a place where all positions are defined by opposition, all talk is trash talk, a culture that is feasting on its own bones, enraged by its own component parts. It is of course a familiar complaint down the ages. Things fall apart. The new is all tainted and toxic. Still, though, change is worth observing. And the crowd will remain a yeasty, fickle, responsive thing. Right now one of its dominant notes in a strange moment for public life is shared impotent hostility. Which would, if the class of 2050 are reading this, make a pretty good name for a retro shoe when the time comes around to pore over the current age of rage.",

      "body": "<p> at around 2pm, Margaret, a manager for a marketing company, received a phone call about her son. She was travelling for work in Wiltshire. Max, then 25, had assaulted a police officer, she was told. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, what has happened now?\u2019\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Margaret drove to the flat near Bristol where Max had been living for four months. It\u2019s a self-contained part of The Maples, a residential building for adults with moderate to severe learning disabilities and mental health problems. Max has the reading age of a 12-year-old and the comprehension of a seven-year-old. He is autistic and has difficulty telling the time.</p> \n<p>The manager of The Maples told Margaret he had called the police because Max was drunk and had broken a window. When the police came, Max was in front of the building, in the driveway. This is where the alleged assault took place, after which he was taken into custody. But there was worse news to come: Max had been shot with a Taser by the police as he tried to run away. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d says Margaret. \u201cIt seemed off the scale.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>That day, Max became part of a disturbing statistic \u2013 one of the disproportionate number of people with learning disabilities, autism and mental health issues who are Tasered by police every year. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/764894/police-use-of-force-apr2017-mar2018-hosb3018.pdf\" title=\"\">Recent Home Office statistics</a> on police \u201cuse of force\u201d show that people perceived as having a \u201cmental disability\u201d are more likely to be subjected to a Taser (or similar device) than other forms of force, such as handcuffing, restraint or pepper spray. The report, based on data from 43 police forces in England and Wales, showed that from April 2017 to March 2018, there were 18,000 incidents involving a Taser (this includes police removing a Taser from the holster, as well as pointing it or actually firing it). Of these, 2,400 incidents involved people with mental<strong> </strong>disabilities \u2013 about 13%, which is a far higher proportion than the <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/learning-disabilities/help-information/learning-disability-statistics-\" title=\"\">2% of the population who have learning difficulties</a>. (The same figures also show that black people were more likely to have force used against them by police officers; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/13/black-people-more-likely-to-have-force-used-against-them-by-police-data-shows\" title=\"\">they experienced 20% of Tasering incidents</a> in 2017-18, despite accounting for 3.3% of the population, according to the 2011 census.)</p> \n<p>Tasers were introduced to the UK in 2003, initially only for authorised firearm-trained officers, as a way to resolve a crisis without having to resort to a gun. But in 2008, after a 12-month Home Office field trial, Tasers were gradually rolled out to forces across the country. They are termed \u201cless lethal weapons\u201d and can only be used when \u201cmitigating a threat of violence\u201d, according to a House of Commons briefing document.</p> \n<p>\u201cClearly, as time has gone on, their use has grown beyond their original intention,\u201d says Gary Wedge, who trains police officers in Taser use. \u201cBut unarmed officers face many dangers and providing them with a Taser helps to mitigate those risks.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3989deb0a2702e4714f89a9a21e1c8c473061d15\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3989deb0a2702e4714f89a9a21e1c8c473061d15/0_359_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret, whose son is autistic and was Tasered by police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max\u2019s mother, Margaret, whose meticulous recordkeeping proved crucial to her son\u2019s defence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Braden/Multistory</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Human rights campaigners and mental health charities feel Tasers are overused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got serious concerns about Tasers becoming the norm for day-to-day policing,\u201d says Oliver Feeley-Sprague, police and security programme director, Amnesty International UK. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly concerned at the alarming rise in overuse against vulnerable and minority groups, including on people with mental health issues and BAME people.\u201d He argues that police officers need specialist training: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see police officers better trained to recognise the likely behaviours of a person with a mental illness in a highly stressful situation. Overall, we\u2019d like to see police officers being more prepared to use a range of de-escalation techniques.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Taser was invented by Jack Cover, an American aerospace engineer, in the late 1960s. It was partly inspired by Tom Swift And His Electric Rifle, a book he had read as a child, about a boy who invents a gun that fires bolts of electricity. Cover adapted the title to come up with the acronym Taser. But it was Rick Smith, a business graduate, and his brother Thomas, who took Taser worldwide, founding Taser International in Arizona in 1993 (recently renamed Axon).</p> \n<p>A Taser looks like a Glock pistol and works by firing two live wires charged with 50,000 volts, each topped with barbed darts. When the barbs hook on to a target they create a charged circuit, causing muscles to contract painfully. Subjects are unable to control their bodies and fall to the floor. For the police, the advantages of a Taser are that it can reach a person 21ft away; it produces immediate incapacitation, no matter how big or strong the subject; and its effects wear off in seconds, leaving little trace.</p> \n<p>But as Taser use has escalated, so have reports of deaths. In the UK there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/timeline-of-taser-controversies-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">at least 18 fatalities linked to the use of a Taser</a> since 2003. Marc Cole, 30, a father of two with a recent history of mental illness, died in hospital last May, after being Tasered by police in Falmouth, Cornwall. His death is currently under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). An inquest is also due to be held, but no date is set.</p> \n<p>The IOPC made a rare judgment against the police in connection with the killing of Jordan Begley, 23, who died of cardiac arrest two hours after being shot by a Taser on 19 July 2013. Greater Manchester police were initially cleared of any wrongdoing, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/officer-who-tasered-jordan-begley-guilty-of-potential-misconduct\" title=\"\">IOPC identified improper use in a second investigation last year</a>. They found that Begley had been fired at for over eight seconds, which they described as \u201cnot reasonable\u201d (a Taser delivers its electrical charge in automatic bursts of five-second cycles).</p> \n<p>In August 2016, police in Telford fired a Taser at Dalian Atkinson, 48, a former Premier League footballer, outside his father\u2019s house in the early hours of the morning. A pre-inquest hearing heard how Atkinson became \u201cunresponsive shortly after being shot with a stun gun\u201d. He was taken to Princess Royal hospital, in Telford, where he died.<strong> </strong>Atkinson had been suffering from depression, his brother told a newspaper at the time, and \u201cwas in a manic state, out of his mind and ranting\u201d.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/15/dalian-atkinson-police-watchdog-iopc-awaiting-test-results-charges\" title=\"\">After a lengthy investigation,</a> the IOPC has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether two police constables should face criminal charges. A pre-inquest review is due to take place in Shrewsbury this year.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>I meet Margaret at her mother\u2019s house on a quiet cul-de-sac in Bristol. Max isn\u2019t here, but is happy for her to speak on his behalf, she tells me. A smartly dressed woman with short, stylish hair, she is meticulously organised. Her habit of keeping documents and letters has proved crucial, she says, because \u201cpeople remember things differently\u201d.</p> \n<p>She tells me about Max. He can be dogged in his thinking, she says, and often talks repetitively about specific subjects at length, especially when he is anxious. And yet Max, who was educated at mainstream schools, is adept at cloaking his differences and fitting in. All of this means \u201cpeople pick up much less than they should\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"101bc53b30d1c4433c2cc34611693a8fe4655475\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101bc53b30d1c4433c2cc34611693a8fe4655475/1331_610_885_976/453.jpg\" alt=\"School photo in home of Max in his mothers home.

In his statement, officer A described Max as \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201cswaying on his feet\u201d. He said that when he attempted to arrest him, he believed that Max \u201cwas going to run or try to fight us\u201d. He said that he not only resisted being handcuffed by his colleague, he \u201cpushed [him] in the chest\u201d. He decided to Taser Max, rather than use his baton or CS spray because officer B had already been \u201cassaulted\u201d: he didn\u2019t know if Max had a weapon and what he would do to \u201ceffect his escape\u201d. Wrestling him to the ground was not an option, he said, because Max was taller and heavier than the officers. \u201cDue to the danger I felt [we] were in I pulled the trigger of my Taser.\u201d He shouted \u201cTaser Taser\u201d according to the protocol. Max \u201cfell to the floor\u201d. In his statement, officer B confirmed Max\u2019s \u201ccombative stance\u201d. He concluded that Max was in \u201cfull fight-or-flight mode\u201d and his intention \u201cwas to shove me out of the way so he could escape\u201d.</p> \n<p>Margaret brings out a portable DVD player to show me the CCTV footage of the Tasering incident. On the day Max was charged, she asked the manager of The Maples for a copy of its surveillance camera footage. Margaret methodically makes her way through the film, stopping and rewinding whenever she sees something that catches her eye.</p> \n<p>The three men stand near the doorway for a while. \u201cThis is Max talking to the police officers,\u201d she says. Both are in full uniform and what one of the officers described in the statement as a \u201cstate of \u2018ties off\u2019 due to the hot weather\u201d. Max is not wearing a top because of the heat.</p> \n<p>Max is talking nonstop, according to officer B\u2019s statement, \u201cjust repeating the same things over and over again\u201d \u2013 further evidence, he suggests, of Max\u2019s inebriation. But repeating things, talking incessantly, standing too close (\u201cthe male repeatedly came in my personal space,\u201d said officer B) are also symptoms of autism (and how Max behaves even when he isn\u2019t drunk).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"477119f0-9dec-407b-8bd7-c53a2343b36a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H8jWbVqn7Dk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The action happens within just a few moments. Margaret points to the screen. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d She rewinds. The video appears to show a very different sequence of events from that described in the officers\u2019 statements. Max has both arms up, hands above his head in apparent surrender. \u201cI can\u2019t see him push anyone,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cHe puts his hands down to be handcuffed and then he suddenly gets scared and decides to run away.\u201d She slows down the footage. \u201cIt happens very quickly, but can you see the police officer pushes Max in the chest?\u201d The video shows Max losing his balance and falling to the floor. As he struggles to get up, officer A fires the Taser. One barb landed in the back of Max\u2019s neck, the other in his upper back.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is a home for people with learning disabilities and mental health issues,\u201d says Margaret. \u2018You don\u2019t go around Tasering vulnerable people as your first option. That should be your last option.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you are vulnerable in any way, you\u2019re more likely to be Tasered because of the officer not understanding what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Sophie Khan, a solicitor advocate who specialises in Taser-related injuries. In other words, a police officer may see the combative behaviour \u2013 not obeying commands, or aggression \u2013 and not the underlying cause behind it: a learning disability, perhaps, or mental breakdown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In situations where people are posing a risk to themselves and others, a Taser might be the least worst option</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The government-appointed body that oversees Taser use, the Scientific Advisory Committee on the Medical Implications of Less-Lethal Weapons (SACMILL)<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443842/DOMILL14_20120127_Taser06.2.pdf\" title=\"\"> has acknowledged that certain people</a> may be at risk of being Tasered simply because of who they are. In a statement published in 2012, the list is long. Mental health conditions, learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental or neurobehavioural conditions (for example, cerebral palsy and autistic spectrum disorders) may \u201cnegatively influence how affected individuals interact with the police\u201d. The point might be: \u201cDon\u2019t be different\u201d.</p> \n<p>Police say this is misleading. \u201cYes, a Taser is more likely to be used on vulnerable people, but in the majority of incidents the device isn\u2019t fired,\u201d says Michael Brown, a mental health coordinator at the College of Policing and for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. A Taser is described as being \u201cused\u201d, even if the gun is drawn but not fired. Merely taking aim, says Brown, is a very effective deterrent. He argues that Tasers can save lives. \u201cIf somebody is posing a risk, the police have to police that, regardless of whether the risk comes from straightforward criminality or whether it\u2019s from drugs and alcohol use, learning disability or mental illness. By the time the police are crisis-managing risk situations where people are self-harming, non-communicative and posing a risk to themselves or others, it might \u2013 just might \u2013 be the least worst option available.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>On 3 February 2013, Talhat Rehman, now 58, a halal butcher from London, jumped the barricades outside Buckingham Palace, where crowds had gathered to watch the changing of the guard. He had two large kitchen knives, which he waved in an aggressive manner, according to police, and went on to hold one knife to his own throat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe disturbance obviously caused a great deal of alarm to members of the public,\u201d observed Peter Zinner, the prosecutor in the trial at Southwark crown court on 27 March 2013. \u201cThe police had no option but to deploy Tasers.\u201d Rehman fell to the floor and officers retrieved the knives. He was taken into police custody and charged with affray and two counts of possession of a knife in a public place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4f5baa3-50e0-4746-b04c-9f77f42586fe\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>18,000</b>&nbsp;The number of police incidents involving a Taser between April 2017 and March 2018</p>\n    <p><b>2,400</b>&nbsp;of those (13%) involved people with 'mental disabilities', according to figures supplied by 43 forces&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2%</b>&nbsp;of the population have learning difficulties</p>\n    <p><b>20%</b>&nbsp;of Tasering incidents in that period involved black people</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rehman was sectioned. When he was considered well enough to be tried, he pleaded guilty to the two counts of having a knife in a public place (the charge of affray was dropped after Rehman\u2019s barrister said there was no evidence that he wanted to hurt others, only himself). His son, Kassum Raja, one of Rehman\u2019s five children, explained in court that his father had lost \u00a3170,000 in a financial scam. The episode, in his view, was the culmination of months of worry and anguish. On 17 May, Rehman was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including mental health treatment and a supervision order.</p> \n<p>Rehman lives with his wife, his son\u2019s family and his parents. When I visit Abdul, his father, 86, a trustee of Brent mosque, he explains that Talhat is in Pakistan seeing family. We talk about the Tasering and he confirms that his son had been \u201cdisturbed mentally\u201d by money worries at the time; he had gone to Buckingham Palace to get help from the Queen. \u201cHe loves the Queen. We all love the Queen. He must have thought she\u2019d help him out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The first he knew of the incident was when he saw it on the news: \u201cWe were very hurt and surprised.\u201d But Abdul is not entirely critical of the police. \u201cThey are professional people, obviously they know what they are doing. But we thought it was wrong when they Tasered him. The knife, you know, was just there\u201d \u2013 he points to his throat \u2013 \u201che could have fallen on the knife and hurt himself.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Abdul says the experience further unsettled his son and that it wasn\u2019t an appropriate use of force for someone with mental health problems. \u201cHe was very affected by it \u2013 it upset him a lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>In November 2013 Talhat Rehman contacted Sophie Kahn. \u201cThe entire episode had traumatised him,\u201d Khan says. \u201cHe said he used to have flashbacks about being Tasered, and being dragged to the floor and handcuffed. They were quite rough with him at the scene.\u201d</p> \n<p>In her view, Rehman should never have been Tasered. \u201cHad he been thrusting the knives at the police officers I would have understood \u2013 they\u2019ve got to protect themselves, but both knives were pointed to his body.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a5c80af25b281ea20bc14c0e34f93d6edd70085\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5c80af25b281ea20bc14c0e34f93d6edd70085/61_68_1895_2473/766.jpg\" alt=\"Spencer Beynon, who died after being tasered by police in Llanelli, Wales, in June 2016\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spencer Beynon, a former soldier who died after being Tasered by police.

She discovered that police had known about his unstable mental health for at least two years before the incident. They had visited his home to discuss letters he had sent to the BBC, the Queen and the Metropolitan Police commissioner, threatening suicide outside Buckingham Palace. Five months prior to being Tasered, he was arrested outside the Palace of Westminster. He was stopped, searched and found to have a knife. Police had been tipped off \u2013 by Rehman himself. \u201cHe contacted Brent Mental Health Service and the police to notify them of his plan,\u201d Khan says. Rehman was sectioned and taken to a secure hospital.</p> \n<p>In Khan\u2019s view, the case demonstrates how the police could have averted the situation. \u201cThe police knew he wasn\u2019t well. Why didn\u2019t they do something? They could have referred him to a team who could have come up with a care plan \u2013 then he would have been in regular contact with mental health services.\u201d</p> \n<p>Almost a year after he was Tasered, Rehman wrote a letter of complaint to the police. He argued that the restraint was \u201cunlawful\u201d and that \u201cpolice had failed to safeguard his welfare prior to the incident\u201d. He received a response on 26 February 2015. They said that in their opinion there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d that the restraint against him \u201cwas unlawful\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the view of Michael Brown, the police mental health coordinator, the case is a textbook example of Taser use; one that is likely to be used in training. \u201cHe was presenting a threat, which means you wouldn\u2019t want to get close to him in case he hurt you with a knife.\u201d Officers \u201cmanaged to mitigate that risk\u201d by using the Taser. The incident \u201calso had the benefit of being videoed at close range [by bystanders] so there\u2019s perfect footage of it\u201d. Of course, he adds, Rehman\u2019s previous contact with the police is significant. But \u201cthe fact that the police knew something doesn\u2019t mean the officers on the ground knew something\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>***</strong></p> \n<p>Spencer Beynon was born in Llanelli, south Wales in 1972. His father, Chris, 75, was a double-glazing salesman, and his mother, Margaret, 73, a housewife. He grew up a very happy, rugby-playing boy who had plenty of friends and was close to his family. He met his wife at 23, after a seven-year stint in the army. Ellen, now 40, was a hairdresser in Llanelli. \u201cHe and his friends used to come in and go on the sunbeds,\u201d she remembers, \u201cHe was a charmer.\u201d They had two children, Victoria, now 19, and Jacob, now 15, but separated after four years of marriage. \u201cWe just drifted apart, but we were friends always.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2005, Beynon decided to go back into the army, and wanted to prove he could still make it at 33 by joining the elite Parachute Regiment (the Paras). \u201cHe said, \u2018If I\u2019m not fit enough for the Paras \u2013 the fittest of them all \u2013 I\u2019m not fit to go back into the army,\u2019\u201d his father says. \u201cHe worked himself very hard.\u201d</p> \n<p>After successfully completing the training, Beynon transferred back to his old regiment \u2013 the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh. He was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan, where several deeply traumatising events changed the course of his life.</p> \n<p>Three months after arriving in Iraq, Beynon witnessed the death of his childhood friend, Ryan, when his vehicle was hit during a night operation. Beynon, who was in the vehicle behind, retrieved his friend\u2019s body from the wreckage. \u201cIt was a policy with the boys, an unwritten law, get them out,\u201d his father explains. \u201cWhat they see out there, we haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were other pivotal events: the death of a baby during a search-and-recovery operation in Basra; the fatal injury of another army colleague in Helmand, Afghanistan. \u201cSpencer and the nurse stayed with him for an hour and a half waiting for the helicopter to come. It was absolutely horrific. And people ask, \u2018Why did he have post-traumatic stress disorder?\u2019\u201d his father says.</p> \n<p>In December 2011, Beynon found out that Ryan\u2019s mother, Alison, had died from cancer before Beynon had a chance to speak to her. Deeply affected by her death, he left the army and moved back home with his parents in Llanelli. \u201cAlison\u2019s death did something to his head,\u201d his mother says. \u201cI\u2019d hear him in the night screaming.\u201d He\u2019d take a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s and sit by Ryan\u2019s grave. \u201cHe was totally obsessed with Ryan\u2019s death,\u201d his mother says. \u201cHe\u2019d lie in his bedroom for days and wouldn\u2019t wash \u2013 and my son was immaculate,\u201d she says. He tried to escape into cannabis and alcohol. When his mother complained, \u201che\u2019d say, \u2018Leave me alone. It\u2019s the only thing that takes the memories away.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>On 14 June 2016, at around 7pm, neighbours contacted police to say Beynon was acting strangely. He was by now living in a cul-de-sac near the seafront, about a 15-minute drive from his parents\u2019 house. His great love was Ganesh, a Boston terrier. \u201cThe dog kept him alive,\u201d says his father. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the dog, he would have taken his own life years ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to witnesses, two officers from Dyfed-Powys police arrived at the scene at around 7.30pm. They found Beynon slumped on the pavement with a self-inflicted cut to his throat. He was bleeding heavily. He\u2019d also turned on his dog, inflicting such severe injuries that he had to be put down. Within minutes of the officers arriving, Beynon was Tasered. He died soon afterwards. He was 43.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aacb722890bae30c9103fa8a81d4cbb2365e92ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aacb722890bae30c9103fa8a81d4cbb2365e92ea/0_462_8153_5539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spencer Beynon\u2019s father Chris, his mother Margaret, his daughter Victoria and former wife Ellen in Milford Haven after the pre-inquest hearing into his death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spencer Beynon\u2019s father Chris, his mother Margaret, his daughter Victoria and former wife Ellen after the pre-inquest hearing into his death.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Braden/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Three years later, Beynon\u2019s family are yet to receive answers about why police used a Taser, and whether that contributed to his death. Since August 2017, there have been five pre-inquest hearings. In one, last June, Sophie Khan, who represents the family, told the court that the officer who fired the Taser described Beynon as getting up and \u201ccharging\u201d at the officers, but none of the other witnesses described him getting up, including the other officer.</p> \n<p>At the fourth hearing, last October, it was revealed that Beynon\u2019s father, Chris, had called the police that morning asking to have his son sectioned under the Mental Health Act for his own safety; this call was not acted on. \u201cWhen the police attended the scene and saw Spencer Beynon bleeding they had an obligation to provide him with first aid, to protect his life,\u201d Khan told the pre-inquest. \u201cThat did not happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The barrister representing Dyfed-Powys police said Beynon had died from the wound to his neck; that the Taser \u201cplayed no part\u201d in his death, adding: \u201cThree experts are of the unanimous view that a Taser was not the cause of death.\u201d This included Anthony Bleetman, a freelance consultant who advises on emergency medicine for SACMILL, and one of three expert witnesses appointed by the coroner to comment on Taser use in this case. In his view, Beynon had an \u201cin-survivable neck wound\u201d and was beyond saving.</p> \n<p>But Khan raised another concern at the hearing: conflict of interest. Not only had Bleetman been instructed by the IOPC as part of its investigation into Beynon\u2019s death (\u201cthe coroner should appoint its own experts,\u201d she said) Bleetman has an ongoing professional relationship with the police, providing advice and training in the use of force for two decades. \u201cHe can\u2019t be classified as an independent expert,\u201d she stated. Bleetman also has a prior relationship with Taser International. He was paid by them to write a literature review of Taser-related injuries in 2001.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are talking about a very modest sum, going back 20 years, which was always declared,\u201d he says when we speak. Is there a conflict of interest? \u201cThat is a matter for discussion, but my approach to these things is straightforward: every time I am asked to comment on a Taser case, the first thing I do is alert the chair of SACMILL. His response has always been \u2018Just declare everything\u2019. It\u2019s up to the courts to determine whether they consider my evidence to be truly independent or not.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bleetman defends the use of the Taser on Beynon. \u201cWe are talking about an individual who cut his own throat. Who did what he did to the dog. And in the cool light of day after the event, we say, \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t you talk to him? Why didn\u2019t you guide him away?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>A date has yet to be set for the inquest, but it\u2019s unlikely to be this year. \u201cFor the family who have lost someone in tragic, complicated and distressing circumstances, the lack of clarity around what happened and why is only adding to their distress,\u201d Khan says. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe just want to get justice for Spencer,\u201d says Ellen. \u201cWe want to get answers so we can move on.\u201d</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>On 30 November 2015, Max, his family and legal team went to Bristol magistrates court for a hearing. Before the hearing, Max\u2019s solicitor met the prosecution barrister and showed him the CCTV footage of the Tasering. The case was dropped.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Margaret hadn\u2019t had the CCTV, Max could have gone to prison for something he hadn\u2019t done,\u201d says Lorne Wilkinson, a former police officer and the litigator on Max\u2019s case. The sentence for assaulting a police officer is up to six months in prison or a \u00a35,000 fine. \u201cIt would have been sending someone with the understanding of a seven-year-old into a man\u2019s prison.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 4 December 2015, Margaret submitted a complaint to the IOPC. She received a response on 6 October 2017. The IOPC found \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in the officers\u2019 accounts, but did not find evidence of any misconduct.<strong> </strong>In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: \u201cThe IOPC found there was no case to answer for misconduct for any of the officers involved. The report stated both the arrest and use of Taser were reasonable in the circumstances\u201d. \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cI feel really let down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Today, she campaigns for <a href=\"http://autisminjustice.org/\" title=\"\">autisminjustice.org</a>, an organisation that challenges the criminalisation of autistic people. She says she replays in her mind over and over the images of Max being Tasered. \u201cThis could have put Max in prison. That is how close we came.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Max\u2019s name has been changed.

      "bodyText": "at around 2pm, Margaret, a manager for a marketing company, received a phone call about her son. She was travelling for work in Wiltshire. Max, then 25, had assaulted a police officer, she was told. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, what has happened now?\u2019\u201d she says. Margaret drove to the flat near Bristol where Max had been living for four months. It\u2019s a self-contained part of The Maples, a residential building for adults with moderate to severe learning disabilities and mental health problems. Max has the reading age of a 12-year-old and the comprehension of a seven-year-old. He is autistic and has difficulty telling the time. The manager of The Maples told Margaret he had called the police because Max was drunk and had broken a window. When the police came, Max was in front of the building, in the driveway. This is where the alleged assault took place, after which he was taken into custody. But there was worse news to come: Max had been shot with a Taser by the police as he tried to run away. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d says Margaret. \u201cIt seemed off the scale.\u201d *** That day, Max became part of a disturbing statistic \u2013 one of the disproportionate number of people with learning disabilities, autism and mental health issues who are Tasered by police every year. Recent Home Office statistics on police \u201cuse of force\u201d show that people perceived as having a \u201cmental disability\u201d are more likely to be subjected to a Taser (or similar device) than other forms of force, such as handcuffing, restraint or pepper spray. The report, based on data from 43 police forces in England and Wales, showed that from April 2017 to March 2018, there were 18,000 incidents involving a Taser (this includes police removing a Taser from the holster, as well as pointing it or actually firing it). Of these, 2,400 incidents involved people with mental disabilities \u2013 about 13%, which is a far higher proportion than the 2% of the population who have learning difficulties. (The same figures also show that black people were more likely to have force used against them by police officers; they experienced 20% of Tasering incidents in 2017-18, despite accounting for 3.3% of the population, according to the 2011 census.) Tasers were introduced to the UK in 2003, initially only for authorised firearm-trained officers, as a way to resolve a crisis without having to resort to a gun. But in 2008, after a 12-month Home Office field trial, Tasers were gradually rolled out to forces across the country. They are termed \u201cless lethal weapons\u201d and can only be used when \u201cmitigating a threat of violence\u201d, according to a House of Commons briefing document. \u201cClearly, as time has gone on, their use has grown beyond their original intention,\u201d says Gary Wedge, who trains police officers in Taser use. \u201cBut unarmed officers face many dangers and providing them with a Taser helps to mitigate those risks.\u201d Human rights campaigners and mental health charities feel Tasers are overused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got serious concerns about Tasers becoming the norm for day-to-day policing,\u201d says Oliver Feeley-Sprague, police and security programme director, Amnesty International UK. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly concerned at the alarming rise in overuse against vulnerable and minority groups, including on people with mental health issues and BAME people.\u201d He argues that police officers need specialist training: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see police officers better trained to recognise the likely behaviours of a person with a mental illness in a highly stressful situation. Overall, we\u2019d like to see police officers being more prepared to use a range of de-escalation techniques.\u201d The Taser was invented by Jack Cover, an American aerospace engineer, in the late 1960s. It was partly inspired by Tom Swift And His Electric Rifle, a book he had read as a child, about a boy who invents a gun that fires bolts of electricity. Cover adapted the title to come up with the acronym Taser. But it was Rick Smith, a business graduate, and his brother Thomas, who took Taser worldwide, founding Taser International in Arizona in 1993 (recently renamed Axon). A Taser looks like a Glock pistol and works by firing two live wires charged with 50,000 volts, each topped with barbed darts. When the barbs hook on to a target they create a charged circuit, causing muscles to contract painfully. Subjects are unable to control their bodies and fall to the floor. For the police, the advantages of a Taser are that it can reach a person 21ft away; it produces immediate incapacitation, no matter how big or strong the subject; and its effects wear off in seconds, leaving little trace. But as Taser use has escalated, so have reports of deaths. In the UK there have been at least 18 fatalities linked to the use of a Taser since 2003. Marc Cole, 30, a father of two with a recent history of mental illness, died in hospital last May, after being Tasered by police in Falmouth, Cornwall. His death is currently under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). An inquest is also due to be held, but no date is set. The IOPC made a rare judgment against the police in connection with the killing of Jordan Begley, 23, who died of cardiac arrest two hours after being shot by a Taser on 19 July 2013. Greater Manchester police were initially cleared of any wrongdoing, but the IOPC identified improper use in a second investigation last year. They found that Begley had been fired at for over eight seconds, which they described as \u201cnot reasonable\u201d (a Taser delivers its electrical charge in automatic bursts of five-second cycles). In August 2016, police in Telford fired a Taser at Dalian Atkinson, 48, a former Premier League footballer, outside his father\u2019s house in the early hours of the morning. A pre-inquest hearing heard how Atkinson became \u201cunresponsive shortly after being shot with a stun gun\u201d. He was taken to Princess Royal hospital, in Telford, where he died. Atkinson had been suffering from depression, his brother told a newspaper at the time, and \u201cwas in a manic state, out of his mind and ranting\u201d. After a lengthy investigation, the IOPC has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether two police constables should face criminal charges. A pre-inquest review is due to take place in Shrewsbury this year. *** I meet Margaret at her mother\u2019s house on a quiet cul-de-sac in Bristol. Max isn\u2019t here, but is happy for her to speak on his behalf, she tells me. A smartly dressed woman with short, stylish hair, she is meticulously organised. Her habit of keeping documents and letters has proved crucial, she says, because \u201cpeople remember things differently\u201d. She tells me about Max. He can be dogged in his thinking, she says, and often talks repetitively about specific subjects at length, especially when he is anxious. And yet Max, who was educated at mainstream schools, is adept at cloaking his differences and fitting in. All of this means \u201cpeople pick up much less than they should\u201d. She shows me the witness statements from the two policemen (referred to as officer A and officer B) who arrested Max that day. In his statement, officer A described Max as \u201cintoxicated\u201d and \u201cswaying on his feet\u201d. He said that when he attempted to arrest him, he believed that Max \u201cwas going to run or try to fight us\u201d. He said that he not only resisted being handcuffed by his colleague, he \u201cpushed [him] in the chest\u201d. He decided to Taser Max, rather than use his baton or CS spray because officer B had already been \u201cassaulted\u201d: he didn\u2019t know if Max had a weapon and what he would do to \u201ceffect his escape\u201d. Wrestling him to the ground was not an option, he said, because Max was taller and heavier than the officers. \u201cDue to the danger I felt [we] were in I pulled the trigger of my Taser.\u201d He shouted \u201cTaser Taser\u201d according to the protocol. Max \u201cfell to the floor\u201d. In his statement, officer B confirmed Max\u2019s \u201ccombative stance\u201d. He concluded that Max was in \u201cfull fight-or-flight mode\u201d and his intention \u201cwas to shove me out of the way so he could escape\u201d. Margaret brings out a portable DVD player to show me the CCTV footage of the Tasering incident. On the day Max was charged, she asked the manager of The Maples for a copy of its surveillance camera footage. Margaret methodically makes her way through the film, stopping and rewinding whenever she sees something that catches her eye. The three men stand near the doorway for a while. \u201cThis is Max talking to the police officers,\u201d she says. Both are in full uniform and what one of the officers described in the statement as a \u201cstate of \u2018ties off\u2019 due to the hot weather\u201d. Max is not wearing a top because of the heat. Max is talking nonstop, according to officer B\u2019s statement, \u201cjust repeating the same things over and over again\u201d \u2013 further evidence, he suggests, of Max\u2019s inebriation. But repeating things, talking incessantly, standing too close (\u201cthe male repeatedly came in my personal space,\u201d said officer B) are also symptoms of autism (and how Max behaves even when he isn\u2019t drunk). The action happens within just a few moments. Margaret points to the screen. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d She rewinds. The video appears to show a very different sequence of events from that described in the officers\u2019 statements. Max has both arms up, hands above his head in apparent surrender. \u201cI can\u2019t see him push anyone,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cHe puts his hands down to be handcuffed and then he suddenly gets scared and decides to run away.\u201d She slows down the footage. \u201cIt happens very quickly, but can you see the police officer pushes Max in the chest?\u201d The video shows Max losing his balance and falling to the floor. As he struggles to get up, officer A fires the Taser. One barb landed in the back of Max\u2019s neck, the other in his upper back. \u201cIt is a home for people with learning disabilities and mental health issues,\u201d says Margaret. \u2018You don\u2019t go around Tasering vulnerable people as your first option. That should be your last option.\u201d *** \u201cIf you are vulnerable in any way, you\u2019re more likely to be Tasered because of the officer not understanding what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Sophie Khan, a solicitor advocate who specialises in Taser-related injuries. In other words, a police officer may see the combative behaviour \u2013 not obeying commands, or aggression \u2013 and not the underlying cause behind it: a learning disability, perhaps, or mental breakdown. The government-appointed body that oversees Taser use, the Scientific Advisory Committee on the Medical Implications of Less-Lethal Weapons (SACMILL) has acknowledged that certain people may be at risk of being Tasered simply because of who they are. In a statement published in 2012, the list is long. Mental health conditions, learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental or neurobehavioural conditions (for example, cerebral palsy and autistic spectrum disorders) may \u201cnegatively influence how affected individuals interact with the police\u201d. The point might be: \u201cDon\u2019t be different\u201d. Police say this is misleading. \u201cYes, a Taser is more likely to be used on vulnerable people, but in the majority of incidents the device isn\u2019t fired,\u201d says Michael Brown, a mental health coordinator at the College of Policing and for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. A Taser is described as being \u201cused\u201d, even if the gun is drawn but not fired. Merely taking aim, says Brown, is a very effective deterrent. He argues that Tasers can save lives. \u201cIf somebody is posing a risk, the police have to police that, regardless of whether the risk comes from straightforward criminality or whether it\u2019s from drugs and alcohol use, learning disability or mental illness. By the time the police are crisis-managing risk situations where people are self-harming, non-communicative and posing a risk to themselves or others, it might \u2013 just might \u2013 be the least worst option available.\u201d *** On 3 February 2013, Talhat Rehman, now 58, a halal butcher from London, jumped the barricades outside Buckingham Palace, where crowds had gathered to watch the changing of the guard. He had two large kitchen knives, which he waved in an aggressive manner, according to police, and went on to hold one knife to his own throat. \u201cThe disturbance obviously caused a great deal of alarm to members of the public,\u201d observed Peter Zinner, the prosecutor in the trial at Southwark crown court on 27 March 2013. \u201cThe police had no option but to deploy Tasers.\u201d Rehman fell to the floor and officers retrieved the knives. He was taken into police custody and charged with affray and two counts of possession of a knife in a public place. Rehman was sectioned. When he was considered well enough to be tried, he pleaded guilty to the two counts of having a knife in a public place (the charge of affray was dropped after Rehman\u2019s barrister said there was no evidence that he wanted to hurt others, only himself). His son, Kassum Raja, one of Rehman\u2019s five children, explained in court that his father had lost \u00a3170,000 in a financial scam. The episode, in his view, was the culmination of months of worry and anguish. On 17 May, Rehman was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including mental health treatment and a supervision order. Rehman lives with his wife, his son\u2019s family and his parents. When I visit Abdul, his father, 86, a trustee of Brent mosque, he explains that Talhat is in Pakistan seeing family. We talk about the Tasering and he confirms that his son had been \u201cdisturbed mentally\u201d by money worries at the time; he had gone to Buckingham Palace to get help from the Queen. \u201cHe loves the Queen. We all love the Queen. He must have thought she\u2019d help him out.\u201d The first he knew of the incident was when he saw it on the news: \u201cWe were very hurt and surprised.\u201d But Abdul is not entirely critical of the police. \u201cThey are professional people, obviously they know what they are doing. But we thought it was wrong when they Tasered him. The knife, you know, was just there\u201d \u2013 he points to his throat \u2013 \u201che could have fallen on the knife and hurt himself.\u201d However, Abdul says the experience further unsettled his son and that it wasn\u2019t an appropriate use of force for someone with mental health problems. \u201cHe was very affected by it \u2013 it upset him a lot.\u201d In November 2013 Talhat Rehman contacted Sophie Kahn. \u201cThe entire episode had traumatised him,\u201d Khan says. \u201cHe said he used to have flashbacks about being Tasered, and being dragged to the floor and handcuffed. They were quite rough with him at the scene.\u201d In her view, Rehman should never have been Tasered. \u201cHad he been thrusting the knives at the police officers I would have understood \u2013 they\u2019ve got to protect themselves, but both knives were pointed to his body.\u201d Even if Tasering Rehman was justified, Khan says, the situation should never have got to that point. She discovered that police had known about his unstable mental health for at least two years before the incident. They had visited his home to discuss letters he had sent to the BBC, the Queen and the Metropolitan Police commissioner, threatening suicide outside Buckingham Palace. Five months prior to being Tasered, he was arrested outside the Palace of Westminster. He was stopped, searched and found to have a knife. Police had been tipped off \u2013 by Rehman himself. \u201cHe contacted Brent Mental Health Service and the police to notify them of his plan,\u201d Khan says. Rehman was sectioned and taken to a secure hospital. In Khan\u2019s view, the case demonstrates how the police could have averted the situation. \u201cThe police knew he wasn\u2019t well. Why didn\u2019t they do something? They could have referred him to a team who could have come up with a care plan \u2013 then he would have been in regular contact with mental health services.\u201d Almost a year after he was Tasered, Rehman wrote a letter of complaint to the police. He argued that the restraint was \u201cunlawful\u201d and that \u201cpolice had failed to safeguard his welfare prior to the incident\u201d. He received a response on 26 February 2015. They said that in their opinion there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d that the restraint against him \u201cwas unlawful\u201d. In the view of Michael Brown, the police mental health coordinator, the case is a textbook example of Taser use; one that is likely to be used in training. \u201cHe was presenting a threat, which means you wouldn\u2019t want to get close to him in case he hurt you with a knife.\u201d Officers \u201cmanaged to mitigate that risk\u201d by using the Taser. The incident \u201calso had the benefit of being videoed at close range [by bystanders] so there\u2019s perfect footage of it\u201d. Of course, he adds, Rehman\u2019s previous contact with the police is significant. But \u201cthe fact that the police knew something doesn\u2019t mean the officers on the ground knew something\u201d. *** Spencer Beynon was born in Llanelli, south Wales in 1972. His father, Chris, 75, was a double-glazing salesman, and his mother, Margaret, 73, a housewife. He grew up a very happy, rugby-playing boy who had plenty of friends and was close to his family. He met his wife at 23, after a seven-year stint in the army. Ellen, now 40, was a hairdresser in Llanelli. \u201cHe and his friends used to come in and go on the sunbeds,\u201d she remembers, \u201cHe was a charmer.\u201d They had two children, Victoria, now 19, and Jacob, now 15, but separated after four years of marriage. \u201cWe just drifted apart, but we were friends always.\u201d In 2005, Beynon decided to go back into the army, and wanted to prove he could still make it at 33 by joining the elite Parachute Regiment (the Paras). \u201cHe said, \u2018If I\u2019m not fit enough for the Paras \u2013 the fittest of them all \u2013 I\u2019m not fit to go back into the army,\u2019\u201d his father says. \u201cHe worked himself very hard.\u201d After successfully completing the training, Beynon transferred back to his old regiment \u2013 the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh. He was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan, where several deeply traumatising events changed the course of his life. Three months after arriving in Iraq, Beynon witnessed the death of his childhood friend, Ryan, when his vehicle was hit during a night operation. Beynon, who was in the vehicle behind, retrieved his friend\u2019s body from the wreckage. \u201cIt was a policy with the boys, an unwritten law, get them out,\u201d his father explains. \u201cWhat they see out there, we haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d There were other pivotal events: the death of a baby during a search-and-recovery operation in Basra; the fatal injury of another army colleague in Helmand, Afghanistan. \u201cSpencer and the nurse stayed with him for an hour and a half waiting for the helicopter to come. It was absolutely horrific. And people ask, \u2018Why did he have post-traumatic stress disorder?\u2019\u201d his father says. In December 2011, Beynon found out that Ryan\u2019s mother, Alison, had died from cancer before Beynon had a chance to speak to her. Deeply affected by her death, he left the army and moved back home with his parents in Llanelli. \u201cAlison\u2019s death did something to his head,\u201d his mother says. \u201cI\u2019d hear him in the night screaming.\u201d He\u2019d take a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s and sit by Ryan\u2019s grave. \u201cHe was totally obsessed with Ryan\u2019s death,\u201d his mother says. \u201cHe\u2019d lie in his bedroom for days and wouldn\u2019t wash \u2013 and my son was immaculate,\u201d she says. He tried to escape into cannabis and alcohol. When his mother complained, \u201che\u2019d say, \u2018Leave me alone. It\u2019s the only thing that takes the memories away.\u2019\u201d On 14 June 2016, at around 7pm, neighbours contacted police to say Beynon was acting strangely. He was by now living in a cul-de-sac near the seafront, about a 15-minute drive from his parents\u2019 house. His great love was Ganesh, a Boston terrier. \u201cThe dog kept him alive,\u201d says his father. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the dog, he would have taken his own life years ago.\u201d According to witnesses, two officers from Dyfed-Powys police arrived at the scene at around 7.30pm. They found Beynon slumped on the pavement with a self-inflicted cut to his throat. He was bleeding heavily. He\u2019d also turned on his dog, inflicting such severe injuries that he had to be put down. Within minutes of the officers arriving, Beynon was Tasered. He died soon afterwards. He was 43. Three years later, Beynon\u2019s family are yet to receive answers about why police used a Taser, and whether that contributed to his death. Since August 2017, there have been five pre-inquest hearings. In one, last June, Sophie Khan, who represents the family, told the court that the officer who fired the Taser described Beynon as getting up and \u201ccharging\u201d at the officers, but none of the other witnesses described him getting up, including the other officer. At the fourth hearing, last October, it was revealed that Beynon\u2019s father, Chris, had called the police that morning asking to have his son sectioned under the Mental Health Act for his own safety; this call was not acted on. \u201cWhen the police attended the scene and saw Spencer Beynon bleeding they had an obligation to provide him with first aid, to protect his life,\u201d Khan told the pre-inquest. \u201cThat did not happen.\u201d The barrister representing Dyfed-Powys police said Beynon had died from the wound to his neck; that the Taser \u201cplayed no part\u201d in his death, adding: \u201cThree experts are of the unanimous view that a Taser was not the cause of death.\u201d This included Anthony Bleetman, a freelance consultant who advises on emergency medicine for SACMILL, and one of three expert witnesses appointed by the coroner to comment on Taser use in this case. In his view, Beynon had an \u201cin-survivable neck wound\u201d and was beyond saving. But Khan raised another concern at the hearing: conflict of interest. Not only had Bleetman been instructed by the IOPC as part of its investigation into Beynon\u2019s death (\u201cthe coroner should appoint its own experts,\u201d she said) Bleetman has an ongoing professional relationship with the police, providing advice and training in the use of force for two decades. \u201cHe can\u2019t be classified as an independent expert,\u201d she stated. Bleetman also has a prior relationship with Taser International. He was paid by them to write a literature review of Taser-related injuries in 2001. \u201cWe are talking about a very modest sum, going back 20 years, which was always declared,\u201d he says when we speak. Is there a conflict of interest? \u201cThat is a matter for discussion, but my approach to these things is straightforward: every time I am asked to comment on a Taser case, the first thing I do is alert the chair of SACMILL. His response has always been \u2018Just declare everything\u2019. It\u2019s up to the courts to determine whether they consider my evidence to be truly independent or not.\u201d Bleetman defends the use of the Taser on Beynon. \u201cWe are talking about an individual who cut his own throat. Who did what he did to the dog. And in the cool light of day after the event, we say, \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t you talk to him? Why didn\u2019t you guide him away?\u2019\u201d A date has yet to be set for the inquest, but it\u2019s unlikely to be this year. \u201cFor the family who have lost someone in tragic, complicated and distressing circumstances, the lack of clarity around what happened and why is only adding to their distress,\u201d Khan says. \u201cWe just want to get justice for Spencer,\u201d says Ellen. \u201cWe want to get answers so we can move on.\u201d *** On 30 November 2015, Max, his family and legal team went to Bristol magistrates court for a hearing. Before the hearing, Max\u2019s solicitor met the prosecution barrister and showed him the CCTV footage of the Tasering. The case was dropped. \u201cIf Margaret hadn\u2019t had the CCTV, Max could have gone to prison for something he hadn\u2019t done,\u201d says Lorne Wilkinson, a former police officer and the litigator on Max\u2019s case. The sentence for assaulting a police officer is up to six months in prison or a \u00a35,000 fine. \u201cIt would have been sending someone with the understanding of a seven-year-old into a man\u2019s prison.\u201d On 4 December 2015, Margaret submitted a complaint to the IOPC. She received a response on 6 October 2017. The IOPC found \u201cinaccuracies\u201d in the officers\u2019 accounts, but did not find evidence of any misconduct. In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said: \u201cThe IOPC found there was no case to answer for misconduct for any of the officers involved. The report stated both the arrest and use of Taser were reasonable in the circumstances\u201d. \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cI feel really let down.\u201d Today, she campaigns for autisminjustice.org, an organisation that challenges the criminalisation of autistic people. She says she replays in her mind over and over the images of Max being Tasered. \u201cThis could have put Max in prison. That is how close we came.\u201d \u2022 Max\u2019s name has been changed.

      "body": "<p> Somewhere towards the end of last year, I stood up in front of 400 or so 17-year-olds to talk about poetry. The lecture was one I\u2019d already given in various guises; a comparative reading of two poems: one canonical, the other contemporary. In the past, I\u2019d compared WB Yeats with Sharon Olds, Helen Dunmore with Tishani Doshi, and John Donne with Tiphanie Yanique. That day, we were back with Donne again: <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44129/the-sun-rising\" title=\"\">\u201cThe Sun Rising\u201d</a>, one of the language\u2019s greatest love poems, as fresh and exultant now as it was when it was written four centuries ago. But rather than scouring the work of Forward or Pulitzer prize winners to find something to read with it, this time I turned to YouTube. The poem I chose was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/16/hollie-mcnish-politics-of-poetry-ted-hughes-prize-winner\" title=\"\">Hollie McNish</a>\u2019s \u201cWatching Miserable-Looking Couples in the Supermarket\u201d.</p> \n<p>A few months earlier, McNish had found herself at the centre of a whirlwind, when an argument that had been rumbling for some time behind the poetry world\u2019s tightly closed doors abruptly burst forth in public. McNish \u2013 whose vivid, visceral poems have been watched by millions online \u2013 had won the Ted Hughes award for new work in poetry in 2016 for her debut collection, and subsequently secured a publishing deal for a new book, <em>Plum</em>, with Picador. <em>Plum </em>came out in 2017, was broadly well received, and rapidly became one of the year\u2019s bestselling collections, part of a surge in poetry sales that was spearheaded by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rupikaur_/\" title=\"\">Instapoet Rupi Kaur</a>, whose two collections had together sold in the hundreds of thousands. But it wasn\u2019t until January 2018 that <em>Plum </em>made headlines. Rebecca Watts (a prize-shortlisted poet in her own right) was commissioned to review it for poetry journal PN Review, but submitted, instead, <a href=\"https://www.pnreview.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?item_id=10090\" title=\"\">an essay</a> in which she decried \u201cthe rise of a cohort of young female poets who are currently being lauded by the poetic establishment for their \u2018honesty\u2019 and \u2018accessibility\u2019 \u2013 buzzwords for the open denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft\u201d. She declined to review <em>Plum</em> on the grounds that \u201cto do so \u2026 would imply that it deserves to be taken seriously as poetry\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69aefce4-8f3d-43bf-87ee-e0a85dd0689b\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Born in Wakefield in 1989, Abbott is a poet, educator and activist.

But the speed and fury with which this one exploded marked the point at which a formerly nebulous territorial dispute within a small community suddenly hardened, and everyone felt obliged to pick a side. \u201cIn every period you\u2019ve had poets who write what\u2019s seen as being more accessible poetry,\u201d says Anthony Anaxagorou, award-winning slam poet and founder-director of live poetry night <a href=\"https://www.outspokenldn.com/\" title=\"\">Out-Spoken</a>, citing, among others, Charles Bukowski, Maya Angelou and Emily Dickinson. \u201cThe difference now is that things are more democratic. Anyone is free to set up a social media account or website and publish their poems. Gatekeepers traditionally have been responsible for maintaining a sense of quality control, which many feel has diminished since the rise of social media. What you\u2019re left with is a widening chasm. The establishment and the academy have buttressed their positions as \u2018knowers\u2019 of good poetry, resulting in serious readers and writers swaying over to one side, leaving the more casual reader to trundle through the badlands of social media poetry.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d0da9aac103775864bcc962075b13488c5b527d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d0da9aac103775864bcc962075b13488c5b527d/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Things are more democratic\u2019 ...

Whatever your view, there\u2019s no doubt that, historically, the number of people accessing poetry has been low. In audience terms, poetry has long been the literary world\u2019s poor relation, at once revered as high art, the place where language works at its outer limits, and viewed as difficult and (that word again) inaccessible, only touching the lives of the wider public when it was wheeled out to mark births, deaths and marriages.</p> \n<p>At Arts Council England, where I work as director of literature, our mission is \u201cgreat art and culture for everyone\u201d, but the plain fact is that, when it came to poetry, the sector\u2019s success in reaching new audiences has been limited. While there have been moments when it broke through \u2013 via the wildly popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/09/poems-on-the-underground\" title=\"\">Poems on the Underground </a>initiative, for example, and in the form of Bloodaxe Books\u2019 series of bestselling contemporary anthologies, both Arts Council-supported \u2013 these were statistical outliers. As recently as 2012, poetry sales (as reported by industry bible Nielsen Bookscan) appeared to be on an alarming slide\u2019 from a (relative) high of \u00a38.4m in 2009 to a dismal low of \u00a36.4m. Even for poetry - accustomed to existing on short rations - things were looking bleak.</p> \n<p>And yet, beyond the bookshelves, the world was on the move. Smartphones went mainstream, and social media use erupted. Mobile devices apparently offered the perfect vehicle for sharing poems, while spoken word artists found, in YouTube, a means of connecting with new, physically dispersed audiences. Poetry popped up in people\u2019s Facebook feeds, was served to them as they sat on their sofas, and casual readers of the sort Anaxagorou describes were born in abundance. The latest Nielsen figures for 2018 show poetry sales hitting an all-time high of \u00a312.3m \u2013 nearly double what it was in 2012.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8847fc7f-b778-497c-8d63-03509e6399c4\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Born in 1982, Garbutt is from Knottingley, West Yorkshire and has toured with John Cooper Clarke. <i>The Universe and Me</i> is her first collection.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>We\u2019ll Dance to Madonna Like We Used to by Toria Garbutt</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Drugs are fucking everywhere<br>up noses down throats<br>of them who hurt the most<br>them who are lonely<br>and aching and dying to feel loved<br>Drugs feel good<br>in the absence of connection<br>we seek compensation<br>in self medication<br>umbilical sherbet<br>whisky and coke<br>owt to fill the hole<br>and be whole again<br>Drugs are fucking everywhere<br>in lungs in veins<br>in t\u2019blood of those we love and hate<br>at once<br>Those who hunt for smack in daytime<br>top up wi tapped tenners<br>n methadone by twilight<br>or those who live the highlife<br>sniffing charlie in the night time<br>it\u2019s all the same in the end</p>\n    <p>I\u2019ve lost friends and family<br>to the veiled imposter<br>cost me my sister<br>promised you\u2019d look after her<br>dint you?<br>I wish you\u2019d give her back to me<br>it\u2019s fucking sinister<br>watching you eat her alive<br>Drugs feel good<br>in the absence of connection<br>if I open up my arms though<br>will I die of suffocation?<br>I\u2019m barely afloat<br>in my sea of realisation<br>n if I take you in I\u2019ll drown<br>before I\u2019ve reached my destination<br>But I\u2019ll see you there sister<br>You\u2019ll be wild and free<br>floating in on t\u2019sea breeze<br>you\u2019ll reach out to me<br>and we\u2019ll dance to Madonna<br>like we used to</p>\n    <p><i>From The Universe and Me (<a href=\"http://wreckingballpress.com/category/poetry/\">Wrecking Ball</a>)&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If this looks like a sudden and seismic shift \u2013 well, it is, and it isn\u2019t.

But spoken word has far deeper roots, as well as a history of attracting practitioners and audience members from more socially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. <a href=\"https://applesandsnakes.org/\" title=\"\">Apples and Snakes</a>, the UK\u2019s leading spoken word promoter and a member of the Arts Council\u2019s national portfolio of organisations, was founded in a room over a pub back in 1982. Its chief executive, Lisa Mead, points to \u201cyears of grassroots development\u201d, which have led to a sector that has \u201csuccessfully developed a broad range of poets \u2013 from Kate Tempest to Inua Ellams to Debris Stevenson \u2013 and created an appetite among young people to engage with poetry. Without all the graft that\u2019s been put in we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now; current poets have risen on the shoulders of those who went before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anaxagorou agrees, describing a rich hybrid form that draws on \u201cthe dub poetry and live literature movements of the 80s and the slam movement of the 90s\u201d alongside rap music and \u201cAmerican sermonising, which employs language, ideology, performance and intonation \u2026 Today it feels very much like a fusion of different traditions and approaches that all stem from the oral. A highly communicative, informed, visceral way of connecting with people while also keeping them entertained.\u201d</p> \n<p>The raw material has been here for some time; what the internet and social media have done is lift it out of geographical silos and allow anyone, anywhere access to it. But theoretically, haiku and villanelles are just as shareable as Kate Tempest videos.

So why the anxiety? Well, to paraphrase William Gibson, the future may be here, but it\u2019s not evenly distributed. For all the talk of a poetry boom, this appears to be confined primarily to poetry\u2019s new wave; the traditional market remains challenging. Although Paterson reports a rise in poetry sales across the board at Picador, he acknowledges \u201cit hasn\u2019t quite been the tide that\u2019s lifted all boats\u201d. At Carcanet, meanwhile, director Michael Schmidt believes \u201cthe \u2018boom\u2019 is based largely on poetry which originates in the social media, where would-be writers develop a substantial following\u201d.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, while there\u2019s a growing acknowledgement that spoken word poetry deserves its place at the table (Bloodaxe director Neil Astley, who championed many of the original dub poets such as Benjamin Zephaniah and Jean \u201cBinta\u201d Breeze, observes \u201ca real and fluid crossover\u201d between stage and page), the line often seems to be drawn at Instapoetry. \u201cWhat troubles me as a reader and editor,\u201d Schmidt says, \u201cis the privileging of cliche inherent in the movement \u2026 the intolerance of subtlety.\u201d Even Paterson says of Kaur that \u201cshe writes a kind of affirmative sloganeering for folk who don\u2019t really read books \u2013 it clearly does some people a lot of good, so all power to her.\u201d This is not real poetry, runs the theory, and it\u2019s not delivering a crossover audience, either; in fact, according to Astley, \u201cthe more successful Instagram poets\u201d are \u201covershadowing the valuable, edgy, thoughtful and beautifully written real poetry\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3e41ce5a-375a-4bab-97b4-3c6fc4059f2e\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Born in 1986 in London to British and Jamaican parents, Antrobus is a deaf poet whose debut collection, <i>The Perseverance</i>, was a Poetry Book Society choice last year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>I Want the Confidence of by Raymond Antrobus</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Salvador Dali in a 1950s McDonald\u2019s advert,<br>of red gold and green ties<br>on shanty town dapper dandies, of Cuba Gooding Jr.<br>in a strip club shouting <i>SHOW ME THE MONEY</i>,<br>of the woman on her phone in the quiet coach,<br>of knowing you\u2019ll be seen and served,<br>that no one will cross the road when they see you,<br>the sun shining through the gaps in the buildings,<br>a glass ceiling in a restaurant<br>where knives and spoons wink,<br>a polite pint and a cheeky cigarette, tattoos<br>on the arms, trains that blur the whole city without delay.<br>I want the confidence of a coffee bean in the body,<br>a surface that doesn\u2019t need scratching;<br>I want to be fluent in confidence so large it speaks from its own sky.<br>At the airport I want my confidence to board<br>without investigations, to sit in foreign cafe\u0301s<br>without a silver spoon in a teacup clinking<br>into sunken places, of someone named after a saint,<br>of Matthew the deaf footballer who couldn\u2019t hear<br>to pass the ball, but still ran the pitch,<br>of leather jackets and the teeth<br>of hot combs, rollin\u2019 roadmen and rubber.<br>I don\u2019t want my confidence to lie;<br>it has to mean helium balloons in any shape or colour,<br>has to mean rubber tree in rain; make it<br>my sister leaving home for university, my finally sober father,<br>my mother becoming a circus clown.<br>There is such a thing as a key confidently cut<br>that accepts the locks it doesn\u2019t fit.<br>Call it a boy busking on the canal path singing<br>to no one but the bridges<br>and the black water under them.</p>\n    <p><i>From The Perseverance (<a href=\"http://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/\">Penned in the Margins</a>)&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s easy to see how those steeped in decades of writing and editing have come to this conclusion. Yet quite apart from the very real worry about dismissing a form of expression that is produced and consumed overwhelmingly by young women, there\u2019s a danger in writing off any enterprise still in its infancy: if history teaches us anything, it\u2019s that this always comes back to bite you. From modernism to the metaphysicals, there is no form of poetry yet that hasn\u2019t produced great art; it\u2019s hard to imagine Instapoetry won\u2019t, too. In some senses it appears to be doing what YA literature did for the novel: bridging a gap between the already verdant fields of poetry for children and adults. Poetry Society director Judith Palmer points to the society\u2019s 2018 survey of under-18s in which participants expressed their desire \u201cto read poetry that feels like it was written by people like them; it\u2019s no accident that the most successful Instapoets are young women of colour\u201d, but also noted that those surveyed referenced Kaur and Leav in the same breath as Anne Carson, Ocean Vuong, Sylvia Plath and John Keats when asked to name their favourite poets. \u201cYoung people,\u201d she says, \u201care discovering poetry through Instapoetry.\u201d Whether this growth in audiences is sustainable only time will tell, but in the short term it may be worth bearing in mind that a lack of crossover audience works both ways: it\u2019s unlikely readers of traditional poetry are forsaking it for Instagram. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything,\u201d Paterson says, \u201cit\u2019s that I should stop paying lip service to this lazy rubbish about poetry being a broad church. It can be many churches, and we needn\u2019t worship at them all.\u201d</p> \n<p>By taking McNish as the subject of my lecture, I was, in part, asking a question of myself: whether poetry that arose out of social media could hold up under intensive close reading. The answer, in short, was yes. I talked about McNish\u2019s use of conjunctions and repetition; about her deployment of the passive tense; about the way she sets us up to expect one word, and then wrongfoots us with another. As time passes, and the new poets grow older, a critical discourse will develop, and we\u2019ll begin to see a canon emerge. Until then, let\u2019s give the last word to one of them. \u201cSpoken word,\u201d Joelle Taylor says, \u201cis proper poetry. But poetry for the mouth has a different instinct than that for the pen; of equal value, but different. We must be judged on the terms of the chosen expression. Those who undermine the form often reveal an elitist, classist bias \u2013 as seen in their need to define and own poetry. You cannot own an art\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Somewhere towards the end of last year, I stood up in front of 400 or so 17-year-olds to talk about poetry. The lecture was one I\u2019d already given in various guises; a comparative reading of two poems: one canonical, the other contemporary. In the past, I\u2019d compared WB Yeats with Sharon Olds, Helen Dunmore with Tishani Doshi, and John Donne with Tiphanie Yanique. That day, we were back with Donne again: \u201cThe Sun Rising\u201d, one of the language\u2019s greatest love poems, as fresh and exultant now as it was when it was written four centuries ago. But rather than scouring the work of Forward or Pulitzer prize winners to find something to read with it, this time I turned to YouTube. The poem I chose was Hollie McNish\u2019s \u201cWatching Miserable-Looking Couples in the Supermarket\u201d. A few months earlier, McNish had found herself at the centre of a whirlwind, when an argument that had been rumbling for some time behind the poetry world\u2019s tightly closed doors abruptly burst forth in public. McNish \u2013 whose vivid, visceral poems have been watched by millions online \u2013 had won the Ted Hughes award for new work in poetry in 2016 for her debut collection, and subsequently secured a publishing deal for a new book, Plum, with Picador. Plum came out in 2017, was broadly well received, and rapidly became one of the year\u2019s bestselling collections, part of a surge in poetry sales that was spearheaded by Instapoet Rupi Kaur, whose two collections had together sold in the hundreds of thousands. But it wasn\u2019t until January 2018 that Plum made headlines. Rebecca Watts (a prize-shortlisted poet in her own right) was commissioned to review it for poetry journal PN Review, but submitted, instead, an essay in which she decried \u201cthe rise of a cohort of young female poets who are currently being lauded by the poetic establishment for their \u2018honesty\u2019 and \u2018accessibility\u2019 \u2013 buzzwords for the open denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft\u201d. She declined to review Plum on the grounds that \u201cto do so \u2026 would imply that it deserves to be taken seriously as poetry\u201d. It\u2019s a truism that there\u2019s no row like a poetry row. \u201cFor some reason,\u201d says Don Paterson, McNish\u2019s editor at Picador, \u201cpoets saying ungenerous things about each other is considered news, which is pretty funny, given they fight all the time\u201d. But the speed and fury with which this one exploded marked the point at which a formerly nebulous territorial dispute within a small community suddenly hardened, and everyone felt obliged to pick a side. \u201cIn every period you\u2019ve had poets who write what\u2019s seen as being more accessible poetry,\u201d says Anthony Anaxagorou, award-winning slam poet and founder-director of live poetry night Out-Spoken, citing, among others, Charles Bukowski, Maya Angelou and Emily Dickinson. \u201cThe difference now is that things are more democratic. Anyone is free to set up a social media account or website and publish their poems. Gatekeepers traditionally have been responsible for maintaining a sense of quality control, which many feel has diminished since the rise of social media. What you\u2019re left with is a widening chasm. The establishment and the academy have buttressed their positions as \u2018knowers\u2019 of good poetry, resulting in serious readers and writers swaying over to one side, leaving the more casual reader to trundle through the badlands of social media poetry.\u201d At the heart of the dispute was this notion of \u201caccessibility\u201d \u2013 and the question of whether heightened accessibility necessarily involves a blunting of the fine edge that is poetry\u2019s USP. Whatever your view, there\u2019s no doubt that, historically, the number of people accessing poetry has been low. In audience terms, poetry has long been the literary world\u2019s poor relation, at once revered as high art, the place where language works at its outer limits, and viewed as difficult and (that word again) inaccessible, only touching the lives of the wider public when it was wheeled out to mark births, deaths and marriages. At Arts Council England, where I work as director of literature, our mission is \u201cgreat art and culture for everyone\u201d, but the plain fact is that, when it came to poetry, the sector\u2019s success in reaching new audiences has been limited. While there have been moments when it broke through \u2013 via the wildly popular Poems on the Underground initiative, for example, and in the form of Bloodaxe Books\u2019 series of bestselling contemporary anthologies, both Arts Council-supported \u2013 these were statistical outliers. As recently as 2012, poetry sales (as reported by industry bible Nielsen Bookscan) appeared to be on an alarming slide\u2019 from a (relative) high of \u00a38.4m in 2009 to a dismal low of \u00a36.4m. Even for poetry - accustomed to existing on short rations - things were looking bleak. And yet, beyond the bookshelves, the world was on the move. Smartphones went mainstream, and social media use erupted. Mobile devices apparently offered the perfect vehicle for sharing poems, while spoken word artists found, in YouTube, a means of connecting with new, physically dispersed audiences. Poetry popped up in people\u2019s Facebook feeds, was served to them as they sat on their sofas, and casual readers of the sort Anaxagorou describes were born in abundance. The latest Nielsen figures for 2018 show poetry sales hitting an all-time high of \u00a312.3m \u2013 nearly double what it was in 2012. If this looks like a sudden and seismic shift \u2013 well, it is, and it isn\u2019t. The Instapoetry popularised by Kaur, Lang Leav, Nayyirah Waheed and Nikita Gill, among others, is unquestionably a recent phenomenon; Kaur didn\u2019t join Instagram until 2014. But spoken word has far deeper roots, as well as a history of attracting practitioners and audience members from more socially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Apples and Snakes, the UK\u2019s leading spoken word promoter and a member of the Arts Council\u2019s national portfolio of organisations, was founded in a room over a pub back in 1982. Its chief executive, Lisa Mead, points to \u201cyears of grassroots development\u201d, which have led to a sector that has \u201csuccessfully developed a broad range of poets \u2013 from Kate Tempest to Inua Ellams to Debris Stevenson \u2013 and created an appetite among young people to engage with poetry. Without all the graft that\u2019s been put in we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now; current poets have risen on the shoulders of those who went before.\u201d Anaxagorou agrees, describing a rich hybrid form that draws on \u201cthe dub poetry and live literature movements of the 80s and the slam movement of the 90s\u201d alongside rap music and \u201cAmerican sermonising, which employs language, ideology, performance and intonation \u2026 Today it feels very much like a fusion of different traditions and approaches that all stem from the oral. A highly communicative, informed, visceral way of connecting with people while also keeping them entertained.\u201d The raw material has been here for some time; what the internet and social media have done is lift it out of geographical silos and allow anyone, anywhere access to it. But theoretically, haiku and villanelles are just as shareable as Kate Tempest videos. What is it about spoken word that\u2019s captivated contemporary audiences in such numbers? Joelle Taylor is one of slam poetry\u2019s leading lights, and the founder of national youth slam championship SLAMbassadors. As well as acknowledging the form\u2019s availability to her, as a working-class woman (\u201cThere were few opportunities in the area I grew up in to access the arts \u2026 Spoken word allowed me to bypass literary gatekeepers\u201d), she also cites its ability to \u201creach across class and culture to create a community of free thinkers ... In these increasingly dystopian and hostile times, we need that sense of belonging, of thoughtful uprising.\u201d Mead also notes the urgency of \u201cthe current political climate\u201d as an audience driver. \u201cPoets have always been the social commentators of the moment, tuning in to the issues that are bubbling under the surface. Given what\u2019s going on currently, people are looking for someone who\u2019s saying aloud what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d Just as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon articulated the most urgent experiences of their generation in the poetry of the trenches (and were soundly rebuked at the time by Yeats, who declared, in terms that might ring bells for Instapoets, that \u201cpassive suffering is not a theme for poetry\u201d), so today\u2019s young poets are responding passionately to crises in government, finance and the environment. In 2014, Jeremy Paxman, judging the Forward poetry prize, accused poetry of \u201cconniving at its own irrelevance\u201d and lamented its failure \u201cto engage with ordinary people\u201d. Whatever criticisms might be levelled at poetry in 2019, irrelevance is no longer one of them: quite apart from the rise in sales, the most prominent and profound responses to the Manchester terror attack and the Grenfell fire were delivered via poetry. \u201cWe\u2019ll always need poetry, especially at thresholds, in times of difficult transition,\u201d says Paterson. \u201cIf you think this is a boom, wait until you see poetry after a no-deal Brexit.\u201d But what about the fear that this broadening of the artform is diminishing its excellence? The poetry world\u2019s prize givers appear to be taking, if anything, the opposite view. In 2018, Jay Bernard won the Ted Hughes prize with an hour-long performance, \u201cSurge: Side A\u201d, on the 1981 New Cross fire. The Forward prize, meanwhile, formerly won by the likes of Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes and Alice Oswald, was awarded to Danez Smith, who started life as a performance poet. \u201cThe media may have focused on Smith\u2019s youth, gender, race and background,\u201d says Susannah Herbert, executive director of the Forward Arts Foundation, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t win for any of these: their book was judged the best collection of the year because it expands the language and nourishes the imagination. This is skilful, closely worked and inspired poetry. It\u2019s built to last.\u201d Linton Kwesi Johnson, regarded by many as the father of modern spoken word, was originally derided by the establishment; a Spectator profile claimed his poetry had \u201cwreaked havoc in schools and helped to create a generation of rioters and illiterates\u201d. In 2002, he became only the second living poet to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. \u201cI like to think,\u201d he says now, \u201cthat for the generation who came after me, some of them thought, \u2018Bloody hell, if that geezer can do it so can I.\u2019\u201d As Paterson argues, \u201cI think you\u2019re obliged to make some account of what the culture regards as important \u2013 or at least learn to distinguish between not liking something and not understanding it. I used to think I didn\u2019t like performance poetry. But if an activity is widespread and clearly involves a lot of intelligent people \u2013 you\u2019re the problem.\u201d The world is changing; mediums are evolving; and the language and content of poetry is shifting, too, to accommodate this. So why the anxiety? Well, to paraphrase William Gibson, the future may be here, but it\u2019s not evenly distributed. For all the talk of a poetry boom, this appears to be confined primarily to poetry\u2019s new wave; the traditional market remains challenging. Although Paterson reports a rise in poetry sales across the board at Picador, he acknowledges \u201cit hasn\u2019t quite been the tide that\u2019s lifted all boats\u201d. At Carcanet, meanwhile, director Michael Schmidt believes \u201cthe \u2018boom\u2019 is based largely on poetry which originates in the social media, where would-be writers develop a substantial following\u201d. What\u2019s more, while there\u2019s a growing acknowledgement that spoken word poetry deserves its place at the table (Bloodaxe director Neil Astley, who championed many of the original dub poets such as Benjamin Zephaniah and Jean \u201cBinta\u201d Breeze, observes \u201ca real and fluid crossover\u201d between stage and page), the line often seems to be drawn at Instapoetry. \u201cWhat troubles me as a reader and editor,\u201d Schmidt says, \u201cis the privileging of cliche inherent in the movement \u2026 the intolerance of subtlety.\u201d Even Paterson says of Kaur that \u201cshe writes a kind of affirmative sloganeering for folk who don\u2019t really read books \u2013 it clearly does some people a lot of good, so all power to her.\u201d This is not real poetry, runs the theory, and it\u2019s not delivering a crossover audience, either; in fact, according to Astley, \u201cthe more successful Instagram poets\u201d are \u201covershadowing the valuable, edgy, thoughtful and beautifully written real poetry\u201d. It\u2019s easy to see how those steeped in decades of writing and editing have come to this conclusion. Yet quite apart from the very real worry about dismissing a form of expression that is produced and consumed overwhelmingly by young women, there\u2019s a danger in writing off any enterprise still in its infancy: if history teaches us anything, it\u2019s that this always comes back to bite you. From modernism to the metaphysicals, there is no form of poetry yet that hasn\u2019t produced great art; it\u2019s hard to imagine Instapoetry won\u2019t, too. In some senses it appears to be doing what YA literature did for the novel: bridging a gap between the already verdant fields of poetry for children and adults. Poetry Society director Judith Palmer points to the society\u2019s 2018 survey of under-18s in which participants expressed their desire \u201cto read poetry that feels like it was written by people like them; it\u2019s no accident that the most successful Instapoets are young women of colour\u201d, but also noted that those surveyed referenced Kaur and Leav in the same breath as Anne Carson, Ocean Vuong, Sylvia Plath and John Keats when asked to name their favourite poets. \u201cYoung people,\u201d she says, \u201care discovering poetry through Instapoetry.\u201d Whether this growth in audiences is sustainable only time will tell, but in the short term it may be worth bearing in mind that a lack of crossover audience works both ways: it\u2019s unlikely readers of traditional poetry are forsaking it for Instagram. \u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything,\u201d Paterson says, \u201cit\u2019s that I should stop paying lip service to this lazy rubbish about poetry being a broad church. It can be many churches, and we needn\u2019t worship at them all.\u201d By taking McNish as the subject of my lecture, I was, in part, asking a question of myself: whether poetry that arose out of social media could hold up under intensive close reading. The answer, in short, was yes. I talked about McNish\u2019s use of conjunctions and repetition; about her deployment of the passive tense; about the way she sets us up to expect one word, and then wrongfoots us with another. As time passes, and the new poets grow older, a critical discourse will develop, and we\u2019ll begin to see a canon emerge. Until then, let\u2019s give the last word to one of them. \u201cSpoken word,\u201d Joelle Taylor says, \u201cis proper poetry. But poetry for the mouth has a different instinct than that for the pen; of equal value, but different. We must be judged on the terms of the chosen expression. Those who undermine the form often reveal an elitist, classist bias \u2013 as seen in their need to define and own poetry. You cannot own an art\u201d.",

Their destination was a sports centre-turned-migrant camp to visit people they\u2019d met travelling north with a caravan of other Central Americans. Two of them never returned: the bodies of Jasson Ricardo Acu\u00f1a Polanco and Jorge Alexander Ruiz Duban, 16 and 17, were found the following morning; three people were arrested for their murder. The boys were tricked, abducted, tortured and killed; the survivor escaped with wounds to his throat from attempted strangulation and remains acutely traumatised. The horrific murder brings into brutal focus the vulnerability of migrants forced to \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d under the new US policy for asylum seekers. On a recent visit to Tijuana, Unicef\u2019s deputy representative in Mexico, Pressia Arifin Cabo said that migrant children must be protected from danger \u2013 on both sides of the border. \u201cMigration is not a crime, and many of these adolescents are travelling alone, unsure of what to do,\u201d she said.

She told us where the house was, and there we found one man who took us to the other guy.\u201d The woman and two men were arrested and charged with abduction and murder. Because the victims were from the migrant caravan, the killings have drawn rare attention in Tijuana \u2013 where such deaths usually fail to turn a head. Local human rights activists have linked the double murder to a growing hostility towards Central Americans that has grown in Tijuana since the migrant caravans first arrived last year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think that a climate of xenophobia promoted by the state\u2019s own institutions is not a breeding ground for this type of action\u201d, said the president of the Baja California State Commission for Human Rights, Melba Adriana Olvera Rodr\u00edguez, citing what she called inflammatory language by municipal leaders. Prosecutor \u00c1lvarez insists the deaths reflect the spiraling violence which has afflicted Tijuana: 2,502 were killed in the city last year \u2013 a rate of 126 per 100,000 inhabitants. \u201cThese were small-time drug dealers working the street, themselves intoxicated. These terrible murders illustrate the social decomposition we see in Tijuana,\u201d he said. Both men arrested have records of drug dealing, and admitted low-level connections with cartels. \u201cAt the root of this are drugs\u201d, says \u00c1lvarez, \u201cbut most of the murders now are by petty drug-dealers; people fighting for turf for the domestic market in methamphetamine. \u201c[This case] has attracted attention because the victims were from the caravan. If they had not been, no one would know about this \u2013 they would probably be just two more murder victims in Tijuana.\u201d Weeks after the murders, the YMCA shelter is still in shock; most of the youngsters here remember the victims well. \u201cThey were the same as us, who came here hungry and thirsty,\u201d says one boy, Jos\u00e9. \u201cWe came for lack of work and because gangs back home threaten you with death to get money even if it\u2019s just a few pennies .\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez fears for the safety of the surviving boy. \u201cThe kidnappers threatened to kill him if he spoke. He just wants to get the hell out of Mexico, but cannot until they have closed the case,\u201d he said. Local authorities say L\u00e1zaro will have to testify, but after that there is no guarantee the boy will be granted asylum in the US. There is s a cruel final twist to the tragedy. On Monday 17 December, two Californian congress members, Nanette Barrag\u00e1n and Jimmy G\u00f3mez, came to Tijuana, to join a protest against US authorities\u2019 refusal to allow asylum seekers to make their claim, as is their right under US and international law.

      "body": "<p><em>Over the course of several months, a team at Guardian Australia built the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/deaths-inside\">Deaths Inside</a> project, which collated all available data to build a definitive, searchable database cataloguing the 147 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died in custody between 2008 and 2018. Many died from treatable medical conditions, and more than half had </em><em>not been convicted of a crime.</em> <em>In response to the systemic failures exposed by this investigation, Aboriginal leaders have called for an immediate review of the \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d numbers of Indigenous deaths in custody, and are demanding Australia develop an independent system for monitoring them as a priority.</em><br><br>The project was speerheaded by <em><strong>Lorena Alla</strong></em><em><strong>m, </strong>the Guardian\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, in close collaboration with <strong>Nick Evershed, </strong>the data and interactives editor for Guardian Australia and <strong>Calla Wahlquist</strong>, one of Guardian</em><em> Australia\u2019s reporters.</em></p> <h2><strong>Wahlquist was covering </strong><strong>the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/15/weve-got-to-put-our-story-out-there-ms-dhus-family-prepare-for-verdict-on-death-in-custody\">inquest into the death of an Indigenous woman</a></strong><strong> who died while in police custody for unpaid fines. </strong></h2> <p>\u201cWhen the coronial inquest into the death of a Yamatji woman, known as Ms Dhu, began in November 2015, we decided it would be helpful, for context, to put a line in our coverage explaining how many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had died in custody since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody produced its final report in April 1991.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/28/the-147-dead-indigenous-leaders-demand-action-over-unacceptable-deaths-in-custody\">The 147 dead: terrible toll of Indigenous deaths in custody spurs calls for reform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMiss Dhu, who was 22 when she died in police custody in Port Hedland on 4 August 2014, was born six months after that final report was published. She had been jailed for unpaid fines, a practice the royal commission recommended be abolished. How many had died between the publication date and her birth? How many more had died between her death and the opening of the inquest? We assumed there would be a list. There was not.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the time I was covering the inquest I began emailing every police and corrective services department in Australia to learn how many Indigenous people had died in custody since the publication of the most recent Australian Institute of Criminology report on deaths in custody, which at that stage only covered until July 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"706926a65c2d456a03227e47ee5af610579d9992\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/706926a65c2d456a03227e47ee5af610579d9992/0_175_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ms Dhu\u2019s grandmother, Carol Roe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ms Dhu\u2019s grandmother, Carol Roe, outside Perth magistrates court before the resumption of the inquest on Monday 14 March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Calla Wahlquist/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI also had a chance to speak to some leading deaths-in-custody campaigners, who were in the courtroom alongside me. None of them knew of a national register that individually listed every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person who had died in custody and set out the circumstances surrounding their death, but all said they wanted that resource. A few had plans to develop it but had run out of resources \u2013 the research task is immense and never-ending if you intend to keep updating the list.</p> <p>\u201cTogether with those contacts, I pulled together a list of all deaths in custody that we were aware of, and that list became the basis for Deaths Inside.</p> <p>\u201cA key problem was that corrections departments had stopped issuing media releases following a death in custody, and instead only confirmed the details of a death when asked. That meant that, unless a family member had contacted either the media or an advocacy group, many deaths went unmarked until the official figures came out. That, coupled with the extreme delay between death and inquest in Western Australia \u2013 we found an average of 2.5 years until the start of the inquest, and another three months for the findings \u2013 meant that the public perception of the issue was limited to those few high-profile cases that captured media attention.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Allam </strong><strong>helped to collate the information</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt was a bigger task than we had anticipated. We originally wanted to record every Indigenous death in custody since the royal commission ended in 1991, but we soon realised that was beyond our capacity, partly because of the volume of work involved but mainly because official monitoring had fallen away. That in itself underscored the need for our investigation: so many statistics were out of date, or not even collected.</p> <p>\u201cSo, we looked at the past 10 years of coronial data, from 2008-2018. To do that, we had to compile coronial findings from every Australian jurisdiction as well as track media reports or press releases from custodial agencies.</p> <p>\u201cWe read, checked and recorded every coronial finding relating to an Indigenous death in custody from 2008 onwards, as well as cases that are still awaiting inquest. For 2010-2015, we also collected information on every single death in custody in order to have a large enough sample size to produce meaningful analysis.</p> <p>\u201cWe examined 463 cases, 147 of which concerned an Indigenous person. We have determined that in the 30 years since the royal commission there have been more than 407 Indigenous deaths in custody.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2018/jul/13/breathless-episode-1-death-david-dungay-jr-podcast\">Breathless, episode 1: The death in custody of David Dungay \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe checked each case against a number of data points, such as age, gender, whether a person was on remand or sentenced, the kind of charges they faced, whether they had health or mental health issues and whether these were managed or even acknowledged, whether force was used by authorities and whether police and prisons followed their own procedures.

      "bodyText": "Over the course of several months, a team at Guardian Australia built the Deaths Inside project, which collated all available data to build a definitive, searchable database cataloguing the 147 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died in custody between 2008 and 2018. Many died from treatable medical conditions, and more than half had not been convicted of a crime. In response to the systemic failures exposed by this investigation, Aboriginal leaders have called for an immediate review of the \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d numbers of Indigenous deaths in custody, and are demanding Australia develop an independent system for monitoring them as a priority. The project was speerheaded by Lorena Allam, the Guardian\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, in close collaboration with Nick Evershed, the data and interactives editor for Guardian Australia and Calla Wahlquist, one of Guardian Australia\u2019s reporters. Wahlquist was covering the inquest into the death of an Indigenous woman who died while in police custody for unpaid fines. \u201cWhen the coronial inquest into the death of a Yamatji woman, known as Ms Dhu, began in November 2015, we decided it would be helpful, for context, to put a line in our coverage explaining how many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had died in custody since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody produced its final report in April 1991. \u201cMiss Dhu, who was 22 when she died in police custody in Port Hedland on 4 August 2014, was born six months after that final report was published. She had been jailed for unpaid fines, a practice the royal commission recommended be abolished. How many had died between the publication date and her birth? How many more had died between her death and the opening of the inquest? We assumed there would be a list. There was not. \u201cDuring the time I was covering the inquest I began emailing every police and corrective services department in Australia to learn how many Indigenous people had died in custody since the publication of the most recent Australian Institute of Criminology report on deaths in custody, which at that stage only covered until July 2013. \u201cI also had a chance to speak to some leading deaths-in-custody campaigners, who were in the courtroom alongside me. None of them knew of a national register that individually listed every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person who had died in custody and set out the circumstances surrounding their death, but all said they wanted that resource. A few had plans to develop it but had run out of resources \u2013 the research task is immense and never-ending if you intend to keep updating the list. \u201cTogether with those contacts, I pulled together a list of all deaths in custody that we were aware of, and that list became the basis for Deaths Inside. \u201cA key problem was that corrections departments had stopped issuing media releases following a death in custody, and instead only confirmed the details of a death when asked. That meant that, unless a family member had contacted either the media or an advocacy group, many deaths went unmarked until the official figures came out. That, coupled with the extreme delay between death and inquest in Western Australia \u2013 we found an average of 2.5 years until the start of the inquest, and another three months for the findings \u2013 meant that the public perception of the issue was limited to those few high-profile cases that captured media attention.\u201d Allam helped to collate the information \u201cIt was a bigger task than we had anticipated. We originally wanted to record every Indigenous death in custody since the royal commission ended in 1991, but we soon realised that was beyond our capacity, partly because of the volume of work involved but mainly because official monitoring had fallen away. That in itself underscored the need for our investigation: so many statistics were out of date, or not even collected. \u201cSo, we looked at the past 10 years of coronial data, from 2008-2018. To do that, we had to compile coronial findings from every Australian jurisdiction as well as track media reports or press releases from custodial agencies. \u201cWe read, checked and recorded every coronial finding relating to an Indigenous death in custody from 2008 onwards, as well as cases that are still awaiting inquest. For 2010-2015, we also collected information on every single death in custody in order to have a large enough sample size to produce meaningful analysis. \u201cWe examined 463 cases, 147 of which concerned an Indigenous person. We have determined that in the 30 years since the royal commission there have been more than 407 Indigenous deaths in custody. \u201cWe checked each case against a number of data points, such as age, gender, whether a person was on remand or sentenced, the kind of charges they faced, whether they had health or mental health issues and whether these were managed or even acknowledged, whether force was used by authorities and whether police and prisons followed their own procedures. This last criterion was important because the royal commission handed down many recommendations to improve custodial procedures more than 30 years ago. \u201cThe most important thing we did was work with families, their legal representatives and others \u2013 NGOs, criminologists \u2013 to make sure our work was carried out sensitively, that our access and sharing of the information was done with the full permission and support of bereaved families, and was presented in a way that did not exacerbate trauma for anyone who chose to click through to the database. \u201cSo many of the families we worked with were so generous with their time and support. They continue to advocate for their loved ones in the face of institutional neglect and indifference. The old saying is \u2018justice delayed is justice denied\u2019, and I think that holds true for many of the people we met while doing this project.\u201d Evershed faced the challenge of making the data make sense \u201cIn some ways our analysis cemented what people familiar with the deaths in custody either knew or suspected, but seeing the stark difference in treatment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people was still shocking. \u201cWe showed that Indigenous people were dying in custody of preventable conditions, and they were less likely than non-Indigenous people to get all the medical care they needed. Official procedures were less likely to be followed in cases involving Indigenous people. Mental health or cognitive impairment was a factor in many cases. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges came in how we presented these results. All too often data analysis and visualisation can result in distancing the reader from the people underlying the statistics. We wanted to address this with a design that would present the results of our investigation in a way that would communicate the broader trends while still preserving the humanity of the people involved. \u201cWe built on top of our previous work on visual databases to try to incorporate more human elements to the design, hopefully providing a reminder that each case represents a human life.\u201d Wahlquist explains the impact the project had in Australia \u201cWe expected that the project would be picked up by advocates and by family members who would be able to use the database to find common themes within cases and to find precedents for what had happened to their loved ones. From day one, we heard from families, community advocacy groups and academics about how they intended to make use of the resource. \u201cBut we also heard from lawyers, including the heads of Aboriginal legal services around the country, who said they planned to use the database to build cases for coronial inquests, find examples of recommendations that had been made when similar deaths occurred in other jurisdictions, and also provide evidence of the scale of the problem. \u201cOne of the challenges that lawyers in death-in-custody inquests often face is getting the court to tackle the systemic issues when the institutions responsible insist it is an isolated case.

      "bodyText": "With both sides on the losing side of the four previous W-League championship deciders it was always going to be a story of huge disappointment for one side, and huge relief for the other. With their dominance in midfield and their pace and guile down the flanks, Sydney FC were arguably deserved winners - and despite the heroics of Sam Kerr up front, Perth will no doubt draw some solace from the fact that were beaten by an excellent team today. Few disappointed in Sky Blue today, with Savannah McCaskill starring up front with a clever brace, aided by two excellent strikes from compatriot Sofia Huerta and Matilda Chloe Logarzo. Kerr did manage her 17th goal of the season - albeit from the penalty spot - and Alyssa Mautz\u2019s 68th minute goal did threaten to make for a lively finish at 3-2. But Sydney FC ultimately with too much. A fine team effort and a well-earned third championship for the club that has been there or there abouts since the league\u2019s establishment eleven season ago. And from our eyes at the ground - here\u2019s Martin Farrer\u2019s match report: 90 + 3 min: And there it is! A record-equalling third W-League championship for Sydney FC, and you\u2019d have to say - on the balance of play, a result that was well-deserved for the home side. A pump of the fist for coach Ante Juric. His players celebrate - they\u2019ve seen off Sam Kerr and this brave Perth Glory outfit. Who for the third time in five years have made it to the Big Dance, but go home empty handed. 90 min: So for all the miracles we\u2019ve seen from her - not even Sam Kerr it appears can prevent this terrific team effort from Sydney FC today. They\u2019ve looked good for their lead, and surely - just surely - they\u2019ve done enough here to secure this? 88 min: Bledsoe with a good claim in the Sydney goal. It\u2019s not often two \u2018keepers cop six goals between them in a final - but you\u2019d have to say, there were plenty that they couldn\u2019t have done much about, such have been the calibre of some of the strikes today. 86 min: Kerr still working hard, and she\u2019s picked out Mautz at the far post, but she\u2019s strayed marginally offside. Bledsoe scrambling well to save the header in any case. Still, a warning shot for a tiring Sydney FC defence. 83 min: De Vanna looks to spark something, but she loses her footing in the box, the veteran. Remarkably, she hasn\u2019t scored this entire W-League campaign. Would a goal do her confidence a world of good, in this World Cup year? 80 min: Owie! It\u2019s a heavy contact from the substitute Moreno who catches Logarzo sharply on the ankle. This would be a horror blow to the talented Matildas if this proves serious. Hopefully she\u2019s okay. She heads to the sideline but in a fair degree of discomfort. Fingers crossed that doesn\u2019t have any affect on her prospects for the forthcoming Cup of Nations tournament. Amy Harrison comes on to replace Logarzo. 77 min: Kerr looks to twist and turn, and fashion something to spark her side. But once again Kennedy has her covered. The lanky defender steps in bravely, and she\u2019s snuffed out the danger once again. 75 min: And if you thought the goal threat was over - Sydney FC have gone to the bench, and who else? It\u2019s Lisa De Vanna who enters the fray! This absolute legend of women\u2019s football - can she add her stamp to Sydney\u2019s dominance today? 72 min: So a crowd of over 6,000 in at Kogarah today - and what a feast they\u2019ve been treated to. The highest goal tally in W-League grand final history, and we\u2019ve still got 20-odd minutes to play in this one. Don\u2019t. Look. Away. 70 min: My, oh my! We\u2019ve scarcely had time for the restart and Sydney FC have restored their two-goal buffer. It\u2019s a belter from Logarzo - Campbell with no chance - that\u2019s top bins! Excellent work in the build up from McCaskill who whips a hopeful ball into the mix from an acute angle. It\u2019s only partially cleared, and from outside the box, it\u2019s fiercely whipped by Sydney FC midfielder. She\u2019s just signed a new WNSL contract this week - now a goal in the final! Take a bow, Chloe Logarzo. 68 min: She\u2019s been overshadowed by her compatriot Hill, but when it\u2019s matter most it\u2019s Mautz her stands up! Stanton with a clever ball from the corner, it curls away from the defenders and Mautz chips it brilliantly. It just evades the fingertips of Bledsoe - and do we have a game on again?! 65 min: It\u2019s a terrific combination between Hill and Kerr - the US forward drops deep to spark the transition attack, and but for a better final ball from Kerr and that could have ended in a goal! Still, they\u2019ve earned the corner. What can they make from it? 63 min: More excellent work from Huerta, she\u2019s really running the show from right back. She jinks round her marker and fires a fierce ball across the face of goal - but no-one anticipates the ball and it flashes into touch. Lovely stuff. 59 min: Eek. Perth failing to clear their lines and it\u2019s the false nine McCaskill who\u2019s first to react. She pounces and hits a smart shot across Campbell - and inside an hour, they\u2019ve hit three! Big test of character for Kerr and her chargers. Can they come back from this? 56 min: Sydney FC with a corner - they\u2019re enjoying another spell of ascendancy here, the hosts and they probe with a corner. Nobody on the end of it, but they\u2019re ratcheting the pressure over the past 5-10 minutes or so. 54 min: Freekick to Sydney FC, it\u2019s almost miss-hit but Logarzo adjusts well with a clever backheel and almost conjures something from nothing. The Glory defence scrambles well to block though. 51 min: Tremendous work from Ibini who has a teammate pull away a defender with a clever run. And the wide forward jinks inside and curls an effort that sees Campbell scrambling. Great strike, great save. Great football. 48 min: Lovely build up here from Sydney FC. Kennedy is harried by Kerr but she plays calmly back to her \u2018keeper and the play out well. Polias starts a move, Huerta pushes forward and McCaskill drops well to receive. So fluid and they\u2019re pulling the Glory all over the park. 45 min: And it\u2019s Sydney FC\u2019s turn to get us underway. And they straight away begin to torment Gale at left back, and a spinning ball almost finds its way through to Foord in the box but Campbell is swiftly off her line to pounce and claim the loose ball. A great crowd in here, in Sydney\u2019s south. Many families taking this one in from the hill, blanket and picnic basket style - great to see. We\u2019re not too far away, as the players return to the pitch. So, your thoughts on that half? Who impressed in particular? Where was it shaded? And what changes can either coach make to swing this contest towards their side? Shoot me an email or tweet to join the conversation. 45 min: So, one last chance for the visitors, as Glory win a freekick in a handy area. It\u2019s a bit too deep for the direct shot so Stanton looks to find a teammate. Mautz looks to get on the end of it, but she can\u2019t generate the power. And there\u2019s the whistle. A frenetic first forty-five, blink and you\u2019d miss it, and how about some of those strikes! An exciting opening stanza - what more awaits after the break? 43 min: Fine work from Kennedy once again, as she stands strong in a one-on-one with Kerr. What a battle that is between the two Matilda stars. Perth looking to strike straight back just before the break, but the FC centre back anticipates the danger. 40 min: They are not interesting in scoring rubbish goals today, Sydney FC - how bout that! It\u2019s a cross from Foord who hits her target perfectly - McCaskill from just outside the 18 yard box cranes the neck and adds just a bit of heat to the ball - and she guides a superb looping header over Campbell in the Perth goal! Terrific goal - what intelligence, what finesse. 39 min: Ally Green enjoying a few runs down the left - we were expecting she\u2019d have her hands full marshaling Hill and/or Mautz, but the fullback is also enjoying some big forward runs with the ball. She gets past two, but her cross evades a teammate. 35 min: Terrific tackle from Kennedy! She\u2019s watching Kerr like a hawk, and it was a clever run from the Glory talisman, but the Sydney stopper didn\u2019t give her an inch. It\u2019s swung round this one, with Perth enjoying a few moments on transition to threaten the FC goal. 33 min: Sharp save from Bledsoe from the boot of Kerr. Perth take the direct approach with Hill nodding a well-cushioned ball back to her strike partner. The Fremantle Flyer controls well with the chest before snapping a shot, but it\u2019s well-held. Good defensive work from Huerta who shadowed the run and pushed Kerr a little wide. 30 min: A shout from the visiting fans for a second penalty - Hill going to ground after a shove, but it\u2019s perhaps just outside the box, and the American striker was a touch light on her feet. Big task for the Glory three in midfield - against Polias, Colaprico and Logarzo, they\u2019ll have a huge challenge getting their foot on the ball and trying to dictate the tempo. 27 min: So a nerve-settler for the women from the West, who having been largely on the back foot for a third of this contest, find themselves once again at parity. They drop a touch deeper and look to hit FC on the counter. Sydney will have to be careful not to push too far forward - if anyone can hit fast it\u2019s Rachel Hill and Sam Kerr. 23 min: A brave effort from Aubrey Bledsoe in the Sydney goal, but she can\u2019t stop the strike from Kerr. From nothing, they\u2019ve got a lifeline. That\u2019s the danger of Kerr - just the smallest whisker of an opportunity, and she\u2019s drawn her team level! Game on. 21 min: My oh my - we\u2019ve got a penalty!! It\u2019s a loose ball in a dangerous area, Kerr is first in to nip it off the toes of Polias, and her Chicago teammate, the American Colaprico, has caught the star striker in the box! It\u2019s as clear a pen as you\u2019ll see anywhere - Kerr just too quick! 18 min: Kennedy strikes it okay - but it sails high over the bar! Let off for the visitors. Can they build into this match from here? They\u2019re on the back foot, the Glory. It\u2019s a very impressive start from the home side. 17 min: Caitlin Foord now wriggling and weaving to the delight of the home crowd. Sydney FC with a fortuitous freekick - right in \u201cAlanna Kennedy territory\u201d for a tackle from Rigby on Colaprico that on second view could have perhaps gone either way. What can the centre back / set piece wizard conjure here? 12 min: It\u2019s a big, and a vocal crowd, in at Kogarah in Sydney\u2019s south, and they\u2019d be very pleased with what they\u2019ve seen so far. Ibini once again is able to isolate her fullback and fires in a cross - but this time it\u2019s too big for the late-arriving Huerta at the far post. 10 min: So. Not the start Bobby Despotovski and her chargers would have wanted, but you\u2019ll recall they did fall behind very early on against the Victory in the semi-final and managed to find their way back (and how). It\u2019s that odd dilemma in football sometimes, but have Sydney FC scored too early? Surely, they won\u2019t risk taking the foot off the pedal. Surely. 6 min: Ooooph! She\u2019s got a foot like a traction engine! What an absolute belter of a strike from the US international, Sofia Huerta! She made the topscorer list in the WNSL last season, but lines up in the less familiar position of right back for Sydney. But she\u2019s finished like a striker there - that\u2019s surely one of the goals of the season; and on the biggest stage of them all! What a goal. Clever lay-off from McCaskill, and the right back strikes it sweetly from about 25m out, and it goes like a tracer bullet into the top righthand corner. Magic. 4 min: A first look at Sam Kerr in full flight as she darts forward with intent, looking to combine with her partner in crime Rachel Hill. It doesn\u2019t end in a shot, but a first warning sign that they will attack with pace and purpose on the transition, the Glory. 2 min: Crossbar!! A flying start from the home side - Ibini does well to beat her marker down the left and looks to fire a cross in. The Glory defence looked odd-on to clear but Savannah McCaskill steals in on the blind side of her marker, Jamie-Lee Gale, but she thumps her first-time volley against the crossbar! Eliza Campbell between the sticks no chance - what a near thing for the hosts! 1 min: And we\u2019re away! The youngster Leticia McKenna kicks us off for the Glory and they look to attack from the get-go. Our players are out on the pitch, as we observe the national anthem. Your predictions? On paper, Sydney FC might just shade it position by position across the XI. But then you\u2019d have said the same last weekend for Melbourne Victory. Sam Kerr is of course the biggest X-factor of the lot, but in Caitlin Foord, Princess Ibini and Lisa De Vanna the Sky Blues aren\u2019t short of firepower themselves. Canberra United\u2019s coach Heather Garriock has a simple prediction: GOALS GOALS GOALS! It\u2019s like Norman May has turned his hand to women\u2019s football. So, to team news - and there\u2019s only one change for both the squads that won their respective semi-finals: young Julie Vignes is the unlucky one to miss out as she gives way to the returning Lisa De Vanna for Sydney FC. Here\u2019s how the home side will line up: And the visiting side: And not one to revel in the mistakes of other media outlets, this from Channel 9 was one hell of a scoop - with Sydney FC\u2019s coach Ante Juric being mistaken linked with the vacant Matildas head coach role - a position The Australian\u2019s Ray Gatt has reported has been offered to former Socceroos assistant, Ante Milicic. As they say, if my Ante was my uncle.. He\u2019s a good natured man, hopefully the Sydney FC boss has seen the lighter side of it all. And if you missed that dramatic semi-final match between Perth Glory and Melbourne Victory, do yourself a favour a whizz through our liveblog, here: I\u2019m honestly struggling to remember a more exciting W-League clash; especially in a finals series. And while players like Shannon May, Leticia McKenna and Rachel Hill played more than their part for the Glory, it really was all about one woman - the irrepressible Samantha Kerr: \u201cIt\u2019s the premier fixture in the women\u2019s domestic football calendar, but a casual internet search would return scant details about this Saturday night\u2019s W-League final, amid the thousands of thunderous column inches and general vitriol engulfing the women\u2019s game right now.\u201d So started my column yesterday previewing today\u2019s W-League championship decider, and while that has lamentably been the case amid the continued fallout from the sacking of Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, today - finally - is all about the football. Today\u2019s teams Sydney FC and Perth Glory share the remarkable distinction of having been on the losing end of the last four championship deciders - necessarily that sequence ends for one club today. In one of the tightest competitions in recent memory, both sides technically only qualified for the final series on goal difference - but the performance Perth put in to vanquish premiers Melbourne Victory in a remarkable 4-2 semi-final win makes the side from the West very worthy participants. Sydney too were good value despite a late scare up in Queensland to down premiership runners-up Brisbane Roar 2-1, so we should be set for a cracker today. Remarkable match ups all over the pitch will be the feature today, as Matildas teammates turn rivals - none better than Sam Kerr v Alanna Kennedy, where one of the world\u2019s best defenders is tasked with marking one of the world\u2019s top strikers. At the other end the experienced former Matildas Kim Carroll will need to marshall her forces well to keep Caitlin Foord quiet; and if that\u2019s not daunting enough, throw in the lively Princess Ibini as well as the late news that Lisa De Vanna has passed a fitness test and could take some part, and it makes for a nervy day for the Glory backline. Socceroos teammates Bobby Despotovski and Ante Juric have both tasted defeat in a W-League final, but the former friends turn adversaries today, knowing to the victor, the spoils. A tantalising prospect awaits therefore - don\u2019t miss a beat, here, on our W-League final liveblog!",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Scott is keen to get rid of me. He is about to have his picture taken and has come over paralysingly self-conscious. The stylist walks over and whispers in my ear. \u201cAndrew says you don\u2019t have to be here,\u201d she says. That\u2019s fine, I reply, I\u2019ll just get on with my own stuff. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201che doesn\u2019t want you here.\u201d Oh.</p> <p>I withdraw into a freezing studio next door, a little hurt, and use the time to watch the end of one of Scott\u2019s forthcoming films, <a href=\"http://film.britishcouncil.org/steel-country\" title=\"\">Steel Country</a>, in which the actor plays an obsessive, possibly autistic sanitation truck driver determined to investigate the death of a child. About 40 minutes later, Scott emerges. Now he is not only paralysingly self-conscious, he\u2019s desperately apologetic. \u201cSorry, I hope they didn\u2019t\u2026 I said, \u2018Simon doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to be here,\u2019 and then they\u2026 anyway, sorry.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a classic Scott sentence. Put somebody else\u2019s words into his mouth (Shakespeare, say) and his delivery is magical: that singsong Dublin accent changing pitch by the word, that wonderful ability to make the prosaic poetic and vice versa. But put his own words into his mouth and he splutters and stalls like an old banger cranking up in a deep chill. Sentences drift off into the ether, and often have no middle; sometimes it\u2019s hard to work out where or why they began.</p> <p>Scott asks me what I\u2019m watching. Steel Country, I say. He shrieks in shock. \u201cOh Jesus! Really? How did you get it?\u201d He\u2019s so discombobulated that he runs off to the toilet, possibly for good.</p> <p>When he returns, he fiddles with the heating before settling down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re watching that film. That\u2019s extraordinary. I don\u2019t even know when it\u2019s coming out.\u201d I just asked for a preview copy, I say. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice of you, thank you.\u201d He is scrupulously polite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49476b5c7977262248fc849de9753b9a42697534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49476b5c7977262248fc849de9753b9a42697534/0_152_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott as the priest in Fleabag with Phoebe Waller-Bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott as the subversive priest in Fleabag with Phoebe Waller-Bridge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sherlock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though he doesn\u2019t like to dwell on it, Scott is probably still best known for his role as Moriarty in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/sherlock-episode-recaps\" title=\"\">TV series Sherlock</a>. Until he arrived, the show was all about the eponymous hero, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch\" title=\"\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>; Scott, working his sweet, boyish face into a kind of crazed malevolence, provided Sherlock with the five-star foe he deserved \u2013 an evil genius who promises his arch enemy, \u201cI will burn the heart out of you.\u201d In their final face-off, the two men stare into each other\u2019s eyes and acknowledge they are identikit sociopaths \u2013 even if the detective is ostensibly on the side of the angels. </p> <p>Now Scott is back on television in a role likely to define him in a very different way. He plays a priest in the second series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/fleabag-a-hilarious-sitcom-about-terrible-people-and-broken-lives\" title=\"\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag</a>, the comedy-drama about a young woman trying to navigate sex, family dysfunction, loss and life. Series one, for which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\" title=\"\">Waller-Bridge</a> won a Bafta, ended with Fleabag broke and broken, and the revelation that she was responsible for her best friend\u2019s death. Series two, which also features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/24/kristin-scott-thomas-fleabag-phoebe-waller-bridge\" title=\"\">Kristin Scott Thomas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fiona-shaw\" title=\"\">Fiona Shaw</a>, begins 371 days, 19 hours and 26 minutes later. Fleabag\u2019s browbeaten father (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bill-paterson\" title=\"\">Bill Paterson</a>) and her monstrous stepmother (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/olivia-colman\" title=\"\">Olivia Colman</a>) are taking the family out to dinner to announce their marriage. And of course, it goes disastrously.</p> <p>Scott\u2019s Catholic priest is introduced as the man who will conduct the wedding ceremony. But as you may expect from a Waller-Bridge creation, this is no regular clergyman. His parents are alcoholic lawyers, his brother a paedophile lorry driver, and he is sweary, subversive and seductive. The first new episode concludes with Fleabag and her sister Claire sharing the same thought. \u201cThe priest is quite hot,\u201d Claire says. \u201c<em>So</em> hot,\u201d says Fleabag with a trademark conspiratorial glance at the camera. We are left with a sneaking suspicion that this particular man of God might be shagged senseless by at least one, if not both, sisters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I like the idea of not being defined as one thing, whether that\u2019s being an actor, or being Irish, or being gay</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Scott and Waller-Bridge first worked together a decade ago when they were cast in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/14/review-roaring-trade-soho-theatre\" title=\"\">the play Roaring Trade</a>, about City shenanigans, at the Soho theatre in London. (On a publicity photo, Waller-Bridge\u2019s power-suited Jess is seen strangling Scott\u2019s unscrupulous Donny with his tie.) Of that time Scott says, \u201cNobody had a clue who we were.\u201d He was surprised when Waller-Bridge offered him the part in Fleabag. \u201cWe\u2019d not seen each other for so long. But we had a natural chemistry then, and we still do. What I love about Fleabag is that it talks about sex in what Americans would call a very sex-positive way. It\u2019s the thing that every single person in the world is interested in, whether they are sexual people or not.\u201d</p> <p>I email Waller-Bridge to ask why she cast him, since Scott\u2019s not sure. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been anyone else,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy ask \u2013 someone who could convince as a person who\u2019s seemingly totally at peace, but at the same time has a promise of danger. He had to be a character that Fleabag couldn\u2019t sum up and dismiss as easily as she has with so many others \u2013 so he had to be played by an actor who you can\u2019t define. Andrew has the charisma of 10 people rolled into one.\u201d</p> <p>The other thing Scott loves about Fleabag is that his name will no longer be synonymous with Moriarty. Before our interview, Scott made two demands \u2013 I had to have seen his Hamlet, and he didn\u2019t just want to talk about Moriarty. The funny thing is, though, you can see his Moriarty in his Hamlet \u2013 performed at the Almeida theatre in London in 2017, and screened on BBC2 last year \u2013 not least the way Scott segues from meek introvert to raging madman. I tell him I loved the way his Hamlet spoke: you could understand every word, even if you\u2019d never read Shakespeare before. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he says, suddenly blazing with enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m <em>obsessed</em> with this. It\u2019s a thriller. It\u2019s supposed to be for everybody. I hate the idea that Shakespeare\u2019s just supposed to be for academics.\u201d He earned rave reviews (the Observer\u2019s Kate Kellaway called him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/25/hamlet-andrew-scott-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-transfer-review-robert-icke\" title=\"\">\u201ca brilliant communicator\u201d</a>) and was nominated for an Olivier award.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c3c6c5f3f8d559cb0de9d59970bd9fcc0cc7b01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c3c6c5f3f8d559cb0de9d59970bd9fcc0cc7b01/0_1203_4564_5703/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Scott\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott wears Blazer, officinegenerale.com; striped vest, danielwfletcher.com; trousers, Acne Studios, harrods.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bella Howard/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scott does an impersonation of the way Shakespeare has been performed in the past \u2013 grandiose and hammy, with more than a hint of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/22/news.obituaries\" title=\"\">Johnny Gielguds</a>. \u201cI love the idea that a 14-year-old will come and go, \u2018God! That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019 Because we\u2019re competing with box sets and you\u2019ve got to be as good as box sets. Rob Icke, the director, said, \u2018It\u2019s not like eating your greens\u2019 \u2013 Shakespeare shouldn\u2019t be something you have to do, it should be properly stirring.\u201d</p> <p>It was the toughest and most rewarding part he has played. \u201cThere was some great actor, maybe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/peter-o-toole-dies-81\" title=\"\">Peter O\u2019Toole</a>, who said that after playing Hamlet he felt altered. And I think that\u2019s true. You have to play all facets of yourself \u2013 the lover, the son, the prince, the student.\u201d He believes that what makes Hamlet centuries ahead of its time is its exploration of mental illness. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the tip of the iceberg, in terms of our understanding of mental health. We need to learn so much more.\u201d</p> <p>Has he had mental health problems of his own? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in the world who hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like being asked if you have ever been physically ill, and saying, \u2018Nope, never had anything wrong!\u2019 Of course I have. For me, it\u2019s like weather. Sometimes it\u2019s fucking storming down on you.\u201d And when it is, he says, the best thing you can do is face it full on. \u201cThis idea of west coast positivity pisses me off, the idea of putting a positive spin on it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy. There\u2019s no point in being in the driving rain and going, \u2018Shine, sun, shine!\u2019\u201d He makes a strange, distant noise from deep within himself \u2013 as if he is conjuring up a demon. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You\u2019ve just got to be in the weather. And that\u2019s where I think our biggest problems come from.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb99040fac98456224b6c55809872688e3912ead\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb99040fac98456224b6c55809872688e3912ead/99_25_4157_2494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sherlock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sherlock/Hartswood Films/Colin Hutton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until Hamlet, Scott thought he was in danger of being typecast. \u201cI was a little bit tired of playing the freak. Do you know what I mean? What I really look for, and what attracts me in other people, is vulnerability. So being known for playing monstrous people, you know\u2026\u201d Another embryonic sentence is discarded.</p> <p>Apart from Moriarty, who does he mean: Max Denbigh, the villainous head of national security he played in the 2015 Bond film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spectre\" title=\"\">Spectre</a>? He nods and says it\u2019s something he fell into, or that casting directors plunged him into. It\u2019s funny that people see you as a baddie when you\u2019ve got such a baby face, I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think, when I was 20, people said, \u2018He\u2019s going to make a great villain.\u2019\u201d Another pause. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love those parts.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s being tough on himself. In fact, one of the appealing things about Scott is that you never know quite what he\u2019ll turn up in next. So he flips from the nebbish nerd in 2004\u2019s TV comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426757/\" title=\"\">My Life In Film</a> to the principled priest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/apr/02/jimmys-hall-trailer-ken-loach-film-video\" title=\"\">Ken Loach\u2019s Jimmy\u2019s Hall</a>; from the cerebral lawyer Anthony Julius, taking on Holocaust denier David Irving in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/26/denial-review-holocaust-rachel-weisz\" title=\"\">Denial</a>, to the lovably morose gay bookshop owner Gethin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984\" title=\"\">Pride</a>; back in 1995, he played a nameless corpse on the beach in Spielberg\u2019s second world war epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/saving-private-ryan\" title=\"\">Saving Private Ryan</a>.</p> <p>He has been equally prolific on stage, starring in three plays at the Royal Court in London. Scott won an Olivier in 2005 for his role in Rob Evans\u2019 abduction drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/dec/01/theatre1\" title=\"\">A Girl In A Car With A Man</a>; played twin brothers in Christopher Shinn\u2019s Pulitzer-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/may/19/theatre\" title=\"\">Dying City</a>, about the aftermath of 9/11; and was a self-obsessed rock star in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/10/birdland-rock-stardom-theatre-review-royal-court\" title=\"\">Simon Stephens\u2019 Birdland</a> in 2014.

He can\u2019t stand the idea of being pigeonholed. Many actors are embarrassed about spending their life playing parts, as if it were infantilising, but Scott isn\u2019t. In fact, he is such a passionate advocate of play that his stubby, broken sentences become louder and louder as he makes the case for it. \u201cI love the idea of playfulness. And you do play a part. It\u2019s really fucking important in life. Just taking things a little more lightly.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard anybody talk with such intensity about the importance of lightening up.</p> <p>It\u2019s all of a piece with his acting. At times, Scott\u2019s performances are so quiet you barely notice him. And then he turns on a sixpence: a change in register, a look in his eyes \u2013 which can glint with cruelty, sarcasm, turmoil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b50f86f1b86509e82778ac5eab1d2844be4f8d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b50f86f1b86509e82778ac5eab1d2844be4f8d50/1349_774_1560_1950/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Scott in Ibsen\u2019s Emperor And Galilean at the Olivier theatre in 2011.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Ibsen\u2019s Emperor And Galilean at the Olivier theatre in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You know when your characters suddenly go off on one, I say, is that a trick you have learned or is it actually you? \u201cI think I am pretty manic \u2013 \u2018energised\u2019, as the Americans might say.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI think it <em>is</em> part of me. In life, I am quite a playful person. I like a fluidity in relation to the work I do \u2013 even in my own personal life. I like the idea of not being defined as one particular thing, whether that\u2019s being an actor, or being Irish, or being gay, whatever the fuck it is. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much value in saying, \u2018This is what I am.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Now 42, Scott grew up in Dublin with two sisters; his older sister, Sarah, is a sports coach and television commentator, his younger sister, Hannah, is also an actor. His father, Jim, worked for an employment agency, while his mother, Nora, was an art teacher. He attended a private Jesuit school and went to drama classes on Saturday. A painfully shy schoolboy, he was liberated by acting. \u201cI was just so self-conscious, but I felt free on stage. I could be more audacious.\u201d He fidgets away like a hyperactive hamster as he talks, tearing a cardboard cake wrapper into pieces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9aa8040ef3b1e2d91935d478a9d27a717506c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9aa8040ef3b1e2d91935d478a9d27a717506c7c/1953_136_3820_4776/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Scott\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grooming: Victoria Bond using Sisley.

But on the day he was due to start, he was cast in his first film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113573/\" title=\"\">Korea</a>, about an Irish boy emigrating to America in the 1950s and being enlisted to fight in the Korean war. He turned down art college, made the film, then went to Trinity College to study drama. When he got there, he thought it was a waste of time \u2013 all theory and no practice. After six months, he quit to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/abbey-theatre\" title=\"\">Dublin\u2019s Abbey theatre</a>.</p> <p>Since leaving Ireland for London in his early 20s, Scott has spent most of his adult life in England. But recently, he bought himself a house in Dublin, a city he says he has come to realise is much more than a home. For a long time, he felt alienated from Ireland \u2013 associating it with the Catholic church, bigotry and archaic views on homosexuality and abortion. England, he thought, was a relatively progressive, liberal country, but not any more. Brexit is a factor, he says. \u201cThe greatest tragedy is that it\u2019s so confusing for people to even understand what it is. It\u2019s like a crazy golf course.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came over here to have some breathing space and find out who I could be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ireland has a lot to be proud of these days, hasn\u2019t it, I say. Scott\u2019s face lights up. \u201cI agree, I totally agree. It\u2019s extraordinary, isn\u2019t it? The development of Ireland. The emancipation of Ireland. I find it very moving. I can\u2019t really speak about it without being emotional, because the Catholic church had such a stranglehold on Ireland. And that has certainly dissipated. For me it began with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/live/2015/may/23/counting-underway-for-irelands-referendum-on-marriage-equality\" title=\"\">marriage referendum in 2015</a>. Then last year we had the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live\" title=\"\">abortion referendum</a>.\u201d</p> <p>For once the words just pour out. \u201cIn 1993, when I was 16, it was illegal to be gay. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d Was that scary? \u201cYes, certainly. It would have been under the surface and I always felt loved. But I definitely came over here to have some breathing space and find out who I could be. When the marriage referendum happened, I bought a little house in Dublin. I had a real feeling of wanting to be involved in Ireland, and Irish culture, and the Irish people. And I must have felt I wasn\u2019t fully embraced by that when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>Was he angry with Ireland? He answers in the present tense. \u201cI definitely feel angry about the attitude towards sex and sexuality. The Catholic church\u2019s ideas about sexuality, and the terrible pain that they inflicted on children \u2013 the primness and deep conservative attitude towards sex as something that needs to be feared.\u201d And of course, he says, it was made so much worse by the hypocrisy. \u201cPractically every week when I was growing up in the 90s, I\u2019d listen to my dad\u2019s radio on the way into school and there were stories about abuse. Unbelievable abuse, extraordinary abuse, and priests having affairs with people, and the damage is limitless. And I certainly know, personally speaking, emancipating myself from that, dealing with my own shame and guilt, realising my own self-worth, that\u2019s been a really big job for me. And I feel really proud that I\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8194d5bf492e6fdeba6dccbb98342d97eb782445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8194d5bf492e6fdeba6dccbb98342d97eb782445/0_951_2585_1550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Scott as Hamlet at the Almeida theatre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Hamlet at the Almeida theatre, for which he won rave reviews.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miles Aldridge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did he feel shame and guilt about? \u201cAbout who I was. Or that you can live a life less ordinary and still have the attributes of kindness and compassion and community. That there\u2019s more than one way to live a life.\u201d</p> <p>Is he still Catholic? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says. I give him a look. Are his parents Catholic? \u201cYes. I was brought up Catholic.\u201d He laughs uneasily. So you are disowning your Catholicism? \u201cYes. A lot of my family are Catholic, and I totally respect that. I suppose what I mean is, there is a real need in our culture for security and predictability and living a life that\u2019s going to keep us safe. And I also think there\u2019s a human need for adventure and autonomy and transgression. I really found myself in being able to embrace those thoughts and still be a good person. In a world of innovation, I feel we lack innovation when it comes to sexuality and relationships.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When did he first say out loud that he was not Catholic? He bursts out laughing. \u201cFive minutes ago. Normally I would say I was brought up Catholic, and actually why do I have to say that?\u201d He\u2019s still giggling about the idea that he has eliminated the church from his life with a simple \u201cNo\u201d. Does he feel different for saying it out loud? \u201cFuck, yeah! Do I look different?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if his parents are liberal. \u201cYeah, it turns out they are.\u201d What does he mean by that? \u201cWell, I suppose I had a fear that they weren\u2019t. We went to Catholic school and they\u2019re both churchgoers. I think having gay people in the Scott family has been the making of our family \u2013 to be able to engage in that conversation openly.\u201d He came out in his early 20s. \u201cI always thought this about being gay \u2013 it\u2019s a great gift that you\u2019re given, when you have to go around to everybody in your life and say, \u2018This is me, I hope you love me,\u2019 and they say that they do.\u201d Did he think people would reject him? \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d And did any? \u201cNo, not one person.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Scott if he\u2019s still living with his long-term partner, whom he has described in the past as someone in the industry but not an actor. \u201cNo, I live alone now.\u201d Is there a man in his life? \u201cI have a lot of love in my life, but I prefer not to talk about that.\u201d Was their split recent? He squirms at the question, but is keen to reassure me at the same time. \u201cNo. Not too recently. No. No. Yeah. So, no. No, I feel happy. There is no need to be concerned.\u201d Actually, he says, he is happier, more at ease with himself than he has ever been. \u201cI feel like I have a good relationship with who I am. I really enjoy my work, really enjoy my life. I feel like I know myself a lot better.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about how lucky he is. For one thing, he loves working with other actors. \u201cI always find it weird when actors say, \u2018I don\u2019t have any actor friends\u2019, because I like actors a lot. I think they\u2019re very funny, and empathetic, and sexy.\u201d Who is his favourite? \u201cI worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anthony-hopkins\" title=\"\">Anthony Hopkins</a> in King Lear.\u201d Scott played Edgar in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/28/bbc-king-lear-review-anthony-hopkins\" title=\"\">Richard Eyre\u2019s recent BBC adaptation</a>. \u201cI think he\u2019s the most engaging actor I\u2019ve ever worked with. I find something very moving about the fact that he\u2019s 81 and at the top of his game.\u201d He talks about how lucky he has been to work with directors such as Ken Loach. \u201cOh I loved him so much. He knew every single person \u2013 all the extras\u2019 names. He was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>By now the cardboard cake wrapper is in tiny shreds. But Scott keeps talking about his luck \u2013 all the new challenges ahead of him, the variety of work he is doing. He is delighted that Phoebe Waller-Bridge not only wanted him for Fleabag, but that she cast him as the straight priest she fancies the pants off. \u201cThis is uncharted territory for me, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m always looking for. It\u2019s a character I\u2019ve never got to play, and it\u2019s such a big part of my life. Sex\u2026\u201d And, of course, one word into the sentence he gives up on it. \u201cI feel so grateful to her that she thought of me. The part develops in a really beautiful, brilliant way.\u201d In a transgressive way? He grins. \u201c\u2018Course it fucking does \u2013 it\u2019s Fleabag!\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Fleabag series two starts on 4 March on BBC One at 10.35pm; it will also be available on BBC Three via iPlayer.</p> <p>Commenting on this piece?

      "bodyText": "Andrew Scott is keen to get rid of me. He is about to have his picture taken and has come over paralysingly self-conscious. The stylist walks over and whispers in my ear. \u201cAndrew says you don\u2019t have to be here,\u201d she says. That\u2019s fine, I reply, I\u2019ll just get on with my own stuff. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201che doesn\u2019t want you here.\u201d Oh. I withdraw into a freezing studio next door, a little hurt, and use the time to watch the end of one of Scott\u2019s forthcoming films, Steel Country, in which the actor plays an obsessive, possibly autistic sanitation truck driver determined to investigate the death of a child. About 40 minutes later, Scott emerges. Now he is not only paralysingly self-conscious, he\u2019s desperately apologetic. \u201cSorry, I hope they didn\u2019t\u2026 I said, \u2018Simon doesn\u2019t have to be here,\u2019 and then they\u2026 anyway, sorry.\u201d It\u2019s a classic Scott sentence. Put somebody else\u2019s words into his mouth (Shakespeare, say) and his delivery is magical: that singsong Dublin accent changing pitch by the word, that wonderful ability to make the prosaic poetic and vice versa. But put his own words into his mouth and he splutters and stalls like an old banger cranking up in a deep chill. Sentences drift off into the ether, and often have no middle; sometimes it\u2019s hard to work out where or why they began. Scott asks me what I\u2019m watching. Steel Country, I say. He shrieks in shock. \u201cOh Jesus! Really? How did you get it?\u201d He\u2019s so discombobulated that he runs off to the toilet, possibly for good. When he returns, he fiddles with the heating before settling down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re watching that film. That\u2019s extraordinary. I don\u2019t even know when it\u2019s coming out.\u201d I just asked for a preview copy, I say. \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice of you, thank you.\u201d He is scrupulously polite. Though he doesn\u2019t like to dwell on it, Scott is probably still best known for his role as Moriarty in the TV series Sherlock. Until he arrived, the show was all about the eponymous hero, played by Benedict Cumberbatch; Scott, working his sweet, boyish face into a kind of crazed malevolence, provided Sherlock with the five-star foe he deserved \u2013 an evil genius who promises his arch enemy, \u201cI will burn the heart out of you.\u201d In their final face-off, the two men stare into each other\u2019s eyes and acknowledge they are identikit sociopaths \u2013 even if the detective is ostensibly on the side of the angels. Now Scott is back on television in a role likely to define him in a very different way. He plays a priest in the second series of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag, the comedy-drama about a young woman trying to navigate sex, family dysfunction, loss and life. Series one, for which Waller-Bridge won a Bafta, ended with Fleabag broke and broken, and the revelation that she was responsible for her best friend\u2019s death. Series two, which also features Kristin Scott Thomas and Fiona Shaw, begins 371 days, 19 hours and 26 minutes later. Fleabag\u2019s browbeaten father (Bill Paterson) and her monstrous stepmother (Olivia Colman) are taking the family out to dinner to announce their marriage. And of course, it goes disastrously. Scott\u2019s Catholic priest is introduced as the man who will conduct the wedding ceremony. But as you may expect from a Waller-Bridge creation, this is no regular clergyman. His parents are alcoholic lawyers, his brother a paedophile lorry driver, and he is sweary, subversive and seductive. The first new episode concludes with Fleabag and her sister Claire sharing the same thought. \u201cThe priest is quite hot,\u201d Claire says. \u201cSo hot,\u201d says Fleabag with a trademark conspiratorial glance at the camera. We are left with a sneaking suspicion that this particular man of God might be shagged senseless by at least one, if not both, sisters. Scott and Waller-Bridge first worked together a decade ago when they were cast in the play Roaring Trade, about City shenanigans, at the Soho theatre in London. (On a publicity photo, Waller-Bridge\u2019s power-suited Jess is seen strangling Scott\u2019s unscrupulous Donny with his tie.) Of that time Scott says, \u201cNobody had a clue who we were.\u201d He was surprised when Waller-Bridge offered him the part in Fleabag. \u201cWe\u2019d not seen each other for so long. But we had a natural chemistry then, and we still do. What I love about Fleabag is that it talks about sex in what Americans would call a very sex-positive way. It\u2019s the thing that every single person in the world is interested in, whether they are sexual people or not.\u201d I email Waller-Bridge to ask why she cast him, since Scott\u2019s not sure. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been anyone else,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy ask \u2013 someone who could convince as a person who\u2019s seemingly totally at peace, but at the same time has a promise of danger. He had to be a character that Fleabag couldn\u2019t sum up and dismiss as easily as she has with so many others \u2013 so he had to be played by an actor who you can\u2019t define. Andrew has the charisma of 10 people rolled into one.\u201d The other thing Scott loves about Fleabag is that his name will no longer be synonymous with Moriarty. Before our interview, Scott made two demands \u2013 I had to have seen his Hamlet, and he didn\u2019t just want to talk about Moriarty. The funny thing is, though, you can see his Moriarty in his Hamlet \u2013 performed at the Almeida theatre in London in 2017, and screened on BBC2 last year \u2013 not least the way Scott segues from meek introvert to raging madman. I tell him I loved the way his Hamlet spoke: you could understand every word, even if you\u2019d never read Shakespeare before. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he says, suddenly blazing with enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with this. It\u2019s a thriller. It\u2019s supposed to be for everybody. I hate the idea that Shakespeare\u2019s just supposed to be for academics.\u201d He earned rave reviews (the Observer\u2019s Kate Kellaway called him \u201ca brilliant communicator\u201d) and was nominated for an Olivier award. Scott does an impersonation of the way Shakespeare has been performed in the past \u2013 grandiose and hammy, with more than a hint of the Johnny Gielguds. \u201cI love the idea that a 14-year-old will come and go, \u2018God! That\u2019s brilliant!\u2019 Because we\u2019re competing with box sets and you\u2019ve got to be as good as box sets. Rob Icke, the director, said, \u2018It\u2019s not like eating your greens\u2019 \u2013 Shakespeare shouldn\u2019t be something you have to do, it should be properly stirring.\u201d It was the toughest and most rewarding part he has played. \u201cThere was some great actor, maybe Peter O\u2019Toole, who said that after playing Hamlet he felt altered. And I think that\u2019s true. You have to play all facets of yourself \u2013 the lover, the son, the prince, the student.\u201d He believes that what makes Hamlet centuries ahead of its time is its exploration of mental illness. \u201cWe\u2019re still at the tip of the iceberg, in terms of our understanding of mental health. We need to learn so much more.\u201d Has he had mental health problems of his own? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in the world who hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like being asked if you have ever been physically ill, and saying, \u2018Nope, never had anything wrong!\u2019 Of course I have. For me, it\u2019s like weather. Sometimes it\u2019s fucking storming down on you.\u201d And when it is, he says, the best thing you can do is face it full on. \u201cThis idea of west coast positivity pisses me off, the idea of putting a positive spin on it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy. There\u2019s no point in being in the driving rain and going, \u2018Shine, sun, shine!\u2019\u201d He makes a strange, distant noise from deep within himself \u2013 as if he is conjuring up a demon. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. You\u2019ve just got to be in the weather. And that\u2019s where I think our biggest problems come from.\u201d Until Hamlet, Scott thought he was in danger of being typecast. \u201cI was a little bit tired of playing the freak. Do you know what I mean? What I really look for, and what attracts me in other people, is vulnerability. So being known for playing monstrous people, you know\u2026\u201d Another embryonic sentence is discarded. Apart from Moriarty, who does he mean: Max Denbigh, the villainous head of national security he played in the 2015 Bond film Spectre? He nods and says it\u2019s something he fell into, or that casting directors plunged him into. It\u2019s funny that people see you as a baddie when you\u2019ve got such a baby face, I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think, when I was 20, people said, \u2018He\u2019s going to make a great villain.\u2019\u201d Another pause. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love those parts.\u201d He\u2019s being tough on himself. In fact, one of the appealing things about Scott is that you never know quite what he\u2019ll turn up in next. So he flips from the nebbish nerd in 2004\u2019s TV comedy My Life In Film to the principled priest in Ken Loach\u2019s Jimmy\u2019s Hall; from the cerebral lawyer Anthony Julius, taking on Holocaust denier David Irving in Denial, to the lovably morose gay bookshop owner Gethin in Pride; back in 1995, he played a nameless corpse on the beach in Spielberg\u2019s second world war epic Saving Private Ryan. He has been equally prolific on stage, starring in three plays at the Royal Court in London. Scott won an Olivier in 2005 for his role in Rob Evans\u2019 abduction drama A Girl In A Car With A Man; played twin brothers in Christopher Shinn\u2019s Pulitzer-nominated Dying City, about the aftermath of 9/11; and was a self-obsessed rock star in Simon Stephens\u2019 Birdland in 2014. He made his Broadway debut in 2006 alongside Julianne Moore and Bill Nighy, in David Hare\u2019s The Vertical Hour about the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Change, he says, is all-important. He can\u2019t stand the idea of being pigeonholed. Many actors are embarrassed about spending their life playing parts, as if it were infantilising, but Scott isn\u2019t. In fact, he is such a passionate advocate of play that his stubby, broken sentences become louder and louder as he makes the case for it. \u201cI love the idea of playfulness. And you do play a part. It\u2019s really fucking important in life. Just taking things a little more lightly.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard anybody talk with such intensity about the importance of lightening up. It\u2019s all of a piece with his acting. At times, Scott\u2019s performances are so quiet you barely notice him. And then he turns on a sixpence: a change in register, a look in his eyes \u2013 which can glint with cruelty, sarcasm, turmoil. You know when your characters suddenly go off on one, I say, is that a trick you have learned or is it actually you? \u201cI think I am pretty manic \u2013 \u2018energised\u2019, as the Americans might say.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI think it is part of me. In life, I am quite a playful person. I like a fluidity in relation to the work I do \u2013 even in my own personal life. I like the idea of not being defined as one particular thing, whether that\u2019s being an actor, or being Irish, or being gay, whatever the fuck it is. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much value in saying, \u2018This is what I am.\u2019\u201d *** Now 42, Scott grew up in Dublin with two sisters; his older sister, Sarah, is a sports coach and television commentator, his younger sister, Hannah, is also an actor. His father, Jim, worked for an employment agency, while his mother, Nora, was an art teacher. He attended a private Jesuit school and went to drama classes on Saturday. A painfully shy schoolboy, he was liberated by acting. \u201cI was just so self-conscious, but I felt free on stage. I could be more audacious.\u201d He fidgets away like a hyperactive hamster as he talks, tearing a cardboard cake wrapper into pieces. Scott was a promising painter and won a bursary to art school at the age of 17. But on the day he was due to start, he was cast in his first film, Korea, about an Irish boy emigrating to America in the 1950s and being enlisted to fight in the Korean war. He turned down art college, made the film, then went to Trinity College to study drama. When he got there, he thought it was a waste of time \u2013 all theory and no practice. After six months, he quit to join Dublin\u2019s Abbey theatre. Since leaving Ireland for London in his early 20s, Scott has spent most of his adult life in England. But recently, he bought himself a house in Dublin, a city he says he has come to realise is much more than a home. For a long time, he felt alienated from Ireland \u2013 associating it with the Catholic church, bigotry and archaic views on homosexuality and abortion. England, he thought, was a relatively progressive, liberal country, but not any more. Brexit is a factor, he says. \u201cThe greatest tragedy is that it\u2019s so confusing for people to even understand what it is. It\u2019s like a crazy golf course.\u201d Ireland has a lot to be proud of these days, hasn\u2019t it, I say. Scott\u2019s face lights up. \u201cI agree, I totally agree. It\u2019s extraordinary, isn\u2019t it? The development of Ireland. The emancipation of Ireland. I find it very moving. I can\u2019t really speak about it without being emotional, because the Catholic church had such a stranglehold on Ireland. And that has certainly dissipated. For me it began with the marriage referendum in 2015. Then last year we had the abortion referendum.\u201d For once the words just pour out. \u201cIn 1993, when I was 16, it was illegal to be gay. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d Was that scary? \u201cYes, certainly. It would have been under the surface and I always felt loved. But I definitely came over here to have some breathing space and find out who I could be. When the marriage referendum happened, I bought a little house in Dublin. I had a real feeling of wanting to be involved in Ireland, and Irish culture, and the Irish people. And I must have felt I wasn\u2019t fully embraced by that when I was younger.\u201d Was he angry with Ireland? He answers in the present tense. \u201cI definitely feel angry about the attitude towards sex and sexuality. The Catholic church\u2019s ideas about sexuality, and the terrible pain that they inflicted on children \u2013 the primness and deep conservative attitude towards sex as something that needs to be feared.\u201d And of course, he says, it was made so much worse by the hypocrisy. \u201cPractically every week when I was growing up in the 90s, I\u2019d listen to my dad\u2019s radio on the way into school and there were stories about abuse. Unbelievable abuse, extraordinary abuse, and priests having affairs with people, and the damage is limitless. And I certainly know, personally speaking, emancipating myself from that, dealing with my own shame and guilt, realising my own self-worth, that\u2019s been a really big job for me. And I feel really proud that I\u2019ve done that.\u201d What did he feel shame and guilt about? \u201cAbout who I was. Or that you can live a life less ordinary and still have the attributes of kindness and compassion and community. That there\u2019s more than one way to live a life.\u201d Is he still Catholic? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he says. I give him a look. Are his parents Catholic? \u201cYes. I was brought up Catholic.\u201d He laughs uneasily. So you are disowning your Catholicism? \u201cYes. A lot of my family are Catholic, and I totally respect that. I suppose what I mean is, there is a real need in our culture for security and predictability and living a life that\u2019s going to keep us safe. And I also think there\u2019s a human need for adventure and autonomy and transgression. I really found myself in being able to embrace those thoughts and still be a good person. In a world of innovation, I feel we lack innovation when it comes to sexuality and relationships.\u2019\u201d When did he first say out loud that he was not Catholic? He bursts out laughing. \u201cFive minutes ago. Normally I would say I was brought up Catholic, and actually why do I have to say that?\u201d He\u2019s still giggling about the idea that he has eliminated the church from his life with a simple \u201cNo\u201d. Does he feel different for saying it out loud? \u201cFuck, yeah! Do I look different?\u201d I ask if his parents are liberal. \u201cYeah, it turns out they are.\u201d What does he mean by that? \u201cWell, I suppose I had a fear that they weren\u2019t. We went to Catholic school and they\u2019re both churchgoers. I think having gay people in the Scott family has been the making of our family \u2013 to be able to engage in that conversation openly.\u201d He came out in his early 20s. \u201cI always thought this about being gay \u2013 it\u2019s a great gift that you\u2019re given, when you have to go around to everybody in your life and say, \u2018This is me, I hope you love me,\u2019 and they say that they do.\u201d Did he think people would reject him? \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d And did any? \u201cNo, not one person.\u201d I ask Scott if he\u2019s still living with his long-term partner, whom he has described in the past as someone in the industry but not an actor. \u201cNo, I live alone now.\u201d Is there a man in his life? \u201cI have a lot of love in my life, but I prefer not to talk about that.\u201d Was their split recent? He squirms at the question, but is keen to reassure me at the same time. \u201cNo. Not too recently. No. No. Yeah. So, no. No, I feel happy. There is no need to be concerned.\u201d Actually, he says, he is happier, more at ease with himself than he has ever been. \u201cI feel like I have a good relationship with who I am. I really enjoy my work, really enjoy my life. I feel like I know myself a lot better.\u201d He talks about how lucky he is. For one thing, he loves working with other actors. \u201cI always find it weird when actors say, \u2018I don\u2019t have any actor friends\u2019, because I like actors a lot. I think they\u2019re very funny, and empathetic, and sexy.\u201d Who is his favourite? \u201cI worked with Anthony Hopkins in King Lear.\u201d Scott played Edgar in Richard Eyre\u2019s recent BBC adaptation. \u201cI think he\u2019s the most engaging actor I\u2019ve ever worked with. I find something very moving about the fact that he\u2019s 81 and at the top of his game.\u201d He talks about how lucky he has been to work with directors such as Ken Loach. \u201cOh I loved him so much. He knew every single person \u2013 all the extras\u2019 names. He was unbelievable.\u201d By now the cardboard cake wrapper is in tiny shreds. But Scott keeps talking about his luck \u2013 all the new challenges ahead of him, the variety of work he is doing. He is delighted that Phoebe Waller-Bridge not only wanted him for Fleabag, but that she cast him as the straight priest she fancies the pants off. \u201cThis is uncharted territory for me, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m always looking for. It\u2019s a character I\u2019ve never got to play, and it\u2019s such a big part of my life. Sex\u2026\u201d And, of course, one word into the sentence he gives up on it. \u201cI feel so grateful to her that she thought of me. The part develops in a really beautiful, brilliant way.\u201d In a transgressive way? He grins. \u201c\u2018Course it fucking does \u2013 it\u2019s Fleabag!\u201d \u2022 Fleabag series two starts on 4 March on BBC One at 10.35pm; it will also be available on BBC Three via iPlayer.

I\u2019ve already lost my partner due to the stress of this and have had suicidal thoughts. This will bankrupt me. All I did was follow advice and do what was the norm at the time. This all happened 10 to 20 years ago, and one of the clients at that time was HMRC.\u201d</p> <p>Not all were high-earning IT workers. We were contacted by a healthcare professional who was a locum in the NHS for two years. He said: \u201cI was advised to sign up with an umbrella company by my agency [and] advised that they were fully compliant with HMRC, I would not have to worry about end-of-year paperwork because it was fully managed by them. There was never any mention of \u2018loans\u2019 at any point and I do not recall ever signing any paperwork agreeing to receiving my income through a loan.\u201d</p> <p>The person has been told they now face a tax bill of about \u00a320,000.</p> <p>So what were they doing that has resulted in such enormous bills? The heart of the issue is how contractors were paid using loans rather than salaries, thus sidestepping usual income tax and national insurance arrangements.</p> <p>The schemes were hugely complex, but a simple example would be this. Let\u2019s say the IT worker is hired for \u00a33,000 worth of work. They are advised by their accountant to use an employee benefit trust (EBT), usually set up by a specialist company. The \u00a33,000 is paid not to the IT worker but to the EBT, which then pays it back to them in the form of a loan, after some deductions for their fees. There is no tax paid on the \u00a33,000, and the idea is that there is a mutual understanding that the loan will never be repaid. This is why HMRC calls it \u201cdisguised remuneration\u201d. It\u2019s also why many PAYE workers will have limited sympathy for the people receiving bills now, arguing that they were evidently sidestepping income tax.</p> <p>HMRC has already contacted 40,000 people with loan charge demands, and in total it expects to pull in an extraordinary \u00a33.2bn in tax. In its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/loan-schemes-and-the-loan-charge-an-overview/tax-avoidance-loan-schemes-and-the-loan-charge\" title=\"\">official guide to the loan charge</a>, it says: \u201cThese loans are paid to people in such a way that means it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll ever have to be repaid. In other words, the person receiving money from a loan scheme gets to keep it all. And they don\u2019t pay any tax on this money, even though it\u2019s clearly income. It\u2019s highly unusual to receive your salary in loans and is clearly a method used to avoid paying tax.\u201d</p> <p>Such arguments enrage the people who have received the bills, who argue that they often had little or no choice when they were working as a contractor but to enter into these schemes.</p> <p>They are astounded at the retrospective nature of the charges, often dating back more than a decade, long after their tax returns were officially closed, as well as HMRC\u2019s refusal to accept reduced settlements, and what they say is their inability to challenge the charge.</p> <p>Richard Horsley is co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/\" title=\"\">the Loan Charge Action Group</a>. He says that many IT contractors such as himself fell into the loan schemes following measures at the end of the 1990s, known as IR35, to close tax loopholes used by some contractors.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, tax professionals and QCs came up with solutions where we went on to PAYE for a portion of our earnings, while another portion was a loan, which was not taxable. We asked if it was legal and were told yes. If we knew it was illegal we would never have allowed ourselves into it.\u201d</p> <p>He says in his case it meant that effectively 25% of his earnings went in deductions for tax, interest on the loans and the scheme promoter\u2019s fees. But now he is subject to loan charges that effectively mean he will end up paying around 80% tax on his earnings for the period.</p> <p>Another campaigner, who wished to remain anonymous, says: \u201cWe are just the fall guys. I was completely hoodwinked by the scheme administrators, and I feel that HMRC should have acted much, much sooner to advise me that these schemes were not legal. Genuinely naive contractors are being treated like horribly aggressive tax avoiders.\u201d Why, he argues, is HMRC not going after the promoters of the schemes, many of which made millions, but have subsequently dissolved their companies?</p> <p>Even the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which fights the corner for the low-paid and those on welfare, says in <a href=\"https://www.litrg.org.uk/latest-news/news/180913-are-you-affected-2019-%E2%80%98loan-charge%E2%80%99-help-available\" title=\"\">its guide to the charge</a> that \u201csome agency workers may have had little choice to participate in such schemes, if they wanted to work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56f07ba852eb6b5346a9452c905246481945d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56f07ba852eb6b5346a9452c905246481945d3d/277_206_4445_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat MP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With tens of thousands of people facing life-changing bills, it is vital that the loan charge is properly examined before it comes into effect.\u2019 Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many MPs are now backing the loan charge workers. This week saw the launch of the all-party parliamentary loan charge group, chaired by Sir Ed Davey MP. He says: \u201cThere has been considerable concern raised about the loan charge by MPs and peers. With tens of thousands of people facing life-changing bills, it is vital that the loan charge is properly examined before it comes into effect on 5 April.\u201d</p> <p>Inside government, those in charge of collecting the levy see it very differently. Officials speak of an unprecedented campaign by those affected by the tax charge, talking darkly about how their social media accounts are bombarded with messages, how anyone who dares to defend the charge is attacked, and how HMRC workers have been individually targeted.</p> <p>We asked HMRC to justify why it is reaching so far back in time for payments, and why it did not act earlier to stop the schemes \u2013 and the bills that have now racked up for contractors.</p> <p>It says: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that these schemes do not work, warning against the use of tax avoidance schemes in the media and in publications such as our Spotlight series on gov.uk as early as 2009. HMRC have opened tens of thousands of inquiries into these schemes starting before 1999, making users and their representatives aware that their tax return was under investigation.\u201d</p> <p>It argues that the loan charge is not retrospective. It said: \u201cIt is unfair to ordinary taxpayers to let anybody benefit from contrived tax avoidance of this sort, and that is why the government has taken action to ensure that everybody pays the taxes they owe.</p> <p>\u201cThe charge on disguised remuneration (DR) loans is not retrospective. It is a new charge, arising at a future date, on loan balances outstanding at that date. It does not change the tax position of any previous year or the outcome of any open compliance checks. Its announcement at budget 2016 provided scheme users with a three-year period to repay their DR loans, or to agree a settlement with HMRC before the charge takes effect.\u201d</p> <p>It denies that it is not chasing the scheme promoters. \u201cSince the formation of HMRC\u2019s fraud investigation service on 1 April 2016, more than 15 individuals have been convicted for offences relating to arrangements which have been promoted and marketed as tax avoidance schemes and sentenced to over 95 years custodial.\u201d</p> <p>Burned by suggestions that it is chasing low-income locum nurses and social workers, HMRC analysed the occupations of the people sent charge notices. \u201cWe estimate that of the 50,000 people affected, 3% are nurses and less than 2% are social workers.\u201d</p>",

In other words, the person receiving money from a loan scheme gets to keep it all. And they don\u2019t pay any tax on this money, even though it\u2019s clearly income. It\u2019s highly unusual to receive your salary in loans and is clearly a method used to avoid paying tax.\u201d Such arguments enrage the people who have received the bills, who argue that they often had little or no choice when they were working as a contractor but to enter into these schemes. They are astounded at the retrospective nature of the charges, often dating back more than a decade, long after their tax returns were officially closed, as well as HMRC\u2019s refusal to accept reduced settlements, and what they say is their inability to challenge the charge. Richard Horsley is co-founder of the Loan Charge Action Group. He says that many IT contractors such as himself fell into the loan schemes following measures at the end of the 1990s, known as IR35, to close tax loopholes used by some contractors. \u201cAt the time, tax professionals and QCs came up with solutions where we went on to PAYE for a portion of our earnings, while another portion was a loan, which was not taxable. We asked if it was legal and were told yes. If we knew it was illegal we would never have allowed ourselves into it.\u201d He says in his case it meant that effectively 25% of his earnings went in deductions for tax, interest on the loans and the scheme promoter\u2019s fees. But now he is subject to loan charges that effectively mean he will end up paying around 80% tax on his earnings for the period. Another campaigner, who wished to remain anonymous, says: \u201cWe are just the fall guys. I was completely hoodwinked by the scheme administrators, and I feel that HMRC should have acted much, much sooner to advise me that these schemes were not legal. Genuinely naive contractors are being treated like horribly aggressive tax avoiders.\u201d Why, he argues, is HMRC not going after the promoters of the schemes, many of which made millions, but have subsequently dissolved their companies? Even the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which fights the corner for the low-paid and those on welfare, says in its guide to the charge that \u201csome agency workers may have had little choice to participate in such schemes, if they wanted to work.\u201d Many MPs are now backing the loan charge workers. This week saw the launch of the all-party parliamentary loan charge group, chaired by Sir Ed Davey MP. He says: \u201cThere has been considerable concern raised about the loan charge by MPs and peers. With tens of thousands of people facing life-changing bills, it is vital that the loan charge is properly examined before it comes into effect on 5 April.\u201d Inside government, those in charge of collecting the levy see it very differently. Officials speak of an unprecedented campaign by those affected by the tax charge, talking darkly about how their social media accounts are bombarded with messages, how anyone who dares to defend the charge is attacked, and how HMRC workers have been individually targeted. We asked HMRC to justify why it is reaching so far back in time for payments, and why it did not act earlier to stop the schemes \u2013 and the bills that have now racked up for contractors. It says: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that these schemes do not work, warning against the use of tax avoidance schemes in the media and in publications such as our Spotlight series on gov.uk as early as 2009. HMRC have opened tens of thousands of inquiries into these schemes starting before 1999, making users and their representatives aware that their tax return was under investigation.\u201d It argues that the loan charge is not retrospective. It said: \u201cIt is unfair to ordinary taxpayers to let anybody benefit from contrived tax avoidance of this sort, and that is why the government has taken action to ensure that everybody pays the taxes they owe. \u201cThe charge on disguised remuneration (DR) loans is not retrospective. It is a new charge, arising at a future date, on loan balances outstanding at that date. It does not change the tax position of any previous year or the outcome of any open compliance checks. Its announcement at budget 2016 provided scheme users with a three-year period to repay their DR loans, or to agree a settlement with HMRC before the charge takes effect.\u201d It denies that it is not chasing the scheme promoters. \u201cSince the formation of HMRC\u2019s fraud investigation service on 1 April 2016, more than 15 individuals have been convicted for offences relating to arrangements which have been promoted and marketed as tax avoidance schemes and sentenced to over 95 years custodial.\u201d Burned by suggestions that it is chasing low-income locum nurses and social workers, HMRC analysed the occupations of the people sent charge notices. \u201cWe estimate that of the 50,000 people affected, 3% are nurses and less than 2% are social workers.\u201d",

They recommended it to me, repeatedly. It was like American pulp fiction, they said, but also like French literary theory. I bought it. I tried reading it, repeatedly. I would get 40 pages into Auster\u2019s parboiled prose about doppelgangsters looking for private dicks called Auster and then I would stop, and stopping would feel good.</p> <p>I had been reading a completely different novel from my friends: this was probably my failure rather than theirs. And Auster wrote much better later on. (Or so the same friends tell me.)</p> <p>With <em>Muscle</em>, the Scottish writer Alan Trotter has written the book my friends were recommending \u2013 or, at least, the one I thought they were recommending. It does what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/fiction.paulauster\" title=\"\"><em>City of Glass </em></a>promised to do: takes Raymond Chandler, Albert Camus, Philip K Dick and Patricia Highsmith and pummels them together into something not entirely new but exquisitely fresh.</p> <p>Most of the book is narrated by Box, who is muscle for hire. He punches, stabs and burns his way through the novel, a couple of paces behind his partner-in-crime. This character\u2019s name is never revealed, appearing only as \u201c______\u201d. The two of them maraud around a nameless city in a noir version of 1950s America, where men wear homburgs and are good at violence.</p> <p>When a writer enters this literary territory, they are instantly going toe-to-toe with Raymond Chandler. You need strength, then technique, but you also need grace. The first part of the noir sentence is easy enough to pull off: it gets action done minimally but elegantly. It\u2019s the set-up punch: \u201cHis moustache twitched \u2026\u201d Any writer can write that. But then you get to the pivotal word \u201clike\u201d. After this, you\u2019re on your own. You have to deliver the follow-through. Trotter\u2019s moustache-twitching sentence continues, \u201c\u2026 like a car veering into oncoming traffic\u201d. It\u2019s balanced, light on its toes \u2013 a sweet punch. Chandler might win on points, but this fight could go the distance.</p> <p><em>Muscle</em> \u2013 Trotter\u2019s debut novel \u2013 isn\u2019t ring-ready from the opening bell. The first pages, which deal with another couple of remorseless killers called Hector and Charles, read as if a few hundred words of crime fiction have been pinged back and forth through Google Translate. But then Box takes over the story, and the one-twos start to come. \u201cAs we turned the tallest peak, the city seemed to tip out in front of me like dark paint down a glass hill.\u201d That sneaky jab made me smile: yes, it\u2019s another city of glass, but it\u2019s not Auster\u2019s. And here\u2019s a sentence that really made me slap-happy: \u201cThe larger [man] had a nose that had been broken so many times it lay flat on his face like roadkill.\u201d</p> <p>Most of <em>Muscle</em> passed in a daze of pure reading pleasure. There are descriptions here that not only fit their emotional moment to perfection but seem to convey an action, a thing, as well as it\u2019s ever been done. Here is a woman getting a light: \u201cShe reached toward me and picked my cigarette from my lips. She put its lit end to the unlit end of her own and inhaled, pulling the air back up the cigarette, through the flame \u2013 which growled and chewed into her cigarette \u2013 and then up through it, into herself.\u201d</p> <p>This is not in any believable way the language of a musclehead. But the main plot involves Box becoming friendly with and then profoundly influenced by Holcomb, a writer of Philip K Dick-esque pulp science fiction about time travel, parallel universes and existential devastation. Holcomb is also defined by the way he smokes. \u201cHe was the sort that holds a cigarette only in ways that don\u2019t quite make sense, like they\u2019ve over-thought the whole exercise and now worry it won\u2019t be impressive enough just to hold a cigarette.\u201d The final fifth of the book swerves unpredictably, but I\u2019d say successfully, into a mind-meld of Box\u2019s possible pasts and impossible futures. </p> <p>As with the best pulp fiction, there\u2019s serious existential heft here. The force of the melancholy can catch you off guard. \u201cThis is always the thing, this is the tide we cannot swim against \u2013 that we always have to find somewhere to be. You chew down the tiredness until it chokes you, you keep finding somewhere to be until you\u2019re excused, finally.\u201d Trotter is a very fine writer, and <em>Muscle</em> is an unadulterated ultraviolent delight.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Toby Litt\u2019s Wrestliana is published by Galley Beggar.

The first part of the noir sentence is easy enough to pull off: it gets action done minimally but elegantly. It\u2019s the set-up punch: \u201cHis moustache twitched \u2026\u201d Any writer can write that. But then you get to the pivotal word \u201clike\u201d. After this, you\u2019re on your own. You have to deliver the follow-through. Trotter\u2019s moustache-twitching sentence continues, \u201c\u2026 like a car veering into oncoming traffic\u201d. It\u2019s balanced, light on its toes \u2013 a sweet punch. Chandler might win on points, but this fight could go the distance. Muscle \u2013 Trotter\u2019s debut novel \u2013 isn\u2019t ring-ready from the opening bell. The first pages, which deal with another couple of remorseless killers called Hector and Charles, read as if a few hundred words of crime fiction have been pinged back and forth through Google Translate. But then Box takes over the story, and the one-twos start to come. \u201cAs we turned the tallest peak, the city seemed to tip out in front of me like dark paint down a glass hill.\u201d That sneaky jab made me smile: yes, it\u2019s another city of glass, but it\u2019s not Auster\u2019s. And here\u2019s a sentence that really made me slap-happy: \u201cThe larger [man] had a nose that had been broken so many times it lay flat on his face like roadkill.\u201d Most of Muscle passed in a daze of pure reading pleasure. There are descriptions here that not only fit their emotional moment to perfection but seem to convey an action, a thing, as well as it\u2019s ever been done. Here is a woman getting a light: \u201cShe reached toward me and picked my cigarette from my lips. She put its lit end to the unlit end of her own and inhaled, pulling the air back up the cigarette, through the flame \u2013 which growled and chewed into her cigarette \u2013 and then up through it, into herself.\u201d This is not in any believable way the language of a musclehead. But the main plot involves Box becoming friendly with and then profoundly influenced by Holcomb, a writer of Philip K Dick-esque pulp science fiction about time travel, parallel universes and existential devastation. Holcomb is also defined by the way he smokes. \u201cHe was the sort that holds a cigarette only in ways that don\u2019t quite make sense, like they\u2019ve over-thought the whole exercise and now worry it won\u2019t be impressive enough just to hold a cigarette.\u201d The final fifth of the book swerves unpredictably, but I\u2019d say successfully, into a mind-meld of Box\u2019s possible pasts and impossible futures. As with the best pulp fiction, there\u2019s serious existential heft here. The force of the melancholy can catch you off guard. \u201cThis is always the thing, this is the tide we cannot swim against \u2013 that we always have to find somewhere to be. You chew down the tiredness until it chokes you, you keep finding somewhere to be until you\u2019re excused, finally.\u201d Trotter is a very fine writer, and Muscle is an unadulterated ultraviolent delight. \u2022 Toby Litt\u2019s Wrestliana is published by Galley Beggar.

      "body": "<p>Have some banks, or their legal representatives, been faking signatures on UK court documents used to repossess people\u2019s homes and to recover other debts?</p> <p>It\u2019s a serious charge, but a new campaign group claims there has been \u201calleged industrial-scale forgery\u201d of signatures. And the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign has some powerful supporters in high places. The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking \u2013 a cross-party group of MPs and peers \u2013 publicly voiced its support this month, as did the high-profile police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, Anthony Stansfeld.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a signature expert told Guardian Money: \u201cThe whole thing is highly suspicious.\u201d</p> <p>If the campaign\u2019s claims are true, it would mean a multibillion-dollar scandal that played out in the US was being repeated in the UK (see box).</p> <p>Julian Watts, the man behind the campaign, says big banks and lenders are linked to documents carrying questionable signatures, and that, in some cases, people were evicted as a direct result.</p> <p>He has amassed a dossier of signatures purporting to be by one person that sometimes appear to be very different.

      "bodyText": "Have some banks, or their legal representatives, been faking signatures on UK court documents used to repossess people\u2019s homes and to recover other debts? It\u2019s a serious charge, but a new campaign group claims there has been \u201calleged industrial-scale forgery\u201d of signatures. And the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign has some powerful supporters in high places. The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking \u2013 a cross-party group of MPs and peers \u2013 publicly voiced its support this month, as did the high-profile police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, Anthony Stansfeld. Meanwhile, a signature expert told Guardian Money: \u201cThe whole thing is highly suspicious.\u201d If the campaign\u2019s claims are true, it would mean a multibillion-dollar scandal that played out in the US was being repeated in the UK (see box). Julian Watts, the man behind the campaign, says big banks and lenders are linked to documents carrying questionable signatures, and that, in some cases, people were evicted as a direct result. He has amassed a dossier of signatures purporting to be by one person that sometimes appear to be very different. He is asking people to send in photos or photocopies of signatures on bank or company court documents so they can be examined. The central allegation of the campaign, running on Facebook and Twitter, is that signatures on some UK court documents appear to have been forged \u2013 that is, not signed by the person whose printed name appears under the \u201cstatement of truth\u201d (the bit that typically says something like \u201cI believe the facts stated in this document are true\u201d). It is claimed that in some cases, employees at the law firms acting on behalf of the banks or the bank\u2019s representatives, may have faked them in order to speed up the legal process. For example, it might be that the case handler whose name is on the documents was off sick or on holiday when they needed to be signed, so other members of staff simply signed that person\u2019s name in order to keep the process moving. Handwriting expert Adam Brand has viewed some of the documents and says they definitely appear worthy of further investigation, adding: \u201cThere certainly appears to be a case here, although further extensive work is going to be needed.\u201d Money asked Brand \u2013 a forensic handwriting analyst \u2013 to comment on one set we were shown. They relate to a home repossession, and all the signatures \u2013 in this case, a squiggle \u2013 were supposedly made by the same person. Yet there are arguably variations. Brand told us that someone who had adopted a reduced signature, or squiggle, would tend to stick to that same signature. \u201cHere we have a totally inconsistent situation. Purely from a common-sense point of view it is unreasonable.\u201d However, both the individual named on the documents, and the law firm that employed them, have firmly rejected any suggestions that multiple people had signed in the employee\u2019s name. Giving its support to the campaign, the APPG on fair business banking, co-chaired by Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, says it \u201creceives frequent and consistent representations from constituents with concerns over the forgery of signatures\u201d. It adds: \u201cThis campaign will provide a vital method of gathering evidence of possible signature forgeries by UK banks in court documents.\u201d Some may take the view that even if this did happen, it is hardly the crime of the century, while others may feel that the campaign\u2019s real agenda is trying to help people wriggle out of their debts on a technicality. But Watts rejects this and says it is more than just a technicality: \u201cWhile it\u2019s fine for people to pp letters, people cannot pp the signature on court documents such as witness statements ... signed \u2018statements of truth\u2019 are a foundational aspect of the justice system.\u201d He says that if it was conclusively proved that signature forgery had taken place, \u201cpeople may have been fraudulently evicted from their homes, or had court judgments fraudulently secured against them for other consumer debt\u201d. It is fair to say that faking a signature on a \u201cstatement of truth\u201d is a very serious business: in late 2017 a UK solicitor was struck off for \u2013 among other things \u2013 directing other members of staff to fake signatures on witness statements. The official ruling in that case stated that \u201cthe seriousness of the misconduct is at the highest level ... the dishonesty was of such gravity that public confidence in the profession would no doubt be undermined were the public to learn of what occurred.\u201d However, it should also be pointed out that Watts is no impartial observer: he has an axe to grind in that he and his wife have been the subject of several bank court cases.

One of these practices was known as \u201crobo-signing\u201d, where some staff signed someone else\u2019s name, or signed documents they hadn\u2019t even read, to speed up the foreclosure process. In one article about fake signatures on American mortgage documents, Associated Press reported that \u201cone name, \u2018Linda Green,\u2019 was signed almost two dozen different ways\u201d.",

It\u2019s one of her best performances: subtle, simmering; a study in the sexual politics of prestige that doesn\u2019t offer up everything at once but keeps you guessing. She plays Joan Castleman, the middle-aged wife of a conceited, Bellow-type Nobel prize-winning novelist, who must smilingly stand alongside him while he tells fawning interviewers that his wife never had any literary ambitions of her own.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81IM0loH7o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d81IM0loH7o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Best actor</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong><em>Christian Bale \u2013 Vice; Bradley Cooper \u2013 A Star Is Born; Willem Dafoe \u2013 At Eternity\u2019s Gate; Rami Malek \u2013 Bohemian Rhapsody; Viggo Mortensen \u2013 Green Book</em></p> <p>I\u2019m voting with my heart rather than my head here, but Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born gives such a huge, chest-busting performance: not chewing the scenery, but soaking it with manly tears and making it more digestible. He builds on the role played in the film\u2019s previous versions by Kris Kristofferson, James Mason and Frederic March: the giant star on the skids who mentors and falls in love with a young singer (Lady Gaga) and has to be content with her rocketing to superstar fame while he slides into failure.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSbzyEJ8X9E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nSbzyEJ8X9E?start=2&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2><strong>Best supporting actress</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong> <em>Amy Adams \u2013 Vice; Marina de Tavira \u2013 Roma; Regina King \u2013 If Beale Street Could Talk; Emma Stone \u2013 The Favourite; Rachel Weisz \u2013 The Favourite</em></p> <p>Regina King in If Beale Street Could Talk gives a quietly excellent performance in Barry Jenkins\u2019s fine adaptation of the James Baldwin novel.

Not backing Olivia Colman is now practically a treasonable offence, but Glenn Close in The Wife inches into pole position. It\u2019s one of her best performances: subtle, simmering; a study in the sexual politics of prestige that doesn\u2019t offer up everything at once but keeps you guessing. She plays Joan Castleman, the middle-aged wife of a conceited, Bellow-type Nobel prize-winning novelist, who must smilingly stand alongside him while he tells fawning interviewers that his wife never had any literary ambitions of her own.

He builds on the role played in the film\u2019s previous versions by Kris Kristofferson, James Mason and Frederic March: the giant star on the skids who mentors and falls in love with a young singer (Lady Gaga) and has to be content with her rocketing to superstar fame while he slides into failure.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Yorkshire Sculpture Park</strong></h2> <p>As we head up out of the trees by the lake, the snow comes down and for a few minutes we can see nothing but the grey shapes of sheep as they huddle together. I even mistake the ovine drinking trough for a piece of modern art, an error that could probably only happen here in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 500 acres of parkland, pasture and lake where on your winter walk you are as likely to bump into a Highland cow or Texel ewe as a Gormley or Caro.</p> <p>Wilf, my terrier, thinks he knows which is more interesting, delivering a stinging jet of canine criticism towards Ai Weiwei\u2019s <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/ai-weiwei-circle-of-animals-/-zodiac-heads\" title=\"\">Zodiac Heads</a>. What Wilf lacks in artistic nous, however, he makes up for in appreciation of the walk, recognising a good yomp when he sees one. We had started at the car park, passing Barbara Hepworth\u2019s <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/openair/barbarahepworth/familyofman\" title=\"\">Family of Man</a>, then looped around the various gallery buildings. There was plenty to see around these outlying buildings: we got sidetracked by a multicoloured octopus and a video installation, but finally dropped down to the Cascade Bridge and then up into the snowstorm on the hill.</p> <p>Not all the park is available to dog-walkers unfortunately. We are going to abandon the hound later in order to see Jaume Plensa\u2019s <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/jaumeplensa\" title=\"\">Wilsis</a>, a seven-metre-tall head by the lake. In the meantime we press on, climbing to the Longside Gallery (closed in winter) then on to a wooded ridge where Andy Goldsworthy has constructed <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/openair/andygoldsworthy/hangingtrees\" title=\"\">Hanging Trees</a>, three stone-walled rectangles, each containing a dead tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b82a4e2b0c29bdb90b90b3034b3c09aff2483067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b82a4e2b0c29bdb90b90b3034b3c09aff2483067/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilf the writer's dog checks out a Henry moore sculpture at Yorkshire Sculpture Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilf checks out a Henry Moore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The joy of this walk is partly in the conversation and debate. I\u2019m with someone who loathes Goldsworthy\u2019s \u201cbouldery balderdash\u201d while I am a committed fan of his subtle stonework. Our verbal battle keeps the cold at bay all the way down through beautiful beech woods, back to the lake where we find Henry Moore. His bronzes really are the tour-de-force moments of the entire park and are given centre stage on the broad lawns below the visitor centre. And so we complete our first circuit, a 90-minute loop, depending on how fast you walk while smiling appreciatively, or shaking your fist, at large random objects.</p> <p>We pop Wilf back into the car and stride out for the shorter lakeside route, which is definitely worth the extra effort, although I am adamant that the frozen lake with swans beats any human artistic effort \u2013 another heated debate to keep us going. I\u2019m also quite taken with the endeavours of a previous generation: the park was once home to a formidable branch of the Wentworth family who loved nothing better than constructing follies, inserting all kinds of pyramids, grottoes and grotesque stony nonsense into the woods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"403b7af3fa59ffd0b2d31b962e19973d9154fa65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/403b7af3fa59ffd0b2d31b962e19973d9154fa65/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wilf on the ridge in the snow at, Yorkshire Sculpture Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilf on the ridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I suggest that they did \u201cgarden furniture\u201d with more humour and skill than all the pompous modern artists, we are propelled all the way back up the hill on a tidal wave of discussion.</p> <p>And there we reach the cafe, a lovely minimalist hunk of concrete with spectacular views \u2013 or a hideous brutalist nightmare \u2013 depending on your point of view. And there, at long last, we reach full agreement: both the curried parsnip soup and the coffee walnut cake are excellent. <br>\u2022 <em>Free entry, car parking \u00a311 for the day, </em><em> <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ysp.org.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d66e40a5d20cac0f96d40c513554533556ff0eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d66e40a5d20cac0f96d40c513554533556ff0eda/0_145_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"suspended stained glass panel, Forest of Dean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Window dressing \u2026 suspended stained glass panel, Forest of Dean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gretchen Mattison/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the UK\u2019s first sculpture trails, this one provides some big-hitting names \u2013 Cornelia Parker and Ian Hamilton Finlay are here \u2013 plus three good walks of between two and five miles.

We take the tunnel on Park Street, turning right as we emerge into Shaw\u2019s Passage, then left up Allison Street and right into Bordesley Street, for the first graffiti by Philth and by Panda himself.

      "bodyText": "Yorkshire Sculpture Park As we head up out of the trees by the lake, the snow comes down and for a few minutes we can see nothing but the grey shapes of sheep as they huddle together. I even mistake the ovine drinking trough for a piece of modern art, an error that could probably only happen here in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 500 acres of parkland, pasture and lake where on your winter walk you are as likely to bump into a Highland cow or Texel ewe as a Gormley or Caro. Wilf, my terrier, thinks he knows which is more interesting, delivering a stinging jet of canine criticism towards Ai Weiwei\u2019s Zodiac Heads. What Wilf lacks in artistic nous, however, he makes up for in appreciation of the walk, recognising a good yomp when he sees one. We had started at the car park, passing Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Family of Man, then looped around the various gallery buildings. There was plenty to see around these outlying buildings: we got sidetracked by a multicoloured octopus and a video installation, but finally dropped down to the Cascade Bridge and then up into the snowstorm on the hill. Not all the park is available to dog-walkers unfortunately. We are going to abandon the hound later in order to see Jaume Plensa\u2019s Wilsis, a seven-metre-tall head by the lake. In the meantime we press on, climbing to the Longside Gallery (closed in winter) then on to a wooded ridge where Andy Goldsworthy has constructed Hanging Trees, three stone-walled rectangles, each containing a dead tree. The joy of this walk is partly in the conversation and debate. I\u2019m with someone who loathes Goldsworthy\u2019s \u201cbouldery balderdash\u201d while I am a committed fan of his subtle stonework. Our verbal battle keeps the cold at bay all the way down through beautiful beech woods, back to the lake where we find Henry Moore. His bronzes really are the tour-de-force moments of the entire park and are given centre stage on the broad lawns below the visitor centre. And so we complete our first circuit, a 90-minute loop, depending on how fast you walk while smiling appreciatively, or shaking your fist, at large random objects. We pop Wilf back into the car and stride out for the shorter lakeside route, which is definitely worth the extra effort, although I am adamant that the frozen lake with swans beats any human artistic effort \u2013 another heated debate to keep us going. I\u2019m also quite taken with the endeavours of a previous generation: the park was once home to a formidable branch of the Wentworth family who loved nothing better than constructing follies, inserting all kinds of pyramids, grottoes and grotesque stony nonsense into the woods. When I suggest that they did \u201cgarden furniture\u201d with more humour and skill than all the pompous modern artists, we are propelled all the way back up the hill on a tidal wave of discussion. And there we reach the cafe, a lovely minimalist hunk of concrete with spectacular views \u2013 or a hideous brutalist nightmare \u2013 depending on your point of view. And there, at long last, we reach full agreement: both the curried parsnip soup and the coffee walnut cake are excellent. \u2022 Free entry, car parking \u00a311 for the day, ysp.org.uk Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail One of the UK\u2019s first sculpture trails, this one provides some big-hitting names \u2013 Cornelia Parker and Ian Hamilton Finlay are here \u2013 plus three good walks of between two and five miles. Given the age of the site (it was started in 1986), some of the sculptures do look a bit weathered, in fact some have been \u201cdecommissioned\u201d and are gently disappearing into the forest. Sixteen pieces, however, remain. Worth seeking out is Kevin Atherton\u2019s Cathedral, which uses stained glass to create a sense of awe in what is one of Britain\u2019s finest ancient forests, the real star of the fine walks. The start/finish \u2013 point at Beechenhurst Lodge also has a good cafe and play area. \u2022 Free entry, car parking \u00a35 a day (\u00a34 a day weekends), forestofdean-sculpture.org.uk The Sculpture Park, Surrey This 100-acre park lies at the western end of the North Downs, six miles south of Farnham. About 800 sculptures are dotted throughout the woodland and around various lakes with several marked walks. It\u2019s an eclectic mix: expect the mythical and wacky alongside super-serious pieces \u2013 something for everyone. There are plenty of colourful, fun things to keep the children amused, and, if you are truly moved, there are lots of pieces on sale. Visitors are encouraged to bring picnics, but you may find the Bel and Dragon pub opposite the entrance a warmer location. There is also the Orchard Barn Cafe a mile down the road. \u2022 Adult \u00a310, child (4-15) \u00a35, thesculpturepark.com Digbeth street art, Birmingham It could be the sheer quantity of canals \u2013 35 miles of them \u2013 that led to Birmingham\u2019s graffiti explosion. What better canvas than vast brick walls with few passersby? The cognoscenti reckons that Digbeth, just south-east of the city centre, has the best. Local graffiti artist Panda says: \u201cIt\u2019s got such a special mix of art: graffiti, of course, but also film locations, quirky shops, and architecture \u2013 I love it.\u201d In his company I start the walk at Selfridges (close to both New Street and Moor Street stations) . We take the tunnel on Park Street, turning right as we emerge into Shaw\u2019s Passage, then left up Allison Street and right into Bordesley Street, for the first graffiti by Philth and by Panda himself. Opposite is the old Typhoo Tea factory, site of graffiti by Stock and a recent location for Steven Spielberg\u2019s Ready Player One. We head up Canal Street and turn right on Fazeley Street for murals by Juice 126, Newso, Tempo 33 and G-Anders. Left on to the canal towpath, then right down the Grand Union canal takes us past an ever-changing roster of graffiti (\u201cwatch out for Fox by Annatomix\u201d). Coming off at Coventry Road, we then turn right into Upper Trinity and grab a coffee at Mutt Cycles (\u201ccoolest motorbike shop in the country\u201d) then on past lots of murals into Lower Trinity and the Custard Factory, where there\u2019s food at Kanteen, more graffiti and Panda\u2019s workshop, where I could learn to spray, too. \u2022 Free, self-guided: details, map and photos at walkruncycle.com Grizedale Forest, Cumbria Spread over 6,500 acres of forest between Coniston Water and Windermere, Grizedale is a big place with a good choice of trails. The artwork is geared toward wood, stone and fun, with plenty to divert the kids on a day out. Ridding Wood path is just a one-mile stroll, but highly recommended is the 10-mile Silurian Way, which will bag you a couple of dozen artworks. Begin at the visitor centre and follow the green-topped posts in a clockwise circuit that takes in Kerry Morrison\u2019s Some Fern, now getting pleasingly weathered, then on to Andy Goldsworthy\u2019s Taking a Wall for a Walk. Around halfway, in the village of Satterthwaite, there\u2019s a handy pub, the Eagle\u2019s Head, for a pie and a pint. Other sculptures worth seeking out are Our Lady of the Water by Alannah Robins and Richard Harris\u2019s contributions, Dry Stone Passage and Cliff Structure, both beautifully seasoned by moss and foliage these days. \u2022 Free entry, car parking \u00a38 for the day, grizedalesculpture.org Banksy\u2019s Bristol You can take a tour, or just go DIY as there is plenty of information online detailing the whereabouts of various original Banksy artworks.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s never been a better time to buy a top-of-the-line smartphone, with a large range of truly excellent phones available from a variety of different manufacturers starting at \u00a3500 and stretching to a wallet-busting \u00a31,000-plus. But with all that top-quality choice, it\u2019s difficult to know which one to buy. Here\u2019s a quick guide to get the best flagship phone for you right now. Huawei Mate 20 Pro RRP: \u00a3899 - deals from \u00a3650 The Chinese firm might be in the middle of a political storm, but that didn\u2019t stop Huawei from producing the most cutting-edge, feature-packed phone of 2018: the Mate 20 Pro. Headline features include 3D IR-based (the most secure kind) face recognition matching the iPhone XS, a pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint scanner and a brilliant triple-camera system on the back that is the best in the business. If that wasn\u2019t enough the Mate 20 Pro also has a huge and beautiful 6.38in OLED screen squeezed into a slim and curved body, which keeps the whole phone relatively easy to handle. Huawei\u2019s own Kirin 980 processor matches or bests rivals, while a large battery means it running for close to two days. When it does run out, it has really fast cable charging, fast wireless charging and it can even wirelessly charge another device with the flick of a switch. Verdict If you\u2019re going to blow the budget, this is the one to do it on, unless you\u2019re an iPhone diehard. Apple iPhone XS RRP: \u00a3999 - deals from \u00a3749 (with trade-in) The best iPhone available isn\u2019t the most expensive, nor is it, sadly, the cheapest. The iPhone XS is the middle of the road with best combination of features, size and that premium feel that makes and iPhone special, which it has to have costing this much. The 5.8in screen is stunning and both big enough for watching videos on the commute and small enough to easily hold and fit in your pocket. The dual camera system on the back is one of the best, the Face ID system works great (there\u2019s no Touch ID or home button anymore) and Apple\u2019s gesture navigation is the best in the business. Performance is top-notch, but battery life is only about a day compared to almost two for competitors. It still has Apple\u2019s Lightning connector, not the newer universal USB-C standard, but does have wireless charging and will get software support longer than any other phone here. Verdict If you want an Apple smartphone, the iPhone XS is the best, but it costs a pretty penny. OnePlus 6T RRP: \u00a3499 - deals from \u00a3440 OnePlus has made a name for itself by offering top phones that undercut the competition on price, and the latest OnePlus 6T is no exception. For around half the cost of a Huawei Mate 20 Pro or an iPhone XS you get a phone that\u2019s 90% as good. It has the big and beautiful 6.41in full HD+ OLED screen, slim bezels and a tiny notch for the selfie camera. It has a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner. It even has Qualcomm\u2019s top of the line processor and a battery that will last 1.5 days, plus super fast charging via cable. OnePlus doesn\u2019t skimp on the software either, with one of the best Android experiences you can get and three years of software updates from release. The only downsides are a camera that isn\u2019t quite as good as the top-priced models, no wireless charging and not formal water resistance. Verdict With a great Android experience second only to Google\u2019s, good battery, top performance and a gorgeous screen, the OnePlus 6T is hard to beat for \u00a3500. Honor View20 RRP: \u00a3499 Until recently the OnePlus 6T was the king of the cut-price flagship. Now it has some real competition in the form of the Honor View20. Made by Huawei\u2019s e-brand Honor, the View20 has a big, 6.4in full HD+ LCD screen that takes up the entire front with just a small hole in the top left corner for a selfie camera. It also has good battery life, super fast charging, a premium feel, a great rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and the same processor as Huawei\u2019s Mate 20 Pro making it fast and capable. On the back it has a new generation of 48-megapixel camera, which is really very good and a cut above the OnePlus 6T. The Android software experience is solid, but not on the same level as the OnePlus, but you get a similar two to three years of updates from release. It\u2019s even still got a headphone socket - a rarity in 2019. Verdict If you want the best camera for under \u00a3500, the Honor View20 is a cracking performer that feels and operates like a phone that\u2019s much more expensive. Google Pixel 3 RRP: \u00a3739 - deals from \u00a3550 As the Android-marker, the Pixel 3 is Google showing what can be done when you create both the hardware and software together, just as Apple does. And as a result it has the best, most polished Android experience going. The hardware more or less matches the competition on specifications, but lacks any truly cutting-edge additions. Instead you get advanced software, a brilliant single camera and Android updates first with software support guaranteed through October 2021.

The downside is you have to put up with battery that doesn\u2019t quite match up to the competition lasting only about a day, but at least it has fast cable and wireless charging. There\u2019s a bigger sibling, the Pixel 3 XL, but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is better all round at that size. Verdict The Google Pixel 3 offers a first-class experience and is the best smaller Android phone currently available. The runners up - watch out for deals Samsung Galaxy S9 Samsung is due to replace the Galaxy S9 next week, but if you can find it for \u00a3400 or less it could be a good deal. The larger S9+ could also be a worth looking at. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 The Galaxy Note 9 is Samsung\u2019s huge, stylus-equipped productivity beast that\u2019s overkill for most, but if you need a phone to do everything, this is it. Huawei P20 Pro Huawei\u2019s original hit, the P20 Pro is due to be replaced in the next couple of months, but is still a great phone with a camera that rivals the excellent one on the Mate 20 Pro and can be picked up for as little as \u00a3430. Dual-sim versions are available. Apple iPhone X If you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a3999 on the iPhone XS and the \u00a3749 iPhone XR just doesn\u2019t cut it, Apple\u2019s selling last year\u2019s smash hit, the iPhone X for \u00a3769 refurbished.

      "bodyText": "The UK is on \u201cthe wrong side of the law\u201d by sanctioning arms exports to Saudi Arabia for the war in Yemen and should suspend some of the export licences, an all-party Lords committee has said. The report by the international relations select committee says ministers are not making independent checks to see if arms supplied by the UK are being used in breach of the law, but is instead relying on inadequate investigations by the Saudis, its allies in the war. It describes the humanitarian plight of Yemenis as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. It is the first unanimous report from a parliamentary committee describing Saudi arms export sales as unlawful, and comes ahead of an imminent high court appeal by campaigners to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia on the grounds they are in breach of humanitarian law. The report places no legal obligation on ministers, but is likely to add indirectly to the pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to seek a way out of the war in Yemen through negotiation, rather than further military offensives to dislodge Houthi rebels in the capital Sana\u2019a and the port city of Hodeidah. Although a patchy ceasefire holds around Hodeidah, Saudi airstrikes are reported by the Yemen Data Project to be at their most intensive since the four-year civil war began in Saada governorate along the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The US Congress voted earlier this week to suspend US arms sales to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen, but the White House has signalled the president will veto the resolution if necessary. The Lords\u2019 international relations committee concludes following a short inquiry: \u201cThe government asserts that, in its licensing of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, it is narrowly on the right side of international humanitarian law. Although conclusive evidence is not yet available, we assess that it is narrowly on the wrong side: given the volume and type of arms being exported to the Saudi-led coalition, we believe they are highly likely to be the cause of significant civilian casualties in Yemen, risking the contravention of international humanitarian law.\u201d The committee also asserts that the UK \u201cshould immediately condemn any further violations of international humanitarian law by the Saudi-led coalition, including the blocking of food and medical supplies, and be prepared to suspend some key export licences to members of the coalition\u201d. It adds it is \u201cdeeply concerned that the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s misuse of the weaponry is causing \u2013 whether deliberately or accidentally \u2013 loss of civilian life. \u201cRelying on assurances by Saudi Arabia and Saudi-led review processes is not an adequate way of implementing the obligations for a risk-based assessment set out in the arms trade treaty.\u201d The committee, chaired by the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Howell, describes the British as supporters of the Saudis in the civil war. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has taken up the search for a peace settlement in Yemen as his single most important priority, apart from Brexit, and travelled to Warsaw this week to meet with Saudi, UAE and US ministers to discuss the state of the limited Yemen ceasefire negotiated in Stockholm in December. The joint statement issued by the four countries following their talks was sharply critical of the Houthis adherence to the Stockholm agreement, but nevertheless agreed to do more to stabilise the Yemen economy in the north. However, the peers urge the UK to be more active. The committee, including senior former diplomats, says: \u201cThe government should give much higher priority to resolving \u2013 not just mitigating \u2013 this situation, particularly in light of the tension between its support for the Saudi-led coalition and its role as a major donor of humanitarian relief to those affected by the conflict.\u201d In its latest update on the war, the NGO International Crisis Group says: \u201cThough the battle for the Red Sea port and city of Hodeidah is paused until the UN-brokered deal to demilitarise the area succeeds or collapses, fighting on other fronts has intensified, particularly along the Saudi-Yemeni border ...

Rayner will also unveil a new policy to improve the ethnic diversity of staff in higher education, with the reformed regulator given specific powers to address inequality as part of Labour\u2019s plans for a national education service. \u201cLike much of our establishment, our universities are too male, pale and stale and do not represent the communities that they serve or modern Britain,\u201d Rayner will say. \u201cWomen and staff from ethnic minority backgrounds are chronically under-represented across these institutions, and in particular at the most senior levels. \u201cUniversities must do much more, and under Labour they will be held to account.\u201d The regulator would be required to enforce a commitment to a 20:1 pay ratio between the highest and lowest paid members of staff in universities, while vice-chancellors would be barred from sitting on the committees that set their pay. Sources say that Labour hasn\u2019t ruled out scrapping the OfS and replacing it if the regulator is unable to adapt, with Rayner saying that the OfS is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Rayner\u2019s speech will also take aim at statements by the higher education minister Chris Skidmore, who said some institutions \u201cmay exit the market altogether as a result of strong competition\u201d and that increased choice for students \u201cdoes not equate to propping up any particular failing HE provider\u201d. In the past year a number of universities have announced multi-million pound deficits and are having to cut budgets and staff as a result of the cut-throat competition for students. \u201cThese are not profit-making private companies that can simply be left at the mercy of market forces. Ministers cannot simply bury their heads in the sand when we\u2019re faced with losing some of these vital institutions,\u201d Rayner is to say. \u201cStudents would be left with immense uncertainty about their futures and entire communities would lose one of their major academic, economic, and social institutions in the event of bankruptcy.\u201d Under Labour the regulator would be set an explicit objective to avoid the bankruptcy of any higher education provider in England, and given powers to make emergency loans and replace senior management in the event of severe difficulties. Matt Waddup, the UCU\u2019s head of policy, said: \u201cAngela Rayner is right to highlight the damage that this government\u2019s marketisation agenda is doing to further and higher education. \u201cWhile students and staff are central to the social and economic future of this country, their views are habitually ignored by both ministers and the OfS.\u201d Labour\u2019s stance means the OfS may have a relatively short lifespan, having only come into existence last year. Its first days were beset by difficulty, thanks to the controversy over Toby Young\u2019s appointment to its board, and it has been slow to fulfil some of its key obligations. In response, Skidmore said: \u201cI\u2019ve yet to find a vice-chancellor who supports Labour\u2019s plans to damage the sector and roll back progress that has been made in recent years. \u201cUnder the Conservatives there are more 18-year-olds in higher education than ever before, including more students from disadvantaged backgrounds being the first in their family to go to university.\u201d",

The house was brimful with family, but it was earlier than most people get up on a weekend. (\u201cI\u2019m a morning person,\u201d says Wintour, for whom anything later than 5am constitutes a lie-in.) As she prepared to serve, she heard a car pull up. \u201cI am pretty OCD about guests and where they are sleeping. I thought, I\u2019m not expecting anyone else, I don\u2019t have any more rooms. Who is this? And then I thought \u2013 that looks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer\" title=\"\">Roger [Federer</a>, with whom Wintour is good friends]. And that looks like [his wife] Mirka. And that looks like their twins.\u201d Wintour\u2019s daughter Bee Shaffer, it transpired, had arranged for a Federer-Wintour family tennis tournament, \u201cwhich was the best gift a daughter could give a tennis-mad mother. I got to play doubles with Roger for the first time in our very long friendship, against my two nephews.\u201d Twenty-five floors above Manhattan, behind the ebonised mahogany <a href=\"https://thejoyofdesign.net/Alan-Buchsbaum\" title=\"\">Alan Buchsbaum</a> desk from which she has ruled the fashion world for three decades, she leans back in her chair and smiles at the memory. \u201cWe won, of course.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"603ecd6c613af9dd37a38a7b22120afd240c1630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/603ecd6c613af9dd37a38a7b22120afd240c1630/0_38_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, goes over page layouts at the magazine\u2019s offices in New York, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, goes over page layouts at the magazine\u2019s offices in New York, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joyce Dopkeen/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course. Anna Wintour plays to win in everything she does. She is editor-in-chief of American Vogue and <a href=\"https://www.condenast.com/about/#dame-anna-wintour\" title=\"\">artistic director of parent company Cond\u00e9 Nast</a>, but her job titles do not come close to describing her iconic status. Vogue has been a launchpad from which she has powered herself to become a player in culture and politics. She is a fashion industry kingmaker, a Washington insider (Barack Obama\u2019s fourth-biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/anna-wintour-obama-funds-ambassador-london\" title=\"\">fundraiser in the 2012 campaign</a>), an art world luminary (<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2014/anna-wintour-costume-center\" title=\"\">the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum was renamed in her honour</a> in 2014) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/may/05/anna-wintour-editor-american-vogue-made-dame-queen-buckingham-palace\" title=\"\">a Dame</a> of the British Empire. And her haircut alone \u2013 as preternaturally unruffled and impenetrable up close as it looks in photographs \u2013 is recognisable from space.</p> <p>The Anna Wintour mythology is as much about power as it is about fashion. It owes a great deal to the 2006 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama\" title=\"\">The Devil Wears Prada</a> in which Meryl Streep\u2019s ice-queen editor, assumed to be a cartoonised Wintour, created a character that popular culture has thrilled to ever since. Such is her fame that a mere rumour of her departure is enough to send shockwaves through the fashion and media worlds. (Last summer, these rose to such a clamour that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/condenast/status/1024392770272849920?lang=en\" title=\"\">Cond\u00e9 Nast issued a statement</a> confirming Wintour would remain at Vogue \u201cindefinitely\u201d.)</p> <p>Her office has an air of ambassadorial gentility. No industrial styling, no modish succulents. Definitely no treadmill desk. The south wall is glass, diffusing the room with silver light bouncing off the towers of the financial district. Framed photos of her son Charles and Bee, as children and as the thirtysomethings they are now, are prominently displayed on her desk, on the window ledge and between a pair of topiaried miniature trees standing sentry on the limewashed sideboard. A cornflower-blue ceramic vase is filled with fresh ranunculus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/titian\" title=\"\">Titian</a> reds and coppers; a glass pot holds sharpened HB pencils.

Wintour is wearing a calf-length <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/erdem\" title=\"\">Erdem</a> dress in dark silk with a bright floral print, collared with two sparkling necklaces. A blush pink coat and a jade green scarf are thrown over a corner chair next to a small <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a> black leather tote. With characteristic briskness, she has already wrapped her portrait shoot with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/08/tyler-mitchell-the-photographer-who-made-history-with-beyonce\" title=\"\">Tyler Mitchell</a>, who last year became the first black person to shoot a Vogue cover when he photographed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> for Wintour\u2019s September issue. \u201cHe\u2019s charming, he\u2019s intelligent \u2013 I\u2019ve been impressed by what he\u2019s said yes to, and what he\u2019s said no to,\u201d she says of Mitchell. \u201cAlso, he\u2019s quick.\u201d</p> <p>Before the shoot, she was watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/14/andy-murray-last-match-brilliant-finish-australian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">Andy Murray\u2019s match at the Australian Open</a> on television \u2013 his first after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-announces-impending-retirement-from-tennis-live\" title=\"\">announcing his retirement</a>. \u201cSo emotional,\u201d she says, gravely. Is it true that she herself plays tennis every day at 5am? \u201cI don\u2019t play tennis as much as I used to, but I get up every day between 4am and 5am, and I work out every day.\u201d (Her game is, she says, \u201cterrible! But I enjoy it.\u201d) While we\u2019re on the subject, this seems an opportune moment to verify some of the other Anna Wintour myths. What about spending only 20 minutes at parties? \u201cWell, it depends on the party. If it is fashion week, then most likely I will be in and out. But there have been many times I have stayed a lot longer, believe me.\u201d She is smiling, but her folded arms semaphore impatience to change the subject. I am sorry to say that I chicken out of asking her if it\u2019s true about eating medium rare steak for lunch every day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f79560dc9702ef38efcd14f6aa9db355243ace4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f79560dc9702ef38efcd14f6aa9db355243ace4/0_0_3239_5315/609.jpg\" alt=\"Edna Mode from The Incredibles bears a clear resemblance to Wintour.\" width=\"609\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edna Mode from The Incredibles bears a clear resemblance to Wintour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becoming a public figure in a way no other Vogue editor ever has been \u201cwasn\u2019t a conscious path\u201d, she insists. \u201cI don\u2019t work for Anna Wintour, I work for Cond\u00e9 Nast. I don\u2019t have any kind of social media accounts or look for personal recognition.\u201d But Wintour is instantly recognisable, thanks to a style that has remained almost unchanged since the 80s. Her sleek bob teamed with a sharp wit has often been a power combination, channelled by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/characters/nm0000235\" title=\"\">Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction</a>, by the diminutive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2011/jun/26/pixar-animation\" title=\"\">Edna Mode in The Incredibles</a> and by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a> at her most sassy. But the style was \u201cnot a strategic decision\u201d, Wintour insists. \u201cI feel comfortable with it, that\u2019s all. I am a creature of habit. Honestly, Jess, it\u2019s not something I spend any time thinking about at all. I come to the office and do my job.\u201d</p> <p>Wintour\u2019s image of cool, impermeable authority has become a blueprint for successful female leadership. I am sure I even caught something of Wintour\u2019s staccato delivery in the sardonic crispness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/23/mary-poppins-returns-review-emily-blunt-rob-marshall-ben-whishaw-lin-manuel-miranda\" title=\"\">Emily Blunt\u2019s Mary Poppins</a>. The notion raises a smile, but Wintour has a politician\u2019s sleight of hand when it comes to answering questions she doesn\u2019t like, segueing to her preferred talking points. She steers the conversation away from her own image and on to how Vogue is championing women in political leadership. \u201cI was very encouraged by our midterm results on that front. I believe women are taking control and standing up for what they believe in. We are in a moment of huge change.\u201d She reels off an impressive list of female politicians who have appeared in the magazine recently, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.underwoodforcongress.com/\" title=\"\">Lauren Underwood</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kirsten-gillibrand\" title=\"\">Kirsten Gillibrand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/kamala-harris-memoir-truths-we-hold\" title=\"\">Kamala Harris</a>.</p> <p>For the best part of two decades, Wintour\u2019s Vogue was closer to the White House than Vogue had ever been. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> became the first first lady to cover Vogue in 1998 \u2013 an honour not bestowed, even, on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis\" title=\"\">Jackie Kennedy</a> \u2013 and in 2016, Vogue endorsed her presidential candidacy, the first time the magazine had ever been publicly partisan. But it is the mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michelleobama\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama</a> that sends Wintour into raptures. \u201cWhat intrigued me and the rest of the world about Mrs Obama from the beginning was her poise, her intelligence, her grace, how articulate she was, and the sense that she gave of being a true partner to her husband. She was remarkable in so many ways \u2013 and still is, look at the incredible success of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/upcoming-prh-title-001.html\" title=\"\">her book</a> \u2013 and I was thrilled to see how she embraced fashion in such a democratic way. She would wear leggings one day, a designer gown the next, and look comfortable in both. She wasn\u2019t locked into one idea of how a first lady should dress. For Vogue, she was a gift.\u201d When the Met\u2019s Costume Institute was renamed in recognition of Wintour\u2019s work as a fundraiser and cheerleader, Michelle Obama cut the ribbon, saying, \u201cI\u2019m here because I have such respect and admiration for this woman, who I am proud to call my friend.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b08d170b14279ed39258942cd2e9cbc259bb9ae1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08d170b14279ed39258942cd2e9cbc259bb9ae1/0_0_6177_7617/811.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Wintour\" width=\"811\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wintour: \u2018Today\u2019s audience \u2026 wants journalism to take a stand.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Trump\u2019s election, Vogue has found itself in opposition, a position it has embraced with unexpected relish. <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/stormy-daniels-interview-michael-cohen-donald-trump\" title=\"\">The September issue</a> included a profile on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/stormy-daniels\" title=\"\">Stormy Daniels</a> (the adult film star who had a hush money deal with the president) which saw Daniels resplendent in evening gown and Tiffany diamonds, photographed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/annie-leibovitz\" title=\"\">Annie Leibovitz</a>. \u201cToday\u2019s audience \u2013 not just Vogue\u2019s audience, every audience \u2013 wants journalism to take a stand,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cPeople want to know what you believe in and what you stand for. In this time of fake news, when there is so much disregard for truth and value and for supporting those less fortunate than oneself, we have a moral obligation to stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>While Michelle Obama starred on three Vogue covers as first lady, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump\" title=\"\">Melania Trump</a> is still waiting for Wintour to call. Will Melania be in Vogue, I ask? \u201cMelania has been on the cover of Vogue,\u201d Wintour fires back without missing a beat. Indeed she has, in her wedding dress, in 2005, but not as first lady, representing the White House. \u201cWe do report on Melania consistently, on <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/?international\" title=\"\">vogue.com</a>,\u201d says Wintour. \u201cWhich is Vogue.\u201d Her inflection puts the emphasis firmly on the full stop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4656e82ae2c251a58059ded0433b644bc849460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4656e82ae2c251a58059ded0433b644bc849460/0_892_2715_1629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the Australian Open men\u2019s semifinals in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tennis-mad\u2019 \u2026 Wintour at the Australian Open men\u2019s semifinals in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Smith/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She picks up her mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask someone to bring me another coffee. Would you like one?\u201d I say no, and wait for her to make her call, but after a few seconds she raises an amused eyebrow at me. \u201cGo ahead. I can type and think at the same time, you know.\u201d She has texted the coffee request, I realise. As perfect as Wintour\u2019s manners are, I do not get the impression it would be wise to put them to the test by boring her. I try not to think about the scene in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/the-september-issue-review\" title=\"\">2009 Vogue documentary The September Issue</a> when Stefano Pilati, then designer of Yves Saint Laurent, withers under her stony-faced appraisal of his latest collection.</p> <p>Born in London in 1949 to a British father (Evening Standard editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/05/guardianobituaries.peterpreston\" title=\"\">Charles Wintour</a>) and an American mother, Wintour moved to New York in her 20s. She returned to London in 1985 to edit British Vogue, but was back in New York two years later. Her first issue as editor of American Vogue, in November 1988, featured a model wearing jeans, which famously caused the printers to call Vogue\u2019s office to check they had the right picture. It was an early signpost of the shift from fashion being \u201csomething that was directed at a small group, to becoming something that speaks to everyone. That has been the most extraordinary change that I have seen.\u201d As fashion has swelled to a powerful force in culture over the last three decades, Vogue has ridden the crest of that wave. A Vogue cover has become an official stamp not just of beauty, but of relevance. For <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/amal-clooney-vogue-cover-may-issue-2018\" title=\"\">Amal Clooney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018\" title=\"\">Serena Williams</a> and others, a Vogue cover has signalled a change in gear from success in their field to general superstardom. \u201cVogue stands for quality,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cTo be recognised by Vogue always has an impact.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"893282d5421e47edbd3034ef7b3d3a6a0a85547a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/893282d5421e47edbd3034ef7b3d3a6a0a85547a/92_0_5066_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The costume department of the New York Metropolitan Museum was renamed the Anna Wintour Costume Institute in 2014, and Mrs Obama cut the ribbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama cutting the ribbon of the Met\u2019s costume department, renamed the Anna Wintour Costume Institute in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Aquino/Penske Media/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1998, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/renee-zellweger\" title=\"\">Ren\u00e9e Zellweger</a> became the first non-model to cover an all-important September issue of Vogue (traditionally the biggest of the year). As the era of the supermodel waned, Wintour coached and coaxed a new generation of actresses to take their place. \u201cThe supermodels led us to celebrity,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cThe generation of models who came after the supers just wanted to be models, and didn\u2019t want that spotlight. Meanwhile, celebrities were starting to engage with fashion, realising the power of fashion to build their personality, to express who they were, on the red carpet or the front row. So the supermodels ended up being replaced by celebrities.\u201d The alchemy that happens when fashion meets celebrity is at its most potent at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/met-ball\" title=\"\">Met Gala</a>, over which Wintour (who has chaired the event since 1995) will once again preside on the first Monday in May.</p> <p>But today Wintour, who rarely gives interviews, seems less interested in talking frocks than in establishing her place on the right side of history. \u201cI hope I have been able to use the platform of Vogue to do a little bit of good in the world,\u201d she says. She mentions the <a href=\"https://cfda.com/programs/designers/cfdavogue-fashion-fund\" title=\"\">CFDA Fashion Fund</a>, launched in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\" title=\"\">9/11</a> to support young American designers. \u201cIt has been wonderful to see Cond\u00e9 Nast and Vogue taking leadership in championing diversity. As a company, we want to stand for positive change. I personally take that very seriously, but it\u2019s not just about me. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\" title=\"\">Edward Enninful</a> was such an important appointment at British Vogue, and he is leading the way on diversity.\u201d I ask who her mentors and allies have been, and she namechecks Cond\u00e9 Nast luminaries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/01/si-newhouse-conde-nast-dies-aged-89\" title=\"\">Si Newhouse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/07/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Alexander Liberman</a>, and designers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\" title=\"\">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, Calvin Klein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/02/its-not-about-fabric-its-about-dreams-how-ralph-lauren-created-an-empire\" title=\"\">Ralph Lauren</a>, before landing on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/18/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">Kay Graham</a>, publisher of the Washington Post during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\" title=\"\">Watergate</a> era. \u201cShe was a great friend of my father\u2019s and became a great friend of mine. I admired everything she stood for, how she represented the progress of women, how she stood her ground against the White House. She believed in her editors, she had wonderful women friends and was a deeply good person and had a lot of fun. And [she] was a great tennis player.\u201d</p> <p>It is a year since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/mario-testino-and-bruce-weber-models-claim-fashion-vogue\" title=\"\">New York Times published allegations</a> of sexual misconduct against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mario-testino\" title=\"\">Mario Testino</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/06/photography-bruce-weber-best-shot\" title=\"\">Bruce Weber</a>, two star photographers of Wintour\u2019s Vogue. Wintour has faced criticism for having failed to use her power to better protect the vulnerable in fashion. \u201cWe take very seriously events that happen in the industry, whether in or out of our control,\u201d she says today, \u201cand after so many unfortunate incidents came to light, we took a strong stand.\u201d Testino and Weber were banished from Vogue. A new Cond\u00e9 Nast code of conduct forbids the hiring of models under 18, and requires images involving nudity, swimwear, lingerie or suggestive poses to be approved in advance by the subject.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29aa01056a82eae23d6adcc794404bae8c1704f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29aa01056a82eae23d6adcc794404bae8c1704f7/0_0_1644_2464/667.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Wintour with her children, Sean John Fashion show, New York, 2003.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Wintour with her children at a Sean John fashion show in New York, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How long Wintour will remain at Vogue is impossible to predict, because Cond\u00e9 Nast is itself in turmoil. Having lost an estimated $250m over the past two years, the company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/conde-nast-to-combine-us-and-international-businesses\" title=\"\">plans to merge US and international operations</a>, and is searching for a new CEO to replace the departing Bob Sauerberg. Wintour enthuses about the digital age as \u201ca golden era for journalism, because we have the luxury of being able to talk to more people than ever before\u201d, but digital has undoubtedly eroded the might of Vogue. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/voguemagazine/?hl=en\" title=\"\">The magazine\u2019s Instagram account</a> has 21.5 million followers but that sounds less impressive when you note that three of the Kardashian family \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kylie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kendalljenner/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kendall</a> \u2013 have more than 100 million followers each.</p> <p>Wintour insists that she believes print magazines will be around \u201cfor ever\u201d. Really? \u201cYes, for ever. I really believe that. Print remains the jewel in the crown.\u201d Does she think of Vogue as a magazine, these days, or is it now a brand? \u201cI don\u2019t care for the word brand, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m in a supermarket. But I love Vogue \u2013 very deeply.\u201d She types a few words on her phone and the door opens to signal our time is up. She walks me to her door, shakes my hand, bids me a warm goodbye and turns to her assistant. \u201cI asked for a coffee,\u201d she says. There is no discernible hint in her tone that this is a sackable offence. But then, Anna Wintour doesn\u2019t give much away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One morning last August, Anna Wintour was playing tennis with her coach in the 40-acre grounds of her Long Island summerhouse. She noticed he seemed a little distracted: \u201cBut his wife was about to have a baby, so I thought he was nervous about that.\u201d Then it struck her that they had attracted an unusual number of spectators. The house was brimful with family, but it was earlier than most people get up on a weekend. (\u201cI\u2019m a morning person,\u201d says Wintour, for whom anything later than 5am constitutes a lie-in.) As she prepared to serve, she heard a car pull up. \u201cI am pretty OCD about guests and where they are sleeping. I thought, I\u2019m not expecting anyone else, I don\u2019t have any more rooms. Who is this? And then I thought \u2013 that looks like Roger [Federer, with whom Wintour is good friends]. And that looks like [his wife] Mirka. And that looks like their twins.\u201d Wintour\u2019s daughter Bee Shaffer, it transpired, had arranged for a Federer-Wintour family tennis tournament, \u201cwhich was the best gift a daughter could give a tennis-mad mother. I got to play doubles with Roger for the first time in our very long friendship, against my two nephews.\u201d Twenty-five floors above Manhattan, behind the ebonised mahogany Alan Buchsbaum desk from which she has ruled the fashion world for three decades, she leans back in her chair and smiles at the memory. \u201cWe won, of course.\u201d Of course. Anna Wintour plays to win in everything she does. She is editor-in-chief of American Vogue and artistic director of parent company Cond\u00e9 Nast, but her job titles do not come close to describing her iconic status. Vogue has been a launchpad from which she has powered herself to become a player in culture and politics. She is a fashion industry kingmaker, a Washington insider (Barack Obama\u2019s fourth-biggest fundraiser in the 2012 campaign), an art world luminary (the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum was renamed in her honour in 2014) and a Dame of the British Empire. And her haircut alone \u2013 as preternaturally unruffled and impenetrable up close as it looks in photographs \u2013 is recognisable from space. The Anna Wintour mythology is as much about power as it is about fashion. It owes a great deal to the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada in which Meryl Streep\u2019s ice-queen editor, assumed to be a cartoonised Wintour, created a character that popular culture has thrilled to ever since. Such is her fame that a mere rumour of her departure is enough to send shockwaves through the fashion and media worlds. (Last summer, these rose to such a clamour that Cond\u00e9 Nast issued a statement confirming Wintour would remain at Vogue \u201cindefinitely\u201d.) Her office has an air of ambassadorial gentility. No industrial styling, no modish succulents. Definitely no treadmill desk. The south wall is glass, diffusing the room with silver light bouncing off the towers of the financial district. Framed photos of her son Charles and Bee, as children and as the thirtysomethings they are now, are prominently displayed on her desk, on the window ledge and between a pair of topiaried miniature trees standing sentry on the limewashed sideboard. A cornflower-blue ceramic vase is filled with fresh ranunculus in Titian reds and coppers; a glass pot holds sharpened HB pencils. Only the lipstick mark on the grande Starbucks coffee cup and the Chanel sunglasses in the in-tray give the Vogue game away. I am summoned to this inner sanctum 10 minutes before our scheduled 9am interview time. Wintour is wearing a calf-length Erdem dress in dark silk with a bright floral print, collared with two sparkling necklaces. A blush pink coat and a jade green scarf are thrown over a corner chair next to a small Victoria Beckham black leather tote. With characteristic briskness, she has already wrapped her portrait shoot with Tyler Mitchell, who last year became the first black person to shoot a Vogue cover when he photographed Beyonc\u00e9 for Wintour\u2019s September issue. \u201cHe\u2019s charming, he\u2019s intelligent \u2013 I\u2019ve been impressed by what he\u2019s said yes to, and what he\u2019s said no to,\u201d she says of Mitchell. \u201cAlso, he\u2019s quick.\u201d Before the shoot, she was watching Andy Murray\u2019s match at the Australian Open on television \u2013 his first after announcing his retirement. \u201cSo emotional,\u201d she says, gravely. Is it true that she herself plays tennis every day at 5am? \u201cI don\u2019t play tennis as much as I used to, but I get up every day between 4am and 5am, and I work out every day.\u201d (Her game is, she says, \u201cterrible! But I enjoy it.\u201d) While we\u2019re on the subject, this seems an opportune moment to verify some of the other Anna Wintour myths. What about spending only 20 minutes at parties? \u201cWell, it depends on the party. If it is fashion week, then most likely I will be in and out. But there have been many times I have stayed a lot longer, believe me.\u201d She is smiling, but her folded arms semaphore impatience to change the subject. I am sorry to say that I chicken out of asking her if it\u2019s true about eating medium rare steak for lunch every day. Becoming a public figure in a way no other Vogue editor ever has been \u201cwasn\u2019t a conscious path\u201d, she insists. \u201cI don\u2019t work for Anna Wintour, I work for Cond\u00e9 Nast. I don\u2019t have any kind of social media accounts or look for personal recognition.\u201d But Wintour is instantly recognisable, thanks to a style that has remained almost unchanged since the 80s. Her sleek bob teamed with a sharp wit has often been a power combination, channelled by Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction, by the diminutive Edna Mode in The Incredibles and by Taylor Swift at her most sassy. But the style was \u201cnot a strategic decision\u201d, Wintour insists. \u201cI feel comfortable with it, that\u2019s all. I am a creature of habit. Honestly, Jess, it\u2019s not something I spend any time thinking about at all. I come to the office and do my job.\u201d Wintour\u2019s image of cool, impermeable authority has become a blueprint for successful female leadership. I am sure I even caught something of Wintour\u2019s staccato delivery in the sardonic crispness of Emily Blunt\u2019s Mary Poppins. The notion raises a smile, but Wintour has a politician\u2019s sleight of hand when it comes to answering questions she doesn\u2019t like, segueing to her preferred talking points. She steers the conversation away from her own image and on to how Vogue is championing women in political leadership. \u201cI was very encouraged by our midterm results on that front. I believe women are taking control and standing up for what they believe in. We are in a moment of huge change.\u201d She reels off an impressive list of female politicians who have appeared in the magazine recently, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Klobuchar, Lauren Underwood, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris. For the best part of two decades, Wintour\u2019s Vogue was closer to the White House than Vogue had ever been. Hillary Clinton became the first first lady to cover Vogue in 1998 \u2013 an honour not bestowed, even, on Jackie Kennedy \u2013 and in 2016, Vogue endorsed her presidential candidacy, the first time the magazine had ever been publicly partisan. But it is the mention of Michelle Obama that sends Wintour into raptures. \u201cWhat intrigued me and the rest of the world about Mrs Obama from the beginning was her poise, her intelligence, her grace, how articulate she was, and the sense that she gave of being a true partner to her husband. She was remarkable in so many ways \u2013 and still is, look at the incredible success of her book \u2013 and I was thrilled to see how she embraced fashion in such a democratic way. She would wear leggings one day, a designer gown the next, and look comfortable in both. She wasn\u2019t locked into one idea of how a first lady should dress. For Vogue, she was a gift.\u201d When the Met\u2019s Costume Institute was renamed in recognition of Wintour\u2019s work as a fundraiser and cheerleader, Michelle Obama cut the ribbon, saying, \u201cI\u2019m here because I have such respect and admiration for this woman, who I am proud to call my friend.\u201d Since Trump\u2019s election, Vogue has found itself in opposition, a position it has embraced with unexpected relish. The September issue included a profile on Stormy Daniels (the adult film star who had a hush money deal with the president) which saw Daniels resplendent in evening gown and Tiffany diamonds, photographed by Annie Leibovitz. \u201cToday\u2019s audience \u2013 not just Vogue\u2019s audience, every audience \u2013 wants journalism to take a stand,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cPeople want to know what you believe in and what you stand for. In this time of fake news, when there is so much disregard for truth and value and for supporting those less fortunate than oneself, we have a moral obligation to stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d While Michelle Obama starred on three Vogue covers as first lady, Melania Trump is still waiting for Wintour to call. Will Melania be in Vogue, I ask? \u201cMelania has been on the cover of Vogue,\u201d Wintour fires back without missing a beat. Indeed she has, in her wedding dress, in 2005, but not as first lady, representing the White House. \u201cWe do report on Melania consistently, on vogue.com,\u201d says Wintour. \u201cWhich is Vogue.\u201d Her inflection puts the emphasis firmly on the full stop. She picks up her mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask someone to bring me another coffee. Would you like one?\u201d I say no, and wait for her to make her call, but after a few seconds she raises an amused eyebrow at me. \u201cGo ahead. I can type and think at the same time, you know.\u201d She has texted the coffee request, I realise. As perfect as Wintour\u2019s manners are, I do not get the impression it would be wise to put them to the test by boring her. I try not to think about the scene in the 2009 Vogue documentary The September Issue when Stefano Pilati, then designer of Yves Saint Laurent, withers under her stony-faced appraisal of his latest collection. Born in London in 1949 to a British father (Evening Standard editor Charles Wintour) and an American mother, Wintour moved to New York in her 20s. She returned to London in 1985 to edit British Vogue, but was back in New York two years later. Her first issue as editor of American Vogue, in November 1988, featured a model wearing jeans, which famously caused the printers to call Vogue\u2019s office to check they had the right picture. It was an early signpost of the shift from fashion being \u201csomething that was directed at a small group, to becoming something that speaks to everyone. That has been the most extraordinary change that I have seen.\u201d As fashion has swelled to a powerful force in culture over the last three decades, Vogue has ridden the crest of that wave. A Vogue cover has become an official stamp not just of beauty, but of relevance. For Amal Clooney, Serena Williams and others, a Vogue cover has signalled a change in gear from success in their field to general superstardom. \u201cVogue stands for quality,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cTo be recognised by Vogue always has an impact.\u201d In 1998, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger became the first non-model to cover an all-important September issue of Vogue (traditionally the biggest of the year). As the era of the supermodel waned, Wintour coached and coaxed a new generation of actresses to take their place. \u201cThe supermodels led us to celebrity,\u201d Wintour says. \u201cThe generation of models who came after the supers just wanted to be models, and didn\u2019t want that spotlight. Meanwhile, celebrities were starting to engage with fashion, realising the power of fashion to build their personality, to express who they were, on the red carpet or the front row. So the supermodels ended up being replaced by celebrities.\u201d The alchemy that happens when fashion meets celebrity is at its most potent at the Met Gala, over which Wintour (who has chaired the event since 1995) will once again preside on the first Monday in May. But today Wintour, who rarely gives interviews, seems less interested in talking frocks than in establishing her place on the right side of history. \u201cI hope I have been able to use the platform of Vogue to do a little bit of good in the world,\u201d she says. She mentions the CFDA Fashion Fund, launched in the aftermath of 9/11 to support young American designers. \u201cIt has been wonderful to see Cond\u00e9 Nast and Vogue taking leadership in championing diversity. As a company, we want to stand for positive change. I personally take that very seriously, but it\u2019s not just about me. Edward Enninful was such an important appointment at British Vogue, and he is leading the way on diversity.\u201d I ask who her mentors and allies have been, and she namechecks Cond\u00e9 Nast luminaries Si Newhouse and Alexander Liberman, and designers Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, before landing on Kay Graham, publisher of the Washington Post during the Watergate era. \u201cShe was a great friend of my father\u2019s and became a great friend of mine. I admired everything she stood for, how she represented the progress of women, how she stood her ground against the White House. She believed in her editors, she had wonderful women friends and was a deeply good person and had a lot of fun. And [she] was a great tennis player.\u201d It is a year since the New York Times published allegations of sexual misconduct against Mario Testino and Bruce Weber, two star photographers of Wintour\u2019s Vogue. Wintour has faced criticism for having failed to use her power to better protect the vulnerable in fashion. \u201cWe take very seriously events that happen in the industry, whether in or out of our control,\u201d she says today, \u201cand after so many unfortunate incidents came to light, we took a strong stand.\u201d Testino and Weber were banished from Vogue. A new Cond\u00e9 Nast code of conduct forbids the hiring of models under 18, and requires images involving nudity, swimwear, lingerie or suggestive poses to be approved in advance by the subject. How long Wintour will remain at Vogue is impossible to predict, because Cond\u00e9 Nast is itself in turmoil. Having lost an estimated $250m over the past two years, the company recently announced plans to merge US and international operations, and is searching for a new CEO to replace the departing Bob Sauerberg. Wintour enthuses about the digital age as \u201ca golden era for journalism, because we have the luxury of being able to talk to more people than ever before\u201d, but digital has undoubtedly eroded the might of Vogue. The magazine\u2019s Instagram account has 21.5 million followers but that sounds less impressive when you note that three of the Kardashian family \u2013 Kim, Kylie and Kendall \u2013 have more than 100 million followers each. Wintour insists that she believes print magazines will be around \u201cfor ever\u201d. Really? \u201cYes, for ever. I really believe that. Print remains the jewel in the crown.\u201d Does she think of Vogue as a magazine, these days, or is it now a brand? \u201cI don\u2019t care for the word brand, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel like I\u2019m in a supermarket. But I love Vogue \u2013 very deeply.\u201d She types a few words on her phone and the door opens to signal our time is up. She walks me to her door, shakes my hand, bids me a warm goodbye and turns to her assistant. \u201cI asked for a coffee,\u201d she says. There is no discernible hint in her tone that this is a sackable offence. But then, Anna Wintour doesn\u2019t give much away.",

In El Paso, he mocked a nearby counter-rally led by former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, which law enforcement officials <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections-2020/2019/02/11/could-beto-orourkes-counter-rally-trumps-el-paso-visit-hispresidential-bid-launch\">said</a> drew 7,500.</p> <p>\u201cHe has 200 people, 300 people,\u201d Trump told his crowd. \u201cNot too good.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also went after Ocasio-Cortez, although not by name, ridiculing a policy plan known as the Green New Deal the freshman congresswoman helped to unveil last week.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t like their policy of, taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of \u2018Let\u2019s hop a train to California\u2019, of \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to own cows anymore\u2019,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLotta problems. Lotta problems.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was riffing on a factsheet about the policy circulated by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office, later disavowed, which made a reference to getting rid \u201cof farting cows and airplanes\u201d. The actual plan for emissions reductions <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5729033-Green-New-Deal-FINAL\">does not mention cars, airplanes or cows</a>, farting or otherwise.</p> <h2>\u2018Sometimes you hand your opponent the sword\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cThis is a race that Trump can\u2019t win but the Democrats can absolutely lose,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSometimes you hand your opponent the sword to cut off your head.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in regard to the Democrats seeking political death, nothing would make that more likely than if they lead their 2020 campaign with gun control, climate change and abortion.

And the biggest challenge is not getting distracted by the president and not chasing every rabbit he throws out there.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to get better on the economy.

      "bodyText": "A campaign-style speech by Donald Trump in the border city of El Paso, Texas on Monday night did more than just electrify the 6,500 crowd who turned out in red hats to enjoy a night of flag-waving, immigrant-bashing and Democrat-dissing. \u201cIs there any place that\u2019s more fun to be than a Trump rally?\u201d the president asked from the stage, to a cascade of cheers. The speech was also a road-test for the message Trump will use to try to win reelection \u2013 and there\u2019s a chance it could work, strategists from across the political spectrum said. While some top Democratic strategists mocked the speech for sounding a lot like the speeches Trump delivered before Republicans suffered historic losses in the 2018 midterms, others warned that the basic message \u2013 of a Trump-driven economic prosperity threatened by a radical Democratic agenda \u2013 could be effective in 2020.

He\u2019s just shifting that model to politics.\u201d Trump will try to define Democrats in a negative way by going after the party\u2019s most visible young stars, said Siegfried, who thought the method could be effective with voters in the middle. \u201cYou see a lot of these new freshmen among in Democrats \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar \u2013 they all have very high profiles and they\u2019re pushing some pretty out-there stuff that is pushing the Democrat party further to the left, to a place where I don\u2019t think the general electorate \u2013 at least swing voters \u2013 is comfortable.\u201d The Democratic party sees its unprecedented crop of diverse young talent as an unalloyed sign of promise as the country looks more and more like the trio Siegfried named and less and less like Trump. But there\u2019s no doubt about whether Trump senses a political opportunity in attacking the young Democrats. In El Paso, he mocked a nearby counter-rally led by former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, which law enforcement officials said drew 7,500. \u201cHe has 200 people, 300 people,\u201d Trump told his crowd. \u201cNot too good.\u201d Trump also went after Ocasio-Cortez, although not by name, ridiculing a policy plan known as the Green New Deal the freshman congresswoman helped to unveil last week. \u201cI really don\u2019t like their policy of, taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of \u2018Let\u2019s hop a train to California\u2019, of \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to own cows anymore\u2019,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLotta problems. Lotta problems.\u201d Trump was riffing on a factsheet about the policy circulated by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office, later disavowed, which made a reference to getting rid \u201cof farting cows and airplanes\u201d. The actual plan for emissions reductions does not mention cars, airplanes or cows, farting or otherwise. \u2018Sometimes you hand your opponent the sword\u2019 \u201cThis is a race that Trump can\u2019t win but the Democrats can absolutely lose,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSometimes you hand your opponent the sword to cut off your head. \u201cAnd in regard to the Democrats seeking political death, nothing would make that more likely than if they lead their 2020 campaign with gun control, climate change and abortion. You want to get Trump re-elected? That\u2019s how you do it. You lead with those three things.\u201d Lake, the Democratic strategist, said \ufeffthat as Trump yells about socialism, Democrats should talk about healthcare and jobs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about the label\u201d Trump uses, such as \u201csocialist\u201d or any other, Lake said. \u201cI\u2019d worry about Democrats defining what they stand for. And the biggest challenge is not getting distracted by the president and not chasing every rabbit he throws out there. \u201cWe have to get better on the economy. We have to communicate an economic message. That\u2019s the most important thing we have to do. That should be what Democrats focus on.\u201d",

The everyday killings of young Americans add up to \u201ca Parkland every five days,\u201d according to a new project from The Trace, a nonprofit that covers gun violence, in collaboration with McClatchy newspapers and the Miami Herald. Fourteen high school students and three educators were murdered last Valentine\u2019s Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, a massacre that inspired a national youth protest movement for gun control. SinceParkland.org, a new project from McClatchy and The Trace, attempts to tell the stories of every child and teenager, ages 18 and younger, killed with a gun since that shooting.

Police, engineers and other miners have struggled since Tuesday to reach any survivors of the accident, which took place in the town of Kadoma, 125 miles (200km) west of the capital, Harare. About 60 miners are thought to have been working at about 11pm local time (2100 GMT) on Tuesday when heavy rains sent a wave of water pouring into shafts that were up to 100 metres deep.

      "bodyText": "Nigeria\u2019s electoral commission has delayed the presidential election until 23 February, making the announcement just five hours before polls were set to open on Saturday. It cited unspecified \u201cchallenges\u201d amid reports that voting materials had not been delivered to all parts of the country. \u201cThis was a difficult decision to take but necessary for successful delivery of the elections and the consolidation of our democracy,\u201d commission chairman Mahmood Yakubu told reporters in the capital, Abuja, late on Friday night. He said more details would be released on Saturday afternoon. President Muhammadu Buhari faces a tight election contest in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, top oil producer and most populous nation, against the main opposition candidate, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar. The election has been seen as a referendum on Buhari\u2019s first term, which has been marred by his prolonged absence due to illness, a weak economy, and the government\u2019s failure to effectively tackle corruption and insecurity. But the 84 million people registered to vote across Nigeria are waking up to learn that they will not be able to take part in the poll for another week. Nigerians have to return to their home states to cast their votes, and many of those who have travelled across the large west African country in order to do so will not be able to repeat the journey next weekend. On Friday, planes leaving Abuja airport were full of people going home in order to take part in the election. On election day, travel is restricted, and most people walk to polling stations to cast their votes. Elections for the state governors, due to be held on 2 March, were also delayed by a week. The cost of the election, already expected to be 242 billion naira ($670m) will increase now. The country\u2019s presidential elections in 2011 and 2015 were also delayed over logistics and security issues. The decision to delay this year\u2019s vote was criticised by the chairman of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, said the move was an action that was \u201cdangerous to our democracy and unacceptable\u201d, adding that it was part of an attempt by Buhari to \u201ccling on to power even when it\u2019s obvious to him that Nigerians want him out\u201d. The president\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress party criticised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the delay. Buhari \u201ccooperated fully with INEC by ensuring everything it demanded to conduct free and fair elections were promptly made available,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis news is therefore a huge disappointment to us.\u201d An electoral commission official said that \u201csome result sheets and some ballot papers are reportedly missing. We want to track every (piece of) sensitive material, take inventory of what we have and what is missing\u201d. A government official said: \u201cThe legitimacy of the entire process will be questioned and the winner could lack the moral authority to superintend the affairs of the state.\u201d In the lead up to the election Nigeria has been dealing with pockets of instability. Authorities bolstered security in much of the country on the eve of the vote, after past elections were marred by violence, voter intimidation and ballot rigging. A faction of Boko Haram attacked a state governor\u2019s convoy on Tuesday, killing four people and stealing vehicles. Elsewhere, 15 people were crushed to death at a ruling party rally in eastern Port Harcourt. On Thursday, 14 sacks of ballot papers were intercepted in Kano state \u2013 though police said they were merely \u201cspecimen\u201d papers to educate voters.",

They could not reach a verdict on 10 other charges.</p> <p>He was found to have hidden more than $16m in income from US authorities, which allowed him to avoid paying $6m in taxes. He also hid tens of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts secured $25m in loans from banks through fraud.</p> <p>Manafort had \u201cample funds\u201d to cover the tax bills he should have paid, the filing said, but \u201che simply chose not to comply with laws that would reduce his wealth\u201d.</p> <p>Mueller\u2019s team said Manafort resorted to fraud to maintain a lifestyle of \u201clavish spending\u201d \u2013 spanning multiple homes, luxurious rugs and an ostrich-skin leather jacket \u2013 after his lucrative work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine dried up.</p> <p>Following his convictions, Manafort admitted other crimes in a plea deal to avoid a second trial on other charges in Washington DC. But the deal was scrapped by Mueller after Manafort continued to lie to investigators.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s court filing said Manafort\u2019s \u201cconcerted criminality\u201d, even while out on bail and under indictment last year, should be a factor in his Virginia sentence. He also faces sentencing next month in Washington for crimes he admitted in that case.</p> <p>Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election, which intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at helping Trump. Prosecutors from Mueller\u2019s team have said Manafort\u2019s interactions in 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence operative, are a central focus of their inquiries.</p> <p>Manafort has been in jail since June last year, when he and Kilimnik were charged with witness tampering while Manafort awaited his trial in Virginia.

      "bodyText": "Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, should be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison, the special counsel Robert Mueller said on Friday. Mueller\u2019s team said in a court filing that Manafort should face a prison term of 235 to 292 months, or between 19 and a half and 24 and a half years, for \u201cserious, longstanding, and bold\u201d financial crimes. Manafort, 69, could also receive financial penalties totaling more than $50m, according to the filing by Mueller\u2019s prosecutors. His sentence will be decided by federal judge TS Ellis. The new court filing dealt with Manafort\u2019s convictions in Virginia last year for fraud and other crimes that the veteran political consultant began committing before he joined Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016. \u201cManafort acted for more than a decade as if he were above the law, and deprived the federal government and various financial institutions of millions of dollars,\u201d Mueller\u2019s team said. \u201cThe sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct.\u201d A jury found Manafort guilty in August on eight counts of tax fraud, bank fraud and concealing a foreign bank account. They could not reach a verdict on 10 other charges. He was found to have hidden more than $16m in income from US authorities, which allowed him to avoid paying $6m in taxes. He also hid tens of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts secured $25m in loans from banks through fraud. Manafort had \u201cample funds\u201d to cover the tax bills he should have paid, the filing said, but \u201che simply chose not to comply with laws that would reduce his wealth\u201d. Mueller\u2019s team said Manafort resorted to fraud to maintain a lifestyle of \u201clavish spending\u201d \u2013 spanning multiple homes, luxurious rugs and an ostrich-skin leather jacket \u2013 after his lucrative work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine dried up. Following his convictions, Manafort admitted other crimes in a plea deal to avoid a second trial on other charges in Washington DC. But the deal was scrapped by Mueller after Manafort continued to lie to investigators. Friday\u2019s court filing said Manafort\u2019s \u201cconcerted criminality\u201d, even while out on bail and under indictment last year, should be a factor in his Virginia sentence. He also faces sentencing next month in Washington for crimes he admitted in that case. Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election, which intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at helping Trump. Prosecutors from Mueller\u2019s team have said Manafort\u2019s interactions in 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence operative, are a central focus of their inquiries. Manafort has been in jail since June last year, when he and Kilimnik were charged with witness tampering while Manafort awaited his trial in Virginia. Kilimnik denies the allegations and insists he has not worked for Russian intelligence. Mueller\u2019s team said on Friday that Manafort had resorted to crime despite having had \u201cevery opportunity to succeed\u201d \u2013 including a good education at Georgetown university and law school. His sentence should punish him for serious wrongdoing and serve as a deterrent to others tempted to commit similar crimes, they said. The court filing said Manafort was the ringleader of a financial criminal operation that also involved his accountants, Kilimnik and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy chairman on the Trump campaign. Gates has pleaded guilty to lying to investigators. \u201cManafort solicited numerous professionals and others to reap his ill-gotten gains,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. Separately on Friday, the transcript of a hearing held in Manafort\u2019s case in Washington DC on Wednesday was unsealed. The transcript showed judge Amy Berman Jackson explaining why she agreed with Mueller that Manafort had breached his plea deal by lying. Jackson said Manafort had been caught lying repeatedly about his interactions with Kilimnik, which she said went to the \u201cundisputed core\u201d of Mueller\u2019s search for any \u201clinks and/or coordination\u201d between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. \u201cMr Kilimnik doesn\u2019t have to be in the government or even be an active spy to be a link,\u201d she said. Jackson said Manafort had forced Mueller\u2019s investigators \u201cto pull teeth\u201d by withholding facts if he thought he could get away with it, before learning that Mueller\u2019s team actually already knew the truth. By lying about the witness-tampering conspiracy with Kilimnik, Manafort also seemed to be trying to protect \u201chis Russian conspirator\u201d from legal peril, Jackson said, raising \u201clegitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.\u201d",

His new construction to date has replaced existing barriers.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A big majority of the big drugs \u2014 the big drug loads \u2014 don\u2019t go through ports of entry.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage, thanks for following along on this busy day. Here are some highlights: Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall. Special counsel Robert Mueller said Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, should be sentenced to up to 24 years in prison. Democrats said they would use \u201cevery remedy available\u201d to block Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, and the House judiciary committee said it would investigate and call a hearing. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders revealed that she had been interviewed by Mueller, saying she was \u201chappy to voluntarily sit down\u201d with the investigators. A judge issued a gag order for attorneys and witnesses in the case of Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser. Bill Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, said he will run against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. Sign up for our morning briefing for a new perspective on the US. We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. Some excerpts from Mueller\u2019s sentencing recommendations against Paul Manafort: In the end, Manafort acted for more than a decade as if he were above the law, and deprived the federal government and various financial institutions of millions of dollars. The sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct... Considering only the crimes charged in this district, they make plain that Manafort chose to engage in a sophisticated scheme to hide millions of dollars from United States authorities. And when his foreign income stream dissipated in 2015, he chose to engage in a series of bank frauds in the United States to maintain his extravagant lifestyle, at the expense of various financial institutions. Manafort chose to do this for no other reason than greed, evidencing his belief that the law does not apply to him. Manafort solicited numerous professionals and others to reap his ill-gotten gains... Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, should be sentenced to 19 to 24 years in prison, special counsel Robert Mueller said on Friday. The sentence was recommended by Mueller for Manafort\u2019s convictions in Virginia last year for financial crimes that the veteran political consultant began committing before he joined Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016. A jury found Manafort guilty in August on eight counts of tax fraud, bank fraud and a foreign bank account. They could not reach a verdict on 10 other charges. Manafort signed a plea deal to avoid a second trial on other charges in Washington DC, but the deal was scrapped by Mueller after Manafort continued to lie. Manafort faces sentencing for crimes he admitted in that case next month. Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election, with intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at helping Trump. Prosecutors from Mueller\u2019s team have said Manafort\u2019s interactions in 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence operative, are a central focus of their inquiries. Manafort, 69, has been in jail since June last year, when he and Kilimnik were charged with witness tampering while Manafort awaited his trial in Virginia. Protesters are rallying in New York City in opposition to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. Some are shouting, \u201cTrump is the emergency!\u201d Twitter has reportedly ruled that this tweet from Iran\u2019s leader violated its terms of service: The tweet had inspired intense backlash: Twitter apparently decided only to take enforcement action against the individual tweet, and not the account. Some have long argued that Twitter should take action against Donald Trump\u2019s account for violating policies on hateful content or violent threats. Twitter, however, has generally argued that it does not take down the president\u2019s tweets or ban his account, because his statements are considered \u201cnewsworthy\u201d or in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. Police in Aurora, Illinois have confirmed that five died in the shooting this afternoon: The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Gary Martin, is also dead: Trump has weighed in on the shooting in Illinois: More on the incident here: Trump\u2019s announcement of his emergency declaration earlier today was filled with misleading statements and falsehoods. Here\u2019s a summary of a few key fact checks of Trump quotes, from the Associated Press: I\u2019ve built a lot of wall. I have a lot of money, and I\u2019ve built a lot of wall. The AP: \u201cHe\u2019s built no new miles of wall, lacking the money. His new construction to date has replaced existing barriers.\u201d A big majority of the big drugs \u2014 the big drug loads \u2014 don\u2019t go through ports of entry. They can\u2019t go through ports of entry. You can\u2019t take big loads because you have people \u2014 we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement \u2014 looking. The AP: \u201cHis own administration says illicit drugs come mainly through ports of entry. He has persistently contradicted his officials on this point.\u201d Take a look at our federal prison population. See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens. Just see. Go ahead and see. AP: \u201cAbout 40% of the people who entered federal prison in 2014 were foreigners, according to the most recent Bureau of Justice statistics. The vast majority of the foreigners (20,842 of 28,821) were being held for immigration violations, not violent or property crimes.\u201d There\u2019s rarely been a problem [when presidents declare national emergencies]. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren\u2019t very exciting. But nobody cares ... And the people that say we create precedent \u2014 well, what do you have? Fifty-six? There are a lot of times \u2014 well, that\u2019s creating precedent. AP: \u201cThose declarations were rarely as consequential, and that\u2019s precisely why they were mostly uncontroversial. He\u2019s roughly correct about the numbers. But past declarations did not involve the unilateral spending of substantial sums of money that Congress did not approve.\u201d In 2020 news, Kamala Harris has earned the endorsement of labor rights leader Dolores Huerta, who is joining the senator\u2019s presidential campaign as a co-chair: The news comes a day after a high-profile endorsement from Barbara Lee, former Congressional Black Caucus chair. Special counsel Robert Mueller has said in a new court filing that investigators have executed search warrants on accounts used to \u201cfacilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release\u201d, including communications with Roger Stone, the president\u2019s longtime friend and adviser: Earlier today, a federal judge issued a gag order for attorneys and witnesses in the ongoing Stone case. The latest filing is here: Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has now received a civil subpoena from the New Jersey attorney general: The AP reports that the committee is in contact with New Jersey prosecutors: The subpoena is the second such request the inaugural committee has received in as many weeks as scrutiny mounts over how it raised and spent $107 million on inaugural events. The committee also received a sweeping request for documents issued by federal prosecutors in New York investigating whether foreign nationals illegally contributed to the inauguration. The AP obtained a copy of the New Jersey subpoena. It also seeks documents related to any benefits donors received. Trump left for Florida earlier without taking questions about a shooting in Aurora, Illinois: The White House said he had been briefed and was monitoring: Details are still emerging about the shooting at a business in suburban Chicago, but the AP has reported that at least one person was killed and that four officers were wounded, but are in stable condition. Some Democrats have cited the shooting as a reminder that gun violence is a \u201creal emergency\u201d in America: Sam Levin here in our Oakland office, taking over our live coverage of the fallout since Trump declared a national emergency. The House judiciary committee has now said it is going to investigate Trump\u2019s declaration: The letter calls for a hearing with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Department of Justice officials. The Democrats have also said they were \u201cparticularly troubled\u201d about Trump\u2019s statement earlier today that he \u201cdidn\u2019t need to do this\u201d. The letter adds: We believe your declaration of an emergency shows a reckless disregard for the separation of powers and your own responsibilities under our constitutional system. \u2022Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fund his border wall. Speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump said there was an emergency at the border which could only be fixed by building a wall. The president repeated a number of falsehoods to justify the need for the structure. \u2022Democrats said they will use \u2018every remedy available\u2019 to block Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency is unlawful, and would \u201cshred the Constitution\u201d by circumventing Congress\u2019 power to control spending. \u2022White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said she has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cThe President urged me, like he has everyone in the administration, to fully cooperate with the special counsel. I was happy to voluntarily sit down with them,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u2022A gag order for attorneys and witnesses was issued in the Roger Stone trial. Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u2019s order does not generally apply to Stone, a longtime friend and adviser to Trump. But the judge gave the veteran political operative a courtly warning to curb his excesses in the media. \u2022Bill Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, announced he will run against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. \u201cIn every country there comes a time when patriotic men and women must stand up and speak out to protect our individual rights and the overall health of the nation. In our country, now is such a time,\u201d Weld said. Is Texas in play in the 2020 presidential election? Or the 2020 Senate election? According to this Public Policy Polling survey, yes it is. In both. The poll has 46% of Texans voting for Joe Biden in a theoretical presidential race, compared to 49% for Donald Trump. In a theoretical Senate election between hot young thing Beto O\u2019Rourke and incumbent John Cornyn, who is not that, O\u2019Rourke is within the margin of error. Here\u2019s Trump earlier, performing what is being referred to as both a \u201cditty\u201d and a \u201csing-song\u201d. The sound of the summer? A gag order for attorneys and witnesses has been issued in the case of Roger Stone by a federal judge in Washington DC. Stone, a longtime friend and adviser to Donald Trump, was indicted last month on charges of lying to investigators, obstructing justice and witness tampering. He denies wrongdoing. Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u2019s order does not generally apply to Stone himself. But the judge gave the veteran political operative a courtly warning to curb his excesses in the media. While it was not up to her \u201cto advise the defendant as to whether a succession of public statements would be in his best interest,\u201d Jackson wrote, he should not complain about the effects of pre-trial publicity if he courts the publicity himself. The gag order also bars Stone and anyone else involved in the case from making comments to the public and media around the courthouse before or after hearings. Jackson said the order was needed to protect Stone\u2019s right to a fair trial. \u201cThe court has particular concerns about the potential impact of public statements made in the District of Columbia, directed at individuals who may be members of the venire from which the jury will be drawn,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cAnd, in light of the size and vociferousness of the crowds that have already been attracted to these proceedings, and the risk that public pronouncements by the participants may inflame those gatherings, the court is persuaded that a narrowly tailored order governing the conduct of participants in the matter while they are at the courthouse is necessary to advance the court\u2019s legitimate interest in maintaining the order and decorum that is essential to court proceedings and the fair administration of justice.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to CNN. \u201cThe President urged me, like he has everyone in the administration, to fully cooperate with the special counsel. I was happy to voluntarily sit down with them,\u201d Sanders told the network in an interview. Mueller has also interviewed former chief of staff John Kelly, former White House communications director Hope Hicks and former press secretary Sean Spicer. Sanders appears not to have expanded on the subject of the interview. CNN wrote that \u201cone likely area of interest was how Sanders composed statements she made on the podium defending the President regarding the Russia investigation\u201d. Right-wing crank Ann Coulter has fired back at Trump after the president slighted her during his Rose Garden speech this morning. \u201cForget the fact that he\u2019s digging his own grave,\u201d Coulter told LA-based radio station KABC. She was talking about Trump signing the congressional bill to end the government shutdown. \u201cThe only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,\u201d she continued. Coulter was an early supporter of Trump, but turned on the president over his inaction on the much-touted border wall. Earlier on Friday Trump, 72, had criticized Coulter, describing her as \u201coff the reservation\u201d \u201cThis is the worst open borders the country has ever had under the president who ran against open borders,\u201d Coulter said. Donald Trump has just posted this bizarre video marking his State of the Union speech. It features REM\u2019s Everybody Hurts and has lines from Trump\u2019s address interspersed with unimpressed looking Democrats. It seems to have been originally created by Twitter person @CarpeDonktum, a co-founder of the right-wing website Culttture. \u201cI love politics and making people laugh with funny, clever, and high quality meme videos and images,\u201d @CarpeDonktum says on his Patreon page. \u201cI have combined my love of politics and comedy and now create memes to support President Trump and MAGA. The Supreme Court is set to decide whether the government can add a question about citizenship to the next national census. The Trump administration wanted to add the question: \u201cIs this person a citizen of the United States?\u201d to the 2020 census. Opponents said the question would lead to inaccurate census results, as both legal and undocumented immigrants would refuse to fill out the census form. The government\u2019s Census Bureau estimated that adding the question could depress responses in households with at least one non-citizen by as much as 5.8%. That could be particularly damaging in states like New York or California, which have large immigrant populations. In January a federal judge in New York ruled that Trump\u2019s administration could not put a question about citizenship on the census. Now the Supreme Court, newly furnished with two conservative justices, will have the final say. Rep Earl Blumenauer, of Oregon\u2019s third district, has filed a resolution to declare a national emergency over the climate crisis. \u201cWhat our country should be doing right now is focusing efforts on addressing a real national emergency and one of the most pressing issues of our time: the climate crisis,\u201d Blumenauer said in a letter to Congress. \u201cIf Donald Trump wants to start declaring national emergencies for fake crises, Congress should start to address the real ones, starting with climate change.\u201d The progressive organizations MoveOn and Indivisible have announced a series of nationwide protests against Trump\u2019s national emergency. \u201cWe are mobilizing nonviolent rapid-response events to stand up against Trump\u2019s #FakeNationalEmergency to defend our democracy and immigrant, Muslim, black, and brown communities from Trump\u2019s dangerous national emergency power grab,\u201d MoveOn said. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team plan to file a sentencing recommendation this afternoon in the Paul Manafort case, according to CNN. Yesterday a federal judge ruled that Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, intentionally lied to the special counsel after he had agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation. Manafort will be sentenced on March 13. Here\u2019s some of that statement from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, on Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration. They argue that Trump\u2019s announcement is in violation of the constitution. \u201cIf unchecked,\u201d Trump\u2019s declaration \u201cwould fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our founders\u2019 vision\u201d, Pelosi and Schumer say. The President\u2019s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation. This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process. The President\u2019s actions clearly violate the Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse, which our founders enshrined in the constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available. This issue transcends partisan politics and goes to the core of the founders\u2019 conception for America, which commands Congress to limit an overreaching executive. The president\u2019s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our founders\u2019 vision. [...] The President is not above the law. The Congress cannot let the President shred the Constitution. Plenty of people, including Nancy Pelosi, are pointing out that Trump may have immediately complicated the legal case for his national emergency. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this,\u201d Trump said of the national emergency during the press conference. We can expect to see that admission pop-up in plenty of the legal challenges expected to be brought against the president\u2019s declaration. Phew! That was a lot. So what else is going on in politics today? Well, Bill Weld, the Republican former governor of Massachusetts (between 1991 and 1997) has announced he will run against Trump in 2020. In a speech in New Hampshire, Weld said he has set up an exploratory committee to begin the process of challenging Trump. His announcement was deeply critical of the president. \u201cIn every country there comes a time when patriotic men and women must stand up and speak out to protect our individual rights and the overall health of the nation. In our country, now is such a time,\u201d he said, according to the local New Hampshire news station WMUR9. Weld, 73, was the vice-presidential candidate for the Libertarian party in 2016, running alongside Gary Johnson. I met him at one of Johnson\u2019s rallies during the campaign. He was very pleasant, and very tall. That\u2019s unlikely to help him beat Trump, however, as my colleague Ed Pilkington notes that Weld has a \u201cHerculean task ahead of him\u201d: He is unlikely to be able to muster anything like as much money or media attention as the White House incumbent. But by opening a crack of insurgency within the Republican party, he may embolden others to follow. He may also force Trump to expend some energy, however limited, on his right flank at a time when Democratic presidential candidates are amassing on his left. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said they\u2019ll take action \u201cin the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public\u201d, to oppose Trump\u2019s declaration of an emergency. Pelosi and Schumer, the Democrats\u2019 two most senior officials, said Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency is unlawful, and would \u201cshred the Constitution\u201d by circumventing Congress\u2019 power to control spending. White House officials say some of the money would come from military construction projects. Pelosi and Schumer say Trump would be using money needed \u201cfor the security of our military and our nation.\u201d Democrats can file lawsuits and force congressional votes to block Trump\u2019s money transfers. Trump could veto the legislation should it pass. \u2022Donald Trump has declared a national emergency to fund his border wall. Speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump said there was an emergency at the border which could only be fixed by building a wall. \u2022The president repeated a number of falsehoods to justify the need for a wall. Trump said, wrongly, that drugs and human trafficking occurs at areas of the border with no wall. Most drugs and human trafficking actually happens at legal points of entry. \u2022Trump questioned his own government\u2019s statistics on undocumented immigration. US Customs and Border Protection figures show that immigration is at its lowest level in a decade. Asked about the CBP numbers, Trump said: \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that stat do you?\u201d \u2022The government expects to be sued over the national emergency declaration, Trump said. \u201cAnd we will possibly get a bad ruling,\u201d in the courts, he added. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll end up in the Supreme Court.\u201d Legal proceedings could hold up the declaration for months. Jim Acosta, who the president doesn\u2019t like, asks Trump why he is declaring a national emergency at a time when statistics show undocumented immigration has just dropped to its lowest level in a decade. \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that stat do you?\u201d Trump says. That stat comes from his own government. Trump says he has seen statistics which contradict the numbers reported by the government\u2019s Customs and Border Protection bureau. The president is asked where he is getting those statistics from. \u201cI use many stats,\u201d Trump says. A reporter asks Trump if he is changing on the job. \u201cWell I\u2019m learning. I am learning,\u201d he says. Trump says he had never run for office before before 2016. This is untrue. He ran for president on the Reform Party ticket in 2000. \u201cI\u2019ve won one out of one [election],\u201d Trump says. \u201cI never did politics before.\u201d Trump is asked about concerns that this declaration could set a precedent for future presidents to announce national emergencies willy nilly. \u201cNot too many people have said that,\u201d Trump says. (A lot of people, including Republicans, have definitely said that.) He repeats his statement about expecting to be sued. It could mean that the government doesn\u2019t get the money for a long time, Trump says. Trump says he will sign the final papers on the national emergency when he finishes this press conference. That could take a while because he\u2019s currently in the middle of a riff about expected legal proceedings against his declaration. \u201cWe will then be sued,\u201d after signing the declaration, Trump says. \u201cAnd we will possibly get a bad ruling, he says: \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll end up in the Supreme Court.\u201d Trump says he hopes for a positive ruling from the Supreme Court. Essentially, it is likely this national emergency declaration will be tied up for months in the courts, and possibly ruled unconstitutional. But he\u2019s doing it anyway. Trump is expanding on his national emergency plans. He said he was building the wall \u201cnot because it is a campaign promise, which it is\u201d, but due to an influx of drugs coming across the border. (Again, the majority of drugs coming into the US come through legal points of entry, not in areas where there is no wall.) \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of drugs invasion of people and its unacceptable,\u201d Trump says of the wall. National emergency declarations have been \u201csigned many times by past presidents\u201d, Trump says, which is true, but most onlookers believe such a declaration is not required in this case \u2013 and it is likely to be fought in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not like its complicated its very simple we want to stop drugs from coming into our country. We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country,\u201d Trump says. Donald Trump has declared a national emergency on the US-Mexican border in order to get money to build his promised border wall. Trump made the announcement on Thursday morning in the Rose Garden at the White House. \u201cI am going to declare a national emergency,\u201d Trump said. Trump repeated a number of lies in justifying the need for the wall. The president said, wrongly, that drugs enter the US through areas where there is no border wall. Trump said most drugs do not go through legal points of entry. \u201cYou can\u2019t take human traffic, women and girls through legal points of entry,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey [border agents] open the door, they look.\u201d Trump added \u2013 again, this is wrong \u2013 \u201cThey go through areas where they have no wall.\u201d He\u2019ll use the declaration to spend taxpayer money on the wall without Congressional approval. He had demanded $5.7bn for the wall, which Congress refused to approve. The measure, which critics call unconstitutional, is expected to face legal challenges. Several Republicans have also called it a bad idea. We\u2019re still waiting for Trump to appear. In the meantime, a group of women, each carrying large signs, have just walked into the Rose Garden for the president\u2019s announcement. It looks like they could be \u201cAngel moms\u201d \u2013 the parents or relatives of people who killed by undocumented immigrants. Trump has repeatedly invited Angel moms to his political events. This is Adam Gabbatt taking over from Erin, by the way. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has returned to the Supreme Court for the first time this year, after undergoing surgery for cancer. She\u2019ll attend a closed door conference at the court today, according to CNN. Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has launched an exploratory committee to mount a primary challenge against Donald Trump in 2020, Politico reports. Weld is a Republican who in 2016 ran for vice president on the Libertarian ticket. \u201cOur president is simply too unstable to carry out the duties of the highest executive office in the land,\u201d Weld said Friday in New Hampshire, according to Politico. \u201cI\u2019m here because I think our country is in grave peril, and I cannot sit any longer quietly on the sidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a president who openly praises and encourages despotic and authoritarian leaders abroad while going out of his way seemingly to insult and even humiliate our Democratic allies.\u201d Democrats are criticizing the use of military construction funds, one of the sources Donald Trump is expected to tap for border wall money. After Donald Trump signs the declaration of national emergency today, he\u2019s expected to head to his Mar a Lago club in Florida. Donald Trump\u2019s emergency declaration would hand him about $8 billion to build his wall on the US-Mexico border. That\u2019s $1.375 billion approved by Congress for fences along 55 miles of the Texas border, plus another $6.5 billion he intends to spend without Congressional approval, according to the Washington Post. ABC News breaks it down further: $1.375 billion would come from the spending bill Congress passed Thursday; $600 million would come from the Treasury Department\u2019s drug forfeiture fund; $2.5 billion would come from the Pentagon\u2019s drug interdiction program; and $3.5 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. It\u2019s the last item that requires the declaration of a national emergency. Donald Trump is prepared to veto any legislation from Congress to block his emergency declaration. On a call with supporters Friday morning, Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget said that Trump would \u201cabsolutely veto\u201d a bill, the Washington Post reports. He also said it will \u201cshock\u201d people how quickly the administration moves to contract and construct the wall. Republicans are making much of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments last night that he would tear down existing border walls. The Guardian took a look at the numbers after Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar ignited a controversy with two tweets claiming pro-Israel lobby money influenced American political policy and discourse. The claim led to accusations of antisemitism. The records show that pro-Israel lobbyists and donors spent more than $22m on lobbying and campaign contributions during the 2018 election cycle. Omar incorrectly suggested Aipac makes campaign contributions to candidates. However, records show it did spend about $3.5m lobbying during the 2018 election cycle. In total, pro-Israel lobbying groups spent about $5min 2018, the highest tally since tracking began in 1998. Pro-Israel groups and individuals also contributed just under $15m to USpoliticians\u2019 campaigns during the 2018 cycle, the highest amount since the 1990 cycle. The J Street Pac, a progressive, pro-Israel lobby that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, contributed the most at $4.03m. Good morning. Donald Trump is expected today to declare a national emergency, a move that would allow him to spend money on a border wall without Congressional approval. He\u2019s also expected to sign a government funding bill approved by Congress last night, preventing a government shutdown. Democrats and some Republicans call the emergency declaration unconstitutional, and it\u2019s expected to face immediate challenge. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks on the issue at 10am in the White House Rose Garden, according to Reuters. Stay tuned.",
