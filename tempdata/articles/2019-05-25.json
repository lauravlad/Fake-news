      "bodyText": "A campaign to stop Boris Johnson becoming prime minister and taking the country into a no-deal Brexit was launched by moderate cabinet ministers on Saturday as the first shots were fired in the Tory contest to succeed Theresa May in Downing Street. After May bowed to pressure on Friday and announced she would resign as Tory leader within two weeks, justice secretary David Gauke and international development secretary Rory Stewart condemned Johnson\u2019s readiness to embrace a no-deal, saying it would be hugely damaging to the national interest. The move, part of a concerted \u201canti-Johnson\u201d push by opponents of a hard Brexit, followed comments by the former foreign secretary on Friday, soon after May\u2019s resignation speech in Downing Street, that the UK would definitely leave the EU \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d on 31 October if he became leader in July. The remark infuriated the soft-Brexit wing of the party, with some MPs and ministers even warning that there would be \u201cserious numbers\u201d of moderate Conservatives who would be ready to vote down a Johnson government if he set the country on a path to no deal. In a clear attack on Johnson, Gauke, writing in today\u2019s Observer, warns that candidates who fail to acknowledge the \u201cenormously harmful\u201d effects of crashing out of the EU will fuel populism and risk doing untold harm to the economy and national interest. \u201cAll those that do have such aspirations have a responsibility to set out their approach to Brexit, which is anchored in the hard realities of the situation. We should not pretend that leaving the European Union without a deal will be anything other than enormously harmful to our economy, weaken our security relationships and threaten the integrity of the union,\u201d said Gauke. His comments come ahead of the release of European election results, which are expected to show Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party trouncing the Conservatives. \u201cThere is too often reluctance in pointing out the likely outcome of no deal. The pretence by people who should know better that no deal is somehow manageable \u2013 or could be addressed simply by \u2018proper preparation\u2019 \u2013 has only encouraged a growing part of the population to be unwilling to make any kind of accommodation with the EU. Loose talk about no deal has helped give credibility to the simplistic slogans of the Brexit party.\u201d The warnings by Gauke \u2013 expected to be endorsed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in media interviews \u2013 came after Stewart, who has declared his intention to stand, tore into Johnson and said he would refuse to serve in a government under his leadership. Stewart said: \u201cI spoke to Boris, I suppose, about two weeks ago and I thought at the time he had assured me that he wouldn\u2019t push for a no-deal Brexit. So, we had a conversation about 20, 25 minutes and I left the room reassured by him that he wouldn\u2019t do this. \u201cBut it now seems that he is coming out for a no-deal Brexit. I think it would be a huge mistake. Damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest.\u201d The warnings came as senior moderate Tories grew increasingly alarmed at signs that Johnson is already winning over MPs who fear that, if they do not back him, a more hardline candidate will emerge as the champion of pro-Brexit Tories in parliament and in the country. One senior Tory source said Johnson held appeal because he was seen by fellow MPs and Tory members as a winner after Theresa May, whose disastrous 2017 election campaign rid the party of its majority. \u201cThe unpalatable truth about the situation is that whether we like it or not, in terms of marginal seat polling, Boris is still outperforming everyone else.\u201d On Saturday the list of candidates entering the race grew as health secretary Matt Hancock threw his hat into the ring, saying he believed May had not been clear enough about the trade-offs required in reaching a Brexit deal. \u201cShe didn\u2019t start by levelling with people,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cI think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposal if you are straightforward in advance.\u201d Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab also formally entered the race with a call for a \u201cnew direction\u201d.

Spring sunshine streams through the windows; Spandau Ballet provide a gentle soundtrack; black-hatted men from the local ultra-Orthodox Jewish community pass by outside.</p> <p>The only customers are four men sitting at a table in an alcove. It was at this spot, more than five months ago, that this group of friends came up with an idea born from their collective despair over the \u201clies, lunacy and hypocrisy\u201d of the Brexit process.</p> <p>That idea was to emblazon the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/595112367358406656?lang=en\" title=\"\">2015 tweet</a> by the then prime minister David Cameron, \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband\u201d, across a giant billboard. Since then, it has turned into a national campaign that has captured the imagination of millions of people, sparked heated debate and infuriated Nigel Farage and his supporters.</p> <p>Now, the creators of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a> have decided to go public.

We\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Knowles, 43.</p> <p>The four have been targeted by the Guido Fawkes website, which claimed to have \u201cunmasked\u201d them as \u201cGreenpeace campaigners\u201d last week after they registered their names with the Electoral Commission. Stewart and Knowles do indeed work for Greenpeace, and Sadri and Rose have previously worked for the environmental campaign group, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/07/billboard-campaigners-brexit-led-by-donkeys\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a> is an entirely freelance amateur operation. \u201cNo one at work knew we were doing this,\u201d said Stewart, 45.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d21220b158e7682b73d8d80a9cd518e8f7c9979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d21220b158e7682b73d8d80a9cd518e8f7c9979/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster that went up in Leeds in January with a Boris Johnson tweet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster that went up in Leeds in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men met for a pint at the Birdcage in mid-December, just after Theresa May had postponed the first scheduled Commons vote on her Brexit deal. \u201cIt felt like the country had reached another level of chaos,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cWe were looking at Cameron\u2019s tweet from before the 2015 election, which was doing the rounds again, and pissing ourselves with laughter. We said it would be a real shame if he deleted it because it encapsulates the total failure of Britain\u2019s political leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Their eyes alighted on an advertising billboard across the road. Within a few days, they had ordered five billboard posters, each in 12 sections: tweets and quotes from Cameron, Michael Gove, Liam Fox, John Redwood and David Davis. And they chose the campaign\u2019s name from the phrase \u201clions led by donkeys\u201d used to describe first world war soldiers and their incompetent generals.</p> <p>In January, the first poster went up on \u201cborrowed space\u201d in Stoke Newington, covering an ad for the Halifax. The group had invested in hi-vis jackets (in the hope of looking legitimate), a ladder, buckets and wallpaper paste, but they had no idea how to actually get the printed sheets up on the giant board.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheets kept falling down, drivers were stopping to look at us, we were covered in paste, and it took us an hour and a half. But then we stood back and looked at it. Olly put his arm round my shoulder and said: \u2018This is absolutely fucking beautiful\u2019. We took a picture to post on social media, expecting maybe seven retweets.

It was reached within three hours. \u201cWe increased it to \u00a350,000, and we\u2019d hit that by the next morning,\u201d said Stewart.

      "body": "<p>Last Sunday, I went to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DeLALXaFuQ&amp;t=3589s\" title=\"\">a Brexit party</a> rally in Frimley, Surrey. The venue was the Lakeside Hotel and Country Club complex, well known as the setting for international darts contests. Inside, 1,200 or so people had gathered to hear Nigel Farage and most of the party\u2019s other would-be MEPs for the south-east region. The atmosphere was roughly as I had expected: highly charged, defiant, often strangely celebratory. But what was most striking was the slickness of the presentation: brisk, elegantly structured speeches and warm-up videos, and the clear sense that everyone had been told to lay off subjects that usually buzz around Farage \u2013 immigration, chiefly. Instead, they doubled down on the twin themes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/jean-claude-juncker-criticises-mps-prioritising-theresa-mays-removal-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit being denied and delayed</a>, and what that says about the people and institutions in charge of the country.</p> <p>The first speaker was one Robert Rowland, a candidate with the face, haircut and stiff demeanour of a freshly bought Action Man. \u201cIf Brexit fails, we cease even to be a democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe duplicitous professional political class will have prevailed. The last three years have seen Britain\u2019s establishment \u2013 the civil servants, the majority of MPs from both parties, academia, the judiciary, and of course let\u2019s not forget the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/may/12/nigel-farage-blasts-bbc-on-andrew-marr-show-for-being-ridiculous-and-ludicrous-video\" title=\"\">BBC</a>\u201d \u2013 at this point, there were loud boos \u2013 \u201cdo their damnedest to delay, defuse and dilute Brexit.

And representative democracy means that the representatives can do what they like. I say, no, that\u2019s not democracy. In a democracy, the people are the power.\u201d Soon after, Farage appeared, grinning from ear to ear and bellowing out his super-charged version of the same messages. The chant that greeted him suggested that if some English people have embraced the politics of wild claims and demagoguery, it at least comes with a certain bathos: \u201cNigel! Nigel! Nigel!\u201d</p> <p>Not, of course, that anyone should be laughing. There is something very sobering indeed about watching a handful of chancers lay in to the fragile mesh of institutions and ideas that underpin our democracy, and a head-spinning quality in the fact that they do so in the name of democracy itself.

Handed yet another opportunity by a Conservative party whose collective stupidity has long since reached the point of surrealism, Farage\u2019s greatest asset is a discourse full of crude binaries, established by the original referendum and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/theresa-may-never-had-a-grip-on-the-crown-that-fell-into-her-lap\" title=\"\">deepened by the hardcore postures struck by Theresa May</a> in its aftermath (the main reason, incidentally, why she deserves her fate).
