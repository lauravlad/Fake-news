But he would not issue an apology.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I\u2019ll say is this: I am determined that our society will be safe for people of all faiths. I don\u2019t want anyone to be feeling insecure in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains or in any or any other form of life.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He was also confronted with specific allegations of antisemitism that have been raised against Labour members who have not been suspended and into whom investigations have been running for lengthy periods of time.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn was unable to say who would campaign for the Brexit deal he has promised he would negotiate and then put to the country, alongside remain, in a referendum.</strong> Following a theme seen throughout the interview, Corbyn sought to explain his party\u2019s policy and the intentions behind it, while Neil tried to pin him down on specifics. Corbyn presented his plan to remain personally neutral as statesmanlike as Neil asked him why the UK would want a prime minister who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a view on what really is the greatest peacetime issue that\u2019s faced this country for 70 years\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would be the prime minister that would make sure that there was a fair debate and fair discussion, we\u2019d come to conclusion at the end of it and I would carry out the result of that referendum in whatever way it went.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Labour leader admitted his tax policies would, in fact, mean some people on less than \u00a380,000 per year would see effective increases.</strong> Pressed on his claims that only the richest would pay more, Corbyn acknowledged that his plan to scrap the marriage tax allowance, for example, would actually mean people on lower incomes losing a \u00a3250-a-year relief.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They will also be getting a pay rise when we bring in a living wage. They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four year olds. They\u2019ll also get properly funded schools.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Some of Labour\u2019s plans will require borrowing, Corbyn acknowledged. </strong>But he presented some elements as investments and others as moral obligations. Referring to his pledge to compensate the Waspi women, Corbyn said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a moral case. Those women were short-changed by government.

He also claimed that Corbyn did not even understand the problem properly. Mirvis wrote:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes.

However, he did point out that while Labour has launched<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-launches-ambitious-race-and-faith-manifesto-rooted-in-social-justice-internationalism-and-human-rights/\"> its own race and faith manifesto</a>, the Conservative party said almost nothing on these issues in its own manifesto.

This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit.</p> \n   <p>It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism.

Jeremy Corbyn gets the Neil treatment tonight. Last night <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland\u2019s first minister, was put through the Neil wringer. I would not normally post on something that happened last night, but in the comments below the line some readers have been asking why we did not cover the interview in more detail, it came up briefly at the Scottish Tory launch earlier and I can\u2019t find a good summary elsewhere on the web, so here is a round-up of the main points. You can watch the half-hour programme<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000bqs0/the-andrew-neil-interviews-election-2019-nicola-sturgeon\"> here.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sturgeon said she did not think it was \u201ccredible\u201d to believe that Jeremy Corbyn would refuse to grant the SNP demand for a Scottish independence referendum if he needed the SNP to support a Labour minority government. </strong>But she admitted that the SNP would back the Labour proposal for a second Brexit referendum whatever, and Neil put it to her that her bargaining position would be weak if Corbyn refused her request, because the SNP would not support a Tory government. Sturgeon rejected this. Asked if she would really be willing to withhold support from a minority Labour government if it did not agree to an independence referendum, she replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A minority government will have to demonstrate that it\u2019s got the ability to govern, and yes, I\u2019m trying to be frank - and I think more politicians could benefit from being frank about this - I don\u2019t think it is reasonable for any Labour leader or any Westminster politician to say to the SNP, \u2018give us support\u2019 if they don\u2019t accept that fundamental principle of Scotland having the right to choose our own future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Sturgeon also said compromise would be necessary.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I also accept that in any discussion of this nature, if we\u2019re in this position after this election because no party\u2019s got an overall majority ... compromise will be required on all sides. I get all of that and I accept that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She claimed that, even if UK were to vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum, a second independence referendum would still be justified.</strong> Neil put it to her that in those circumstances Scotland would not have undergone the \u201cmaterial change\u201d that the SNP said would be needed for a re-run of the 2014 independence referendum to be justified. Sturgeon rejected this. She claimed that the experience of the last three years was enough to justify one because of \u201cthe way in which Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to [it] over the past three years that our views and our views doesn\u2019t matter\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She refused to say how long it would take Scotland to rejoin the EU if Scotland voted for independence after Brexit.</strong> Neil put it to her that it would be five to 10 years, because that is how long the SNP\u2019s growth commission report said it would take for Scotland to establish its own currency.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She rejected claims that Scotland would need its own independent currency before it would be allowed to join the EU.</strong> She said an independent Scotland would start off using the pound. Neil claimed the EU would not allow this. But Sturgeon did not accept that. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We would have a discussion with the European Union about the journey an independent Scotland goes on in terms of currency and the accession, if Scotland was already out of the European Union [at] the point where we rejoined the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She was unable to say how an independent Scotland would build up the currency reserves needed to support a new currency.</strong> Neil pointed out that Scotland was running a deficit. Sturgeon accepted this, but said the deficit was coming down. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She was unable to explain why the SNP says leaving the EU would lead to job losses in Scotland, but why leaving the United Kingdom would not lead to similar job losses.</strong> Neil said the Scottish government has accepted research showing that 80,000 jobs in Scotland could go after Brexit because of the impact of trade friction. Asked why the same thing would not happen after Scottish independence, if Scotland ended up in the EU and the rest of the UK was outside, Sturgeon just said we did not know yet what England\u2019s final relationship with the EU would be. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t yet know what the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU will [be].

Overall the Tories would capture 71 Labour seats if they achieved such a swing everywhere. However, 15 of these seats voted remain. That leaves 56 Labour marginals that voted leave.</p> \n   <p>If we assume the Tories lose around 20 seats to the SNP and Liberal Democrats (without tactical voting, their losses may be fewer), and gains 56 seats from Labour, then Boris Johnson ends up with a majority of 65 (assuming Sinn F\u00e9in MPs stay away from parliament).</p> \n   <p>It would not take much for the Tories to do significantly better than that. Labour has 90 seats vulnerable to a 10% swing. Of these, 70 voted leave.

Dubs, who arrived in the UK in 1939 as a refugee from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, said he respected Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, but thought he was wrong on this. Dubs said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, I have a lot of respect for the chief rabbi, I\u2019ve co-operated with him on campaigns on behalf of child refugees, I\u2019ve spoken to him in many synagogues and I\u2019ve got a lot of positive feeling about the Jewish community, but I think today the chief rabbi has gone too far \u2026</p> \n   <p>I think the Labour party has been much too slow in getting to grips with this, and I\u2019ve been critical of the Labour party over the last two or three years, but I feel we are getting there, and I want to look at it from the point of view of where we are today and moving forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if he thought Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, Dubs replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think he is, yes, I think he is fit to be prime minister. I do not believe he is antisemitic. I believe things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t believe he is personally antisemitic and I believe he will find it very, very hurtful that people accuse him of being antisemitic or racist or Islamophobic. He is none of those things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked whether Jewish people should fear a Labour government, Dubs said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would say you do not have to fear.

Labour sources are disputing this, but Kerslake said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Labour] would then need to have conversations with those [minority] parties to really establish on what basis they would give that support.</p> \n   <p>We don\u2019t yet know in truth how that would play out, although the Liberal Democrats have said they could not support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour government and the SNP have said they would want a second referendum.</p> \n   <p>All of that, no doubt, would form part of the conversation that Labour would be having informally with those two parties.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his Today interview this morning <strong>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson</strong>, the DUP chief whip, also hinted that the DUP could rethink its opposition to Labour if Corbyn were to be replaced as leader. The DUP had a confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May. But now it finds itself isolated because Boris Johnson is proposing a Brexit deal that would in effect create a customs border down the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable to unionists. Asked who the DUP wanted to win the election, Donaldson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, that\u2019s a matter for the electorate, but clearly we\u2019ve stated we believe a Corbyn-led Labour government would be disastrous for the UK. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that his use of the phrase \u201cCorbyn-led Labour government\u201d implied the DUP might take a different view of a Labour government led by someone else, and when he was asked if the DUP could \u201cdo business\u201d with such a government, Donaldson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, it would depend what their platform was. We would have to look at that very carefully.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the DUP could support Labour\u2019s plan for a second referendum featuring two options, remain and a leave option, Donaldson did not rule this out. \u201cWell, we\u2019d need to see what the deal was, of course,\u201d he replied. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not going to commit myself to something at this stage that is entirely hypothetical. But clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and that\u2019s a major problem for us because, if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability, and we certainly don\u2019t need that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Political parties tend to react very badly to other parties telling them who they should have as leader, and it is hard to imagine Labour ditching Corbyn just to win parliamentary support from the Lib Dems or the DUP. But there is some sort of precedent for gestures of this kind. After the 2010 general election Gordon Brown announced that he would quit before the end of the year in the hope that this might make the Lib Dems more willing to form a pact with Labour.

My colleague, Andrew Sparrow, has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s main events: Since he wrote that, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced a bruising encounter with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil; a summary of which you can read here. And the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator said it would not be possible to negotiate a trade deal in the 11 months available in the prime minister\u2019s timetable (see: 6.19pm). Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview this evening: The Labour leader declined repeated opportunities to apologise to the UK\u2019s Jewish community over his handling of antisemitism with his party. During sustained questioning on the damaging issue, which took up about a third of the interview, Corbyn sought to defend his record, claiming to have strengthened the party\u2019s processes for rooting out antisemitism. But he would not issue an apology. What I\u2019ll say is this: I am determined that our society will be safe for people of all faiths. I don\u2019t want anyone to be feeling insecure in our society and our government will protect every community against the abuse they receive on the streets, on the trains or in any or any other form of life. He was also confronted with specific allegations of antisemitism that have been raised against Labour members who have not been suspended and into whom investigations have been running for lengthy periods of time. Corbyn was unable to say who would campaign for the Brexit deal he has promised he would negotiate and then put to the country, alongside remain, in a referendum. Following a theme seen throughout the interview, Corbyn sought to explain his party\u2019s policy and the intentions behind it, while Neil tried to pin him down on specifics. Corbyn presented his plan to remain personally neutral as statesmanlike as Neil asked him why the UK would want a prime minister who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a view on what really is the greatest peacetime issue that\u2019s faced this country for 70 years\u201d. I would be the prime minister that would make sure that there was a fair debate and fair discussion, we\u2019d come to conclusion at the end of it and I would carry out the result of that referendum in whatever way it went. The Labour leader admitted his tax policies would, in fact, mean some people on less than \u00a380,000 per year would see effective increases. Pressed on his claims that only the richest would pay more, Corbyn acknowledged that his plan to scrap the marriage tax allowance, for example, would actually mean people on lower incomes losing a \u00a3250-a-year relief. They will also be getting a pay rise when we bring in a living wage. They will also be getting improvement in free nursery provision for two to four year olds. They\u2019ll also get properly funded schools. Some of Labour\u2019s plans will require borrowing, Corbyn acknowledged. But he presented some elements as investments and others as moral obligations. Referring to his pledge to compensate the Waspi women, Corbyn said: It\u2019s a moral case. Those women were short-changed by government. Short changed in 2011 by the change in the pension rate. My colleague, Rowena Mason, is putting together a comprehensive story on Corbyn\u2019s interview with the BBC, which you can read here: And that\u2019s that, Neil calls the interview to a close. Neil accuses the Labour leader of tending to side with the UK\u2019s enemies. Corbyn says he wants to keep Britain safe. He also declines to say for certain whether or not he would give the orders to kill any new leader of so-called Islamic State if it was not possible to arrest them. He says the UK must abide by international law and attempt to arrest someone \u201cif it is possible\u201d. I will take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time with all the information, you asked me a hypothetical question in a hypothetical scenario. And the Labour leader stressed that it was essential to look \u201cto the future\u201d and at how the terror group formed and spread, adding: \u201cWe also have to look at how we created these dangers as well.\u201d Asking how he will pay for his policy to compensate the Waspi women, Corbyn says it must be paid for because it\u2019s a moral question. Corbyn says the UK will pay for it over \u201csome years\u201d and the money will come either from government reserves or, if necessary, the government will borrow for it. Neil asks Corbyn about his borrowing plans. The Labour leader acknowledges taking institutions into public ownership would require him to issue debt but says there will be a return as well. He added: We are not going to willy-nilly borrow, what we are going to do is deal with the worst aspects of what\u2019s happened in austerity, the worst aspects of poverty in Britain. Corbyn defended his policy to scrap the marriage tax allowance, which Neil suggests undermines his promise that only those earning more than \u00a380,000 per year would see tax increases. The Labour leader says measures such as the introduction of a living wage would mitigate. On his taxation plans, Corbyn denied that a significant part his income tax base would leave the country if he took power. No, it doesn\u2019t crumble at all ... I think they would also recognise that tax rates in general have gone down, that inequality has gone up ... They can see all around them the crumbling of public services and the terrible levels of child poverty that exist across Britain ... There is no reason why they would have to leave the country and they shouldn\u2019t. Neil moves on to Brexit, asking Corbyn why people would want a prime minister who would call a referendum and then decline to say which path he supports. I will be the honest broker that will make sure the referendum is fair and make sure that the leave deal is a credible one and the remain option is alongside it. Corbyn added: \u201cThat seems to me actually an adult and sensible way to go forward.\u201d But he was unable to say who would lead the campaign for his Brexit deal. Corbyn says he has spent his life \u201copposing racism of any form\u201d, adding: \u201cThat is what my life is about.\u201d The Labour leader then declined to apologise four times to the Jewish community, saying instead that he wanted to protect all communities and work with them to ensure racism is \u201celiminated\u201d. Neil presents Corbyn with a specific example of comments the Labour leader agrees are antisemitic and asks why the person accused of making them has not been suspended \u2013 as well as why the party\u2019s investigation into them has taken a year. Corbyn responds that the process is independent of him and says he believes legal representations may have been made, causing delays. Corbyn was challenged over Rabbi Mirvis\u2019s allegation that Labour\u2019s claims it is doing everything to tackle anti-Jewish racism was a \u201cmendacious fiction\u201d. He replied: No, he\u2019s not right. Because he would have to produce the evidence to say that\u2019s mendacious. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with the BBC is starting now. The interviewer, Andrew Neil, opens with a question on the chief rabbi\u2019s claims on antisemitism within the Labour party. Corbyn says antisemitism is not acceptable within society or his party and says he has amended the party\u2019s processes to have people guilty of antisemitism from the party. He also denies the accusation that instances of antisemitism have risen during his tenure as leader. It didn\u2019t rise after I became leader. Antisemitism is there in society, there are a very, very small number of people in the Labour party that have been sanctioned as a result about their antisemitic behaviour. The BBC has posted a clip from its interview with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, which is due to air in a few minutes: We reported earlier that the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, believes it will not be possible to agree a comprehensive trade deal in the 11-month window that would be available if the UK left on 31 January (see: 6.19pm). Now, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, has said: These comments show Boris Johnson is lying to the country. It\u2019s clearly not possible to do a trade deal with the EU in 11 months and now those on the other side of the negotiating table agree. Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline would mean yet another year of damaging uncertainty for businesses and families, with the threat of no deal continuing to loom over the country. There is no deal with the EU that is better than the one we enjoy now as full members. Liberal Democrats will keep fighting to stop Brexit, deny Boris Johnson a majority and build a brighter future for the country. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to apologise to the British Jewish community following a remarkable election intervention from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who used an article in the Times to suggest that the \u201cmoral compass\u201d of Britain would be awry if Labour won the election because of Corbyn\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in his party. In his article Mirvis did not raise any new allegations about Corbyn or his party, but he said the Labour claim that it was doing everything it could to tackle antisemitism in the party was \u201ca mendacious fiction\u201d. He also claimed that Corbyn did not even understand the problem properly. Mirvis wrote: The party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party. Many members of the Jewish community can hardly believe that this is the same party that they called their political home for more than a century. It can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism. And he concluded his article: It is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience. Be in no doubt, the very soul of our nation is at stake. This morning, at the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto, Corbyn said antisemitism was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d and \u201cwould not be tolerated in any form whatsoever\u201d by him. He also offered to meet Mirvis to discuss this further. Many Corbyn supporters are exasperated by this line of attack, which they believe is being amplified by rightwing newspapers with no genuine anti-racist credentials, but Corbyn himself was careful to avoid criticising Mirvis personally or denying the existence of a problem. However, he did point out that while Labour has launched its own race and faith manifesto, the Conservative party said almost nothing on these issues in its own manifesto. Inspired by the chief rabbi, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was important to speak up for the experience of Mulsims in the Tory party too. In a statement the MCB said: The way that the chief rabbi had shared his experiences and insights, has highlighted the importance of speaking out on the racism we face, whilst maintaining our non-partisan stance. As a faith community, we commonly are threatened by Islamophobia. This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit. It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism. It is as if the Conservative party has a blind spot for this type of racism. Boris Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments showed Corbyn had been guility of a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d on the issue of antisemitism. However, mindful no doubt of complaints about racist language he has used himself in the past, when Johnson was asked about this in Scotland, he seemed keen to move the subject on and he quickly made a wider point about Corbyn\u2019s supposed lack of leadership on Brexit. The Conservative vulnerability on this issue was on display later in the day when Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to endorse Johnson\u2019s \u201cletter box\u201d article about Muslim women wearing burqas that was deemed responsible for a sharp rise in incidents of Islamophobia. Javid also claimed he was not disappointed that the inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party he proposed has been converted by Johnson into an inquiry into racism in general in the party. Javid published a Tory analysis of the Labour manifesto that he claimed proved that ordinary people would pay more in tax under Corbyn\u2019s plans. Labour claims only the richest 5% will pay more in tax. But the Tory document identified six \u201ctax rises\u201d (some of them were just financial penalties, not proper tax rises) that might effect non-wealthy taxpayers under Labour. Javid also said that, following the publication of the Labour manifesto, the Conservatives have revised their calculations about how much extra spending they will entail, and what this will mean for taxpayers. By happy coincidence, the Tories have concluded that the overall cost, \u00a31.2tr, and the cost to taxpayers, \u00a32,400 per year, are the same as they were when the party calculated them before the Labour manifesto was published. Both those figures were widely seen as bogus because they were based on too many false or questionable assumptions. Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament. The Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation after distributing fake newspapers with names similar to be independent publications, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party. A sharp rise in voter registration, predominantly among young people, has boosted Labour\u2019s hopes in the general election. Michael Gove has mocked Stormzy for expressing his support for Labour and Corbyn in the forthcoming election. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is in charge now. The chief rabbi\u2019s remarks about Labour and antisemitism should concern \u201cevery right-thinking person\u201d, Nicola Sturgeon has told reporters at a campaign visit to Uddingston. I very much hope that the Labour party listen seriously and carefully to the chief rabbi\u2019s comments today and act on these concerns about anti-semitism. But I would say to people who have concerns about Jeremy Corbyn, if he gets himself into a position of being able to form a government with the help of others then better to have the SNP as a force in there making the right values, policies and priorities are pursued rather than having Labour without that influence. Sturgeon was visiting a nursery to announce a proposal to \u201ctransform\u201d parental leave, by extending shared leave to 64 weeks at an increased rate, including 12 weeks ring-fenced \u201cdaddy leave\u201d. The proposal was welcomed by campaigners \u2013 the work-life balance charity Working Families has been calling for a similar scheme aimed at fathers for a long time, given the uptake of shared parental leave remains low and the evidence suggests that fathers who do have some leave from work with young children are more involved as their families grow up. The Westminster government is currently consulting on parental leave, although neither Tories nor Labour have proposed anything aimed directly at fathers in their manifestos. It will not be possible to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal in the 11-month transition period that would follow an exit from the bloc on 31 January, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told a private meeting of senior MEPs in Strasbourg. The UK is due to leave the single market and customs union at the end of December 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. At that point, new arrangements \u2013 or none \u2013 will come into force. Any extension to the UK\u2019s membership of the single market and customs union would need to be agreed before 1 July. Barnier said that, if such an extension was not sought by the UK, negotiators would \u201cneed to focus on specific subjects\u201d and that agreement on various issues, including the rights of British air carriers to operate as they do today, would have to wait until after 2020. Barnier said the key areas on which the negotiators would work in the coming year would be trade in goods, data, fisheries, aviation, police and judicial cooperation. The goal for the EU is to agree on \u201czero quotas, zero tariffs and zero dumping\u201d, he said in a reference to the bloc\u2019s determination to ensure that the UK signs up to a high degree of regulatory alignment to ensure British companies do not have a competitive advantage post-Brexit. Barnier also told MEPs that the \u201ctoughest question\u201d would be the EU\u2019s insistence that free movement in goods comes as a package with the free movement of people. He added that the most \u201cdifficult outcome\u201d for the EU would be a hung parliament as it would imperil ratification of the deal in Westminster. The prime minister has claimed the UK can conclude a trade deal in time, though experts had already pointed out that such deal typically take years to negotiate and ratify. Boris Johnson has claimed the Tory party takes anti-Islamic abuse seriously after criticism of his party\u2019s handling of the issue from the Muslim Council of Britain. The prime minister told reporters on a visit to the International Aviation Academy in Norwich that he did not agree with the claim that his party has approached Islamophobia with \u201cdenial, dismissal and deceit\u201d. He said: What we do in the Tory party is, when anybody is guilty of any kind of prejudice or discrimination against another group, then they\u2019re out first bounce. Johnson has himself been accused of Islamophobia over his own past comments about Muslims. Earlier this month, the Guardian reported on a dossier of detailing Islamophobic and racist material posted by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors: This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer. Here are the main points from Sajid Javid\u2019s Q&amp;A. Javid, the chancellor, refused to endorse the language that Boris Johnson used in a Telegraph column when he described Muslim women in burqas as looking like letter boxes. Javid claimed that the Conservative problem with Islamophobia was not the same as Labour\u2019s problem with antisemitism partly because \u201cno one has every credibly suggested that it\u2019s an issue with the leadership of the party\u201d. But, when asked repeatedly whether he would have been willing to use the \u201cletter box\u201d language that Johnson used, Javid repeatedly refused to endorse what Johnson wrote. Javid said: All politicians will choose their own words and ways to explain whatever is the point they are trying to get across. We\u2019ve all got our own type of language. Javid also said that Johnson had explained what he meant, and that Johnson was actually trying in that article to defend the rights of women to wear what they want. Javid said the Conservatives should not be willing to accept Islamophobia in their ranks. Asked about this issue, he said: We will never, ever as a party tolerate anyone among our ranks that has any kind of prejudice to any group of people, whether it\u2019s based on their race or their religion or the gender or anything else. We will never tolerate it. He rejected claims that the proposed inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party had been watered down. During the Tory leadership contest, in one TV debate, Javid bounced Johnson and the other candidates into agreeing that there should be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. Johnson is going to set up an inquiry, but it will cover all forms of racism. Asked if he was disappointed about the inquiry being watered down in this way, Javid replied: No, I\u2019m not disappointed. Nothing is going to be watered down. We are absolutely committed to doing everything we can, doing more, to root any kind of prejudice amongst anyone who has got any association with the Conservative party. There is no excuse for it. Javid said the inquiry would start before Christmas. And he said people would be impressed by how serious it was. He said: Once that\u2019s published, the terms, people will see just how serious we are. We will never, ever tolerate any kind of prejudice of any kind. Boris Johnson again made a series of unforced errors when he launched the Scottish Conservative election manifesto, wrongly claiming a spaceport was being built in Scotland; that the SNP wanted to use the euro and that Jeremy Corbyn wanted to scrap the armed forces. Giving the carefully improvised stump speech he has made his trademark, Johnson accused the Labour leader of plotting to demilitarise the UK, staying: \u201cCorbyn has said he wants to scrap our armed services, and can\u2019t think of circumstances in which he would use them.\u201d While Corbyn has in the past suggested global demilitarisation and is a CND member, the Labour manifesto commits a Corbyn-led government to spending at least 2% of UK GDP on the armed forces, remain in Nato, replacing the Trident nuclear missile fleet and increasing UK funding for UN peacekeeping by \u00a3100m. Johnson then referred to a prickly BBC interview between Andrew Neil and Nicola Sturgeon broadcast on Monday night, where Neil pressed the first minister on her plans for an independent Scotland rejoining the EU. Banging his fist on the lectern in emphasis, the prime minister told activists: Confirmed last night, as I understood it, to Andrew Neil \u2013 did I get this right? \u2013 confirmed to rejoin the EU, to join the euro, to put up a border at Berwick, hand back control, obey very jot and tittle of the panoply of EU legislation and hand back control of the fantastic marine wealth of Scotland to Brussels. The SNP said this was \u201cutter fiction\u201d; the party wants to first use sterling after independence and then in time create a new Scottish currency. It explicitly rejects taking on the euro, although its critics insist that EU membership requires a commitment to eventually joining the currency union. Johnson finally wrongly asserted there was a spaceport in Sutherland, in the far north of Scotland, being built \u2013 only to be corrected by an audience member that it was still only planned. Riffing on the wealth- and job-creating potential of artificial intelligence and advance technologies, Johnson said: Not forgetting the spaceport that is under construction or is it under construction or almost complete \u2026 [an audience member corrects him] on its way. The spaceport that is on its way in Scotland \u2013 it certainly will be complete in 10 years time, which will send British satellites into the heavens and drive one of our most exciting new industries. That Space Hub Sutherland project has significant official backing but it is not yet cleared for construction, and is months away from receiving planning permission. It is expected to start that process next month. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From my colleague Peter Walker Q: [From my colleague John Crace] In the Tory leadership contest you managed to get all candidates to agree to an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Are you disappointed it has been watered down into a general inquiry? No, says Javid. He says \u201cnothing has been watered down\u201d. He says when people see the terms of inquiry, they will see how serious it is. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: Why have you not committed to the whole of Northern Powerhouse Rail if you can afford it under your borrowing rules? Javid says the party has not set out all its borrowing under the new borrowing rules. If they win the election, the Conservatives will say more in their first budget. But he says he is \u201cvery keen\u201d on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Q: Boris Johnson says he wants to raise the national insurance threshold eventually to \u00a312,500. But that is not in the manifesto. Will it happen in the next parliament? Javid says the Tories are a tax-cutting party. The national insurance threshold will go up to \u00a39,500, saving people around \u00a3100. But he says he cannot say when the national insurance threshold will rise further. Q: What extra spending would come to Bolton under a Tory government? Javid says people think the north does not get enough infrastructure spending. He says he wants to address that. Q: What about Boris Johnson\u2019s use of Islamophobic language? Javid says Johnson has defended the language he used in his Telegraph article that compared Muslim women to letterboxes. He says Johnson has given an explanation for this. Johnson was making a point about how women should be free to wear what they want. He says the Labour situation is different. The Conservative party has not had MPs leaving because of the views of the party leader. Q: Would you use that language? Incidents of Islamophobia went up 375% after that article. Javid says Johnson has defended his language. Q: Would you use that language? Javid says politicians decide what language they want to use. Q: So you are not saying you would not say that? Javid says he wants to bring people together. Javid is now taking questions. Q: Why do you think Labour would not be able to borrow to spend more? And, given that both main parties are planning to spend more, why should people trust you more on spending then them? Javid says Labour itself admits it would put tax up. It is also proposing higher borrowing. But there remains a black hole, Javid claims. Javid says Labour would not just borrow more because it has fiscal rules. He says he is taking them at their word, assuming they would meet their fiscal rules. And if Labour does borrow more, taxpayers will eventually have to pay for that anyway, he says. He says the Conservatives have published their own costs. In most cases he used Treasury figures in that costings document, he says. He says Labour has not challenged the figures in that document. And he says his fiscal rules are much stricter than Labour\u2019s. Javid claims there are six tax rises in the Labour manifesto that would hit ordinary people. There at least six confirmed tax rises they\u2019ve hidden away that will hit people hard: The marriage tax \u2013 removing an allowance so families lose \u00a3250 a year. A stealth tax on drivers \u2013 hiking the cost of petrol by 16p a litre. A stealth tax on heating \u2013 increasing the energy bills of 24 million households heated by gas. Higher inheritance tax \u2013 reversing our previous cut. The pension tax \u2013 reducing pensions by \u00a311,000, hitting up to 10 million savers. And the small business tax \u2013 adding a \u00a35,000 bill to 1 million small business owners. Javid says the Labour claim that 95% of taxpayers would not have to pay more under its plans is not plausible. Labour\u2019s numbers only add up with significant tax rises for the 95%, not just the 5. They say they want to raise \u00a383bn in new taxes every year. As chancellor I can tell you, you can\u2019t simply raise that amount of money from such a small group of people. But it\u2019s worse than that because there\u2019s currently an \u00a3385bn financial hole in Labour\u2019s plans. And that means tax hikes on hard-working families on lower and middle incomes, like many of the proud people of Bolton. Javid says the Tories published a claim earlier in the campaign that a Corbyn government would spend \u00a31.2tn. He claims that, now the Labour manifesto has been published, the Tories have been able to review the figure. It could be an underestimate, he claims. Well now they\u2019ve released their final plans, and the direct cost of Corbyn is confirmed. And it could actually be worse than we feared. If anything it\u2019s an underestimate. Labour\u2019s costings document shamelessly overlooked many of the commitments in their manifesto \u2013 59 of which don\u2019t have enough detail for us to cost fairly, so we have left those out. Here is an article by my colleague Richard Partington explaining why the original \u00a31.2tn figure was flawed. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is giving a speech in Bolton on the cost of Labour\u2019s plans. We will have a live feed at the top of the blog soon. The most aggressive and forensic interviewer on TV at the moment is the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil and he is interviewing the party leaders during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn gets the Neil treatment tonight. Last night Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, was put through the Neil wringer. I would not normally post on something that happened last night, but in the comments below the line some readers have been asking why we did not cover the interview in more detail, it came up briefly at the Scottish Tory launch earlier and I can\u2019t find a good summary elsewhere on the web, so here is a round-up of the main points. You can watch the half-hour programme here. Sturgeon said she did not think it was \u201ccredible\u201d to believe that Jeremy Corbyn would refuse to grant the SNP demand for a Scottish independence referendum if he needed the SNP to support a Labour minority government. But she admitted that the SNP would back the Labour proposal for a second Brexit referendum whatever, and Neil put it to her that her bargaining position would be weak if Corbyn refused her request, because the SNP would not support a Tory government. Sturgeon rejected this. Asked if she would really be willing to withhold support from a minority Labour government if it did not agree to an independence referendum, she replied: A minority government will have to demonstrate that it\u2019s got the ability to govern, and yes, I\u2019m trying to be frank - and I think more politicians could benefit from being frank about this - I don\u2019t think it is reasonable for any Labour leader or any Westminster politician to say to the SNP, \u2018give us support\u2019 if they don\u2019t accept that fundamental principle of Scotland having the right to choose our own future. But Sturgeon also said compromise would be necessary. I also accept that in any discussion of this nature, if we\u2019re in this position after this election because no party\u2019s got an overall majority ... compromise will be required on all sides. I get all of that and I accept that. She claimed that, even if UK were to vote to remain in the EU in a second referendum, a second independence referendum would still be justified. Neil put it to her that in those circumstances Scotland would not have undergone the \u201cmaterial change\u201d that the SNP said would be needed for a re-run of the 2014 independence referendum to be justified. Sturgeon rejected this. She claimed that the experience of the last three years was enough to justify one because of \u201cthe way in which Scotland has had it completely demonstrated to [it] over the past three years that our views and our views doesn\u2019t matter\u201d. She refused to say how long it would take Scotland to rejoin the EU if Scotland voted for independence after Brexit. Neil put it to her that it would be five to 10 years, because that is how long the SNP\u2019s growth commission report said it would take for Scotland to establish its own currency. She rejected claims that Scotland would need its own independent currency before it would be allowed to join the EU. She said an independent Scotland would start off using the pound. Neil claimed the EU would not allow this. But Sturgeon did not accept that. She said: We would have a discussion with the European Union about the journey an independent Scotland goes on in terms of currency and the accession, if Scotland was already out of the European Union [at] the point where we rejoined the European Union. She was unable to say how an independent Scotland would build up the currency reserves needed to support a new currency. Neil pointed out that Scotland was running a deficit. Sturgeon accepted this, but said the deficit was coming down. She was unable to explain why the SNP says leaving the EU would lead to job losses in Scotland, but why leaving the United Kingdom would not lead to similar job losses. Neil said the Scottish government has accepted research showing that 80,000 jobs in Scotland could go after Brexit because of the impact of trade friction. Asked why the same thing would not happen after Scottish independence, if Scotland ended up in the EU and the rest of the UK was outside, Sturgeon just said we did not know yet what England\u2019s final relationship with the EU would be. She said: We don\u2019t yet know what the UK\u2019s final relationship with the EU will [be]. When we have clarity on that we have to understand those implications and we have to set out clearly how we deal with those implications in order to keep trade flowing between Scotland and England, which is in our interests and in the interests of the rest of the UK. She claimed that a confirmatory referendum was necessary on Brexit because leavers did not give details of what they were planning in 2016, but she said that if Scotland had voted for independence in 2014, a second confirmatory referendum would not have been necessary because the SNP had been very clear about what it was planning. But Neil rejected this argument, saying that the SNP plan in 2014 assumed oil revenues of \u00a38bn by 2016, but that the actual figure was \u00a3300m in 2016. She admitted that the NHS in Scotland was only meeting two of its eight key waiting time targets. Neil said: \u201cYou\u2019ve called for legislation to protect the NHS from Donald Trump. Maybe the NHS needs legislation to protect it from Nicola Sturgeon?\u201d Sturgeon said obviously she did not accept that. Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor when Tony Blair was PM, told the World at One that he thought the chief rabbi\u2019s criticism of Labour over antisemitism was justified. UPDATE: Presumably Falconer was using the word \u201cvote\u201d in a loose, metaphorical sense when he really meant \u201csupport\u201d. As Phil Gibson points out BTL, members of the House of Lords do not get a vote in general elections. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Fife. Johnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament. Asked what would happen if the Tories were the largest party in a hung parliament, and another party demanded a second referendum on Scottish independence or on Brexit as the price for putting Johnson in power, he replied: I don\u2019t normally answer that kind of hypothetical question but I think in your case I\u2019m going to make an exception; I certainly can rule out any such referendums. I genuinely think they would be bad for our country. It\u2019s not the way forward now. We need to honour democracy, we need to get the economy moving. Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments about Labour and antisemitism were \u201cvery serious\u201d and showed that Jeremy Corbyn was guilty of \u201ca failure of leadership\u201d. Asked about the comments, he said: I do think it\u2019s a very serious business when the chief rabbi speaks as he does. I have never known anything like it, and clearly it\u2019s a failure of leadership on the part of the Labour leader that he has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour party. But Johnson said Corbyn was also showing a \u201cgeneral failure of leadership\u201d, particularly by refusing to take a position on Brexit. Johnson laughed off a question about his unpopularity in Scotland. (See 12.35pm.) Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tories\u2019 interim leader, said his party would block requests from Holyrood for the powers to hold a second independence referendum \u201cfor a generation\u201d, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of supporting \u201cdisposable democracy\u201d by insisting on one. Speaking to reporters after Boris Johnson launched the Scottish Tory election manifesto at a hotel only a mile or so from Gordon Brown\u2019s home in North Queensferry, Carlaw said there were no circumstances in which a Conservative government at Westminster would transfer those powers to Holyrood. Citing the Scottish government\u2019s white paper on independence in 2013, Scotland\u2019s Future, Carlaw said: I have been very clear about this. You have a referendum because it\u2019s a binary question; a question you\u2019re unable to resolve through the normal political process and in 2014 we had a once-in-a-generation referendum. It actually said in the Scotland\u2019s Future document that it would be once-in-a-generation, and it actually also said on page 60 of that document \u2013 that the Scottish government spent a lot of money sending to every household \u2013 that if the Conservatives were elected in 2015 there was the prospect of a referendum on Europe, and we might then leave the European Union. So I argued that in 2014 when people made that decision to stay in the United Kingdom, they understood what staying in the UK might in future represent. And 2 million people, the biggest number of people we\u2019ve seen for anything in Scotland\u2019s history, voted to remain in the UK. [We] had that referendum in 2014 and I don\u2019t believe in a culture of disposable democracy, which the SNP now subscribe to, where you can say that you\u2019re going to have a once-in-a-generation referendum and then within a matter of a few years, say that you need to have that whole process again. We are not going to betray the record number of Scots who participated in 2014 on that basis. In a combative BBC interview on Monday night with Andrew Neil, Sturgeon was pressed on how she would defend staging a second vote if Labour succeeded next year in holding a fresh EU referendum in which the UK voted to stay in the EU. Neil said that staying in the EU would neutralise Sturgeon\u2019s argument for justifying a second independence vote so soon after 2014 \u2013 that Brexit was a substantial change to Scotland\u2019s constitutional position. Sturgeon, who supports a second EU referendum, said the chaos of the last three years was argument enough. She said: This is going to dominate Westminster politics for many years to come, and Scotland has had it demonstrated to it beyond any doubt over the past three years that right now, our future path as a country is not in our own hands. It\u2019s in the hands of Westminster politicians like Boris Johnson with the strings being pulled by Nigel Farage. I think it is time for people in Scotland to have a choice. Ahead of the SNP\u2019s manifesto launch tomorrow, Nicola Sturgeon is visiting a nursery this afternoon to announce a proposal to \u201ctransform\u201d parental leave, by extending shared leave to 64 weeks at an increased rate, including 12 weeks\u2019 ringfenced \u201cdaddy leave\u201d. The proposal was welcomed by campaigners; Working Families has been calling for a similar scheme aimed at fathers for a long time, given the uptake of shared parental leave remains low and the evidence suggests that fathers who do have some leave from work with young children are more involved as their families grow up. The Westminster government is currently consulting on parental leave, although neither Tories nor Labour have proposed anything aimed directly at fathers in their manifestos. This follows a difficult interview for Sturgeon with Andrew Neil on the BBC last night, in which she was pressed hard on her economic plans for independence and the state of the Scottish NHS. Meanwhile Boris Johnson \u2013 writing in this morning\u2019s Scottish Daily Mail ahead of his visit to Fife \u2013 has pledged that he would never allow another \u201cchaotic and divisive\u201d independence referendum, his strongest statement yet. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in the Q&amp;A (see 1.42pm) about antisemitism, and about what Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said about Labour\u2019s record. I made it very clear in my speech, and I make it very clear again now, there is no place whatsoever for antisemitism in our society, our country or in my party and there never will be so long as I\u2019m leader of the party. And, since I become leader of the party, the party has adopted processes that didn\u2019t exit before, has had a disciplinary process that didn\u2019t exist before. And when people commit antisemitic acts, they are brought to book, and if necessary expelled from the party or suspended or asked to be educated better about it. I\u2019ve also introduced an education system within the party. I want to live in a country where people respect each other\u2019s faith. I want to live in a country where people feel secure to be Jewish, to be Muslim, to be Hindu, to be Christian, and I want to lead a government that has an open door to all of the faith leaders. So I invite the chief rabbi, I invite the archbishop of Canterbury, I invite all the other faith leaders to come talk to us about what their concerns are. But be absolutely sure of this assurance from me: no community will be at risk because of their identity, their faith, their ethnicity, or their language. I am proud to represent a diverse community in parliament. I\u2019ve spent my life fighting racism in any form, right outside here on Tottenham High Road in the 1970s. And so there is no place for it, and I ask those that think have not been done correctly to tell me about it, talk to me about it, but above all engage. I\u2019m very happy to engage with anybody. My whole life has been engagement with people. Sometimes you agree with them, sometimes you don\u2019t, but you only learn by that process of engagement. So I say to all communities, let\u2019s make our country safe for all of us. That is what our manifesto is all about and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud of our race and faith manifesto today. Q: How would you combat Islamophobia? Q: Can you assure Muslim communities they would be safe? Corbyn says this arts centre is not far from Finsbury Park, where a far-right killer murdered a Muslim just near where Corbyn lives. After the attack happened, the imam from the mosque intervened to protect the attacker. He says he would not tolerate attacks on mosques any more than attacks on any other places of worship. He says the Conservative party should address the Islamophobia problems they have in their own party. Islamophobia will always be challenged in any form in which it raises itself, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. (There was a suggestion earlier that there would not be a Q&amp;A.) Q: If the chief rabbi thinks most Jews are worried about a Labour government, how can the wider public vote Labour? Q: There have been complaints about antisemitism during the whole of your time as Labour leader. You say you are addressing this. But you have not persuaded the chief rabbi. Why? Q: Do you accept you have failed personally on this? Corbyn repeats the point he made in his speech: there is no place for antisemitism in society, or in Labour, and there never will be. He says he has introduced processes in Labour to deal with this that were not there before. He wants to live in a country where people respect each other\u2019s faiths. He wil have an open door as PM. So he invites the chief rabbi, and other faith leaders, to come and talk to him. He says no faith community will be at risk under his government. He has spent his life fighting racism \u2013 including right out here, on Tottenham High Road. He says people with concerns should tell him about them, and engage. You only learn by engagement, he says. Butler says we need to be honest about what Britain did wrong in the past. When people ask why people can\u2019t get over this, they don\u2019t realise how offensive that is. Turning to the Windrush scandal, she refers to the case of Hubert Howard, a Windrush victim who died recently without having had compensation or an apology. Butler says the system that created that injustice is still in place. Butler is now talking about the value of diversity. She says Norman Tebbit used to talk about the cricket test as a way of evaluating if people were loyal to the country. But this year England won the cricket World Cup with a team that included a West Indian, a Pakistani, a South African, a New Zealander and an Irishman. She says Labour will establish an independent review into the rise of the far right. And it will ensure more black history is taught in schools. Because black history is British history, she says. She says, within a month of taking power, Labour would launch a review into the shortage of BAME teachers in schools. Jeremy Corbyn says he is just the warm-up act for Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities. Butler takes to the stage. She says there are people trying to divide the country. She says a video has gone viral of a man and his children receiving antisemitic abuse on a train. It is unsettling to watch, she says. She says some of the people on the train did not intervene. But it was a woman in a hijab who intervened, she says. She says the woman said she knew what it was like to be abused like this. Butler says all forms of racism are wrong. She says after Boris Johnson compared Muslim women to letterboxes the number of incidents of Islamophobia went up by 375%. Corbyn says running through the Labour manifesto is the \u201cgolden thread\u201d of a society that works for all and respects all. He is very proud to lead a party of diversity. And he would be proud to speak on the world stage on behalf of a country proud of its diversity, he says. His manifesto can change lives for millions of people, he says. Corbyn says sometimes when people are challenged they are asked if they are \u201ctolerant\u201d of others. He does not like the word, he says. He prefers the idea of being respectful, he says. He says abuse has no place in our society. Attacks on people, and attacks on churches or synagogues or mosques, are attacks on all of us, he says. He says Labour would ensure there was full protection for places of worship. And attacks on places of worship would count as aggravated crimes, he says. He says: Antisemitism in any form is vile and wrong. It is an evil in our society \u2026 It grew in Europe \u2026 and ultimately led to the Holocaust \u2026 Under a Labour government it will not be tolerated in any form whatsoever. He says Labour has a rapid process for dealing with these complaints. That process is constantly being reviewed. And Labour supports educating people about the problem, he says. Corbyn says he wants to work with people of all faiths and none. It has always been his pride and his pleasure to do this, he says. In government, his door will be open to all faith leaders, he says. He says the chief rabbi will be very welcome, as will be the archbishop of Canterbury, and leaders from other faiths. Corbyn says he thinks history may be the most important thing children learn at school. Labour would promote the emancipation education trust, to ensure that children learn more about slavery. It should not just be taught during black history month. It should be taught all year round, he says. Corbyn says there is not proper BAME representations at the top of public life. There are only 25 black female professors in British universities. He says a Labour government would carry out a review to ensure BAME people are properly represented at the top of the education system. Corbyn says Labour wants to push ahead with anonymised job applications, so people do not face discrimination because of their name. Corbyn says the Tory manifesto does not mention race and equality issues. Labour is the party of equality and human rights, he says. He says he wants to lead a government where this is central to everything it does. He says people have until tonight to register to vote. He urges people to register. And he says Labour will not pursue the voter ID plans in the Tory manifesto. These would suppress voting, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking at the Labour race and faith manifesto launch. He starts by thanking Alf Dubs for what he said, and for all his campaigning on behalf of immigrants. He is speaking at the Bernie Grant arts centre in Tottenham. Corbyn says he knew Grant very well, and is proud to be speaking at an arts centre named after him. He says Grant taught people a lot about the impact of Britain\u2019s colonial past. He says N15, the postcode area where he is speaking, is the most diverse in Britain. He says 150 languages are spoken here. Lord Dubs is speaking now at the Labour event. He says he is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d at what the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said about Jeremy Corbyn and antisemitism. He does not accept a lot of what Mirvis said, although Dubs says he thinks Labour should have addressed the problem more quickly. But the chief rabbi\u2019s comments were \u201cunjustified and unfair\u201d, he says. Q: Why won\u2019t you take part in the Channel 4 News debate on the environment on Thursday? Johnson says he is taking part in other debates. He says as mayor of London he showed how emissions could be cut without the economy being harmed. But Labour would take a sledgehammer to the economy, he says. And that\u2019s it. The event is over. Q: Do you think Nicola Sturgeon should consider the chief rabbi\u2019s comments before propping up a Labour government? Johnson says Corbyn has not been able to stamp out antisemitism in his party. That is part of a wider failure of leadership, he says. He says you cannot be PM and refuse to take a position on Brexit. He says you cannot be neutral on that any more than you can be neutral on antisemitism. Q: If you are the largest party after the election, but don\u2019t have a majority, will you rule out holding a second referendum on independence or on Brexit. Johnson says he normally does not answer hypothetical questions like that. But he will answer this. Yes, he says. He says he genuinely thinks they would be bad for the country. Q: Polling shows your personal popularity in Scotland is only slightly better than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. You\u2019re on minus 34. Johnson interrupts. Minus 34 \u2013 we can build on that, he says, to audience laughter. Q: Would you have any more city deals for Scotland? Johnson says he will have a sectoral deal for the oil industry. And he will put \u00a33.1bn more into Scotland as a result of his manifesto plans, as a result of the Barnett formula. On city deals, Johnson says the whole of Scotland is covered. Q: How much of Brexit will be done by 31 January? Johnson says the UK will be out of the EU. It will be in control of its laws and money. Getting a trade deal by the end of the year will be tight. But people said he would not be able to get a Brexit deal, and he did get one, he says. Q: You have been talking about the cost of two referendums next year. How does that compare with how much you have spend on no-deal planning, and now much Brexit will cost Scotland? Johnson sidesteps the question, and says what is harming the economy is the delay. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: Scotland voted remain. Nicola Sturgeon thinks your policies are catastrophic for Scotland. She does not like Jeremy Corbyn, but she seems to have a loathing for you. Is that mutual? Johnson says he does not nurture grudges like this. He says our politics needs less of that. All that Sturgeon and Corbyn would do together would be waste 2020 on another Brexit referendum. Sturgeon said the 2014 independence referendum was a once in a generation one. She should stick to that, he says. Johnson ends with his joke about wanting to go carbon-neutral by 2050 and Corbyn neutral by Christmas. He urges people to support sensible, moderate, one-nation Scottish Conservatism. Johnson says in 10 years\u2019 time people in Scotland will be passionately proud of their Scottish identity, but also citizens of a proud United Kingdom. Johnson says a space port in Scotland is under construction or almost complete. He asks someone in the audience to clarify. It is \u201con its way\u201d, he says subsequently. Johnson says Nicola Sturgeon confirmed her plan for Scottish independence in her interview with Andrew Neil last night. This would involve borders at Berwick, and handing back control of Scottish fishing waters to the EU, he claims. Johnson is now speaking French, imagining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s first meeting with Michel Barnier. \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t really want it, Mr Corbyn?\u201d Johnson speculates about whether \u201cMonsieur Starmer\u201d or \u201cMonsieur McDonnell\u201d or \u201cMadame Abbott\u201d might back it. In Fife, Boris Johnson is still speaking. It\u2019s a rehash of his standard stump speech. He has just used the line about how Jeremy Corbyn supposedly sided with Russia at the time of the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Here is a live feed of the Labour event. More from the Labour race and faith manifesto launch in London. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has posted these in the last few minutes. Johnson says the climate change conference is coming to Glasgow next week. That is happening because Scotland is in the United Kingdom, he says. Boris Johnson is speaking at the Scottish launch now. He says he did not want a general election, but parliament was blocking Brexit. He has a deal ready to go, he says. But he says Jeremy Corbyn would hold a second referendum. And Corbyn won\u2019t say how he would vote in a second referendum. It is the only time in history someone has stood for PM without saying how they would vote on the most important issue of the day, he claims. This is from ITV\u2019s Peter MacMahon. Boris Johnson has repeated the same mixed metaphors and rhetorical flourishes in his preface to the Scottish Tories election manifesto that he used in the UK manifesto on Sunday, somewhat tweaked for Scottish voters. Alluding to more than 12 years of Scottish National party rule at Holyrood, Johnson asserts: For the last decade Scotland has been trapped, like a lion in a cage. You have been like some super-green supercar blocked in the traffic. You can see the way ahead. You know where you want to go \u2013 and you know why you are stuck. You have been paralysed by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, who simply refuse to accept your decision to keep our United Kingdom together. And that is why this election is so essential. The Scottish Tory manifesto puts blocking a second independence referendum in the foreground. Johnson repeats his usual tropes, insisting a Tory government would defend and protect the \u201cawesome foursome\u201d of nations which make up the UK. Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson writes, who is plotting to stage a second referendum with Sturgeon, \u201cI can guarantee that we will reject any request from the SNP government to hold an independence referendum. There will be no negotiation \u2013 we will mark that letter return to sender and be done with it.\u201d Jackson Carlaw, the acting leader of the Scottish Conservatives, is speaking at the launch now. He urges Labour unionists to back the Tories at this election, saying the Conservatives are best placed to oppose the SNP plans for independence. Boris Johnson is about to speak at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Fife. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog shortly. From the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield says it seems that journalists won\u2019t be able to ask any questions at the launch of the Labour race and faith manifesto this morning. Boris Johnson is launching the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 manifesto in Fife this morning. This is from the Herald\u2019s Tom Gordon. From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, has written an interesting article on current polling for the Article. He has been using YouGov data to look at how opinion has shifted since 2015 and he says \u201cBrexit has completely transformed Britain\u2019s political landscape, by prompting millions of voters to rethink their politics and their party loyalties\u201d. His main point is that, although there has been a 9.5 swing from Tories to Labour among remain voters since 2015, the Labour to Tory swing among leave voters over the same period is double that. Kellner thinks \u201ca Conservative landslide is not inevitable; but it is certainly possible\u201d. He explains: Taking account of the figures in the table above, I reckon that current voting intentions could result in swings of around 8% to the Conservatives in leave seats defended by Labour. Overall the Tories would capture 71 Labour seats if they achieved such a swing everywhere. However, 15 of these seats voted remain. That leaves 56 Labour marginals that voted leave. If we assume the Tories lose around 20 seats to the SNP and Liberal Democrats (without tactical voting, their losses may be fewer), and gains 56 seats from Labour, then Boris Johnson ends up with a majority of 65 (assuming Sinn F\u00e9in MPs stay away from parliament). It would not take much for the Tories to do significantly better than that. Labour has 90 seats vulnerable to a 10% swing. Of these, 70 voted leave. If the Conservatives gain all these, their majority approaches 100. The Electoral Commission has published information about donations to political parties in the third quarter of 2019. This is not the same as the information about donations received during the election campaign period. That data is published weekly, and the first of those reports came out last week. In total more than \u00a319m was donated to political parties in July, August and September (the third quarter). The Conservatives received the most, \u00a35.8m in total, followed by Labour (\u00a35.5m), the Brexit party (\u00a33.4m) and the Liberal Democrats (\u00a33.3m). The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has described the chief rabbi\u2019s intervention (see 6.15am, 7.50am, 9.41am and 10.20am) as \u201chugely worrying\u201d. She said: I think it is hugely worrying that the chief rabbi has felt compelled to make such an intervention in an election. It speaks volumes about the genuine fear that people in the Jewish community feel about Jeremy Corbyn and his inability to tackle antisemitism in the Labour party. I think all of us whatever our religion, or none, whatever our race, we should take very seriously the concerns of a community within our country that is genuinely feeling unsafe. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, has told Sky News that he thinks Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, was wrong in what he said in a Times article about antisemitism being entrenched in Labour. McDonald said: It is a serious intervention. It is a reminder of the hurt that has been caused to the Jewish community by the instances of antisemitism within the party and broader than that. I really do take issue with the conclusions the chief rabbi has raised about the character and nature of the party and indeed Jeremy Corbyn, who has devoted his life to fight racism of all kinds. People come into the Labour party to fight racism in all its manifestations and it is upsetting, to say the least, to find ourselves trying to deal with these small number of incidents. We are a huge movement and this represents a tiny fraction of our membership. Nevertheless it is serious and it has to be dealt with head on. The Mirvis Times article is here (paywall). And here is an extract. The Jewish community has watched with incredulity as supporters of the Labour leadership have hounded parliamentarians, members and even staff out of the party for challenging anti-Jewish racism. Even as they received threats, the response of the Labour leadership was utterly inadequate. We have endured quibbling and prevarication over whether the party should adopt the most widely accepted definition of antisemitism. Now we await the outcome of a formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into whether discrimination by the party against Jews has become an institutional problem. And all of this while in opposition. What should we expect of them in government? The Labour peer Lord Dubs was on the Today programme this morning responding to the claims from the chief rabbi that Jeremy Corbyn has allowed antisemitism to take root in his party. Dubs, who arrived in the UK in 1939 as a refugee from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, said he respected Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, but thought he was wrong on this. Dubs said: I think, I have a lot of respect for the chief rabbi, I\u2019ve co-operated with him on campaigns on behalf of child refugees, I\u2019ve spoken to him in many synagogues and I\u2019ve got a lot of positive feeling about the Jewish community, but I think today the chief rabbi has gone too far \u2026 I think the Labour party has been much too slow in getting to grips with this, and I\u2019ve been critical of the Labour party over the last two or three years, but I feel we are getting there, and I want to look at it from the point of view of where we are today and moving forward. Asked if he thought Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, Dubs replied: I think he is, yes, I think he is fit to be prime minister. I do not believe he is antisemitic. I believe things have happened under his leadership which should have been stopped way back. I don\u2019t believe he is personally antisemitic and I believe he will find it very, very hurtful that people accuse him of being antisemitic or racist or Islamophobic. He is none of those things. Asked whether Jewish people should fear a Labour government, Dubs said: I would say you do not have to fear. There are many of us in the Labour party who will ensure that there is no fear for you, and we respect your concerns but let\u2019s move forwards. Here are some of the campaign events in the diary for today. 11.30am: Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto with Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, at an event in Tottenham in London. 12pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, speaks at an event in Barnsley. 3pm: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, gives a speech in Manchester. 7pm: Corbyn is interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One. Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, are also doing campaign events, but the timings have not been confirmed yet. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. In an interview with Sky News last night Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service who has been advising the Labour party, suggested that, if Labour needed SNP and Lib Dem support to form a minority government, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s role as party leader could be part of the negotiation. Labour sources are disputing this, but Kerslake said: [Labour] would then need to have conversations with those [minority] parties to really establish on what basis they would give that support. We don\u2019t yet know in truth how that would play out, although the Liberal Democrats have said they could not support a Jeremy-Corbyn-led Labour government and the SNP have said they would want a second referendum. All of that, no doubt, would form part of the conversation that Labour would be having informally with those two parties. In his Today interview this morning Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, also hinted that the DUP could rethink its opposition to Labour if Corbyn were to be replaced as leader. The DUP had a confidence and supply arrangement with Theresa May. But now it finds itself isolated because Boris Johnson is proposing a Brexit deal that would in effect create a customs border down the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable to unionists. Asked who the DUP wanted to win the election, Donaldson replied: Well, that\u2019s a matter for the electorate, but clearly we\u2019ve stated we believe a Corbyn-led Labour government would be disastrous for the UK. When it was put to him that his use of the phrase \u201cCorbyn-led Labour government\u201d implied the DUP might take a different view of a Labour government led by someone else, and when he was asked if the DUP could \u201cdo business\u201d with such a government, Donaldson replied: Of course, it would depend what their platform was. We would have to look at that very carefully. Asked if the DUP could support Labour\u2019s plan for a second referendum featuring two options, remain and a leave option, Donaldson did not rule this out. \u201cWell, we\u2019d need to see what the deal was, of course,\u201d he replied. I\u2019m not going to commit myself to something at this stage that is entirely hypothetical. But clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and that\u2019s a major problem for us because, if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability, and we certainly don\u2019t need that. Political parties tend to react very badly to other parties telling them who they should have as leader, and it is hard to imagine Labour ditching Corbyn just to win parliamentary support from the Lib Dems or the DUP. But there is some sort of precedent for gestures of this kind. After the 2010 general election Gordon Brown announced that he would quit before the end of the year in the hope that this might make the Lib Dems more willing to form a pact with Labour. (Of course, it didn\u2019t.) Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips has appeared to advise the party\u2019s leadership on how to respond to the chief rabbi Ephraim Mervis\u2019 intervention. Michael Gove has said he feels a \u201ccertain sense of sadness\u201d about Michael Heseltine\u2019s views on the Conservative party. However, he said he \u201crespectfully disagreed\u201d with the peer on Europe and described him as a \u201clongtime advocate\u201d of further integration with the EU. Gove then said Heseltine was wrong to advise people to vote Liberal Democrat. I think that the most important thing at this general election is the choice between the two alternative prime ministers \u2013 Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 and I think that Boris would undoubtedly ensure that we got Brexit done and avoid the dangers of two referendums, whereas Jeremy Corbyn, as we know by the words of the chief rabbi today, poses a threat to more than just our economy. On the chance of securing a trade deal, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster said: First of all, we\u2019ve heard this scepticism before. It\u2019s the sort of default position of many commentators. It\u2019s also the case that we have a political declaration which accompanies the withdrawal agreement that sets out the broad structure of the agreement that we\u2019d want, and it\u2019s pretty clear the sort of agreement that would work in the EU\u2019s interests and the UK\u2019s interests. It would be a free trade agreement with friendly co-operation \u2013 co-operation on security, on science and on education. Pressed on whether services would have access to the EU freely, Gove said: Well, at the moment we do not have a single market in services even within the European Union. Asked whether services would be better or worse than at present, he added: It would depend on the individual sector. But I think what we are likely to get, and I think this is certainly what Europe wants as well, is a no tariffs, no quotas, no quantitative restrictions as part of that free trade agreement. The DUP parliamentary candidate Jeffrey Donaldson has warned that the Tory Brexit deal would \u201cdestabilise Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK\u201d and be \u201cdisadvantageous\u201d to the Northern Ireland economy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: Clearly there isn\u2019t a single major party in Northern Ireland that supports the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal, and that\u2019s a major problem for us because if this deal is imposed, I believe it will create further instability and we certainly don\u2019t need that. We believe the prime minister needs to look again at this idea of creating a border in the Irish Sea. He reiterated that a Corbyn-led Labour government would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the UK and said the party would look \u201cvery carefully\u201d at joining forces with a Labour government that its current leader was not involved in. Conservative party grandee Michael Heseltine has urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats to stop Brexit being delivered by Boris Johnson. Speaking last night alongside former Tory MPs David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, Heseltine was reported to have said: I\u2019m telling them to vote for what they believe and what the Conservative party has stood for all my life and certainly all of theirs \u2013 and to put country first. And what I think that means in practical terms is they either vote for the defrocked Conservative candidates, of which we have three excellent examples here, or they vote Lib Dem. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, the former deputy prime minster asserted that Jeremy Corbyn had no chance of becoming prime minister and that \u201ctraditional reds under the beds\u201d scares came about in every election. The 86-year-old former deputy prime minster said a more pressing question was whether Corbyn would be leader of the Labour party by Christmas, though he appeared to urge people against voting for the Tories. Anyone who might form a temporary coalition will insist that it\u2019s not Jeremy Corbyn. The real issue is what is at stake. It is the prosperity and world influence of this country. Our relationships with our neighbours in Europe. This is transcendently the overarching issue at stake in this election and I cannot vote or support people who are going to make this country poorer and less influential. The peer has long supported a second referendum, due to the lies made during the 2016 vote by influential Brexit supporters. He recognised that the Liberal Democrats \u2013 with their \u201dStop Brexit\u201d pledge \u2013 are not going to win the election, although he is voting for the party, and warned of the consequences of Johnson winning a majority. It\u2019s complete nonsense to suggest that [Brexit] can be done by Christmas. All you can do by Christmas is to pass legislation to enter into negotiations. It\u2019s preposterous. We are in for another year of uncertainty and a possibility of a no-deal exit at the end of it. That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re facing if Mr Johnson gets an overall majority. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said nobody can afford to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d about antisemitism, reiterating that political parties must avoid worsening a \u201cperception of fear\u201d and calling on them to offer reassurances. The cross-bench peer Rabbi Julia Neuberger has said the UK could become a less comfortable place for Jews to live if Jeremy Corbyn came to power. She said she agreed with the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, that the Jewish community is gripped by anxiety ahead of the general election due to an \u201cunwillingness\u201d of the Labour leadership to tackle a creeping \u201cinsidious antisemitic tone\u201d. \u201cPeople in the Jewish community have seen that unwillingness and asked what is going on, why are they not gripping it?\u201d she asked. The interviewer cited recent polls suggesting 87% of Jews believe Corbyn is antisemitic and almost half would consider emigrating from the UK if he became prime minister, to which Neuberger replied: I think the anxiety is that if in opposition Jeremy Corbyn and his top team do not tackle the antisemitism which has for instance been shown against Labour MPs. If they\u2019re not willing to tackle that, apologise for it and sympathise then something is going very wrong. A political party where some of its MPs leave because of antisemitic taunting, and still cannot deal with it, makes people feel very uncomfortable. The other part of it is what you see on social media, people who claim to be Corbyn supporters saying the most appalling things about Jews. The author said that although UK remains a good place to live as a Jew, that is shifting and if Labour under Corbyn comes to power then \u201cthis comfortable place to live may become less comfortable\u201d. People will look for ways of moving or having a place somewhere else, or whatever they can possibly do to mitigate what feels oppressive, uncomfortable, dangerous. Asked why non-Jews potentially more concerned with austerity and benefit cuts should care enough to not vote Labour, Neuberger said: \u201cIf a section of the population is feeling uncomfortable because of racism, that is serious.\u201d The former Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Ian Austin have spoken out in support of the condemnation of Jeremy Corbyn from the UK\u2019s chief rabbi of the UK. The papers Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has issued a scathing verdict of the government\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic amateurism\u201d, saying Boris Johnson is sowing the seeds of \u201cthe biggest crisis of Brexit to date\u201d. In a lecture in Glasgow, Rogers said Johnson was repeating Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrategy errors\u201d and would soon find himself \u201cunwisely\u201d boxed in by his campaign promises. Labour accused of \u2018poison sanctioned from the top\u2019 by chief rabbi The chief rabbi has accused Jeremy Corbyn of allowing a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d to take root in Labour, saying Jews are justifiably anxious about the prospect of the party forming the next government. Ephraim Mirvis, the spiritual leader of the UK\u2019s 62 orthodox synagogues, made the rare political intervention on the day that the Labour party is planning to unveil its race and faith manifesto in Tottenham this morning. Corbyn, Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler will attend. Writing for the Times, Mirvis said it was not his place to tell people how to vote but argued that the way in which the Labour leadership had dealt with anti-Jewish racism was \u201cincompatible with the British values of which we are so proud \u2013 of dignity and respect for all people\u201d and that in this election the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d was at stake. Labour has always strongly denied any suggestion that Corbyn has failed to get to grips with allegations of antisemitism in Labour, pointing to his record as an anti-racist campaigner and moves to overhaul the party\u2019s complaints process. The rabbi wrote: \u201cThe party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party.\u201d Good morning politics early birds, welcome to our rolling coverage of the day\u2019s news and today, we\u2019re talking about money. The huge gap in the spending promises of the two major parties is the main topic of debate today, after it emerged that Labour was committing 28 times as much in public spending as the Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn defended his multibillion pound general election spending pledge on public services, saying that even with the increased spending of \u00a383bn a year that he has promised, the UK would still spend less on public services than France or Germany. Zoe Williams writes that Labour has outlined its promises, now its job is to make those promises seem real. Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has released analysis showing that child poverty is at risk of rising to a record 60-year high under a Conservative government because its manifesto retains the coalition\u2019s benefit cuts. The analysis says the number of British children living in relative poverty would increase from 29.6% in 2017-18 to 34.5% in 2023-24 under a Boris Johnson-led government. Though it adds that Labour\u2019s \u00a39bn of extra spending on social security would mean 550,000 fewer children in poverty but would not lead to current poverty rates falling.

      "body": "<p>This is turning out to be an election like no other. There is a mood abroad in the UK in which personal feelings about politicians and perceptions about the state of the country are stretching traditional loyalties to breaking point. No one can miss the raw hostility from those in one party toward those in the others. The perceived stakes appear so high that they justify extreme measures. A decade of austerity opened up a debate about the divisions in British society; since 2016 the emotional pitch of arguments has been raised to an intensity not seen before.</p> <p>Brexit is a case in point. How we depart from the European Union will change this country for ever. Political identities have become shaped by the way people voted in 2016, hardened by a cultural divide. To capitalise on this Boris Johnson peddles a hard Brexit while disgracefully <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/boris-johnson-refuses-apologise-racist-homophobic-comments-11204372/\" title=\"\">defending</a> his right to compare burqa-wearing women to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and to refer to gay men as \u201cbum boys\u201d. For Lord Heseltine this is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50555146\" title=\"\">all too much</a>. He sees the repudiation of the party\u2019s socially liberal, pro-business, pro-Europe policies as an existential question for the country. That is why a former Conservative deputy prime minister is urging voters to back the Liberal Democrats where they cannot vote for ex-Tory <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/108210/lord-heseltine-urges-lifelong-tories-vote\" title=\"\">heavyweights</a> expelled for daring to question the hard-Brexit theology of Mr Johnson\u2019s inner circle.</p> <p>And while, on the right, the Brexit revolution is consuming its own children, the left continues to be mired in allegations of racism. Perhaps it is appropriate that a religious leader might cast the stakes in this election as being more spiritual than temporal. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, broke with tradition of political impartiality to condemn Jeremy Corbyn over Labour\u2019s handling of the issue of antisemitism. He called for every person to vote with their conscience, saying the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-25/chief-rabbi-warns-soul-of-nation-is-at-stake-if-labour-wins-general-election/\" title=\"\">nation\u2019s soul</a> was at stake and that \u201ca new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the very top \u2013 has taken root\u201d in the Labour party. Mr Corbyn has made mistakes with dealing with serious allegations of antisemitism within Labour\u2019s ranks. He was in charge of an underwhelming response to a growing crisis. Labour\u2019s handling of such <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party\" title=\"\">complaints</a> is being investigated by the equalities watchdog.</p> <p>Antisemitism is an evil that has festered in plain sight. The pain and hurt within the Jewish community must be acknowledged with due humility. It has cast a shadow over our body politic. Antisemitism\u2019s prominence is in part because, too often, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/18/nus-president-malia-bouattia-political-activists-are-being-demonised\" title=\"\">challenging Israel</a> over its treatment of the Palestinian people descends into outright Jew-hatred. This failure is compounded in an era of social media <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2019/07/16/card-welcome-to-hell-2020-edition/\" title=\"\">trolls</a> who shriek of \u201cnew world order\u201d conspiracies. Mr Corbyn has gone some way to make up for his mistakes. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn-rabbi-criticism-labour\" title=\"\">stated</a> that \u201cantisemitism in any form is vile and wrong\u201d. He has invited Rabbi Mirvis to meet him to discuss the issue and put anti-racist policies at the heart of a Labour government. This is the right thing to do and shows Mr Corbyn\u2019s party has capacity to make the right moral decisions. He must continue to do so, so voters of good conscience can cast their ballot for Labour and Mr Corbyn can make good on his promise to unify the UK.</p> <p>This is a divided country; it has grown more so by design under the last three Tory prime ministers. Divisions between big cities and the regions have deepened. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/1113775078624382979?s=20\" title=\"\">Education</a> has become a political faultline. There is a housing crisis, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/19/uk-millennials-second-worst-hit-financially-in-developed-world-says-study\" title=\"\">young people set to be poorer</a> than their parents. The wealthiest have disproportionately benefited from paltry growth. We can\u2019t have democracy without partisanship. But too much of it will overwhelm democracy. Mr Johnson might think he could win by, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/382770.stm\" title=\"\">in the words of William Whitelaw</a> in 1970, \u201cgoing round the country, stirring up political apathy\u201d to prevent voters from coming out to defeat him in December. Yet the prime minister could be upended by millions who have now registered to vote \u2013 predominantly young people who tend to back Labour. There are signs that they have been inspired by the idea that they could, in the words of the most <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/11/15/how-led-donkeys-created-the-biggest-crowdfunder-political-campaign-uk-history\" title=\"\">successful</a> crowdfunding campaign ever, \u201cmake [Boris] Johnson the shortest-serving PM ever\u201d. That would be a fitting riposte to a decade of division.</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 29 November 2019 to make clear that the \u201cshortest-serving PM\u201d campaign itself appended a qualifier to its catchy wording on short-serving prime ministers: <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/by-donkeys\">https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/by-donkeys</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This is turning out to be an election like no other. There is a mood abroad in the UK in which personal feelings about politicians and perceptions about the state of the country are stretching traditional loyalties to breaking point. No one can miss the raw hostility from those in one party toward those in the others. The perceived stakes appear so high that they justify extreme measures. A decade of austerity opened up a debate about the divisions in British society; since 2016 the emotional pitch of arguments has been raised to an intensity not seen before. Brexit is a case in point. How we depart from the European Union will change this country for ever. Political identities have become shaped by the way people voted in 2016, hardened by a cultural divide. To capitalise on this Boris Johnson peddles a hard Brexit while disgracefully defending his right to compare burqa-wearing women to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and to refer to gay men as \u201cbum boys\u201d. For Lord Heseltine this is all too much. He sees the repudiation of the party\u2019s socially liberal, pro-business, pro-Europe policies as an existential question for the country. That is why a former Conservative deputy prime minister is urging voters to back the Liberal Democrats where they cannot vote for ex-Tory heavyweights expelled for daring to question the hard-Brexit theology of Mr Johnson\u2019s inner circle. And while, on the right, the Brexit revolution is consuming its own children, the left continues to be mired in allegations of racism. Perhaps it is appropriate that a religious leader might cast the stakes in this election as being more spiritual than temporal. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, broke with tradition of political impartiality to condemn Jeremy Corbyn over Labour\u2019s handling of the issue of antisemitism. He called for every person to vote with their conscience, saying the nation\u2019s soul was at stake and that \u201ca new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the very top \u2013 has taken root\u201d in the Labour party. Mr Corbyn has made mistakes with dealing with serious allegations of antisemitism within Labour\u2019s ranks. He was in charge of an underwhelming response to a growing crisis. Labour\u2019s handling of such complaints is being investigated by the equalities watchdog. Antisemitism is an evil that has festered in plain sight. The pain and hurt within the Jewish community must be acknowledged with due humility. It has cast a shadow over our body politic. Antisemitism\u2019s prominence is in part because, too often, challenging Israel over its treatment of the Palestinian people descends into outright Jew-hatred. This failure is compounded in an era of social media trolls who shriek of \u201cnew world order\u201d conspiracies. Mr Corbyn has gone some way to make up for his mistakes. He stated that \u201cantisemitism in any form is vile and wrong\u201d. He has invited Rabbi Mirvis to meet him to discuss the issue and put anti-racist policies at the heart of a Labour government. This is the right thing to do and shows Mr Corbyn\u2019s party has capacity to make the right moral decisions. He must continue to do so, so voters of good conscience can cast their ballot for Labour and Mr Corbyn can make good on his promise to unify the UK. This is a divided country; it has grown more so by design under the last three Tory prime ministers. Divisions between big cities and the regions have deepened. Education has become a political faultline. There is a housing crisis, with young people set to be poorer than their parents. The wealthiest have disproportionately benefited from paltry growth. We can\u2019t have democracy without partisanship. But too much of it will overwhelm democracy. Mr Johnson might think he could win by, in the words of William Whitelaw in 1970, \u201cgoing round the country, stirring up political apathy\u201d to prevent voters from coming out to defeat him in December. Yet the prime minister could be upended by millions who have now registered to vote \u2013 predominantly young people who tend to back Labour. There are signs that they have been inspired by the idea that they could, in the words of the most successful crowdfunding campaign ever, \u201cmake [Boris] Johnson the shortest-serving PM ever\u201d. That would be a fitting riposte to a decade of division. \u2022 This footnote was added on 29 November 2019 to make clear that the \u201cshortest-serving PM\u201d campaign itself appended a qualifier to its catchy wording on short-serving prime ministers: https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/by-donkeys",

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee\u2019s article on the Conservative party manifesto (The Johnson blueprint: crisis, catastrophe and inequality, Journal, 26 November) has raised the issue that should dominate all others in this election \u2013 inequality. Nearly 10 years on from the Marmot review (Fair Society, Healthy Lives, 2010) and after 10 years of government-imposed austerity, which has demonstrably worsened inequality and lowered expectations of a long and healthy life, we are in serious danger of electing a Tory government that apparently believes \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d will usher in national salvation and right all wrongs. Parliamentary candidates (and others): read Michael Marmot\u2019s review, and think again. This country needs a caring government, a government that is able to address the deep divisions between the haves and the have-nots, and which regards as obscene the levels of inequality in this country. Dr John Evers Truro, Cornwall \u2022 While your coverage of the Conservative manifesto in Monday\u2019s paper was extensive, could I just point out something that doesn\u2019t seem to have attracted much attention: the section on page 48 of the manifesto, which promises that \u201cafter Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the government, parliament and the courts; the functioning of the royal prerogative\u201d. Is this the first step towards limiting the role of our supreme court in relation to the government, or an attempt to politicise appointments to it? Sue Durham Cambridge \u2022 When are the Tories going to realise that law and order is not just more police, more prison places and harsher sentencing (The Tory manifesto: What they\u2019re offering and what it means, 25 November)?

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday 28 April 2010, 20 months had passed since the financial crash of 2008, and there were eight days left until the UK general election. Soon, the reins of government would be taken by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, committed to a programme of austerity that would still be making its effects felt a decade later. But for another fortnight, Gordon Brown would be prime minister, and he was on a walkabout in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. It was there that he was introduced to 65-year-old Gillian Duffy.</p> <p>Surrounded by men in suits, and accompanied by the snap of cameras, Duffy ran through a mess of grievances \u2013 about the tax she had to pay on her pension, the state of the national finances, and a benefits system she claimed paid out to people who \u201caren\u2019t vulnerable\u201d while denying help to those who needed it. She reached a climax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript\" title=\"\">with a single broken sentence about immigration</a>: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about the immigrants\u2026 but all these easterns European what are coming in, where are they flocking from?\u201d Still wearing a radio microphone pinned to his lapel by Sky News, Brown then got back in his car, and let rip. \u201cShe\u2019s just this sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be a Labour voter,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The media bowed to the inevitable and called the episode \u201cBigotgate\u201d. And over the next five or six years, Duffy became a minor political celebrity. Thanks to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and a piece she wrote for the Daily Mirror, we know that she enthusiastically voted Leave in the 2016 referendum \u2013 partly, she said, because, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9pjyMH6so\" title=\"\">\u201cI love being English, and I don\u2019t want to be a European.\u201d</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a leftwing version of populism. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her small place in political history should be assured, because her encounter with Brown represented the first stirrings \u2013 in Britain, anyway \u2013 of changes wrought by people and places far from the usual centres of power. Duffy remained loyal to the Labour party, which was soon tying itself in knots about how to appeal to such voters, eventually offering its members mugs emblazoned with the words \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. But here and elsewhere, lots of other people embraced parties that \u2013 and I\u2019m being generous here \u2013 viewed their small \u201cc\u201d conservative, nationalistic instincts and hostility to political establishment as a giant political opportunity.</p> <p>Thanks to a term that dates back to the 19th century, we know it as populism: to quote from the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201ca political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\u201d. There is a leftwing version of populism, seen lately in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is campaigning in the general election, against an \u201cestablishment elite\u201d and \u201crigged system\u201d. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b18225cb6619f5df9e4dcf6bc17fa95eeac44a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b18225cb6619f5df9e4dcf6bc17fa95eeac44a2/0_18_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage campaigning to leave the EU in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage campaigning to leave the EU in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Berry/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ukip got only 3.1% of the national vote in 2010, but by the end of 2016, Nigel Farage had played a key role in the leave side\u2019s referendum victory. Europe has been shaken by such hard-right populist parties as Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the Sweden Democrats, the revived French National Front (these days known as National Rally), and Italy\u2019s Northern League. At the same time, the world has seen the rise of a new breed of populist \u201cstrongmen\u201d, defined by their hostility to the conventions of democracy and gleeful embrace of prejudice and bigotry. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n began his second stint as prime minister in 2010. Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan became president in 2014; India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, took power in the same year. Five years later came the election victory of perhaps the most reckless populist of them all: Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/01/jair-bolsonaro-inauguration-brazil-president\" title=\"\">who replied to a congratulatory tweet from Donald Trump</a> thus: \u201cTogether, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to the big orange baby in the White House. Back in 2011, as the Labour party licked its wounds and Farage began to push his way into the political mainstream, Trump was slowly edging towards the US presidency, a prize on which he had fixed his eyes in the past. In 2011, a poll in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/another-poll-confirms-trump-republican-frontrunner/349693/\" title=\"\">the Wall Street Journal</a> put him in front of all the Republican contenders. Not long after, he jumped on a conspiracy theory that dated back to 2008, questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US, and demanding to see the president\u2019s birth certificate. This mischief laid the path to 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy with a characteristically rambling speech delivered in Trump Tower, in New York.</p> <p>\u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us\u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 I\u2019ve watched the politicians\u2026. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests\u2026 the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d</p> <p>Here was every key facet of populism, in full, shameless effect: racism, the rejection of free trade and globalisation, and a self-serving loathing of supposed elites, made all the more ludicrous by the fact that it was voiced by a billionaire. What Trump said may have regularly tumbled into incoherence and contradiction, but it was also built around a winning slogan stolen from Ronald Reagan, which Trump registered as a trademark in November 2012: \u201cMake America great again\u201d. And if he was gauche and inarticulate, maybe that was the point: here was someone so far from the usual polished politicians that his speeches didn\u2019t even have a clear beginning, middle and end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4eb5bceb583df231bedd2ecd460e08923bcb558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4eb5bceb583df231bedd2ecd460e08923bcb558/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter at a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supporter at a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damon Winter/The New York Times/Redux/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, I watched Trump do his thing at a rally in Evansville, Indiana, a faded place with a dilapidated downtown, where a refrigerator factory <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/us/20whirlpool.html\" title=\"\">that had once employed 10,000 people</a> had closed six years before, something locals blamed on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the way it had incentivised moving jobs to Mexico. He rambled on about the economic threat from China, the need to bring jobs back to America, and his fabled border wall. The 12,000-strong crowd roared their approval.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday 28 April 2010, 20 months had passed since the financial crash of 2008, and there were eight days left until the UK general election. Soon, the reins of government would be taken by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, committed to a programme of austerity that would still be making its effects felt a decade later. But for another fortnight, Gordon Brown would be prime minister, and he was on a walkabout in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. It was there that he was introduced to 65-year-old Gillian Duffy. Surrounded by men in suits, and accompanied by the snap of cameras, Duffy ran through a mess of grievances \u2013 about the tax she had to pay on her pension, the state of the national finances, and a benefits system she claimed paid out to people who \u201caren\u2019t vulnerable\u201d while denying help to those who needed it. She reached a climax with a single broken sentence about immigration: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about the immigrants\u2026 but all these easterns European what are coming in, where are they flocking from?\u201d Still wearing a radio microphone pinned to his lapel by Sky News, Brown then got back in his car, and let rip. \u201cShe\u2019s just this sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be a Labour voter,\u201d he said. The media bowed to the inevitable and called the episode \u201cBigotgate\u201d. And over the next five or six years, Duffy became a minor political celebrity. Thanks to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and a piece she wrote for the Daily Mirror, we know that she enthusiastically voted Leave in the 2016 referendum \u2013 partly, she said, because, \u201cI love being English, and I don\u2019t want to be a European.\u201d Her small place in political history should be assured, because her encounter with Brown represented the first stirrings \u2013 in Britain, anyway \u2013 of changes wrought by people and places far from the usual centres of power. Duffy remained loyal to the Labour party, which was soon tying itself in knots about how to appeal to such voters, eventually offering its members mugs emblazoned with the words \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. But here and elsewhere, lots of other people embraced parties that \u2013 and I\u2019m being generous here \u2013 viewed their small \u201cc\u201d conservative, nationalistic instincts and hostility to political establishment as a giant political opportunity. Thanks to a term that dates back to the 19th century, we know it as populism: to quote from the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201ca political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\u201d. There is a leftwing version of populism, seen lately in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is campaigning in the general election, against an \u201cestablishment elite\u201d and \u201crigged system\u201d. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world. Ukip got only 3.1% of the national vote in 2010, but by the end of 2016, Nigel Farage had played a key role in the leave side\u2019s referendum victory. Europe has been shaken by such hard-right populist parties as Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the Sweden Democrats, the revived French National Front (these days known as National Rally), and Italy\u2019s Northern League. At the same time, the world has seen the rise of a new breed of populist \u201cstrongmen\u201d, defined by their hostility to the conventions of democracy and gleeful embrace of prejudice and bigotry. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n began his second stint as prime minister in 2010. Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan became president in 2014; India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, took power in the same year. Five years later came the election victory of perhaps the most reckless populist of them all: Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, who replied to a congratulatory tweet from Donald Trump thus: \u201cTogether, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\u201d Which brings us to the big orange baby in the White House. Back in 2011, as the Labour party licked its wounds and Farage began to push his way into the political mainstream, Trump was slowly edging towards the US presidency, a prize on which he had fixed his eyes in the past. In 2011, a poll in the Wall Street Journal put him in front of all the Republican contenders. Not long after, he jumped on a conspiracy theory that dated back to 2008, questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US, and demanding to see the president\u2019s birth certificate. This mischief laid the path to 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy with a characteristically rambling speech delivered in Trump Tower, in New York. \u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us\u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 I\u2019ve watched the politicians\u2026. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests\u2026 the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d Here was every key facet of populism, in full, shameless effect: racism, the rejection of free trade and globalisation, and a self-serving loathing of supposed elites, made all the more ludicrous by the fact that it was voiced by a billionaire. What Trump said may have regularly tumbled into incoherence and contradiction, but it was also built around a winning slogan stolen from Ronald Reagan, which Trump registered as a trademark in November 2012: \u201cMake America great again\u201d. And if he was gauche and inarticulate, maybe that was the point: here was someone so far from the usual polished politicians that his speeches didn\u2019t even have a clear beginning, middle and end. In 2016, I watched Trump do his thing at a rally in Evansville, Indiana, a faded place with a dilapidated downtown, where a refrigerator factory that had once employed 10,000 people had closed six years before, something locals blamed on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the way it had incentivised moving jobs to Mexico. He rambled on about the economic threat from China, the need to bring jobs back to America, and his fabled border wall. The 12,000-strong crowd roared their approval. I recognised many of them as kindred spirits of voters I\u2019d spoken to in Britain: older, anxious, often angry white people, wondering what had happened to the world they knew, and where on earth everything was going next. *** Why now? Obviously, it is no accident that populism began its rebirth only a couple of years after the 2008 crash, and the spectacle of reckless financiers taking the global economy to the brink of disaster but suffering almost no comeback. To compound people\u2019s sense of injustice, the long slump that followed has seen wages stagnate, and changes to the world of work that have made more and more jobs insecure, and poorly paid. These developments exacerbated resentments that went back years, into the deindustralisation and automation that had been eating away at people and places\u2019 collective esteem for decades. Rochdale, the home of Duffy, was once a thriving mill town and the birthplace of the co-operative movement. Trump won the presidency thanks to support in rust belt states \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania \u2013 carried by the Democrats in previous elections. The Sweden Democrats are strongest in the old industrial towns and cities of southern Sweden; AfD\u2019s bedrock is the deprived former industrial areas of the old East.

Six years ago, the Guardian sent me to the east of England to speak to some of the activists and voters responsible for Farage\u2019s surge: going back now to what I wrote then, among the most striking things is the sense that lifelong Tories saw Ukip as an answer to their belief that the Conservatives were no longer Conservative enough.

      "bodyText": "Can Labour come back from here? There are 16 days to go, a Conservative leader has been to Wrexham again, and the average of the five weekend polls look roughly as bad as they did for Jeremy Corbyn at this stage in 2017. Labour now sits at 30%, 13 points behind the Conservatives on an election-winning 43%. At this point in the last election Theresa May\u2019s lead was 11 points, although the cracks were already appearing in her campaign. Then, the Tory manifesto collapsed into a row about the \u201cdementia tax\u201d and the then prime minister was forced to retreat in Wrexham, declaring \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. This time, Boris Johnson chose to pose crouching alongside a sheep. So far, the Conservatives have been relatively fortunate: the party has gained eight points since the start of the campaign \u2013 to Labour\u2019s five \u2013 helped almost entirely by Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to pull out of Tory seats. That suggests that the Tory vote could be at its peak, given that Johnson is so unpopular with remain supporters. Labour also needs to improve less than the headline data might suggest. If the Conservative lead dips below six or seven points then that could be enough to deprive Johnson of the 326-plus seat overall majority he craves, according to experts such as political scientist John Curtice of Strathclyde University. To achieve that, Labour has plenty to do. It first needs to hang on to the combination of voters that brought it to 40% at the last general election: the young voters who helped it win seats like Canterbury and Warwick and Leamington, retain Cambridge, and who it needs to win hyper-marginal Southampton Itchen. Labour also needs to shore up its base of traditional voters in \u201cred wall\u201d seats ranging from Wrexham and elsewhere in north Wales, through to the West and east Midlands at a time when party insiders are jittery. Here, perhaps, some of Labour manifesto policies will help. Taxing those earning over \u00a380,000 a year more is supported by 81%, according to Deltapoll, who conducted fieldwork after last Thursday\u2019s launch, making it one of the party\u2019s most popular policies. Scrapping university tuition fees and providing free education for life is supported by 57% and renationalising rail by 51%. Even Labour\u2019s renegotiate-and-vote-again Brexit policy may be more popular than the heavy attack on it by the Conservatives might suggest: with Deltapoll suggesting it is liked by 42% and opposed by 36%. Labour also has to further squeeze the Liberal Democrats, currently polling at 15%, who are still well ahead of their 7.4% finish in 2017. With the Lib Dems finally focusing their attacks on Johnson, Corbyn\u2019s party has a chance to ram home the message that seats won in 2017 like Kensington in London will be vulnerable if the anti-Tory vote is split. Ultimately, though, Labour has to take the argument direct to the Conservatives, and neutralise some of Corbyn\u2019s relative unpopularity to the prime minister. Here, the party is helped by the fact that in a week\u2019s time Donald Trump arrives in London for the two-day Nato summit. That gives Labour a fortuitous opportunity to present an image of Britain under a Johnson government, in thrall to an erratic and unpopular US president and its chlorinated chicken-led trade policy. Labour also needs to find a way to highlight Johnson\u2019s biggest weakness: trust. It is the issue that the party\u2019s candidates say recurs on the doorstep, linked as it is to the complicated personal life that lingers, unsaid, in voter\u2019s minds. Corbyn was notably reluctant to stray into that territory during the first leader\u2019s debate on ITV, although the audience laughed at the prime minister, but has another chance to do so in the BBC head-to-head on 6 December, if he can find the appropriate language. In the interim, Labour has to try and highlight holes in Conservative promises. It has started by demonstrating that Johnson\u2019s pledge to recruit 50,000 more nurses is an exaggeration, but it is also the case that the promise to resolve the social care crisis is just a vague statement of aspiration and talk of tax cuts has been exaggerated. As for Brexit, not only is no deal at the end of the transition period not ruled out but the coming months of negotiations about a free trade deal suggest that the issue will not be done but instead dominate throughout 2020. With the Conservatives pursuing a risk-averse, sheep-first policy, Labour has to attack.",

It is the vacuous sequel to \u2018Take back control\u2019, starring the same falsehood about Britain\u2019s global stature. It contains the illusion that we, liberated nation, tell them, spurned continentals, how things will be. Three years of negotiation tell a different story. The UK tried to retain privileges of EU membership without abiding by the rules, failed, and watched its deal deteriorate as a result. If the Tories win a majority, that pattern repeats all next year. Johnson\u2019s plan is to complete a comprehensive free-trade agreement before transitional arrangements expire next December. Trade talks between advanced economies can fill the best part of a decade. Ministers have three lines of defence for their improbable timetable. First, the UK and EU start from what Johnson describes as \u201cperfect alignment and harmony\u201d, so there isn\u2019t much to adjust. Second, Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said a year is sufficient. Third, people said Johnson couldn\u2019t ditch the backstop from Theresa May\u2019s deal, but he did. Those arguments are bogus. First, Johnson\u2019s plan explicitly mandates divergence from EU norms. Its purpose is to carve out competitive advantage through deregulation. Brussels sees that as a threat to undercut continental businesses and dump substandard goods on EU consumers. Second, when EU officials nod along with the tight timetable, they are being polite and trying not to spook British voters. The commission wants the deal ratified as much as Johnson does, but an imbalance of power favours Brussels as much in the next phase as it did in withdrawal talks. Third, Johnson\u2019s powers of persuasion are fictional. He achieved removal of the backstop by abandoning a promise not to permit a trade border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, burning the DUP and reverting to a Brexit model he had once vigorously rejected.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s ever-succinct former ambassador to the EU weighs in again:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCDouglasF/status/1199029306523049989\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Claims of a swift Brexit deal are &quot;diplomatic amateurism dressed up domestically as boldness and decisiveness&quot; while strengthening the EU&#39;s negotiating position, according to ex-UK ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers, speaking tonight at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UofGlasgow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UofGlasgow</a></p>&mdash; Douglas Fraser\u2712\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd2\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf99\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcb7 (@BBCDouglasF) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCDouglasF/status/1199029306523049989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

Top stories It was a week of two manifestos, two debates and a scandal. On the manifestos, Labour went first, with Jeremy Corbyn unveiling dramatic plans for the biggest increase in tax and spending in more than half a century. Costed at \u00a383bn a year, pledges included free broadband; a 5% public sector pay rise; 100,000 new council houses a year; 1m new jobs in a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d; nationalisation of rail, water and mail; and a nationwide \u201cinvestment blitz\u201d. The Tories followed four days later, with Boris Johnson setting out their aims not just to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d but to \u201clevel up across the country\u201d by improving schools, hospitals and the police \u2013 at a much more modest cost of just \u00a32.9bn more a year. Commentators said Corbyn had gambled that voters are ready for radicalism, while the prime minister aimed to cautiously run down the clock until 12 December, hoping his key (and continually repeated) Brexit promise would cut through. Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was not credible that Labour\u2019s \u201ccolossal\u201d spending plans would only affect businesses and the richest 5% of individuals, while the Conservative offering was \u201cnotable for its lack of ambition\u201d. In the debates \u2013 one a testy head-to-head, the other between the four main party leaders \u2013 Johnson and Corbyn clashed first over the NHS, with the Labour leader accusing the PM of being ready to sell it off to US corporations. The second debate was notable for Corbyn\u2019s promise to take \u201ca neutral stance\u201d in any future Brexit referendum, while Johnson was attacked on his trustworthiness and Jo Swinson for the Liberal Democrats\u2019 record in coalition and revoke article 50 policy. The Tories were lambasted by many (including Twitter) for misleading the public after they rebranded one of the party\u2019s official accounts to make it look like a factchecking service during the first debate - an accusation Johnson subsequently failed to address. There was also a row over the promise of 50,000 new nurses. In his first major intervention in the campaign, Tony Blair said neither Labour nor the Tories were fit to win the election, accusing both parties of peddling \u201cfantasies\u201d and engaging in \u201cpopulism running riot\u201d and predicting it would all end in tears. The Guardian\u2019s election polling tracker showed the Conservatives ahead, but with a lead varying between anything from 19 points to just seven \u2013 the difference between a comfortable Tory majority and another hung parliament. What next? The government is preparing \u2013 if it wins \u2013 for a state opening of parliament and a slimmed-down Queen\u2019s speech as early as 19 December, and first and second readings of the withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas. Meanwhile, Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d is increasingly being attacked as misleading, since \u2013 as my colleague Jennifer Rankin explains \u2013 the UK\u2019s departure from the EU would, in fact, mark the end of merely the first phase of Brexit. What follows, moreover, will be arguably the biggest negotiations of the post-war era, concerning much more than trade, with an immense volume of technical work to be done, potentially diverging EU27 goals, and a UK that has yet to make the necessary hard choices on the form of its post-Brexit future. Best of the rest EU stars disappear from British disabled drivers\u2019 blue badges. NHS winter crisis fears grow after thousands of EU staff quit. Nigel Farage asks voters to elect at least some Brexit party candidates. UK companies hit by sharpest activity drop since Brexit vote. Scottish Labour is free to campaign against Brexit, says Corbyn. UK growth will dip to 1% even if no-deal Brexit avoided, warns OECD. Labour pledges \u00a358bn for women caught in pension trap. Top comment In the Guardian, Rafael Behr argues Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d drumbeat is the prelude to lies, betrayal and duplicity: As politics, \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 is snappy; as policy, it is empty. It is the vacuous sequel to \u2018Take back control\u2019, starring the same falsehood about Britain\u2019s global stature. It contains the illusion that we, liberated nation, tell them, spurned continentals, how things will be. Three years of negotiation tell a different story. The UK tried to retain privileges of EU membership without abiding by the rules, failed, and watched its deal deteriorate as a result. If the Tories win a majority, that pattern repeats all next year. Johnson\u2019s plan is to complete a comprehensive free-trade agreement before transitional arrangements expire next December. Trade talks between advanced economies can fill the best part of a decade. Ministers have three lines of defence for their improbable timetable. First, the UK and EU start from what Johnson describes as \u201cperfect alignment and harmony\u201d, so there isn\u2019t much to adjust. Second, Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said a year is sufficient. Third, people said Johnson couldn\u2019t ditch the backstop from Theresa May\u2019s deal, but he did. Those arguments are bogus. First, Johnson\u2019s plan explicitly mandates divergence from EU norms. Its purpose is to carve out competitive advantage through deregulation. Brussels sees that as a threat to undercut continental businesses and dump substandard goods on EU consumers. Second, when EU officials nod along with the tight timetable, they are being polite and trying not to spook British voters. The commission wants the deal ratified as much as Johnson does, but an imbalance of power favours Brussels as much in the next phase as it did in withdrawal talks. Third, Johnson\u2019s powers of persuasion are fictional. He achieved removal of the backstop by abandoning a promise not to permit a trade border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, burning the DUP and reverting to a Brexit model he had once vigorously rejected.
