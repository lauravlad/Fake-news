He met officials working for EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola.</p> \n  <p>According to a diplomatic note of one meeting, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He also told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal, but was not afraid of no deal.</p> \n  <p>The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal. Frost told EU officials that it would be possible to ratify a Brexit deal in the second half of October and argued that a technical extension would not be necessary.</p> \n  <p>This strategy matches Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But EU diplomats remain sceptical that a solution to the thorny question of the Irish backstop can be devised in 64 days. The backstop is an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and would keep the UK in an EU customs area until both sides agree another plan. The backstop kicks in automatically, if EU and UK negotiators fail to come up with mutually acceptable alternative arrangements. </p> \n  <p>Many EU insiders that a solution that has eluded experts for two years can be agreed in the next few weeks. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that Frost offered no new ideas on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>EU officials are expecting the UK to propose ideas in the coming weeks; the European commission has said to ensure a deal, it wanted to see those ideas \u201cthe earlier, the better\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frost, who called for compromise on both sides, is due back in Brussels next week, but the timetable for talks remains unclear. The British government announced both sides would \u201cintensify discussions\u201d as of next week.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T12:23:44.906Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d67b2228f08a5e74d69792c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:30:54.181Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Updates from the legal attempt to stop the suspension of parliament:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167031811568021505\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Proroguing parliament in this way is \u201cunlawful\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt is the duty of the court to declare it as such\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww\">https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167031811568021505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032566492409856\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">O\u2019Neill: \u201cit is that taking away of political accountability that the balance of the constitution requires the courts to come in, to maintain the legal accountability of government for its actions\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww\">https://t.co/hOI7dz2Oww</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032566492409856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032913977925632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If the court agrees, it must declare the proroguing order by the Queen is \u201cunlawful, unwarranted and unconstitutional\u201d, says O\u2019Neill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopBoris?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stopBoris</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7ls1ZHhB0j\">https://t.co/7ls1ZHhB0j</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell Esq (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1167032913977925632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:41:54.237Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d67aea88f082209d3223b3c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T11:07:20.117Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A legal bid to prevent Johnson from proroguing parliament will be heard in court on Thursday afternoon. </strong>The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House in Edinburgh at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding.

And I believe him when he says that he\u2019s seeking to get a deal. And please ... make it clear now that if a deal comes back to the House of Commons, you will vote for it and let the EU hear you say that you will vote for it so that they understand that there is a reason for them to reopen negotiations. </p> \n   <p>If the prime minister brings a deal back to the House of Commons as I know he is trying to do, for God\u2019s sake, get behind it and this time at the fourth time of asking vote for it.</p> \n   <p>I stand absolutely foursquare behind the prime minister\u2019s attempts to bring back a deal that can pass in the House of Commons. </p> \n   <p>There has been a lot that\u2019s been written about my relationship with the prime minister and I went out to Downing Street to meet him last week in a private meeting. I stared him right in the eye. I asked him out: \u2018I need to know are you actually trying to get a deal or not?\u2019 And he categorically assured me that he was. He believes that his efforts in Biarritz has helped open the door a crack. I know that what would help further would be for people who want to avoid no deal, to come out and say that if a deal is brought back to parliament, that they would back, in the way that they have failed to do three times already. So I want him to get that deal. I believe that\u2019s what he and his government are working towards. And I support him in those efforts. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T10:59:48.542Z\">at 11.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d67a3a98f082209d3223ab1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-29T10:13:06.880Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In her Q&amp;A with reporters, Davidson urged MPs to vote for a deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the \u201cfourth time of asking\u201d.

Some of my Tory colleagues, who are cheering at the moment, would have been turning purple with rage.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt sets a very bad precedent for future governments. It\u2019s a pretty good rule that if you are tempted to play around with parliamentary and constitutional procedure, don\u2019t do something that you wouldn\u2019t want a government of a different party to do to you.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Lidington also questioned Johnson\u2019s rationale for the move. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIf the only reason for this is to have time for the Queen\u2019s speech, all that was necessary was for an announcement to be made saying that there would be a prorogation while parliament was in recess at the conferences, and we\u2019d assemble for the Queen\u2019s speech immediately after the conference season, you didn\u2019t need the five weeks that\u2019s proposed. There\u2019s a big difference between what happens in a parliamentary recess and a prorogation of parliament because all parliamentary activity shuts down including committees. With a prorogation, if I put down a question to a minister that is guillotined, it just falls away.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe are approaching a really important deadline, we\u2019ve got a big negotiation with the European Union. And we\u2019ve got a deadline of the end of October, which could lead to a no deal. And we need to know more about the government\u2019s preparations for that scenario and more about the negotiations as they continue because our constituents will be affected by those decisions.</p> \n   <p>\u201cReal people want answers and what\u2019s happening under this proposal is parliament is being gagged. And people won\u2019t be able to ask questions and hold ministers to account. I think that is wrong. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWhat prorogation does is prevent parliament from sitting at all. And it prevents MPs from asking questions. It prevents many ministers from being held to account by parliamentary select committees.

In a joint statement, they condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cundemocratic\u201d move. The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Lord Young quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision. He said it \u201crisks undermining the fundamental role of parliament\u201d in his resignation letter. Shortly afterwards, Ruth Davidson confirmed her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Although she stressed the decision had been made for family reasons, in her resignation letter she acknowledged: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d An attempt was made in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament. Lord Doherty, presiding over the hearing, said he would consider the issue overnight and give his ruling at 10am tomorrow. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic apparently admitting the real reason parliament was prorogued. Speaking to his French counterpart at a summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Momentum, the pro-Jeremy Corbyn movement, called for street protests and blockades to stop what it called a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Corbyn said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader described the move as \u201ca smash-and-grab raid against our democracy\u201d. If you\u2019d like to read yet more on today\u2019s politics news, my colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story: The devolved administrations need greater funding to deal with the effects of Brexit, finance ministers from the Scottish and Welsh governments have claimed. The Welsh finance minister, Rebecca Evans, and the Scottish finance secretary, Derek Mackay, warned that the Treasury\u2019s plans for a one-year spending round \u2013 as opposed to a three-year comprehensive spending review \u2013 will leave them \u201cshort-changed\u201d. Evans said a meeting with the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, on Thursday was \u201clittle comfort\u201d. I am disappointed that the chief secretary failed to provide us with the clarity, honesty and commitment that we have repeatedly called for from the UK government. Despite being promised a three-year comprehensive spending review at our last finance ministers\u2019 meeting, we now face a one-year spending round next week. That review cannot leave us short-changed again. After nine years of austerity, our Welsh government budget is 5% lower in real terms than it was back in 2010. We currently face the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, and in those circumstances, we know that the economy in Wales is likely to be around 10% smaller in the long term. This would be reflected in real incomes that, in today\u2019s terms, would be up to \u00a32,000 lower per person than otherwise. Mackay said: The actions of the UK government in attempting to shut down parliament to force through a no-deal outcome means that the UK stands on the cusp of an economic crisis. Alongside my Welsh counterpart, I made it abundantly clear to the chief secretary to the Treasury the impact that a no-deal Brexit will have on Scotland\u2019s economy and jobs. I also urged him to provide a cast-iron guarantee that all lost EU funding will be replaced in full by the UK government. The chief secretary failed to provide those assurances and so I challenged him to work with us to agree a new framework for future funding allocations. With a no-deal scenario looking increasingly more likely, the current financial arrangements are not fit for purpose. We need a new agreement to ensure that the Scottish and Welsh governments have the necessary powers to help mitigate, as best we can, the damage caused by the UK government\u2019s no-deal actions. The decision to only part-fund additional costs resulting from changes to public sector pensions further demonstrates the need for a new framework so that the UK government fairly respects devolved administrations. Opposition leaders have demanded that Boris Johnson either reverse his decision to suspend parliament or put it to a Commons vote. The leaders of Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and the Greens, say: It is our view that there is a majority in the House of Commons that does not support this prorogation, and we demand that the prime minister reverses this decision immediately or allows MPs to vote on whether there should be one. We condemn the undemocratic actions of Boris Johnson following his suspension of parliament until 14 October. There is no mandate from the public for a damaging no-deal Brexit. The prime minister is shutting down parliament with the sole aim of stopping MPs from avoiding a no-deal Brexit. This will be the longest prorogation in recent history, and one that comes at a critical moment in the history of our respective nations and the Brexit process. Voters are being deprived of the opportunity to have their representatives hold the government to account, make any key decisions, and ensure there is a lawful basis for any action that is taken. The former justice secretary David Gauke has already made clear his opposition to the prorogation of parliament and his belief that it will embolden opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Now, he has told the BBC: We are very concerned about what no deal is going to involve. It\u2019s probably not in our interests to be very specific about what the proposals might be as to how we would do that. I think there are many of us who would be inclined to say that parliament doesn\u2019t need to take action for a while yet. But, given the announcement from (Wednesday) that parliament is only going to be sitting for a week next week and then really at the end of October \u2013 by which point it will be too late for parliament to do anything effective, then I do think we have to look at what our options are next week. The fact is there isn\u2019t a mandate for a no-deal Brexit. It is not what was campaigned for in 2016. It is not what the public want. According to opinion polls, only about a third of the public would support that and I think as the consequences of no deal become clear, that number may well fall. So, I think parliament does have a responsibility to act and it may well be that next week is the only opportunity for us to do so. The latest Guardian Politics Weekly podcast has just gone out. Jessica Elgot and her guests react to the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament for five weeks from mid-September, an act the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, called a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said was a \u201cthreat to our democracy\u201d Jessica is joined by the Guardian journalists Rafael Behr, Owen Jones and Sonia Sodha to analyse Boris Johnson\u2019s motives and what steps are available for MPs returning to the Commons next week. Richard Harrington, a former Tory minister and a vocal critic both Boris Johnson and Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategies, will stand down at the next general election. The MP for Watford resigned as a business minister in March and said May\u2019s government was \u201cplaying roulette with the lives and livelihoods of the vast majority of people in this country\u201d. Following Wednesday\u2019s news that Johnson plans to prorogue parliament, Harrington has told the Watford Observer: I think suspending parliament increases a no-deal and I will do everything in my power to ensure that won\u2019t happen. The more time there is to debate, the more chance there is of reaching a compromise. According to the Sun, Harrington also indicated he would vote to block a no-deal Brexit. In a statement explaining his decision to stand down, Harrington added: Having had the privilege of serving as MP for Watford for almost 10 years, I have decided to retire from frontline politics. It had always been my intention to step down at the next general election, due under the Fixed Term Parliament Act in 2022. However, with the current increasing uncertainty about an earlier election, I believe it right for me to make clear my intentions now. Therefore, I have told my constituency chairman that I will not be offering myself for selection as the Conservative party candidate for the next general election, whenever that may be. Until then, I shall continue to devote myself to serving all my constituents \u2013 as I have done since they first elected me in 2010. In that general election, we Conservatives took what was then a closely contested three-way marginal seat from Labour. I am proud that we subsequently held the seat in the general elections of 2015 and 2017 and I give my sincere thanks to voters for the confidence they have shown in me. Being MP for Watford has allowed me to meet so many people from visiting schools, businesses, charities and other organisations and groups. I have learned a great deal from them. I will continue to offer my support for such community groups in the future, and will do my best to help my successor, in whatever way I can. Harrington voted three times for the withdrawal agreement and has also indicated his support for a second referendum in the past. Here\u2019s an evening summary of yet another astonishing day in politics: The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Lord Young quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision, saying it \u201crisks undermining the fundamental role of parliament\u201d in his resignation letter. Shortly after, Ruth Davidson confirmed her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Although she stressed the decision had been made for family reasons, in her resignation letter she acknowledged: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d An attempt was made in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament. Lord Doherty, presiding over the hearing, said he would consider the issue overnight and give his ruling at 10am tomorrow. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic apparently admitting the real reason parliament was prorogued. Speaking to his French counterpart at a summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Momentum, the pro-Jeremy Corbyn movement, called for street protests and blockades to stop what it called a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Corbyn said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader described the move as \u201ca smash-and-grab raid against our democracy\u201d. I\u2019m off now - my colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over. Richard J Evans, one of Britain\u2019s foremost historians of Germany and the Third Reich, has written a piece for Prospect magazine in which he compares present day Britain and the US to Weimar Germany. He notes there have been signals that a potential vote of no confidence could be shrugged off with contempt by Boris Johnson. \u201cIf that were to happen, parliamentary democracy would truly be in trouble in this country. This is Britain\u2019s Reichstag Fire Decree moment,\u201d Evans writes. Speaking in Dunfermline, at the start of a three-day tour of Scotland, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted MPs could still have time to move legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but also had some cautionary words for Scottish nationalists. While the SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday said that Boris Johnson\u2019s conduct in shutting down parliament had made independence \u201calmost inevitable\u201d - and Ruth Davidson\u2019s resignation has also prompted speculation about the future of the union - today Corbyn warned that a Labour government would not allow another Scottish independence vote to be held in its \u201cformative years\u201d. Earlier this month, Corbyn\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told an Edinburgh fringe event that a Labour government would not oppose a second independence referendum \u2013 directly contradicting Scottish Labour policy. Today Corbyn said: \u201cI want there to be a Labour government in this country and I want that Labour government to be able to deliver for the people of Scotland as for the rest of the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not my priority that there should be an independence referendum in Scotland.\u201d More protests are being announced. On Tuesday, Ireland-based Brits are scheduled to rally outside the British embassy in Dublin against Brexit and the suspension of parliament, TheJournal.ie reports. Campaign group Brits Not Out was formed in response to Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. \u201cWe are calling on the many British nationals who have made their lives in Ireland to join our protest against this outrageous and undemocratic act,\u201d spokesperson Grace Williams told the publication. \u201cWe care deeply about British democracy and the negative impact that Brexit \u2013 especially a hard Brexit \u2013 will have on our families, friends and communities in the UK. And we care equally about the threat that Brexit poses to jobs, peace and prosperity on this island, where we\u2019ve been welcomed and where are now living our lives.\u201d Other MPs\u2019 positions on the subject of prorogation are also coming under scrutiny. Tory MP Alex Clark has been facing pro-EU protesters outside his office in Cheltenham. He told constituents that \u201cthe actual concrete practical difference\u201d of suspending parliament is modest but admitted \u201cthe political implications are great\u201d. He added, in footage posted to Twitter by BBC reporter Hayley Mortimer: \u201cI\u2019ve made my position clear, what the implications of that are will be for the chief whip.\u201d Downing Street has reacted to that on-air gaffe earlier by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace. He apparently \u201cmisspoke\u201d: The Labour leader has said parliament will \u201clegislate rapidly\u201d on Tuesday, when it resumes, to prevent Boris Johnson from suspending parliament and stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, Corbyn said: \u201cWe will be back in parliament on Tuesday to challenge Boris Johnson on what I think is a smash-and-grab raid against our democracy. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to suspend parliament in order to prevent a serious discussion and a serious debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is try to politically stop him on Tuesday with a parliamentary process in order to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit and also to try and prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period.\u201d Hi, this is Amy Walker taking over from Matt Weaver. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, has spoken about the prorogation of parliament on a visit to Venezuelan refugees in Colombia (in his role as chief executive of the International Rescue Committee). He told the Guardian\u2019s Joe Parkin Daniels: \u201cIt\u2019s an appalling day for British parliamentary democracy. The idea that parliament is a threat to good government rather than the basis of good government is completely contrary to everything we know about British history, never mind international history. I think that it is absolutely right for parliamentarians to fight for their right to sit and to hold government to account not just on Brexit but on a range of issues. The excuses that have been given by the government this morning have been truly pathetic. A strong government welcomes a strong parliament, one can only conclude that it is a weak government if it fears parliamentary scrutiny.\u201d An application at the high court to challenge Boris Johnson\u2019s move in London is \u201cbeing considered\u201d, a spokeswoman for the judiciary has said. An urgent application for a judicial review has been made by campaigner Gina Miller, who previously won a landmark ruling that MPs would have to vote before the government could invoke article 50 to formally start the UK\u2019s exit process from the EU. The judiciary spokeswoman said on Thursday: \u201cWe can confirm that an application for judicial review has been received from Gina Miller. The defendant is the prime minister. The application is being considered.\u201d Philip Pullman has denied wanting to hang Boris Johnson after being widely criticised for a tweet about the prime minister, PA reports. The author said in a since-deleted post on Twitter that he thinks of a \u201crope\u201d and \u201cthe nearest lamp-post\u201d when he hears Johnson\u2019s name. After the backlash Pullman said he had made a \u201ctactical error\u201d but refused to apologise for his anger at the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. In the original tweet, Pullman said: \u201cWhen I hear the name \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019, for some reason the words \u2018rope\u2019 and \u2018nearest lamp-post\u2019 come to mind as well.\u201d Following criticism online, the Northern Lights author blamed recent political events for his post and said he wanted to make it \u201cperfectly clear\u201d that he did not want to kill the prime minister. Daniel Hannan, the arch Eurosceptic Tory MEP, is warning of another Windrush scandal after being contacted by EU nationals denied settled status after Brexit. Hannan is echoing concerns of the Labour party. When the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested ending freedom of movement immediately on 31 October, Jeremy Corbyn warned this could lead to a situation like \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d. Momentum, the grassroots group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn, has called for street protests and road blockades to stop what it calls a coup. Laura Parker, the group\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cOur message to Johnson is this: if you steal our democracy, we\u2019ll shut down the streets.\u201d Momentum, together with trade unions, have organised protests in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Sheffield and York on Saturday and a further demonstration in London next Tuesday when parliament returns. Parker will be joining an occupation of parliament next week. She said: \u201cEton-educated, millionaire Boris Johnson is stealing our democracy so he can sell off our NHS to big US corporations in a no-deal, Trump-first Brexit. This is an establishment coup by a tiny, privileged elite who have been eroding our democracy for decades. Real power doesn\u2019t sit with the Queen or in parliament. It\u2019s with us, the people \u2013 and that\u2019s why we need to take action. There are thousands of us who will join an occupation of parliament and block the roads before we let Johnson close the doors on democracy. Today we\u2019re going to contact all Momentum supporters and encourage them to protest, occupy and blockade on Saturday.\u201d Irish ministers have distanced themselves from comments made by a government colleague who compared Boris Johnson to Oliver Cromwell, PA reports. In a tweet, which he later deleted, the minister of state, Michael D\u2019Arcy, said the UK prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was \u201cperhaps the most anti-democratic decision since the Protectorate government, which Oliver Cromwell set up, was established\u201d. The minister for business, Heather Humphreys, said: \u201cFirst of all, Minister D\u2019Arcy has removed that tweet. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, we are not going to comment on internal British politics.\u201d The minister for communications, Richard Bruton, said: \u201cWe are not going to get involved in British politics because they have a lot of decisions to make. \u201cUndoubtedly, the decisions that they make will have a big impact on us and we need to give them the time and space to do that,\u201d Bruton said. Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend the House of Commons created a greater risk of a hard Brexit. \u201cVery clearly, the issue of resolving this is in Boris Johnson\u2019s court and I think we await the developments in British politics,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s PA\u2019s take on the legal bid in Scotland highest civil court to try to prevent Johnson from suspending parliament. A cross-party group of around 70 MPs and peers are backing the action at the court of session in Edinburgh after beginning a legal move earlier in the summer when they filed a petition aiming to stop Johnson being able to prorogue parliament. They are now seeking an interim interdict, which would stop the prime minister taking the option of suspension until a final decision has been made on the case. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, representing the petitioners, said the prorogation was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and the petitioners are invoking the court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional jurisdiction\u201d. He said: \u201cProrogation is being used to create something which is irreversible, that the UK will be made to leave the EU deal or no deal, do or die, and parliament is being prevented by abuse of the power of prorogation from doing anything about it. There are no precedents for the abuse of prorogation. \u201cThe power of prorogation is not one which is unlimited or unfettered but has to be used in accordance with public trust.\u201d The case is being heard by Lord Doherty. O\u2019Neill said the Queen should be obliged to recall the prorogation order if it turned out to be based on an error of law. He said: \u201cIf the court is satisfied that the advice to the sovereign given yesterday that parliament be prorogued is in fact found to be an abuse of power based on an error of law, then there should be an obligation on the sovereign to recall that order of prorogation because the sovereign is not above the law.\u201d The legal challenge is being led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, aided by Jo Maugham of the Good Law Project. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. The government is facing three legal challenges to try to block the suspension of parliament. A high court in Belfast held an urgent hearing for an injunction against the prime minister, following similar legal battles launched in Scotland and England by the SNP justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, and the campaigner Gina Miller. Ruth Davidson has confirmed her decision to resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. In her resignation letter she cited both the conflict she feels over Brexit and her desire to achieve a better balance between her working and family life. Boris Johnson has suffered his first ministerial resignation, as George Young quit the Tory frontbench in the Lords over the PM\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in September. In his resignation letter as a government whip in the House of Lords, Young said he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation\u201d. A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already been signed by more than 1.4 million people. The petition is growing even faster than the petition to revoke article 50, which eventually had 6m signatures. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been caught on mic admitting uncertainty over what happens next in the Brexit process and conceding the weakness of the government grip on power. Speaking at a gathering of defence ministers in Helsinki, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome will be ... we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has defended the decision to suspend parliament and claimed the outpouring of outrage it triggered was \u201cconfected\u201d. He also accused the Speaker, John Bercow, of being constitutionally \u201cimproper\u201d by criticising the move. Former cabinet ministers including David Gauke and David Lidington have joined those condemning prorogation. Lidington described it as an attempt to gag parliament. Gauke said next week was the only chance parliament had to stop a no-deal exit. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. \u201cI think it is unacceptable behaviour going on at the moment,\u201d he said. Ruth Davidson had a frosty relationship with Boris Johnson, which she alluded to in her press conference. But Johnson glossed over those differences in a three-tweet tribute to her. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, has also piled in. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 World at One programme he said: \u201cIt is not routine to prorogue parliament for five weeks. I don\u2019t believe it is the right thing to do when we face such a crucial question about our future relationship with the European Union. The government should be scrutinised whether it\u2019s on no-deal planning, whether it\u2019s on the negotiations, the government should be held to account by parliamentarians.\u201d Gauke added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there is a mandate for leaving without a deal. That\u2019s isn\u2019t what was put to the people in 2016 by those campaigning to leave. And I think it would cause significant detrimental effect to the economic outlook for this country and for the integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d He also conceded it was unclear how parliament could stop a no-deal and but he appeared to rule out backing a no-confidence motion in the government. I\u2019ve consistently said that I don\u2019t want to see Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. I also have to say, I think that a vote of no confidence in these circumstances is not the correct way forward. What would then happen is that we would run into a general election. Unless another form of government was able to be created, which I very much doubt, then the existing government would be able run down the clock and take us beyond 31 of October. So I don\u2019t believe that that is the right approach. Parliament may need to act to stop a no deal. It does look like next week is essentially the only opportunity parliament will have to maintain some control over this process and ensure that it has a say before we leave without a deal. I don\u2019t think one can rule out the possibility of parliament being able to find a way through this. The lord chief justice in Northern Ireland is to consider whether to grant an immediate injunction to block the suspension of parliament at a full hearing tomorrow. Sir Declan Norman broke his summer holiday for a 20-minute urgent hearing this morning for an application by campaigner Raymond McCord, who has argued that a no-deal Brexit would be a breach of the Good Friday agreement. He instructed both parties to return to court tomorrow with their \u201cexpanded arguments\u201d. \u201cWe are seeking an urgent injunction to compel Boris Johnson to reverse his advice to the queen to prorogue parliament,\u201d said McCord\u2019s lawyer, Ciaran O\u2019Hare. O\u2019Hare says the decision to hear the case while the court is not in session shows the seriousness with which the judge is taking the case. \u201cWe are confident. You now have cases in Scotland and England but in terms of litigation we believe that the Northern Ireland case is the most urgent because we argue the consequences of no deal here are worse than anywhere else in the UK,\u201d he said. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has been caught on mic admitting uncertainty about what happens next in the Brexit process and conceding the weakness of the government grip on power. Speaking to his French counterpart at a defence summit in Helsinki, Wallace could be heard explaining the decision to prorogue parliament. He said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d Shrugging and laughing he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome will be, you know politics.\u201d He added this about the government\u2019s weakness: \u201cOur system is a winner-takes-all system. If you win a parliamentary majority you control everything, you control the timetable. There\u2019s no written separation. So it\u2019s, you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. And we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, appears to accept the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson has been labelled a \u201cdictator\u201d by John McDonnell, PA reports. The shadow chancellor said Downing Street was being run like the Bullingdon Club, an elite group of Oxford students attended by both Johnson and former prime minister David Cameron. He accused Johnson of \u201ctreating us like serfs\u201d and warned the public would not tolerate his antics after the PM\u2019s controversial decision to suspend parliament for more than a month. MPs\u2019 powers will be effectively suspended from 12 September until the Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October after the Queen ratified Johnson\u2019s request for a suspension of more than four weeks - the longest prorogation in modern memory. McDonnell said: \u201cI just give Boris Johnson this warning, really. Trying to undermine the very institution that people have given their lives for, to secure this democracy \u2013 to try to undermine that flies in the face of a whole history and centuries of democratic advancement in this country. \u201cI don\u2019t think the British people will tolerate that. They have stood up to dictators before and they will stand up to this one as well.\u201d Some cabinet ministers have been much quicker to pay tribute to Ruth Davidson than they have to defend Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. A legal bid in Belfast to injunct Boris Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament has been adjourned for 24 hours. The injunction application was made by prominent victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who was already pursing legal proceedings against the potential proroguing of parliament. Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, sat in Belfast high court on Thursday morning for a briefing hearing during which he gave the legal parties 24 hours to prepare for a substantive hearing, which will be heard at 10am on Friday. Afterwards, McCord told the PA news agency: \u201cI don\u2019t want a Brexit, more importantly I don\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit and also I don\u2019t want parliament suspended. \u201cI think it is totally against the democratic process and it\u2019s unconstitutional, and it\u2019s being done for political purposes - it\u2019s not being done for the good of the people.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit envoy offered the European Union no new ideas in finding a way out of the Brexit impasse, Brussels sources have said. David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s Europe adviser, held a series of meetings at EU institutions in Brussels on Wednesday. He met officials working for EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Clara Mart\u00ednez Alberola. According to a diplomatic note of one meeting, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed the prime minister\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He also told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal, but was not afraid of no deal. The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal. Frost told EU officials that it would be possible to ratify a Brexit deal in the second half of October and argued that a technical extension would not be necessary. This strategy matches Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d. But EU diplomats remain sceptical that a solution to the thorny question of the Irish backstop can be devised in 64 days. The backstop is an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and would keep the UK in an EU customs area until both sides agree another plan. The backstop kicks in automatically, if EU and UK negotiators fail to come up with mutually acceptable alternative arrangements. Many EU insiders that a solution that has eluded experts for two years can be agreed in the next few weeks. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that Frost offered no new ideas on Wednesday. EU officials are expecting the UK to propose ideas in the coming weeks; the European commission has said to ensure a deal, it wanted to see those ideas \u201cthe earlier, the better\u201d. Frost, who called for compromise on both sides, is due back in Brussels next week, but the timetable for talks remains unclear. The British government announced both sides would \u201cintensify discussions\u201d as of next week. Updates from the legal attempt to stop the suspension of parliament: Here\u2019s a summary of the latest fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament: A legal bid to prevent Johnson from proroguing parliament will be heard in court on Thursday afternoon. The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House in Edinburgh at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding. A separate attempt to stop the move is also under way at the high court in Belfast. Ruth Davidson has confirmed her decision to resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives. In her resignation letter she cited both the conflict she feels over Brexit and her desire to achieve a better balance between her working and family life. Lord Young of Cookham, a government whip in the Lords, has resigned. He said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the decision to prorogue parliament for an extended period as the the 31 October deadline for Brexit looms. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has defended the decision to suspend parliament and claimed the outpouring of outrage it triggered was \u201cconfected\u201d. He also accused the Speaker, John Bercow, of being constitutionally \u201cimproper\u201d by criticising the move. The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington has joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. He said: \u201cIt prevents MPs from asking questions. It prevents many ministers from being held to account by parliamentary select committees. And I think that is not a good way to do democracy.\u201d Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. \u201cI think it is unacceptable behaviour going on at the moment,\u201d he said. An attempt in a Scottish court to reverse the decision to suspend parliament has been brought forward to noon today. Lawyers acting for the Scottish National party\u2019s Joanna Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers had expected to be in court in Edinburgh on Friday morning to urge Scotland\u2019s civil court, the court of session, to block the suspension of parliament. The hearing is scheduled to take place at Parliament House at 12pm, with Lord Doherty presiding. Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit lawyer who helped coordinate the legal challenge through his Good Law Project, said they believed the courts would be able to reverse the decision even though it had been approved by the Queen. Asked for his response to the prospect of an early election, McDonnell said: \u201cBring it on. The issue for us now is that we have to do everything we can, working on a cross-party basis, to block a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the impact it could have on our country and living standards. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll work on. We\u2019ll use every parliamentary device we possibly can. If that means a vote of no confidence at some stage, then we\u2019re open to it, that is on the table.\u201d Reaction to Davidson\u2019s resignation: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the upcoming spending review was a \u201cpanic-driven stunt\u201d. He said: \u201cNobody is fooled that this is a proper and normal spending review. It is a one-year only, panic-driven stunt budget.\u201d McDonnell said Boris Johnson and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, were attempting to \u201cshift enough votes to get them into power\u201d with next Wednesday\u2019s expected statement. He added: \u201cIf nothing else, this has proved what we have said all along. Austerity was always a political choice, not an economic necessity.\u201d McDonnell said Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for more than a month shows his \u201cdeep-seated arrogant sense of entitlement\u201d. He added: \u201cThe last 24 hours have revealed the true character of Boris Johnson and, as importantly, the real nature of his politics. \u201cIt\u2019s exposed in Johnson a deep-seated arrogant sense of entitlement. Johnson sees himself not as a modern-day prime minister, whose authority rests upon the support of a parliamentary democracy. \u201cInstead, his actions betray that he\u2019s reverted to a much older Tory tradition. He\u2019s a ruler, ruling over the ruled. \u201cDemocratic practices like parliamentary votes have become encumbrances to the freedom of the ruler. And how dare the broadcast media seek to pose questions and ask for an interview or anything more than a short clip of him grinning.\u201d Davidson stopped short of condemning Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Here\u2019s what she told journalists: We had three golden opportunities to support a deal. The people right now who are saying they would do anything to avoid no deal had a goal gaping in front of them three times and they hit the ball over the bar. For all the elaborate plans of bringing down governments and installing Ken Clarke and Harriet Harman on job shares as prime minister, the simplest way to avoid no deal is to vote for a deal. To colleagues who want to avoid no deal: vote for a deal. You\u2019ve had three opportunities, you blew every one of them don\u2019t blow a fourth. I know the prime minister is seeking to get a deal. I\u2019ve had long conversations with him on this point. And I believe him when he says that he\u2019s seeking to get a deal. And please ... make it clear now that if a deal comes back to the House of Commons, you will vote for it and let the EU hear you say that you will vote for it so that they understand that there is a reason for them to reopen negotiations. If the prime minister brings a deal back to the House of Commons as I know he is trying to do, for God\u2019s sake, get behind it and this time at the fourth time of asking vote for it. I stand absolutely foursquare behind the prime minister\u2019s attempts to bring back a deal that can pass in the House of Commons. There has been a lot that\u2019s been written about my relationship with the prime minister and I went out to Downing Street to meet him last week in a private meeting. I stared him right in the eye. I asked him out: \u2018I need to know are you actually trying to get a deal or not?\u2019 And he categorically assured me that he was. He believes that his efforts in Biarritz has helped open the door a crack. I know that what would help further would be for people who want to avoid no deal, to come out and say that if a deal is brought back to parliament, that they would back, in the way that they have failed to do three times already. So I want him to get that deal. I believe that\u2019s what he and his government are working towards. And I support him in those efforts. In her Q&amp;A with reporters, Davidson urged MPs to vote for a deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the \u201cfourth time of asking\u201d. Repeating what she told Boris Johnson in private, Davidson called on the prime minister to secure a deal in Brussels. She said Johnson \u201ccategorically\u201d assured her that he was trying to get a deal. \u201cI support him in that effort,\u201d she said. An attempt to injunct Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament is under way at the high court in Belfast. The application for an injunction has been made by solicitors acting for the victims campaigner Raymond McCord. In a statement, McCord\u2019s lawyers said a hearing had been granted for 10am this morning in front of the lord chief justice. McCord is already involved in one of three sets of legal proceedings arguing a no-deal Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement and his case was listed as the lead case with a hearing scheduled for next month. Ruth Davidson is making a statement on her resignation in Edinburgh. In her resignation letter Davidson added: I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitments to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a different choice.\u201d Ruth Davidson has confirmed her resignation as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland. In her resignation letter she stressed the decision was made for family reasons but acknowledges: \u201cI have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit.\u201d Lord Young has quit as a government whip in the Lords over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In his resignation letter he said: \u201cI am very unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation ... [it] risks undermining the fundamental role of parliament.\u201d Cabinet ministers who have in the very recent past expressed opposition to proroguing parliament are now tight-lipped. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, declined to answer questions on the suspension of parliament during a visit to Belfast. In June, Rudd described the suggestion of proroguing parliament as \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d, \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d. She did not comment on the matter when asked about it by PA Media after visiting a jobs and benefits office in east Belfast, instead insisting she was focused on her job. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to do my job as secretary of state for work and pensions,\u201d she said. Sir Tom Devine, Scotland\u2019s pre-eminent modern historian, has called for mass protests against Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Devine, professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, said those protests would not succeed in overturning Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament without MPs from all parties also showing \u201cguile and spine\u201d by blocking it at Westminster. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Devine said: \u201cWe are now at a very considerable and dangerous crossroads in our democracy. [I] think it\u2019s time for the people to react through mass protest.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a crisis and this is an emergency.\u201d The author of several bestselling histories of Scotland and its global diaspora, Devine was knighted in 2014, given the royal medal by the Queen in 2001 and made an OBE in 2005. He cited the warnings yesterday from Lord Kerslake, the former head of the UK civil service, that civil servants needed to examine their consciences about enabling Johnson\u2019s policies, and also the PM\u2019s decision to make the Queen agree to prorogument. That was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and risked damaging popular respect for the monarchy, Devine said. Party leaders should consider cancelling their annual party conferences, due to start next month. Beyond the current crisis, Johnson\u2019s gambit would also fuel support for Scottish independence. Johnson was \u201cthe greatest recruiting sergeant for the SNP and for independence since Margaret Thatcher,\u201d Devine said. \u201cWe have unambiguous evidence of the complete indifference of this current gang to preserve the union. This is another major blow, another major battering ram against the integrity of what the previous prime minister called \u2018our precious union\u2019. \u201cIt is almost as if Johnson and his ilk has conceived a plan to destroy the UK because of their exclusive obsession with delivering Brexit.\u201d That petition against proroguing parliament has now passed 1.3m. A YouGov poll for the Times, conducted before Johnson prorogued parliament, puts the Conservatives 12% above Labour. Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister who resigned over Brexit, has become the latest Tory backbencher to criticise the suspension of parliament. Speaking to BBC News, he said: \u201cWe know that if Jeremy Corbyn had done this they would have rightly criticised him for using Trotskyite tactics to get his way. \u201cWe should not be using those tactics ourselves.\u201d Gyimah said that suspending parliament was part of a plan to \u201cmuzzle\u201d MPs over a no-deal Brexit. He added: \u201cWhat is so worrying is what we are reading in the papers that this is the first in a series of moves to make sure parliament is muzzled on the subject of scrutinising Brexit. \u201cIf Boris Johnson genuinely believes that his position of a no-deal Brexit is the will of the people, then rather than trafficking our constitution he should go to the people for a mandate. There is no mandate for a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is in Scotland, where he said a second referendum on independence would not take place in the \u201cformative years\u201d of a Labour government. PA Media has this: The Labour leader said if he was voted into Downing Street he would be focused on the \u201ccentral priorities\u201d of dealing with Brexit, ending austerity and acting to tackle the climate emergency. He said: \u201cIn the formative years of a Labour government we wouldn\u2019t agree to another independence referendum because we will be fully focused on these central priorities. \u201cHowever, if at some future point there was a legitimate and fresh mandate, we wouldn\u2019t block it.\u201d Scottish Labour had been opposed to another ballot on independence being held, after voters backed staying in the UK by 55% to 45% in 2014. However, the UK shadow chancellor, John McDonnell ,recently said the party would not stand in the way of a second referendum. Richard Leonard, the party\u2019s Scottish leader, said he was in agreement with Corbyn on the timing of a possible second ballot. He confirmed: \u201cJeremy and I have agreed that, during the formative years of an incoming Labour government, we would not sanction a Section 30 order to allow a further referendum on Scottish independence to take place.\u201d Leonard added: \u201cIt would also only be acceptable to a Labour government to allow a second referendum to proceed if it could be demonstrated that there was a fresh mandate for such a vote to be held. This would require a democratic mandate from the people of Scotland, which clearly signals the majority of people are in favour of a new vote. \u201cI do not believe that the conditions exist for such a move today, nor will they for the foreseeable future.\u201d Details of the agreement between the two leaders on the timing of a possible Scottish referendum emerged ahead of Corbyn making a campaign trip north of the border. And he argued that, while a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Scotland and the rest of the UK, ending the union with England would worsen austerity for Scots and \u201ccreate more instability and chaos\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s pursuit of a no-deal Brexit will be a disaster for the whole country. He is putting at risk Scottish jobs in manufacturing, food processing and service industries. His intention to suspend parliament shows he is also a threat to our democracy.\u201d Ruth Davidson has spoken briefly to the Scottish Daily Mail in advance of her press conference later this morning. She said that, whilst she understood the speculation around her decision and its timing, her departure had been planned prior to the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament yesterday. Davidson said: \u201cThose of us who are lucky enough to serve in political leadership accept the toll it takes, but there\u2019s a part of us which can never accept the effect it has in family and friends.\u201d She added that her party was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d and would continue to hold the SNP to account. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, is to give a statement at 11am when she is expected to resign. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said that if he was in post under a government that prorogued parliament in the way Johnson did, he would resign. Yesterday he told Polly Toynbee: \u201cWe are reaching the point where the civil service must consider putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day.\u201d Kerslake told Today: \u201cIt\u2019s for each individual to consider how far this has gone\u201d. John Bercow gave an interesting interview to Tortoise Media before yesterday\u2019s decision. Asked if parliament could stop a no deal, he said: \u201cYes it can have its say. It will decide what it wants. The idea that parliament would be evacuated from the centre stage of Brexit decision-making is unimaginable, it is inconceivable and it simply is not going to happen.\u201d He added: \u201cNaysayers contending there is nothing MPs can do, they are entitled to their opinion, but they suffer from the very grave disadvantage of being wrong.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg has also criticised Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, for claiming the government put the Queen in a difficult position by asking her to approve the prorogation of parliament. Rees-Mogg told Today: \u201cIt was simply wrong and deeply irresponsible of him to say that. The Queen had no discretion over this. There is no precedent for the Queen refusing a request by her prime minister under these circumstances. \u201cThis is a straightforward decision by the prime minister giving formal advice to the sovereign, which a constitutional monarch is obliged to follow. Lord O\u2019Donnell is saying things that are damaging to the constitution and wrong.\u201d Rees-Mogg gave no details of his meeting with the Queen at Balmoral yesterday, but he said there was no discussion about prorogation, the Queen simply approved the decision. And he continued to maintain that what was done was within law and precedent. He said: \u201cThe number of sitting days that is lost is in line with the averages going back to the second world war.\u201d Rees-Mogg also claimed that the comments by the Speaker, John Bercow, were \u201cthe most constitutionally improper thing that happened yesterday\u201d. He added: \u201cThe candyfloss of outrage that we\u2019ve had over the past 24 hours \u2013 which is almost entirely confected \u2013 is from people who never wanted to leave the European Union. \u201cThe law of the land is that we leave the European Union, and parliament voted for that on the back of a referendum where 17.4 million people voted to leave. That\u2019s not railroading. That\u2019s delivering a proper constitutional settlement.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart on what\u2019s likely to happen in the next few weeks: Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory whip over Brexit, has this: The former de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington has joined those condemning prorogation, describing it as an attempt to gag parliament. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cIf this had been done by a Labour government, Jacob Rees-Mogg would have been leading the denunciations of it. Some of my Tory colleagues, who are cheering at the moment, would have been turning purple with rage. \u201cIt sets a very bad precedent for future governments. It\u2019s a pretty good rule that if you are tempted to play around with parliamentary and constitutional procedure, don\u2019t do something that you wouldn\u2019t want a government of a different party to do to you.\u201d Lidington also questioned Johnson\u2019s rationale for the move. He said: \u201cIf the only reason for this is to have time for the Queen\u2019s speech, all that was necessary was for an announcement to be made saying that there would be a prorogation while parliament was in recess at the conferences, and we\u2019d assemble for the Queen\u2019s speech immediately after the conference season, you didn\u2019t need the five weeks that\u2019s proposed. There\u2019s a big difference between what happens in a parliamentary recess and a prorogation of parliament because all parliamentary activity shuts down including committees. With a prorogation, if I put down a question to a minister that is guillotined, it just falls away. \u201cWe are approaching a really important deadline, we\u2019ve got a big negotiation with the European Union. And we\u2019ve got a deadline of the end of October, which could lead to a no deal. And we need to know more about the government\u2019s preparations for that scenario and more about the negotiations as they continue because our constituents will be affected by those decisions. \u201cReal people want answers and what\u2019s happening under this proposal is parliament is being gagged. And people won\u2019t be able to ask questions and hold ministers to account. I think that is wrong. \u201cWhat prorogation does is prevent parliament from sitting at all. And it prevents MPs from asking questions. It prevents many ministers from being held to account by parliamentary select committees. And I think that is not a good way to do democracy.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has claimed the Speaker, John Bercow, was being unconstitutional by criticising the suspension of parliament. Bercow described Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. But Rees-Mogg claimed it was Bercow who was acting outside the constitution by making such comments, and cited William Lenthall, who served as Speaker during the English civil war. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Rees-Mogg said: There is a constitutional problem with what Mr Speaker said. Speaker Lenthall said that he \u2018had not eyes to see nor tongue to speak unless directed by the house\u2019. It is not constitutional for the speaker to express his opinion without direction of the house. He has had no such direction. And therefore his comments were in a private capacity they cannot be as Mr Speaker. What he said from holiday yesterday was not directed by the house.\u201d Rees-Mogg added that the move to prorogue parliament is not intended to limit the time available for MPs to debate Brexit and will allow the government to tackle other issues. He said: Parliament wasn\u2019t going to be sitting for most of this time anyway. This is completely constitutional and proper. There is going to be a lot of time to debate before 31 October.\u201d The outrage directed towards the move is \u201cphoney\u201d and created by people who do not want the UK to leave the EU, he added. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, has conceded that it will now be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Gardiner condemned the suspension of parliament for five weeks as \u201can unprecedented outrage designed to prevent parliament passing legislation that would stop the government taking the country out of the EU without a deal\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is a majority in parliament who believe that leaving without a deal was not something that was suggested during the referendum. It\u2019s not something that even leave voters considered. And there is no mandate for this.\u201d Asked what parliament could do to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Gardiner said: It\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. And that\u2019s why the government is disingenuous to say that this is not about trying to stop us doing that. We will be seeking measures on Monday, to try and have what\u2019s known as a standing order section 24 debate. And we will seek to try and put through the appropriate legislation in this constrained timetable that the government has now imposed. Downing Street is lying when it claims that this is about the conference recess. If he simply wanted to get on with his domestic agenda, he would actually be having a shorter period of prorogation. It extremely difficult to get the necessary legislation through that would stop a no deal for which this prime minister has no mandate and could have no mandate.\u201d One last front page from me (thank you to the kind reader who sent it to me) before I hand the blog over to Matthew Weaver. Thanks for keeping me company, over to Matthew. Chuka Umunna has called on Matt Hancock to resign, citing Hancock\u2019s former absolute disdain for proroguing. Which includes him saying that suspending parliament went against \u201ceverything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for\u201d. Thanks to all the readers who have sent these in. Keep them coming! Feel free to tweet yourself and tag me (@MsKateLyons) and I\u2019ll embed your tweet. Otherwise, DM me. Read this terrific reminder of some of the things that Tory ministers once said about calls to prorogue parliament, including Matt Hancock, who once said that suspending parliament would disrespect war dead, Amber Rudd, who branded it a \u201cridiculous suggestion\u201d and Sajid Javid, who said \u201cyou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy\u201d. Some international front pages. If you\u2019re outside the UK and proroguing news has made it onto your front page, tweet me a picture and I\u2019ll embed in the blog. ABC in Spain says Johnson has \u201cput the Queen into the Brexit war\u201d and Liberation in France says we are seeing a harder and harder Brexit. De Standaard reports: \u201cJohnson puts everything at stake for hard Brexit\u201d. Several in Belgium call the day\u2019s events a \u201ccoup\u201d, including De Morgen, which labels the event a \u201cvery British coup\u201d. What the papers said There is plenty of constitutional outcry on the front pages of the British papers today, which all lead with Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament ahead of the looming Brexit deadline. Front pages from abroad show the international press is transfixed too. The news has reached Courtney Love, who is devastated. A petition calling for parliament not to be prorogued has now reached more than 1.1m signatures, perhaps you know this, perhaps you\u2019ve signed it. Any petition that receives more than 100,000 signatures is automatically qualified to be debated by parliament, which feels a little ironic in the situation. If you\u2019d like to see where in the country people are most angry about this issue (or at least most willing to click on a petition), you can see it here at this handy map. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the day\u2019s political news. It was not a nightmare, you did not dream it, yesterday Boris Johnson\u2019s government sought and received approval from the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks from mid-September. The prime minister claimed there would be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, but as we know, not everyone shares this view. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, issued a furious statement from his holiday, saying he had not been consulted by the prime minister, and that \u201cthe move represents a constitutional outrage\u201d. \u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d he said. There were protests around the country yesterday and a petition calling for parliament not to be prorogued has now reached more than 1.1m signatures. Eyes are on Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who is expected to quit the party over differences with Johnson. I\u2019ll be shepherding us along for the first hour or so before handing the blog over to my esteemed colleague Matthew Weaver. Please do get in touch on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). We\u2019re not opening comments right now, but will do so later on. Who knows what the day will hold, except that we\u2019ll all be saying the word \u201cproroguing\u201d far more than we ever would have dreamed. Let\u2019s go!",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAbsolutely outrageous.\u201d \u201cNot a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century.\u201d \u201cA mad suggestion.\u201d The idea of suspending parliament to force through Brexit provoked unequivocal condemnation from senior Conservatives just weeks ago, with ministers falling over themselves to express their horror. Now, after Boris Johnson moved to prorogue the Commons for five weeks ahead of the UK\u2019s EU departure date of 31 October, his ministers\u2019 once-steely opposition has turned to a more tight-lipped approach. The Guardian hotfooted it to Whitehall in an attempt to get answers from ministers on their apparent U-turns, which follow on from strongly worded statements earlier in the summer. Nicky Morgan Proroguing parliament is clearly a mad suggestion\u201d \u2013 6 June I\u2019m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister\u201d \u2013 Thursday The newly appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Nicky Morgan, told the BBC\u2019s Question Time programme in June that proroguing parliament was \u201cclearly a mad suggestion\u201d. \u201cYou cannot say you are going to take back control \u2026 and then go: \u2018Oh, by the way, we are just going to shut parliament down for a couple of months, so we are just going to drift out on a no deal,\u2019\u201d she said. But on Thursday morning, when the Guardian spotted Morgan strolling past the gates of Downing Street, it was a different story. Asked to clarify her position on proroguing parliament given her previous opposition, she said: \u201cI\u2019m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister.\u201d Pressed again on whether she still harboured doubts about the plan as the Guardian struggled to keep pace with her along Parliament Street, she repeated firmly: \u201cI support the prime minister.\u201d When asked to respond to critics\u2019 suggestion that proroguing parliament represented an affront to democracy, she said nothing and walked away. Matt Hancock Prorogation would mean the end of the Conservative party\u201d \u2013 6 June Morning, how are you? Sorry. How are you?\u201d \u2013 Thursday The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was once a vigorous opponent of the concept of prorogation, so much so that he wrote a letter during the Tory leadership campaign pledging to rule out the option and urging other candidates to do the same. \u201cTo suspend parliament explicitly to pursue a course of action against its wishes is not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century,\u201d he wrote. The letter, dated 6 June, added: \u201cA policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.\u201d Giving a speech during the campaign four days later, Hancock referenced war veterans saying that proroguing parliament would go against \u201ceverything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd I will not have it.\u201d Now, apparently, he will. Asked by the Guardian to clarify whether his position had changed, his spokesman failed to comment. Caught by reporters earlier in the day outside his house, he dodged their questions and hurried to his car. \u201cMorning, how are you?\u201d he replied. \u201cSorry. How are you?\u201d Michael Gove It would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy\u201d \u2013 9 June Parliamentarians will have plenty of time to debate Brexit\u201d \u2013 Wednesday Leave-supporting Michael Gove has also spoken out against suspending parliament. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show in early June: \u201cProroguing parliament in order to try and get no deal through, I think would be wrong.\u201d Gove, appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by Johnson last month, added: \u201cI think it would be wrong for many reasons.

He did not do much to allay their fears, it seems. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB Union\u2019s manufacturing section, labelled the government\u2019s approach \u201clastminute.com\u201d. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, condemned proroguing parliament, calling it an outrage and a silencing mechanism.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament is an unlawful abuse of power, a Scottish court has heard in the first of three legal challenges.</p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, told a court in Edinburgh that the prime minister had trampled on more than 400 years of constitutional law by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament solely for political gain.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a constitution ruled by law,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Doherty in the court of session, urging him to issue an interdict \u2013 a Scottish court order equivalent to an injunction \u2013 forcing the UK government to quash the prorogation order signed by the Queen on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what a constitutional monarchy means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not some form of autocracy or divine right or that \u2018the king can do no wrong\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, argued that the application was invalid and itself unlawful. He said prorogation was clearly a policy decision properly within the powers of a prime minister.</p> <p>Dunlop said the Queen clearly had the legal authority to suspend parliament if requested by a government, under the crown prerogative. He said the courts had no power to interfere. \u201cIt\u2019s the act of the sovereign herself exercising a privilege which is hers alone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The hearing on Thursday morning was arranged at short notice in response to Johnson\u2019s decision on Wednesday to suspend parliament early next month. Two other legal challenges were urgently filed in Belfast and London on Thursday.</p> <p>Doherty said he would rule on the application on Friday morning. If it is upheld, O\u2019Neill believes Johnson will be forced to reverse the decision to prorogue parliament pending an appeal.</p> <p>The high court in Belfast held a hearing for an emergency injunction brought by Raymond McCord, a victims\u2019 rights campaigner who has argued that a no-deal Brexit would be a breach of the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeking an urgent injunction to compel Johnson to reverse his advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament,\u201d McCord\u2019s lawyer, Ciaran O\u2019Hare, said after the 20-minute hearing.</p> <p>Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, interrupted his summer holiday to hear the prima facie arguments. He instructed O\u2019Hare and the government\u2019s defence barrister to return on Friday at 10am for a full hearing with expanded legal arguments.</p> <p>In London, Gina Miller, the campaigner who mounted a successful legal challenge in 2016 to Theresa May\u2019s attempts to use crown prerogative powers to invoke article 50, lodged papers seeking a judicial review, which is expected to be heard next week.</p> <p>Whichever side loses in the parallel cases is expected to appeal immediately, and the cases will soon be heard by the supreme court, potentially grouped together. It is the first time in UK legal history the Queen\u2019s decision to prorogue a Westminster parliament has been challenged in court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/updated-brexitflowchart/giv-3902C6dUxWQBSwSG/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/updated-brexitflowchart/giv-3902C6dUxWQBSwSG/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>O\u2019Neill told the court of session that Johnson was suspending parliament solely to prevent MPs from properly debating and voting on his Brexit strategy before 31 October, sabotaging parliament\u2019s constitutional role. That was \u201cunlawful, unwarranted and unconstitutional,\u201d he said.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill came close to calling Johnson a liar for claiming Westminster would have enough time to debate a no-deal Brexit. \u201cHe knows it is wrong and he says it anyway,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThat\u2019s what one might call a lie.\u201d</p> <p>He said the prorogation also meant Johnson would breach the supreme court ruling in the Miller case that it was unlawful for a government to change or remove a citizen\u2019s legal rights under EU law without an act of parliament. He said the court had a duty to step in to ensure the government was properly accountable.</p> <p>McCord\u2019s solicitors said Johnson\u2019s motive was to frustrate attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit and that he had prorogued parliament \u201cwithout democratic intent\u201d.</p> <p>McCord\u2019s case had been due to be heard on 16 September, but was brought forward after his solicitors rushed in an application for an immediate injunction following Johnson\u2019s decision.</p> <p>Miller has also lodged an urgent application for a judicial review over the prorogation, arguing Johnson\u2019s move was a brazen attempt to prevent the government from being held accountable by parliament.</p> <p>Her case will be advocated in court by Lord David Pannick QC, widely regarded as one of the leading judicial review barristers in the country.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament is an unlawful abuse of power, a Scottish court has heard in the first of three legal challenges. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, told a court in Edinburgh that the prime minister had trampled on more than 400 years of constitutional law by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament solely for political gain. \u201cWe have a constitution ruled by law,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Doherty in the court of session, urging him to issue an interdict \u2013 a Scottish court order equivalent to an injunction \u2013 forcing the UK government to quash the prorogation order signed by the Queen on Wednesday. \u201cThat is what a constitutional monarchy means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not some form of autocracy or divine right or that \u2018the king can do no wrong\u2019.\u201d The UK government\u2019s lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, argued that the application was invalid and itself unlawful. He said prorogation was clearly a policy decision properly within the powers of a prime minister. Dunlop said the Queen clearly had the legal authority to suspend parliament if requested by a government, under the crown prerogative. He said the courts had no power to interfere. \u201cIt\u2019s the act of the sovereign herself exercising a privilege which is hers alone,\u201d he said. The hearing on Thursday morning was arranged at short notice in response to Johnson\u2019s decision on Wednesday to suspend parliament early next month. Two other legal challenges were urgently filed in Belfast and London on Thursday. Doherty said he would rule on the application on Friday morning. If it is upheld, O\u2019Neill believes Johnson will be forced to reverse the decision to prorogue parliament pending an appeal. The high court in Belfast held a hearing for an emergency injunction brought by Raymond McCord, a victims\u2019 rights campaigner who has argued that a no-deal Brexit would be a breach of the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe are seeking an urgent injunction to compel Johnson to reverse his advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament,\u201d McCord\u2019s lawyer, Ciaran O\u2019Hare, said after the 20-minute hearing. Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, interrupted his summer holiday to hear the prima facie arguments. He instructed O\u2019Hare and the government\u2019s defence barrister to return on Friday at 10am for a full hearing with expanded legal arguments. In London, Gina Miller, the campaigner who mounted a successful legal challenge in 2016 to Theresa May\u2019s attempts to use crown prerogative powers to invoke article 50, lodged papers seeking a judicial review, which is expected to be heard next week. Whichever side loses in the parallel cases is expected to appeal immediately, and the cases will soon be heard by the supreme court, potentially grouped together. It is the first time in UK legal history the Queen\u2019s decision to prorogue a Westminster parliament has been challenged in court. O\u2019Neill told the court of session that Johnson was suspending parliament solely to prevent MPs from properly debating and voting on his Brexit strategy before 31 October, sabotaging parliament\u2019s constitutional role. That was \u201cunlawful, unwarranted and unconstitutional,\u201d he said. O\u2019Neill came close to calling Johnson a liar for claiming Westminster would have enough time to debate a no-deal Brexit. \u201cHe knows it is wrong and he says it anyway,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThat\u2019s what one might call a lie.\u201d He said the prorogation also meant Johnson would breach the supreme court ruling in the Miller case that it was unlawful for a government to change or remove a citizen\u2019s legal rights under EU law without an act of parliament. He said the court had a duty to step in to ensure the government was properly accountable. McCord\u2019s solicitors said Johnson\u2019s motive was to frustrate attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit and that he had prorogued parliament \u201cwithout democratic intent\u201d. McCord\u2019s case had been due to be heard on 16 September, but was brought forward after his solicitors rushed in an application for an immediate injunction following Johnson\u2019s decision. Miller has also lodged an urgent application for a judicial review over the prorogation, arguing Johnson\u2019s move was a brazen attempt to prevent the government from being held accountable by parliament. Her case will be advocated in court by Lord David Pannick QC, widely regarded as one of the leading judicial review barristers in the country.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s revived plans for a $2tn mega-listing of its state oil company may rule out the London Stock Exchange amid Britain\u2019s rising political uncertainty, according to reports. Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company, may instead look to Japan\u2019s Tokyo stock exchange to host the second phase of what would be the biggest public offering in history. The oil giant\u2019s advisers had originally favoured an international stock market debut in either London or Hong Kong but political instability has reduced their appeal, according to the Wall Street Journal. The report said people familiar with Saudi Aramco\u2019s plans expect the company to split the listing into two stages; the first on the Saudi stock exchange later this year, and the second in 2020 or 2021. The decision to rule out London and Hong Kong would prove a major blow to both financial centres, which have courted the mega-float since it was first announced in early 2016. Last year the UK\u2019s City watchdog changed its listing rules, in a move widely viewed as a move designed to encourage Aramco to list in London. The plan to sell 5% of the oil giant\u2019s stock was originally expected in 2018, but a sluggish oil market recovery and fierce debate over how much to raise, and where, has stalled the plan. The IPO was dealt another blow in October last year following international outcry over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, reignited plans for the float earlier this summer after announcing that officials were working to list the company within the next two years. Aramco announced earlier this month, in its first investor call, that it is ready for the listing whenever its shareholders agreed market conditions were \u201coptimal\u201d. The company reported profits of $46.9bn for the first half of this year, down from $53.2bn in the first half of last year owing to lower oil prices. The earnings were still well ahead of the world\u2019s six biggest listed oil companies combined. The once secretive oil behemoth opened its books to international investors for the first time last year ahead of a record-breaking sovereign bond market debut. The debt issuance raised $12bn following overwhelming interest from major international investors. The company is taking steps to increase its transparency as part of the Saudi government\u2019s push to open the country to international investment, and diversify its economy beyond its enormous oil reserves.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If the EU does agree a new deal, Johnson would have a few days for MPs to debate and agree to it.

      "bodyText": "The leader of the European parliament has criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, as some Brussels insiders weigh up the increased risk of a no-deal Brexit. David Sassoli, an Italian socialist MEP who was elected as president of the parliament in July, tweeted: \u201cListening to parliaments is always good for democracy. For this reason, it is better to keep them open.\u201d While MEPs have been quick to condemn Johnson\u2019s decision \u2013 described by the European parliament\u2019s coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, as \u201csinister\u201d \u2013 EU leaders who are driving the Brexit agenda have stayed silent. European leaders nearly always avoid commenting on domestic politics of other countries. Some former leaders were less restrained. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, tweeted: \u201cMakes me really sad to see what Brexit is doing to one of the great democracies of our time. Please, stay calm and use common sense.\u201d The EU wants to avoid getting drawn into Johnson\u2019s political game: officials do not want to hand out Brexit concessions that could be seen as rewarding games of chicken, blocking debate or steamrollering parliament. While some see a small window opening for a deal, many Brussels sources are pessimistic about finding alternatives to the Irish backstop that will respect the EU\u2019s red lines and pass parliament in a matter of days. The backstop is a fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland that would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. \u201cIf there were brilliant solutions we would have found them a year ago,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201c[Prorogation] certainly increases the uncertainty; it just shows that until the very last moment we don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d Ireland is increasingly nervous that it could be betrayed by the EU in the race for a last-minute deal, according to the Irish Times, which recounted a conversation between Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, and the French prime minister, Edouard Philippe. \u201c[Coveney] began his conversation with Mr Philippe by saying: \u2018We are conscious of the fact that Irish-specific issues are preventing a deal between the EU and the UK, and Ireland doesn\u2019t want to be the problem here.\u2019 \u201cMr Philippe interrupted him and said: \u2018Look, you don\u2019t need to worry about this. This is not just an Irish problem. It\u2019s an EU problem and we are in it together.\u2019\u201d For commentators in Europe\u2019s leading newspapers, several metaphors predominated: Johnson\u2019s move was described as a game of poker, or a coup. The leading Dutch daily Volksrant described the suspension of parliament as \u201cJohnson\u2019s power grab\u201d, also calling it a \u201ca sly move\u201d.

Germany\u2019s left-leaning Taz published a striking front page with MPs sitting on the green benches with red crosses over their mouths. In an editorial headlined \u201cPlaying dirty\u201d, Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said that while Johnson\u2019s move may have been legal, it nonetheless constituted a \u201csevere blow to the parliamentary system of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious democracies\u201d.

He said MPs would have \u201cample\u201d time to debate Brexit when the prorogued parliament returns on 14 October, 17 days shy of the exit date. His move is being widely seen as an attempt to stop MPs having a say in how Brexit plays out. </p> \n<h2>What has the reaction been like?</h2> \n<p>Apoplectic to say the least. The Commons speaker, John Bercow, said it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/boris-johnsons-move-to-prorogue-parliament-a-constitutional-outrage-says-speaker\">\u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d</a> aimed at preventing MPs from debating Brexit. The former head of the civil service Robert Kerslake said public servants should consider putting the \u201cstewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day\u201d.</p> \n<h2>What has Jeremy Corbyn said about it?</h2> \n<p>The Labour leader has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/mps-react-with-fury-to-boris-johnsons-plan-to-suspend-parliament\">demanded a meeting with the Queen</a>, saying the monarchy was being set directly against the wishes of the majority of MPs in the House of Commons. The feeling is that stopping the electorate, through their elected MPs, from having their say on Brexit is, at best, a bad look; at worst, unconstitutional.</p> \n<h2>Haven\u2019t Tory cabinet ministers previously opposed suspending parliament?</h2> \n<p>Yes, and quite vigorously. During the recent Conservative party leadership contest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/mad-suggestion-how-tory-ministers-once-viewed-call-to-prorogue-parliament\">several came out staunchly against it</a>, which will make for interesting discussions around the cabinet table now. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said in June that suspending parliament \u201cgoes against everything those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for \u2013 and I will not have it\u201d and that was \u201cnot a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century\u201d. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, said it was an \u201cabsolutely outrageous idea\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tories opposing a no-deal Brexit are understandably unhappy about the suspension of parliament. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, called it a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Rory Stewart \u2013 who stood for leader of the party against Johnson \u2013 said: \u201cWe can do much better.\u201d He has previously said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/rory-stewart-outlines-alternative-parliament-to-stop-no-deal-brexit\">he would set up an alternative parliament, </a>should the House of Commons be suspended.</p> \n<h2>Can the proroguing be reversed?</h2> \n<p>Good question. Proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. The Conservative MP (and former attorney general) Dominic Grieve said he and others were working on a plan to organise a \u201chumble address\u201d, which is a direct call from the Commons to the Queen.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think parliament can stop prorogation, although there may be something that parliament can do to register its deep concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A humble address is binding and can be used by the opposition to express its strength of feeling to the government or request that it hand over documents. It has rarely been deployed in the past 200 years but Labour successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/02/brexit-impact-documents-david-davis-start-talks-handover\">used it in 2017</a> to make a direct appeal to the Queen that the government make public its economic impact assessments of Brexit.</p> \n<p>In the meantime a public petition against parliament\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/petition-stop-proroguing-parliament\">suspension had gathered more than a million signatures</a> by Wednesday night. It is the fastest-growing parliamentary petition since more than 6 million people signed a statement <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584\">calling for article 50 \u2013 the mechanism for leaving the EU \u2013 to be revoked</a> earlier this year.</p> \n<h2>What happens now?</h2> \n<p>Rebel MPs from across the political spectrum are gearing up for a historic clash when parliament resumes on 3 September. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\">Corbyn backed cross-party plans</a> to hold off on a vote of no confidence in order to prioritise attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. But by drastically reducing the parliamentary time available, prorogation has made a no-confidence vote more likely, possibly leading to a general election in October. </p>",

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said in June that suspending parliament \u201cgoes against everything those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for \u2013 and I will not have it\u201d and that was \u201cnot a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century\u201d. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, said it was an \u201cabsolutely outrageous idea\u201d. Tories opposing a no-deal Brexit are understandably unhappy about the suspension of parliament. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, called it a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Rory Stewart \u2013 who stood for leader of the party against Johnson \u2013 said: \u201cWe can do much better.\u201d He has previously said he would set up an alternative parliament, should the House of Commons be suspended. Can the proroguing be reversed? Good question. Proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. The Conservative MP (and former attorney general) Dominic Grieve said he and others were working on a plan to organise a \u201chumble address\u201d, which is a direct call from the Commons to the Queen. \u201cI don\u2019t think parliament can stop prorogation, although there may be something that parliament can do to register its deep concern,\u201d he said. A humble address is binding and can be used by the opposition to express its strength of feeling to the government or request that it hand over documents. It has rarely been deployed in the past 200 years but Labour successfully used it in 2017 to make a direct appeal to the Queen that the government make public its economic impact assessments of Brexit. In the meantime a public petition against parliament\u2019s suspension had gathered more than a million signatures by Wednesday night. It is the fastest-growing parliamentary petition since more than 6 million people signed a statement calling for article 50 \u2013 the mechanism for leaving the EU \u2013 to be revoked earlier this year. What happens now? Rebel MPs from across the political spectrum are gearing up for a historic clash when parliament resumes on 3 September. On Wednesday, Corbyn backed cross-party plans to hold off on a vote of no confidence in order to prioritise attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. But by drastically reducing the parliamentary time available, prorogation has made a no-confidence vote more likely, possibly leading to a general election in October.",
