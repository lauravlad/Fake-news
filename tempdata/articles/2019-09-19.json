      "body": "<p>Parliament should be allowed to reassemble next week, the supreme court has been urged, as the legal battle over Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension threatened to escalate into a constitutional crisis over who has authority to recall MPs and peers.</p> \n<p>At the end of the third and final day of an emergency hearing over the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend debates, the 11 justices were asked to encourage the Speakers of the Commons and Lords to reconvene the parliamentary session.</p> \n<p>In his closing submissions, Lord Pannick QC, representing the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, said that if the supreme court found that Johnson had acted unlawfully but he declined to end the suspension of parliament then \u201cin those circumstances we believe it would be open to the Speaker and Lord Speaker to reassemble parliament \u2026 as soon as possible next week\u201d.</p> \n<p>But government lawyers delivered a defiant legal note to the court in which they asserted that the prime minister could legitimately suspend parliament again even if the supreme court ruled that the prorogation had been unlawful. It stated: \u201cDepending on the court\u2019s reasoning it would still either be open or not open to the prime minister to consider a further prorogation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lord Keen QC, representing the government, cautioned the justices that the English and Scottish applicants in the appeal \u201cwere inviting the court into forbidden territory\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Parliament should be allowed to reassemble next week, the supreme court has been urged, as the legal battle over Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension threatened to escalate into a constitutional crisis over who has authority to recall MPs and peers. At the end of the third and final day of an emergency hearing over the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend debates, the 11 justices were asked to encourage the Speakers of the Commons and Lords to reconvene the parliamentary session. In his closing submissions, Lord Pannick QC, representing the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, said that if the supreme court found that Johnson had acted unlawfully but he declined to end the suspension of parliament then \u201cin those circumstances we believe it would be open to the Speaker and Lord Speaker to reassemble parliament \u2026 as soon as possible next week\u201d. But government lawyers delivered a defiant legal note to the court in which they asserted that the prime minister could legitimately suspend parliament again even if the supreme court ruled that the prorogation had been unlawful. It stated: \u201cDepending on the court\u2019s reasoning it would still either be open or not open to the prime minister to consider a further prorogation.\u201d Lord Keen QC, representing the government, cautioned the justices that the English and Scottish applicants in the appeal \u201cwere inviting the court into forbidden territory\u201d. The decision to prorogue was political and not open to challenge in the courts, he declared. The president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, promised that the court would deliver its ruling early next week. She added: \u201cI must repeat this case is not about when and on what terms the UK leaves the EU. We are solely concerned with the lawfulness [of prorogation].\u201d The final afternoon saw a rapid sequence of exchanges between the justices, Keen and Pannick that exposed the lack of consensus over a pivotal process in the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution \u2013 particularly, who has the power to summon parliament back. In his closing submissions, Keen said the judges should decline to become involved. \u201cWhether it is dissolution or prorogation [of parliament], this is forbidden territory \u2026 It is a matter between the executive and parliament. \u201cThe applicants and petitioners are inviting the court into forbidden territory and an ill-defined minefield that the courts are not properly equipped to deal with.\u201d The court should read the \u201cauthentic and contemporaneous documents\u201d that had been prepared for the case, Keen said. He dismissed the \u201cdiscourteous and incendiary language\u201d deployed by the barrister for the Scottish applicants, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, who accused the government of lying. Even if the supreme court found Johnson\u2019s advice had been unlawful, Keen maintained, the court should then leave it to the executive and parliament to respond. That suggestion prompted one justice, Lord Hodge, to ask how parliament could respond if it was prorogued and \u201cwouldn\u2019t be there\u201d. Another justice, Lord Kerr, suggested that if the court found that Johnson\u2019s advice to prorogue had been unlawful that would consequently mean the prorogation instructions were also unlawful. The Scottish appeal court has already ruled that the prorogation is \u201cnull and void\u201d. The question of what \u201crelief\u201d or \u201cremedy\u201d the courts should deliver if they find against the prime minister is complicated by the courts\u2019 reluctance to be seen to be trespassing on what many consider to be parliamentary privileges. Pannick told the justices: \u201cWe would expect, in the light of a declaration [of unlawfulness], that the prime minister ensures that parliament resumes as soon as possible next week \u2026 We would ask that the court give an indication if it thinks it appropriate what it expects next week so that parliament will meet to decide what happens next.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt may be that the [Commons] Speaker and Lord Speaker will take action to ensure that parliament reopens as soon as possible next week and then parliament can debate and will decide exactly how it wishes to proceed.\u201d Earlier Lord Garnier QC, a Conservative former solicitor general who intervened in the case on behalf of Sir John Major, accused Downing Street of releasing \u201cmisleading\u201d statements about prorogation of parliament and publishing excuses for Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of the Commons that \u201care not the true reasons\u201d. The extraordinary clash of evidence from two Conservative prime ministers came as the court grappled with questions involving the trustworthiness of Johnson\u2019s newly appointed administration. The Downing Street press office, Garnier told the court, had been \u201cmisleading\u201d in releasing announcements during the summer that initially suggested that reports of an extended prorogation were \u201centirely false\u201d. \u201cIts effect was plainly to mislead,\u201d Garnier added. As to the cabinet minutes, which were subsequently published, Garnier said, they \u201care not the true reasons\u201d. The cabinet documents suggested that the need for a long suspension was to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech and a break for the conference season. In submissions to the high court earlier this month, Garnier obliquely compared Johnson to an estate agent, citing a 2009 New Zealand case of Premium Real Estate involving a salesman who misrepresented a buyer as a genuine purchaser when in fact they wanted to resell the property for a quick profit. \u201cIt could hardly be suggested that the duties of the prime minister to the monarch are less than those of an estate agent to a homeowner,\u201d Garnier noted. \u201cAccordingly, if the court is satisfied that the prime minister\u2019s decision was materially influenced by something other than the stated justification, that decision must be unlawful, irrespective of whether the unstated justification was itself legally impermissible.\u201d The 11 justices now begin a behind-the-scenes debate among themselves to decide on their judgment.

Her thinking may have been influenced by the knowledge that, if the court were to find against the government, a lot would depend on exactly what it said about what should happen next. This is not at all straightforward because ...</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has signalled that, even if he loses the case, he does not want to reconvene parliament before 14 October - which is when prorogation was originally due to end. </strong>In<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/832777/R__Miller__v._PM_-_Note_on_Relief__002_.pdf\"> a document submitted to the court (pdf),</a> the government has set out three options as to what might happen if Johnson were to lose. It says one option would be for Johnson to make a fresh, lawful prorogation decision, which could also delay the return of parliament until 14 October. The document acknowledges that the court order Johnson to get parliament reconvened sooner. But, in a clear hint that it wants the court to reject this option, it says that this would have \u201cvery serious practical consequences\u201d that would, it implies, inconvenience the Queen and disrupt the security arrangements being put in place for 14 October. The document says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Queen\u2019s speech, and the state opening of parliament which accompanies it, is a significant political, constitutional and ceremonial occasion, which ordinarily involves the sovereign attending in person. As the court will be well aware, the proper preparations for a Queen\u2019s speech are a matter of thoroughgoing importance, including in relation to the content of that speech. Extensive arrangements would have to be made, including as to security, to enable this to occur. These considerations lead to the need for any order that the court makes, if necessary, to allow for these steps relating to the earlier meeting of parliament to occur in an orderly fashion. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Lord Pannick QC, the lawyer representing Gina Miller, has told the court that if it decides prorogation was unlawful, parliament should reconvene next week.</strong> He suggested that the Speaker, John Bercow, and the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler (Bercow\u2019s equivalent in the House of Lords) could decide to recall parliament themselves. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/sep/19/brexit-news-latest-supreme-court-john-major-tells-supreme-court-it-would-be-naive-to-believe-boris-johnsons-prorogation-claims-live-news?page=with:block-5d838a358f0834740f3be552#block-5d838a358f0834740f3be552\">3.08pm.) </a>Several judges questioned whether that process would be legally watertight. Their comments were taken by some observers as a sign that the court is minded to find against the government. The questions also reflect the fact that there is some uncertainty as to what a declaration that prorogation was unlawful would actually mean, and whether it would amount to saying that prorogation never happened and parliament remained in session anyway. The government argues that, if the court rules prorogation was unlawful, it would be up to the PM to reconvene parliament, by making a request to the Queen under the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Lord Keen, the advocate general for Scotland who was representing the government, has told the court that it is not equipped to decide on whether prorogation was right or wrong. </strong>This was a political matter, not a matter for the courts, he said. It was \u201cforbidden territory\u201d for the court, he said.

At least some voters are impressed. This morning <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-starts-to-reverse-tony-blairs-clause-4-reforms-j9lh2tnfg\">a YouGov poll in the Times (paywall)</a> puts the Lib Dems on 23%, up four points from the previous week and ahead of Labour, which is down two points on 21%. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ed453cc394b281c984b59f3a4630082129ad030\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ed453cc394b281c984b59f3a4630082129ad030/0_0_749_550/500.jpg\" alt=\"YouGov poll\" width=\"500\" height=\"367\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouGov poll</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Times</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And in an interview on the Today programme this morning, to mark John Humphrys final day as presenter, the former Labour prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong> said the Lib Dems were looking increasingly serious as a political option. Blair said that the two-party system might collapse \u201cif it becomes clear that the two main parties have moved so far away from the centre that the gap in the centre has to be filled in order to be representative of the state of opinion\u201d. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the things that troubles me most about politics today is I can\u2019t tell you the number of young people, in the 20s and 30s, really intelligent young people, politically committed, - a) they\u2019ve got no home and b) they look at the state of the two main parties and say: \u2018I couldn\u2019t join either of them.\u2019</p> \n   <p>It doesn\u2019t matter what I say, what anyone else says. You only have to look at the Liberal Democrats now and their party conference. For the first time in long time, they are looking a much more serious group of people. Why is that? Because people have come from the Labour party, come from the Conservative party, and they have got a coherent argument. If I was the two main parties at the moment, I would worry about that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the Lib Dem argument was one that he agreed with, Blair replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is an argument I agree with. I\u2019m very tribally and deeply attached to the Labour party. But if over a long period of time someone from outside your political party is making an argument you think is more sensible, it starts to pull you in the opposite direction.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Humphrys then asked if Blair was going over to the Lib Dems. But Blair would not give him a scoop on his final day in the office. He replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, you shouldn\u2019t read that into it. It just suggests a deep level of frustration about where the Labour party is and where the Conservative party has gone to.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>If Blair is not joining the Lib Dems, what about <strong>Tom Watson</strong>, Labour\u2019s deputy leader? That sounds like a daft proposition, but the New Statesman\u2019s <strong>George Eaton</strong> has just published <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/what-does-tom-watson-want\">a very long and fascinating profile of Watson</a> that includes this nugget.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Watson has long been viewed as one of Labour\u2019s most tribal politicians. But [former Labour MP Michael] Dugher, one of his closest friends, suggests that he could yet join his past enemies: the Liberal Democrats. \u201cIf you\u2019d said to me two years ago, would Tom ever countenance doing anything with the Lib Dems, I would have said \u2018no chance\u2019.

More than 20 years on Major finally has the chance to get his own back because we are going to witness the extraordinary spectacle of a former Conservative prime minister going to court to argue that the current Conservative prime minister has not been telling the truth. The word extraordinary is cropping up rather frequently in Brexit coverage at the moment, but it is very hard to think of a precedent for this.</p> \n  <p>Major will not actually be addressing the court himself. The supreme court is an appeal court, and it does not take evidence from witnesses. But Edward Garnier QC, now Lord Garnier, a former Tory solicitor general, will be making a submission on his behalf. It is not clear yet whether or not Major himself will be in court to listen to the proceedings.</p> \n  <p>The supreme court has overnight published <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/written-case-for-sir-john-major.pdf\">Major\u2019s 10-page submission (pdf)</a> on its website. Drafted by Garnier and two legal colleagues, it argues, on behalf of Major, that the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament should be justiciable - ie, subject to legal challenge; the government says it shouldn\u2019t, because this is beyond the remit of the courts \u2013 and that Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue was at least \u201csubstantially motivated\u201d by the desire to limit the chances for MPs to interfere with Brexit.</p> \n  <p>The government has refused to accept that this was Johnson\u2019s motive. But Major argues in his submission that the supreme court would be \u201cnaive\u201d to believe him. Referring to the fact that the government only produced a limited number of documents about how the prorogation decision was taken, and not a proper witness statement saying the move was not motivated by the desire to silence parliament, the submission says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The current factual picture, on the material which is available and with regard to the absence of evidence which ought to be available but has not been provided, is deeply concerning. The court is under no obligation to approach this case on the artificially na\u00efve basis that the handful of disclosed documents, the contents of which nobody has been prepared to verify with a statement of truth, should nevertheless be assumed to be entirely accurate and complete when even members of the cabinet do not appear to believe them ... It would also be wrong to proceed on that basis, because it would mean that the real issue that has arisen on the facts would not be resolved.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day at the supreme court, where the hearing starts at 10.30am.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10.30am: </em>James Mure QC speaks on behalf of the Scottish government.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Ronan Lavery QC speaks on behalf of Raymond McCord, who launched a legal challenge against a no-deal Brexit in Northern Ireland.</p> \n  <p><em>11.40am:</em> Mike Fordham QC speaks on behalf of the Welsh government.</p> \n  <p><em>12.10pm: </em>Lord Garnier QC speaks on behalf of Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister.</p> \n  <p><em>2pm:</em> Lord Keen QC sums up for the government.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Lord Pannick sums up for Gina Miller</p> \n  <p>And here are other items on the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Boris Johnson holds a meeting with military service chiefs in Downing Street.</p> \n  <p>Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is in Dublin today for a meeting with his Irish counterpart, Paschal Donohoe.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has refused to rule out suspending parliament for a second time. (See 5.53pm.) He was speaking as a three-day supreme court hearing held to determine whether the current suspension (prorogation) is lawful came to an end. Lady Hale, president of the court, said it hopes to publish a decision early next week. In the final session Lord Pannick QC, representing Gina Miller, said that if the government lost parliament should reconvene next week, with the Speaker and Lord Speaker summoning MPs and peers back to work. See 4.57pm for a full summary of the day\u2019s events in court. Downing Street has refused to commit to tabling its Brexit plans for replacing the Irish backstop within two weeks, branding it an \u201cartificial deadline\u201d and agreeing only to share informal \u201cnon-papers\u201d on its preferred solutions. Irish premier Leo Varadkar says he will try to get a deal on Brexit when he meets Boris Johnson in New York next week. \u201cWe were in touch today. I\u2019m going to meet him next week in New York and try to get a deal,\u201d he said. The leaders will both be attending the UN Climate Action Summit. Brexit uncertainty and the slowdown in global growth has weakened the economy and made an interest rate cut more likely, the Bank of England has said. A no-deal Brexit will slice almost 3% from Britain\u2019s economic growth over the next three years compared with just 0.6% from the rest of the EU, according to the OECD\u2019s latest health check of the global economy. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has implied the Queen should refuse to be drawn into a future vote on Scottish independence after David Cameron admitted he asked the monarch to intervene in 2014. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Speaking to reporters on his visit to Wiltshire, Boris Johnson refused to rule out proroguing parliament a second time if he lost the supreme court case. Asked to rule out this option, he replied: I have the greatest respect for the judiciary in this country. The best thing I can say at the moment whilst their deliberations are continuing is that obviously I agree very much with the master of the rolls and the lord chief justice and others who found in our favour the other day. I will wait to see what transpires. Johnson also claimed that the government was making progress in the Brexit talks. He told reporters: I don\u2019t want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress ... You heard Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday say that he doesn\u2019t have any emotional attachment to the backstop. Now that is progress - they weren\u2019t saying that a month ago. But let\u2019s see where we get. It\u2019s vital, whatever happens, that we prepare for no deal. Boris Johnson has told British troops being deployed to Mali that joining a peacekeeping mission in the area was a \u201cgood idea\u201d in the hope that the French would be \u201cnice to us\u201d. As the Press Association reports, Johnson was meeting with soldiers from the British Army at the Salisbury Plain training zone in Wiltshire, to see how military spending by the government was being implemented. After learning some were to be deployed to Mali as part of efforts by the United Nations in the African country, Johnson referred to the French President Emmanuel Macron, the Press Association reports. \u201cMali, that was the promise we made to the French,\u201d Johnson said. It was a very good idea in the hope that they would be nice to us ... We\u2019re waiting to see how that works out, Monsieur Macron. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin The Scottish government has scrapped one of its headline policies, its controversial \u201cnamed person\u201d scheme, only a few days after bowing to opposition demands for an inquiry into two botched hospital projects. Its sharp reversals in two key areas on which the Scottish National party government was refusing to budge until now suggests the SNP is shoring up its policy programme in preparation for a general election. The named person scheme, a programme where every child had a designated adult such as a headteacher to safeguard their welfare, has been dubbed a \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d by critics, partly since families might have no idea they were under scrutiny. The Scottish government went all the way to the UK supreme court to defend the policy, where judges said its aim was benign but it breached the right to privacy and family life under the European convention on human rights. It was due to be introduced three years ago. John Swinney, the education secretary, told Holyrood he had now scrapped it entirely. Two days ago, Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, announced an independent public inquiry into the handling of contracts to build the Queen Elizabeth super-hospital in Glasgow, where two children died earlier this year, and the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children, which will open several years late next year. With both measures, the temporary pain of a climbdown neutralises two potentially damaging lines of opposition attack in an election. Here are the main points from today\u2019s supreme court hearing in the case that will determine whether or not Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was lawful. Today was the last day of a three-day hearing. You can read Tuesday\u2019s highlights here, and Wednesday\u2019s highlights here and here. Lady Hale, president of the court, has said the court hopes to publish its decision \u201cearly next week\u201d. As the case concluded, Hale said: \u201cWe hope to be able to publish our decision early next week.\u201d That implies that the court will produce a full written judgment next week - rather than a preliminary decision, with reasons to follow. Her thinking may have been influenced by the knowledge that, if the court were to find against the government, a lot would depend on exactly what it said about what should happen next. This is not at all straightforward because ... Boris Johnson has signalled that, even if he loses the case, he does not want to reconvene parliament before 14 October - which is when prorogation was originally due to end. In a document submitted to the court (pdf), the government has set out three options as to what might happen if Johnson were to lose. It says one option would be for Johnson to make a fresh, lawful prorogation decision, which could also delay the return of parliament until 14 October. The document acknowledges that the court order Johnson to get parliament reconvened sooner. But, in a clear hint that it wants the court to reject this option, it says that this would have \u201cvery serious practical consequences\u201d that would, it implies, inconvenience the Queen and disrupt the security arrangements being put in place for 14 October. The document says: A Queen\u2019s speech, and the state opening of parliament which accompanies it, is a significant political, constitutional and ceremonial occasion, which ordinarily involves the sovereign attending in person. As the court will be well aware, the proper preparations for a Queen\u2019s speech are a matter of thoroughgoing importance, including in relation to the content of that speech. Extensive arrangements would have to be made, including as to security, to enable this to occur. These considerations lead to the need for any order that the court makes, if necessary, to allow for these steps relating to the earlier meeting of parliament to occur in an orderly fashion. Lord Pannick QC, the lawyer representing Gina Miller, has told the court that if it decides prorogation was unlawful, parliament should reconvene next week. He suggested that the Speaker, John Bercow, and the Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler (Bercow\u2019s equivalent in the House of Lords) could decide to recall parliament themselves. (See 3.08pm.) Several judges questioned whether that process would be legally watertight. Their comments were taken by some observers as a sign that the court is minded to find against the government. The questions also reflect the fact that there is some uncertainty as to what a declaration that prorogation was unlawful would actually mean, and whether it would amount to saying that prorogation never happened and parliament remained in session anyway. The government argues that, if the court rules prorogation was unlawful, it would be up to the PM to reconvene parliament, by making a request to the Queen under the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797. Lord Keen, the advocate general for Scotland who was representing the government, has told the court that it is not equipped to decide on whether prorogation was right or wrong. This was a political matter, not a matter for the courts, he said. It was \u201cforbidden territory\u201d for the court, he said. (See 2.17pm.) He went on: In my respectful submission, the applicants and the petitioners are inviting the court into forbidden territory and into what is essentially a minefield, an ill-defined minefield that the courts are not - with the greatest of respect - properly equipped to deal with. Downing Street put out \u201cmisleading\u201d statements about the prorogation of parliament and published excuses for Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of the Commons that are \u201cnot the true reasons\u201d, the supreme court has been told by a lawyer for the former prime minister John Major. Lady Hale, president of the supreme court, has stressed that the court is not deciding when or how Brexit might happen. In her final remarks, she said: I must repeat that this case is not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. The result of this case will not determine that. We are solely concerned with the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament on the dates in question. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has been in Dublin for the third meeting with his Irish counterpart, Paschal Donohoe, since he became chancellor eight weeks ago. It demonstrates that a direct channel of communication has been opened at a senior level in both governments despite the Brexit impasse. Javid, who pledged to throw millions of pounds at the border issue during the Tory party leadership campaign, and Donohoe both reiterated the importance of maintaining good Anglo-Irish relations irrespective of the Brexit outcome. Javid said: Whatever happens next year regardless of Brexit, it is essential that not only we maintain the strength of our relationship between our two great countries but we find ways to enhance that. Gina Miller left the supreme court to cheers and boos from the large crowd waiting outside the court building. As the Press Association reports, a small group of pro-Brexit protesters shouted \u201cshame on you\u201d and \u201ctraitor\u201d as she got into a waiting car. Here are three lawyers who regularly tweet who all think it is looking bad for the government in the supreme court case. From Joshua Rozenberg, the legal commentator Joanna Cherry says she would like the court to be as clear as possible about what should happen next if it finds against the government. She said parliament should sit again as soon as possible. At the moment parliament is not due to reconvene until three weeks on Monday \u2013 14 October. If parliament does return next week, that would clash with the Labour party conference, which starts this weekend and runs until Wednesday, and with the Conservative party conference, which starts next weekend and runs until Wednesday 2 October. It is normal for parliament to have a recess lasting three weeks in the autumn to allow time for the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative conferences. This has always been a point of contention with the SNP, who always hold their conference a bit later in the autumn and who do not get allocated a recess to ensure that their MPs don\u2019t have to be in two places at the same time. Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP who launched the legal challenge in Scotland, has just told BBC News that she was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the long discussion about remedies that the court had a few minutes ago, at the end of the hearing. (See 3.08pm and 3.11pm.) She says she is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d. The assumption is that the judges would not be taking an interest in the logistics of what might happen if they find against the government unless there is a good chance that they will. Lady Hale, president of the court, thanks the court staff and everyone else involved in the case. She stresses what she said at the opening of the case \u2013 that this hearing will not decide whether or how the UK leaves the EU. She says the court hopes to be able to publish its decision \u201cearly next week\u201d. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary shortly. Pannick refers to paragraph 17 of the government\u2019s remedies paper. The court may find that it would be unlawful for parliament to remain prorogued for any further period and that advising the sovereign to bring forward the meeting of parliament pursuant to the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 is the only option lawfully open to the prime minister. In that event, a declaration would be sufficient on the basis that the prime minister would comply with the terms of a judgment having that effect. It would of course be open to the court to consider whether to make a mandatory order or interlocutor requiring the prime minister so to advise Her Majesty. However, the grant of mandatory relief is in the discretion of the court, and that discretion is to be exercised having regard to the facts as they stand now and the practical consequences of any order. Pannick suggests this might be the best approach. Hale says the court will decide what to do. \u201cNone of this is easy,\u201d she says. Pannick says he hopes it will not be necessary to apply for further relief (ie, to go back to court again.) Lord Kerr puts it to Pannick that, if the advice to prorogue parliament was unlawful, any action taken upon that advice had no effect. Pannick says he assumes the court will give a judgment, and produce its reasons later (a standard court procedure). \u201cMake no assumptions,\u201d says Lady Hale. Pannick says he is asking for a declaration that the PM\u2019s advice was unlawful. But if the advice was unlawful, the order in council that followed proroguing parliament was also unlawful, he says. Lady Hale asks if the PM needs to do anything to ensure parliament meets next week. Pannick says it could be the case that the Speaker and the Lord Speaker could take action if the court were to rule prorogation unlawful. Then parliament could decide how it should proceed, he says. He says in his view that would be the best way forward. Parliament itself should decide what would happen next. Lord Kerr asks Pannick to clarify that, following a ruling from the supreme court, parliament could meet without the PM having to reconvene it. Pannick says that is his submission. MPs and peers would ask the Speaker and the Lord Speaker to reconvene parliament, so parliament could then decide. All that would stand in the way of that would be the PM refusing to take action. He says his argument is that, if the PM did not act, the Speaker and the Lord Speaker could act. Another judge says, even if the court ruled prorogation unlawful, it would still stand prorogued, unless there were a proclamation under the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 initiated by the PM. Pannick says his submission is that parliament could meet. He says that would be a proceeding of parliament, not subject to legal challenge. Another judge says the court needs a bit more clarity than that. Lady Hale, the president of the court, says the court will address this. She says: This court will produce an answer as soon as it humanly can. Here is the text of the government\u2019s remedy document (pdf), which has just been formally published on the government\u2019s website. Pannick says the court should make a declaration as soon as possible. He says, if the government loses, parliament should resume \u201cas soon as possible next week\u201d. Pannick says the supreme court should do in this case what it does in other public law cases \u2013 apply constitutional principles to the facts of the case. And then, giving the PM a \u201cbroad margin of discretion\u201d, the court should ask if the PM went beyond his powers. He says the court does not need to decide exactly what powers the PM does have over prorogation. He refers to the supreme court\u2019s ruling on employment tribunal fees in the Unison case. In that case the court ruled that the fees were excessive \u2013 without trying to determine at what level they should be set. Pannick says the government is arguing that this case is not justiciable, and that there is no element of constitutional law involved. But, Pannick says, he is arguing that constitutional law is engaged - and that the issue is justiciable. The executive, \u201cthe junior partner\u201d in the constitution, cannot claim an unfettered power to close down the legislature, the \u201csenior partner\u201d, he says. Pannick says he would invite the court to draw the inference that the length of the prorogation was influenced by the PM\u2019s desire to stop parliament obstructing his policies. There is no other rational reason for the length of the prorogation, he says. And he says that amounts to an improper purpose. Lord Pannick QC, who represents Gina Miller, is summing up the case against the government now. He says the government has not explained why it needed a five-week prorogation. He says the effect of the prorogation has been to shut down scrutiny of the government by parliament, particularly by select committees. He refers to what Boris Johnson said in a note disclosed to court about the September sitting just being a \u201crigmarole ... to show the public that MPs were earning their crust\u201d. He says Keen said a few minutes ago that the court should look at the government documents with an open mind. Pannick says he is asking them to do no more than that, and to think about what it means. In September bills were still going through parliament \u2013 including a courts bill that Lord Keen himself had been working on, Pannick says. This is what the Press Association has filed about the government\u2019s remedy document. (See 12.04pm and 12.27pm.) Parliament may remain suspended even if Boris Johnson loses at the supreme court. Documents submitted to the court on his behalf on Thursday reveal three possible scenarios in the event the 11 justices conclude the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. The first envisages a situation where the judges find it was unlawful, but their reasoning leaves open the possibility that parliament could be prorogued for the same length of time in a lawful manner. The document, submitted by Sir James Eadie QC and advocate general for Scotland Lord Keen, states: \u201cIn that scenario, the court would and could not make any order purporting to require parliament to be reconvened ... Parliament would remain prorogued.\u201d The second possible outcome is that the court could find the suspension was unlawful and that the recall of parliament before October 14 is the \u201conly option lawfully open to the prime minister\u201d. In this scenario, the document states Johnson would comply with the terms of the ruling, but that it would also be \u201copen to the court to consider whether to make a mandatory order\u201d. However, Johnson\u2019s lawyers urge the court to consider the \u201cvery serious practical consequences\u201d as the recall of parliament would require a meeting of the privy council and a new Queen\u2019s speech. The document continues: \u201cA Queen\u2019s speech, and the state opening of parliament which accompanies it, is a significant political, constitutional and ceremonial occasion, which ordinarily involves the sovereign attending in person. \u201cAs the court will be well aware, the proper preparations for a Queen\u2019s speech are a matter of thoroughgoing importance, including in relation to the content of that speech. \u201cExtensive arrangements would have to be made, including as to security, to enable this to occur. \u201cThese considerations lead to the need for any order that the court makes, if necessary, to allow for these steps relating to the earlier meeting of parliament to occur in an orderly fashion.\u201d In the third possible outcome, the document states the court could rule that the prorogation was unlawful, with the effect that parliament was not prorogued and remains in session. However, Johnson\u2019s lawyers assert that, depending on the court\u2019s reasoning, it may still be open to the prime minister to consider a further prorogation. Keen has now finished. Keen is now addressing the issue of \u201cremedy\u201d (ie, what might happen if the court rules against the government). He says he contends that a determination from the court that prorogation was unlawful would suffice. He says it should then be up to the government and parliament to decide how to respond; ie, it would not be for the court to decide what should happen next. A judge asks how parliament can respond if it is not sitting. Keen says in the first instance it would be for the government to respond. Keen says the government thinks the Commons will have a chance to debate all the statutory instruments required for Brexit before 31 October. And he says some of the five Brexit bills yet to be passed by parliament do not have to be passed by 31 October. Keen says Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, who represents Joanna Cherry and the other parliamentarians bringing the legal challenge in Scotland, was \u201cdiscourteous, incendiary and wholly unwarranted\u201d in what he said about Boris Johnson yesterday. O\u2019Neill, you may remember, branded Johnson \u201cthe father of lies\u201d. Keen says the government documents about the reasons for prorogation should be read with an open mind. Keen says prorogation can have political purposes. If parliament wants to block prorogation, it can move a motion of no confidence. That will be debated, if it is tabled by the leader of the opposition. Keen says this did not happen in September. Lord Kerr suggests that might be because the opposition did not see it as being politically advantageous. Keen says that is the point he was about to make. He says, in practice, prorogation is very similar to dissolution. And dissolution is non-justiciable. (Prorogation is what happens before a new session of parliament, normally once a year. Dissolution is what happens before a general election, in theory every five years.) Keen says prorogation is \u201cforbidden territory\u201d for the court. He says it is for parliament and the executive to determine whether prorogation is proper. And parliament has the \u201ctools available\u201d (ie, a no confidence motion). He says that, if the court were to start ruling on prorogation, it would be entering \u201ca minefield\u201d. He goes on to say it is \u201can ill-defined minefield that the courts are not \u2013 with the greatest of respect \u2013 properly equipped to deal with\u201d. How in the context of that political minefield is the court to opine on the issue of purpose or improper purpose, or legitimate political purpose or illegitimate political purpose? How are these concepts to be defined and applied in this context? In my respectful submission, the applicants and the petitioners are inviting the court into forbidden territory and into what is essentially a minefield, an ill-defined minefield. Lord Keen, the advocate general for Scotland, is now summing up for the government at the supreme court. He says the court is being determined to rule on how long prorogation should last. But this is a matter for constitutional convention, not statute, he says. He says parliament has not legislated on this matter - even though it could have done over the last 300 years. In an interview with a group of journalists in Warsaw today, the Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, ruled out his government blocking a potential British request for an article 50 extension. Some hardline Brexiteers had hoped either Poland or Hungary, who have their own adversarial relationships with Brussels, could be persuaded to block the extension that Boris Johnson is legally required to ask for if he doesn\u2019t negotiate a deal. Earlier this week, Hungary\u2019s foreign minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 ruled out a similar move from Hungary. Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski said previously he had spoken to his friends in the Polish government asking them to block any Brexit extension, but Czaputowicz said this would not happen. \u201cI can exclude the situation that we would veto - we would react positively to [an extension] request from the British government,\u201d he said. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, was in Warsaw last week and met with ministry officials, meetings he described on Twitter as \u201cconstructive\u201d. But Czaputowicz said he had \u201cno information\u201d about any specific British proposals to bring a deal closer. The Brexit department has now released the full text of Stephen Barclay\u2019s speech in Spain this morning. I have already quoted Barclay saying the EU must \u201ccompromise\u201d if a no-deal Brexit is to be avoided. (See 9.36am.) In the full speech Barclay also urged EU leaders to take inspiration from de Gaulle. Now as a business audience, I am sure you recognise that in growing a business you\u2019re required to take risk. Those who refuse to take any risk with their business will not succeed. Great political leaders have always respected the need to take risk. Indeed It was General De Gaulle, who said \u201ca true statesman is one who is willing to take risks\u201d. Yet a refusal by the commission to accept any risk would be a failure of statecraft. And put at risk the future relationship of the UK and the EU because of a lack of flexibility, creativity and indeed pragmatism. Leadership requires more than remaining within a safety net. So whilst we seek a deal, we recognise that we may not be able to agree a deal and in that instance we will leave with no deal. Here is an extract from what Lord Garnier QC told the supreme court when he was making a submission on behalf of Sir John Major this morning. Garnier said: One of the central points of the present case \u2013 and the reason why these proceedings are necessary at all \u2013 is that the power of prorogation subverts the possibility of control by political means. Its effect is to deprive parliament of a voice throughout the period of the prorogation. There is no possibility of political control except in the limited sense that a prime minister who exercises the power in a damaging way might face political consequences at some later date, when parliament is permitted to reconvene. But where the effect of the prorogation is to prevent parliament from discharging its role during a time-critical period, there is no possibility of meaningful political control of that decision until after the damage has been done. This is what Jolyon Maugham, the barrister leading the legal challenge against prorogation in Scotland, told Sky News about the government\u2019s remedy document. (See 12.04pm and 12.27pm.) There\u2019s a great big fuss about these submissions, because quite remarkably the government is not willing to release them to the media. But the normal rule is that once they are mentioned in open court they are available to be published. So I\u2019ve published them. I can tell you what they say. They contemplate a world where the supreme court rules this prorogation unlawful \u2013 the government is plainly contemplating in that world, continuing the prorogation until October 14th. So their very delicate, thorough submissions [are] seeking to persuade the supreme court to leave that door open to the government. That\u2019s striking stuff. And here is an extract from Sir John Major\u2019s submission (pdf) arguing that, if the supreme court does not draw a negative conclusion from Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to produce a witness statement saying prorogation had nothing to do with silencing parliament over Brexit (the negative conclusion being, it was, and Johnson has not been truthful), then that would only encourage other ministers to mislead courts in the same way. The scope for such an inference [a negative inference from the failure to produce a witness statement] in the present case is if anything greater in view of the requirements of the duty of candour. The prime minister is under a duty \u201cto explain the full facts and reasoning underlying the decision challenged\u201d: AHK v secretary of state for the home department [2012] EWHC 1117 (Admin) at \u00a722. His failure or refusal to do so is conspicuous, and there has been no proper explanation for it. The only conceivable explanation is that the true reasons if disclosed would be adverse to his case. If the court proceeded on any basis other than by drawing an adverse inference to that effect, the result would be to incentivise the non-provision of proper explanations of decisions in future cases. The morning hearing is now over. The court will sit again at 2pm. Here is an extract from the submission (pdf) from Sir John Major\u2019s team illustrating how a PM could abuse the right to prorogue parliament if the supreme court decides this matter is not justiciable (open to legal challenge). If that conclusion [ie, the prorogation is not justiciable] were correct, the consequence would be that there is nothing in law to prevent a prime minister from proroguing parliament in any circumstances or for any reason. In the context of constitutional settlement in which parliament is acknowledged to be sovereign, that would be a remarkable position for the courts to endorse. It would follow that the courts would not intervene even if, for example: parliament wished to abolish the power of prorogation, and a bill to that effect passed both houses, but before it could receive royal assent the prime minister prorogued parliament so as to prevent it from becoming law; a prime minister philosophically opposed to the idea of a standing army prorogued parliament during the period leading up to the statutory expiry of the relevant Armed Forces Act, with the result that the act expired and the armed forces were required to disband; or a prime minister prorogued parliament before the outcome of a confidence vote which his whips had calculated he would lose, for no reason other than to prevent it from being recorded that he had lost the confidence of the house such that he would need to resign. On Sky News the lawyer Jolyon Maugham says the government\u2019s remedy document that he disclosed (see 12.04pm) shows the government is considering continuing prorogation until 14 October even if it loses. \u201cThat\u2019s striking stuff,\u201d he says. Here is the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani on Edward Garnier\u2019s submission. On Monday Lord Keen, who was representing the government, told the supreme court that if it found against the government, Boris Johnson would \u201ctake all necessary steps to comply with any declaration made by the court\u201d. But it has now emerged that, even if he loses, Johnson does not want to recall parliament before 14 October \u2013 the day it is due to come back. According to the government\u2019s remedy document published by the lawyer Jolyon Maugham (see 12.04pm), the government is saying that, if the court declares prorogation unlawful, it cannot at this point say what it will do without knowing what the court will advise. It says that, if the court just says prorogation was unlawful, it could be open to Johnson to request another prorogation, lawfully, for the same period of time. The document says the court could also require Johnson to request a recall of parliament from the Queen. But the document also says this would have \u201cvery serious practical consequences\u201d because the timing of the Queen\u2019s speech would have to be brought forward. \u201cExtensive arrangements\u201d have to be made, it says, implying that this would be undesirable. Garnier is now summarising some of the arguments in the written submission. Lord Garnier QC is now addressing the court on behalf of Sir John Major. (See 9.19am.) His written submission is here (pdf). Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and director of the Good Law Project who led the legal challenge against prorogation in Scotland, has just tweeted the statement from the government about its proposed remedy if it loses the case - ie, what it will do to put the matter right. See 11.44am. Turning away from the hearing for a moment, the UK government has announced that it has now shared \u201ctechnical non-papers\u201d with the EU about alternatives to the backstop. A government spokesman said: We have been having detailed discussions with the [European] commission\u2019s taskforce 50 in recent weeks. We have now shared in written form a series of confidential technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward. We will table formal written solutions when we are ready, not according to an artificial deadline, and when the EU is clear that it will engage constructively on them as a replacement for the backstop. A non-paper, apparently, is a paper that does not represent a formal government position. The reference to an \u201cartificial deadline\u201d is prompted by Finland\u2019s prime minister, Antti Rinne, saying yesterday that the UK needed to submit proposals to the EU by the end of this month. Rinne was speaking out because Finland currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU. In his written submission (pdf) Fordham says there are five reasons why the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament is justiciable. The high court in England concluded that it wasn\u2019t. Here are Fordham\u2019s five reasons. First, because the analysis of justiciability should be integrated with consideration of the legal merits and not addressed in rigid isolation from them ... Secondly, because the principled scope of judicial review, foundationally underpinned by courts identifying what the rule of law requires, secures that executive action be accountable for its compatibility (a) with contextually calibrated public law standards and in particular (b) with established constitutional principles and values ... Thirdly, because \u201cpolitical\u201d subject matter is, by reference to established constitutional values, a basis for principled judicial restraint \u2013 where the applicability of grounds for judicial review may be cautiously and contextually calibrated \u2013 but it is not a basis for executive immunity and judicial abdication ... Fourthly, because the divisional court was incorrect (DC judgment \u00a767) to rely on the case of Bobb v Manning [2006] UKPC 22, where the prime minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago was \u201centitled to exercise his informed and political judgment\u201d in deciding not to call for a dissolution of parliament, as supporting its conclusion on the non-justiciability of such decisions ... Fifthly, because it is unsound to rest an adverse conclusion on justiciability upon whether the exercise of the power affects an individual ... Fordham says a form of \u201cremedy\u201d has been proposed to the court. This is a reference to a statement from the government explaining what the government will do if the court finds that prorogation was unlawful. In the hearing yesterday Lady Hale said she would like to see such a statement before the end of today\u2019s hearing. But Fordham does not say what the government\u2019s proposition is, other than that it is a \u201cspecies of declaration\u201d. Mike Fordham QC is now speaking on behalf of the Welsh government. Here is his written submission (pdf). Lavery says his client\u2019s son was murdered because of conditions in Northern Ireland at the time. That is why he feels strongly about this, and why he wants the supreme court to intervene. On that point Lavery winds up. From David Allen Green, the FT\u2019s legal commentator Lord Wilson intervenes. He says he is worried that people be watching Lavery\u2019s submission will conclude that the points he is making \u2013 about Brexit\u2019s impact on Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement \u2013 are at the heart of the case. But they are not. He tells Lavery: Don\u2019t abuse our patience and don\u2019t abuse Lady Hale\u2019s patience. The intervention does not seem to have much impact on Lavery, who is just ploughing on. Lord Sales tells Lavery his arguments are \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d to the issues being determined by the court. In his written submission (pdf) Lavery argues that prorogation has already had \u201ca much greater impact on the rights of people in Northern Ireland\u201d than on the rights of people in the rest of the UK. He says victims of the Troubles have lost the chance to have their concerns debated in parliament. He justifies this point by saying that the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act requires regular debates to be held on certain issues. On Monday 9 September there were motions for five separate debates on the Commons order paper. But four of those debates, covering gambling, human trafficking, payments to victims and historical institutional abuse, were cancelled because prorogation meant other matters needed to be debated instead. Lady Hale, president of the court, says the issues raised by Lavery are not relevant to this case. The court is not looking at the rights and wrongs of Brexit. It is just looking at whether the decision to prorogue was justified. Lavery says if the decision to prorogue was taken for the wrong reasons, the court should intervene. Ronan Lavery QC is now speaking at the supreme court on behalf of Raymond McCord, who brought a legal challenge against the government\u2019s Brexit policy in Northern Ireland. McCord\u2019s son was killed by loyalist terrorists in 1997. He took the government to court on the grounds that its Brexit strategy could undermine the Good Friday agreement. But his challenge was rejected by the high court in Belfast. Lavery says it is important to understand that the EU is a peace project in terms of the effect it has had on relations between Ireland and the UK. Wolffe says he wants to make two points from a Scottish perspective. First, he says this case does not turn on any special feature of Scots law. And, second, he refers to statutory instruments (SIs). The UK government will only pass SIs in relation to Scotland with the approval of the Scottish parliament. He says, as of yesterday, there were only six outstanding SIs relating to Scotland that needed to be made before 31 October. Only two had been made by an emergency procedure that allows them to be made without scrutiny by parliament. This issue is relevant because one argument against prorogation is that it has limited the time available for parliamentary scrutiny of SIs. This submission (pdf) to the court, by the Public Law Project, goes into this in more detail. Wolffe says, if the UK government\u2019s claim that prorogation is non-justiciable is correct, then it would be open to a prime minister to prorogue parliament as soon as he took office. Wolffe says what\u2019s at stake in this case is parliamentary accountability. This is what he says in his written submission (pdf). It is a fundamental principle of the UK\u2019s constitutional democracy that the executive is accountable to parliament \u2013 that the government\u2019s policies and actions are subject to scrutiny in parliament by the elected representatives of the people. That principle \u2013 the principle of responsible government \u2013 is \u201cno less fundamental to our constitution\u201d than the legal doctrine of the sovereignty of parliament. It applies to the relations between the UK government and the UK parliament, and is reflected in the constitutional arrangements set out in the devolution statutes. The purposes served by that principle include: (i) subjecting the policies of the executive to consideration by the representatives of the people; (ii) promoting transparency of executive action by requiring the government to report, explain and defend its actions; and (iii) protecting citizens from the arbitrary exercise of executive power. In a society governed by the rule of law, that constitutional principle must be, and is, recognised by the law. James Wolffe QC, the lord advocate, the Scottish government\u2019s chief law officer, has just started making his statement on behalf of the Scottish government. I\u2019ve taken down an earlier post saying it was James Mure. (The supreme court website said Wolffe would be represented by James Mure.) Here is his written submission (pdf). The supreme court hearing is about to resume. This is from the BBC\u2019s Andrew Kerr. Omar Salem, the Labour activist who confronted Boris Johnson about conditions in a hospital that the PM was visiting yesterday, has defended the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, for tweeting about his Labour background. Kuenssberg\u2019s tweet yesterday provoked a storm of outrage on social media from people who claimed that it was evidence of bias. Personally I thought the reaction was unpleasant and unfair. To point out that someone is a party activist is not to say that their complaint has no merit, and the criticisms I read of Kuenssberg all failed the \u2018what if it was the other way round?\u2019 test. If Jeremy Corbyn got berated by a member of the public in a newsworthy encounter, and he turned out to be a Tory activist, what would you think if the BBC failed to mention it? Downing Street does not always respond well when Johnson has difficult encounters with members of the public, but on this occasion it said the right things. Here is HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh on what Number 10 was briefing. And this is what Johnson himself put on Twitter. By the way, do read this article on this story from my colleague Matthew Weaver. He has written up what a doctor at the Whipps Cross hospital who wanted to remain anonymous told him about conditions there and about the Johnson visit. Here is an excerpt. I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day and felt I had to say something because NHS hospitals today can be unsafe places. Whipps Cross [in Leytonstone, north-east London] is particularly understaffed and under-resourced so people don\u2019t get the care that they need as promptly as they need. And this visit was not reflective of the realities of working at this hospital. Johnson was taken to the nicest ward in the hospital; there were flowers on display and classical music was playing in the background. I wish the prime minister could have seen some of the other wards, which are nothing like what he saw today. He should come on a night shift and see how everything doesn\u2019t function at two in the morning. I\u2019m disappointed with the care I can give patients. I work in acute adult medicine and I constantly feel that I am doing a disservice to patients and their families. And here is the full article. The new Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, firmed up her party\u2019s position on Brexit at her party conference this week, saying that if the Lib Dems won a majority in a general election (quite a colossal if), they would cancel Brexit altogether. At least some voters are impressed. This morning a YouGov poll in the Times (paywall) puts the Lib Dems on 23%, up four points from the previous week and ahead of Labour, which is down two points on 21%. And in an interview on the Today programme this morning, to mark John Humphrys final day as presenter, the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair said the Lib Dems were looking increasingly serious as a political option. Blair said that the two-party system might collapse \u201cif it becomes clear that the two main parties have moved so far away from the centre that the gap in the centre has to be filled in order to be representative of the state of opinion\u201d. He went on: One of the things that troubles me most about politics today is I can\u2019t tell you the number of young people, in the 20s and 30s, really intelligent young people, politically committed, - a) they\u2019ve got no home and b) they look at the state of the two main parties and say: \u2018I couldn\u2019t join either of them.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter what I say, what anyone else says. You only have to look at the Liberal Democrats now and their party conference. For the first time in long time, they are looking a much more serious group of people. Why is that? Because people have come from the Labour party, come from the Conservative party, and they have got a coherent argument. If I was the two main parties at the moment, I would worry about that. Asked if the Lib Dem argument was one that he agreed with, Blair replied: It is an argument I agree with. I\u2019m very tribally and deeply attached to the Labour party. But if over a long period of time someone from outside your political party is making an argument you think is more sensible, it starts to pull you in the opposite direction. Humphrys then asked if Blair was going over to the Lib Dems. But Blair would not give him a scoop on his final day in the office. He replied: No, you shouldn\u2019t read that into it. It just suggests a deep level of frustration about where the Labour party is and where the Conservative party has gone to. If Blair is not joining the Lib Dems, what about Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader? That sounds like a daft proposition, but the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton has just published a very long and fascinating profile of Watson that includes this nugget. Watson has long been viewed as one of Labour\u2019s most tribal politicians. But [former Labour MP Michael] Dugher, one of his closest friends, suggests that he could yet join his past enemies: the Liberal Democrats. \u201cIf you\u2019d said to me two years ago, would Tom ever countenance doing anything with the Lib Dems, I would have said \u2018no chance\u2019. Now I\u2019d say \u2018who knows?\u2019\u201d Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has said Brussels needs to show more flexibility in its approach to Brexit negotiations. Speaking to business leaders while on a visit to Spain, he said: A rigid approach now at this point is no way to progress a deal and the responsibility sits with both sides to find a solution. We are committed to carving out a landing zone and we stand ready to share relevant texts. But it must be in the spirit of negotiation with flexibility and with a negotiating partner that itself is willing to compromise. As a Daily Telegraph columnist in the 1990s Boris Johnson was one of the many journalists on the Tory right who used to treat the then prime minister, John Major, with scorn. More than 20 years on Major finally has the chance to get his own back because we are going to witness the extraordinary spectacle of a former Conservative prime minister going to court to argue that the current Conservative prime minister has not been telling the truth. The word extraordinary is cropping up rather frequently in Brexit coverage at the moment, but it is very hard to think of a precedent for this. Major will not actually be addressing the court himself. The supreme court is an appeal court, and it does not take evidence from witnesses. But Edward Garnier QC, now Lord Garnier, a former Tory solicitor general, will be making a submission on his behalf. It is not clear yet whether or not Major himself will be in court to listen to the proceedings. The supreme court has overnight published Major\u2019s 10-page submission (pdf) on its website. Drafted by Garnier and two legal colleagues, it argues, on behalf of Major, that the PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament should be justiciable - ie, subject to legal challenge; the government says it shouldn\u2019t, because this is beyond the remit of the courts \u2013 and that Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue was at least \u201csubstantially motivated\u201d by the desire to limit the chances for MPs to interfere with Brexit. The government has refused to accept that this was Johnson\u2019s motive. But Major argues in his submission that the supreme court would be \u201cnaive\u201d to believe him. Referring to the fact that the government only produced a limited number of documents about how the prorogation decision was taken, and not a proper witness statement saying the move was not motivated by the desire to silence parliament, the submission says: The current factual picture, on the material which is available and with regard to the absence of evidence which ought to be available but has not been provided, is deeply concerning. The court is under no obligation to approach this case on the artificially na\u00efve basis that the handful of disclosed documents, the contents of which nobody has been prepared to verify with a statement of truth, should nevertheless be assumed to be entirely accurate and complete when even members of the cabinet do not appear to believe them ... It would also be wrong to proceed on that basis, because it would mean that the real issue that has arisen on the facts would not be resolved. Here is the agenda for the day at the supreme court, where the hearing starts at 10.30am. 10.30am: James Mure QC speaks on behalf of the Scottish government. 11am: Ronan Lavery QC speaks on behalf of Raymond McCord, who launched a legal challenge against a no-deal Brexit in Northern Ireland. 11.40am: Mike Fordham QC speaks on behalf of the Welsh government. 12.10pm: Lord Garnier QC speaks on behalf of Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister. 2pm: Lord Keen QC sums up for the government. 2.30pm: Lord Pannick sums up for Gina Miller And here are other items on the agenda for the day. 11am: Boris Johnson holds a meeting with military service chiefs in Downing Street. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is in Dublin today for a meeting with his Irish counterpart, Paschal Donohoe. And the Commons Brexit select committee is also in Dublin for private meetings with Irish ministers. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on the supreme court hearing. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

A more self-aware institution would have sought a media partner with a history of greater empathy for working-class black people than the Sun. It is unacceptable that, on the brink of Brexit, a country that claims to be global is directed by an ever more socially homogenous group. Whether Eton likes it or not, it cannot look at its most visible alumni \u2013 in effect, its ambassadors \u2013 in the political sphere and conclude that these are people who value compassion anywhere near as much as they value power. The UK deserves better leaders, from more socially conscious backgrounds, and it deserves them now. \u2022 Musa Okwonga is a poet, journalist and musician",

      "body": "<p>\u201cPeople have died because of austerity,\u201d a woman told Boris Johnson, buttonholing him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/13/boris-johnson-confronted-doncaster-cheek-come-here-video\" title=\"\">in Doncaster</a> last week. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us that austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now.\u201d It was her words, caught on cameras and phones, that hit a nerve, because she spoke for so many. No one remembers what Johnson said, or what he was doing there. Only yesterday, a man with a sick daughter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/18/nhs-destroyed-boris-johnson-father-sick-child-hospital-london\">berated the PM</a> in a London hospital over waiting times, and on years and years and years of the \u201cNHS being destroyed\u201d.</p> \n<p>A couple of weeks earlier it was the Portuguese woman who hijacked a live <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/aug/29/i-need-a-voice-portuguese-womans-brexit-plea-video\" title=\"\">Sky News broadcast</a> with an emotional plea. After 20 years living and working in Britain she didn\u2019t know whether she was still welcome. \u201cI need a voice, I gave this country my youth,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked after your children, I\u2019ve looked after the elderly.\u201d</p> \n<p>And who can forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/apr/18/does-brenda-from-bristol-have-the-best-reaction-to-the-election-news-video\" title=\"\">Brenda from Bristol</a>. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d she spluttered at the man from the BBC, when he asked her about Theresa May\u2019s decision to hold a snap election. \u201cNot another one! Oh for God\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t stand this. There\u2019s too much politics going on at the moment.\u201d Brenda was surprised by the fuss, then annoyed. \u201cOh God no, go away,\u201d she yelled from a window at some journalists recently when they called for her wisdom. These are the viral stars of Brexit Britain, the ordinary folk who are suddenly and briefly catapulted into the limelight. With a sentence or two, or just a look, they strike a chord with the nation. What is it like for them? What happens after their brief moments of fame? Does it make any difference? I caught up with a few \u2013 all of them women, because, interestingly, most of them are \u2013 to find out.</p> \n<h2><strong>Harriet Ellis, #EyeRollGirl: \u2018I ended up voting leave\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Harriet Ellis was in the queue to board the flight for her holiday. \u201cThe woman in front and her boyfriend kept taking selfies,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s so weird, why do you want to remember this moment, being in the Ryanair queue? And I kept getting in the picture, so I was dodging, I didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment for them. Then I looked over at her phone and I just saw loads of pictures of my face. The woman had Googled me and was checking the picture to see if it was me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then there was the time in Tesco, in Bristol. \u201cThis woman had the strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world, she was like [puts on strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world]: \u2018Oh my God, your eyes are a legend.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Thanks very much.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Ellis\u2019s eyes are a legend. They achieved this status in November when their owner was sitting right behind Nigel Farage in a Channel 4 Brexit debate. It was his claim that Theresa May was delivering a \u201cremainer\u2019s Brexit\u201d that caused them to perform what has been described as a \u201cdouble axis roll\u201d. The clip went viral, Harriet became #EyeRollGirl.</p> \n<p>She was a student at Birmingham University at the time and got an email asking if she wanted to be in the audience for the debate. \u201cI was like: I might as well, I\u2019ve got nothing else to do,\u201d she says. She is interested in politics and has always talked about it at home: \u201cI know a bit, not like loads.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d3ebbea0-240b-4031-83fd-49a65befd533\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RsivXblb7rY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She was not aware of the roll at the time, didn\u2019t even know she was a roller, although afterwards her mum told her she\u2019d had plenty of practice; she had spent years rolling her eyes at her. But after the debate someone asked if she had checked her phone. \u201cOh God, is someone dead? No, but there were 3,000 views on this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1059735878405419008\" title=\"\">gif</a>, and I was like: wow, that\u2019s fun. Then we were in the car on the way home and it just snowballed. If people were concentrating on my eyes it mustn\u2019t have been that interesting a debate.\u201d</p> \n<p>At home she stayed up, looking at \u2013 and engaging with \u2013 all the reaction, even though she had a really important interview for a post-grad teaching degree at Oxford the following day. It was 99% nice, she says, 1% abuse. A man in Canada said he would like to take her out to dinner and propose to her.</p> \n<p>In the morning, her phone wasn\u2019t working. \u201cIt overheated from all the notifications. It took a while to calm down, I had 68,000 likes in 24 hours.\u201d On the way to her interview she spoke to newspapers and magazines. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re on top of the world. I think it helped with the interview.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anyway, she got in, and will start the course this autumn \u2013 teaching in a secondary school (religious education, not politics). Does she think she has got Farage to thank for her career? \u201cHe did give me some confidence,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Extraordinarily, in the referendum, Ellis voted to\u2026 leave! (Now who\u2019s doing the double-axis eye-roll?) But this had nothing to do with Farage. \u201cI was at sixth form at the time; this was my first time voting; I was very interested in Lexit, leftwing Brexit, reading about how the EU promotes the immigration of white westerners and is sort of like a racist ideology in that it is at the expense of immigration from more deserving countries and people of colour. Also I didn\u2019t like the fact that you didn\u2019t know who was running it; you didn\u2019t directly vote for the people at the top, and no one knows who their MEP is.\u201d She would probably vote differently now though, because of the way it has turned out. \u201cIt\u2019s an omnishambles, as Malcolm Tucker would say.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Ana Telma Rocha, #PortugueseBrexitWoman: \u2018I thought they\u2019d cut it because I was just another nutter\u2019\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Ana Telma Rocha came to this country from Portugal in 1999. It made her into the liberal, tolerant person she is, she says. \u201cI was super-Catholic, a xenophobe, I thought gay people were dangerous. It educated me, it\u2019s been wonderful and I love it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But, she says, recently the UK has become unrecognisable. In 2016, she was walking down the street in Sheffield, where she was living with one of her two sons. A man accelerated towards her at a crossing, stopping only metres from them. \u201cHe said: \u2018Go back to your country, foreign scum.\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s when she decided her boys \u2013 one of whom has autism \u2013 would go to live in Portugal while she stayed here to work. \u201cThe toughest decision,\u201d she says, choking up. She moved to London, to carry on her work as a carer for an agency. She gets moved around the country; when we speak she is on her way to a job in Suffolk. She has also worked as an actor.</p> \n<p>It was after Johnson announced that he was suspending parliament that Rocha \u201cabsolutely lost it\u201d. \u201cI saw that this guy was going to push a no deal when the [EU] settlement scheme hadn\u2019t even gone through and everything rushed to my head. I said: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to go down to Westminster to get arrested.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"01d67403-2fcc-4f44-bcaa-d73635fc8118\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P9gpeHQ47Vc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She was not arrested, but she did interrupt a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/aug/29/i-need-a-voice-portuguese-womans-brexit-plea-video\" title=\"\">Sky TV broadcast covering the protests</a>. \u201cI need a voice,\u201d she said, passionately. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for 20 years and I have no voice. The resettlement scheme is not working.\u201d She did not realise it was a live show. \u201cI thought, I don\u2019t know, that they\u2019d cut it, because I was just another nutter off the street. But then everybody started to ring me and I thought: \u2018God, this has gone a bit mad.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Soon she became Portuguese Brexit Woman, getting sympathy and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1167780171312766976\" title=\"\">abuse</a>, especially when it emerged that she had helped set up a theatre company. She was a planted remoaner stooge, it was clearly fake news. \u201cI knew that as soon as they found out I\u2019m an actress they would say it was fake news,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there were many more nice messages than \u2013 sorry \u2013 those idiots.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rocha\u2019s main issue \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/applying-for-settled-status-is-a-fraught-and-humiliating-process\" title=\"\">like many other EU citizens in the UK</a>, has been the laborious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/its-not-easy-to-apply-for-settled-status\" title=\"\">process</a> \u2013 of applying for the EU settlement scheme; having to navigate seemingly endless technical issues, error messages and helpline hell while working up to 65 hours a week. Not as simple as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/home-office-eu-citizens-settlement-scheme-home-office-brexit\" title=\"\">the Home Office made out</a>. But since her impassioned TV outburst, she has heard directly from the Portuguese consulate, which has offered to help. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of Portugal,\u201d she says. There is no such warmth towards Johnson. \u201cGod forgive him for what he\u2019s done to England.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Amelia McDowell, Question Time\u2019s \u2018future prime minister\u2019: \u2018My mate said you\u2019ve hit a million views\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Amelia McDowell, 16, remembers getting the call. She was in the middle of an art class, at her school in Belfast. \u201cI checked my voice messages and there was this really posh British woman. I said to my teacher: \u2018This is important, do you mind if I get it?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The teacher agreed, McDowell went into the art cupboard, sat down among all the paint and the clay and called the woman back. \u201cShe\u2019s asking me all these questions and I try to answer as best as I can with these pots of paint falling on my head, then she\u2019s like: \u2018That\u2019s brilliant, we\u2019d love to have you, we\u2019ll send you the tickets.\u2019 I hung up and just screamed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tickets to a concert? The X Factor? Oh no. \u201cI burst out of the art store and went, to my whole class: \u2018I\u2019M GOING TO BE ON QUESTION TIME!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>McDowell watches the BBC politics debate every week. When there was an announcement that the show would be coming to Belfast (\u201cIt never comes to Belfast!\u201d) she immediately applied to be in the audience.</p> \n<p>A few days later, Dad dropped her off at the venue. \u201cI knew I wanted to say something but it wasn\u2019t like I had completely thought it out, it was mostly spontaneous.\u201d What she did, when she got the chance, was to calmly deliver a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcquestiontime/status/1108863526406418438?lang=en\" title=\"\">damning indictment of the Conservative party</a>. \u201cDavid Cameron made the referendum policy because he didn\u2019t want to risk losing 10 or 15 seats to Ukip, and look where it has got us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has always been because Tories are playing party politics with issues that are going to be huge, generational changes for all of us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6bd557b7-02f1-484a-be04-a06504529a22\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cLrYmLizmKY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She was soon being hailed for her eloquence and clarity. She set up a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ameliamcd_?lang=en\" title=\"\">Twitter account</a>, wrote: \u201cHi, this is me,\u201d under her clip, and collected 8,000 followers overnight. Celebrities \u2013 Rob Delaney, Richard Bacon, Amanda Abbington \u2013 were retweeting it; here was the human embodiment of the argument to give the vote to 16-year-olds (a campaign that McDowell is now part of).</p> \n<p>In English class the next morning, \u201cfriends kept refreshing their phones under the desk, and going: \u2018It\u2019s on 215,000 views now.\u2019 I remember when my mate Erin just stood up and said it had hit a million. That night my friend Amy rang and she\u2019s like: \u2018Mimi, your video\u2019s on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Twitter!\u2019 Then I checked my Twitter and like John McDonnell\u2019s followed me! What\u2019s going on?\u201d It was really good, to have a platform at last, and to know people don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re talking crap when it comes to politics. But also part of me is like: there are like so many young activists my age or maybe a bit older who maybe have an understanding like mine or close to it but didn\u2019t have the chance to go on Question Time and say something. That was luck and I\u2019m very thankful for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>McDowell has certainly used her moment in the spotlight: she has been on the radio and written articles, and says she would have done more if her GCSEs had not got in the way. She is at sixth-form college now doing French, English language and biology. Not politics, incidentally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seem up myself but it\u2019s mainly things that I do already have a good understanding of.\u201d That is very clear. As well as school, and school orchestra (violin), she is a Labour party of Northern Ireland youth activist.</p> \n<p>At the end of her Question Time speech she called for a general election. Is that still what she wants? \u201cThere\u2019s obviously the danger of being so close to Brexit now, and I am quite worried that it will become another Brexit election, and we will end up with the Tories again, but I think Boris Johnson\u2019s recent moves have been an electoral disaster. I do not think he\u2019s going to get back in. So honestly part of me really wants an election because we probably would get an extension to do it and I think another government would get in even if Labour needs to be propped up for a while.\u201d </p> \n<p>After college, she hopes to go to university \u2013 Oxford is the aim, otherwise Edinburgh or UCL \u2013 to study French and Russian, and then eventually go into politics. There were people saying she should be prime minister after Question Time; what did she make of that? \u201cI\u2019m not saying right now, but maybe in the future like, if the opportunity comes up I\u2019m willing to take it.\u201d #VoteMimi</p> \n<h2><strong>Kirsty Archer, evicted renter: \u2018It shows people can actually change things\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>When Kirsty Archer complained to her landlord about the state of disrepair of the London flat she rented, she was served with an eviction order. Then, following the announcement that the government was going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/15/short-notice-evictions-face-axe-in-tenant-rights-victory\" title=\"\">scrap these section 21 eviction notices</a> \u2013 which enable landlords to evict tenants for no reason at all, so long as they give them two months\u2019 notice \u2013 she agreed to be interviewed on Sky News. It did not quite go as expected.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought if you are a case study you would have the chance to talk about what happened to you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t really go like that. She was quite critical of me; it emerged during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=Hkc1mc71B9k\" title=\"\">interview</a> that she had been a landlord herself. I was quite surprised about the line of questioning.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is the Sky journalist \u2013 and landlord \u2013 Jayne Secker. \u201cThat\u2019s just the housing market isn\u2019t it?\u201d Secker said to Archer, on air, about the extortionate rents in London. And she went on to have a moan about some of her own experiences renting out properties to young people who don\u2019t know how to do anything around the house and can\u2019t even change a lightbulb. It had gone from a piece about scrapping section 21 to the woes of being a property owner, and Archer came away thinking it had gone really badly. \u201cShe said at the end that I swore, and apologised for me swearing.\u201d (Archer had used the term \u201cpissed off\u201d.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a38acfb6-b53e-48a0-97bd-bbca9e98a504\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hkc1mc71B9k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Archer\u2019s flatmate \u2013 and fellow evictee \u2013 did not think it had gone so badly for her, and did the sensible thing in the situation: he uploaded the clip to Twitter. Two days later \u2013 after retweets from, among others, Owen Jones, Philip Pullman and Ellie Goulding \u2013 it had garnered 4m views. The story then not only returned to being one about renters\u2019 rights, but now it also became one about patronising journalists who are wildly out of touch with the living situations of the nation\u2019s young people, and woefully ignorant of the renting crisis. Secker ended up apologising, saying that she \u201cgot the tone and content of an interview wrong\u201d and had \u201ctaken the many comments on board\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously it resonated with a lot of people,\u201d Archer says. \u201cI think one of the nicest things was all the comments from random people online saying well done and it\u2019s so good you are speaking out for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Archer works for the charity <a href=\"https://www.rethink.org/\" title=\"\">Rethink Mental Illness</a> and knows a thing or two about the link between housing and mental health. She is one of the lucky ones; she got a platform. Since \u2013 and as a result of \u2013 her TV appearance she has been to the annual OECD forum in Paris, sat on panels, spoken in schools. \u201cI think it shows that if people take action and are willing to do something rather than just letting it happen, then they can actually change things and help maybe more than just themselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>The renting situation is still rubbish. The ban on letting fees is positive, likewise scrapping section 21s, although that hasn\u2019t come into effect yet, and who knows when it will, with everything else going on. Archer is renting a new place in Streatham, south London, \u00a3675 a month plus bills. The washing machine broke, but it got fixed. \u201cThe landlord is a lot more reasonable this time.\u201d </p>",

After 20 years living and working in Britain she didn\u2019t know whether she was still welcome. \u201cI need a voice, I gave this country my youth,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked after your children, I\u2019ve looked after the elderly.\u201d And who can forget Brenda from Bristol. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d she spluttered at the man from the BBC, when he asked her about Theresa May\u2019s decision to hold a snap election. \u201cNot another one! Oh for God\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t stand this. There\u2019s too much politics going on at the moment.\u201d Brenda was surprised by the fuss, then annoyed. \u201cOh God no, go away,\u201d she yelled from a window at some journalists recently when they called for her wisdom. These are the viral stars of Brexit Britain, the ordinary folk who are suddenly and briefly catapulted into the limelight. With a sentence or two, or just a look, they strike a chord with the nation. What is it like for them? What happens after their brief moments of fame? Does it make any difference? I caught up with a few \u2013 all of them women, because, interestingly, most of them are \u2013 to find out. Harriet Ellis, #EyeRollGirl: \u2018I ended up voting leave\u2019 Harriet Ellis was in the queue to board the flight for her holiday. \u201cThe woman in front and her boyfriend kept taking selfies,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s so weird, why do you want to remember this moment, being in the Ryanair queue? And I kept getting in the picture, so I was dodging, I didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment for them. Then I looked over at her phone and I just saw loads of pictures of my face. The woman had Googled me and was checking the picture to see if it was me.\u201d Then there was the time in Tesco, in Bristol. \u201cThis woman had the strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world, she was like [puts on strongest Bristolian accent in the whole world]: \u2018Oh my God, your eyes are a legend.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Thanks very much.\u2019\u201d Ellis\u2019s eyes are a legend. They achieved this status in November when their owner was sitting right behind Nigel Farage in a Channel 4 Brexit debate. It was his claim that Theresa May was delivering a \u201cremainer\u2019s Brexit\u201d that caused them to perform what has been described as a \u201cdouble axis roll\u201d. The clip went viral, Harriet became #EyeRollGirl. She was a student at Birmingham University at the time and got an email asking if she wanted to be in the audience for the debate. \u201cI was like: I might as well, I\u2019ve got nothing else to do,\u201d she says. She is interested in politics and has always talked about it at home: \u201cI know a bit, not like loads.\u201d She was not aware of the roll at the time, didn\u2019t even know she was a roller, although afterwards her mum told her she\u2019d had plenty of practice; she had spent years rolling her eyes at her. But after the debate someone asked if she had checked her phone. \u201cOh God, is someone dead? No, but there were 3,000 views on this gif, and I was like: wow, that\u2019s fun. Then we were in the car on the way home and it just snowballed. If people were concentrating on my eyes it mustn\u2019t have been that interesting a debate.\u201d At home she stayed up, looking at \u2013 and engaging with \u2013 all the reaction, even though she had a really important interview for a post-grad teaching degree at Oxford the following day. It was 99% nice, she says, 1% abuse. A man in Canada said he would like to take her out to dinner and propose to her. In the morning, her phone wasn\u2019t working. \u201cIt overheated from all the notifications. It took a while to calm down, I had 68,000 likes in 24 hours.\u201d On the way to her interview she spoke to newspapers and magazines. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re on top of the world. I think it helped with the interview.\u201d Anyway, she got in, and will start the course this autumn \u2013 teaching in a secondary school (religious education, not politics). Does she think she has got Farage to thank for her career? \u201cHe did give me some confidence,\u201d she says. Extraordinarily, in the referendum, Ellis voted to\u2026 leave! (Now who\u2019s doing the double-axis eye-roll?) But this had nothing to do with Farage. \u201cI was at sixth form at the time; this was my first time voting; I was very interested in Lexit, leftwing Brexit, reading about how the EU promotes the immigration of white westerners and is sort of like a racist ideology in that it is at the expense of immigration from more deserving countries and people of colour. Also I didn\u2019t like the fact that you didn\u2019t know who was running it; you didn\u2019t directly vote for the people at the top, and no one knows who their MEP is.\u201d She would probably vote differently now though, because of the way it has turned out. \u201cIt\u2019s an omnishambles, as Malcolm Tucker would say.\u201d Ana Telma Rocha, #PortugueseBrexitWoman: \u2018I thought they\u2019d cut it because I was just another nutter\u2019\u2019 Ana Telma Rocha came to this country from Portugal in 1999. It made her into the liberal, tolerant person she is, she says. \u201cI was super-Catholic, a xenophobe, I thought gay people were dangerous. It educated me, it\u2019s been wonderful and I love it.\u201d But, she says, recently the UK has become unrecognisable. In 2016, she was walking down the street in Sheffield, where she was living with one of her two sons. A man accelerated towards her at a crossing, stopping only metres from them. \u201cHe said: \u2018Go back to your country, foreign scum.\u2019\u201d. That\u2019s when she decided her boys \u2013 one of whom has autism \u2013 would go to live in Portugal while she stayed here to work. \u201cThe toughest decision,\u201d she says, choking up. She moved to London, to carry on her work as a carer for an agency. She gets moved around the country; when we speak she is on her way to a job in Suffolk. She has also worked as an actor. It was after Johnson announced that he was suspending parliament that Rocha \u201cabsolutely lost it\u201d. \u201cI saw that this guy was going to push a no deal when the [EU] settlement scheme hadn\u2019t even gone through and everything rushed to my head. I said: \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to go down to Westminster to get arrested.\u2019\u201d She was not arrested, but she did interrupt a Sky TV broadcast covering the protests. \u201cI need a voice,\u201d she said, passionately. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for 20 years and I have no voice. The resettlement scheme is not working.\u201d She did not realise it was a live show. \u201cI thought, I don\u2019t know, that they\u2019d cut it, because I was just another nutter off the street. But then everybody started to ring me and I thought: \u2018God, this has gone a bit mad.\u2019\u201d Soon she became Portuguese Brexit Woman, getting sympathy and abuse, especially when it emerged that she had helped set up a theatre company. She was a planted remoaner stooge, it was clearly fake news. \u201cI knew that as soon as they found out I\u2019m an actress they would say it was fake news,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there were many more nice messages than \u2013 sorry \u2013 those idiots.\u201d Rocha\u2019s main issue \u2013 like many other EU citizens in the UK, has been the laborious process \u2013 of applying for the EU settlement scheme; having to navigate seemingly endless technical issues, error messages and helpline hell while working up to 65 hours a week. Not as simple as the Home Office made out. But since her impassioned TV outburst, she has heard directly from the Portuguese consulate, which has offered to help. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of Portugal,\u201d she says. There is no such warmth towards Johnson. \u201cGod forgive him for what he\u2019s done to England.\u201d Amelia McDowell, Question Time\u2019s \u2018future prime minister\u2019: \u2018My mate said you\u2019ve hit a million views\u2019 Amelia McDowell, 16, remembers getting the call. She was in the middle of an art class, at her school in Belfast. \u201cI checked my voice messages and there was this really posh British woman. I said to my teacher: \u2018This is important, do you mind if I get it?\u2019\u201d The teacher agreed, McDowell went into the art cupboard, sat down among all the paint and the clay and called the woman back. \u201cShe\u2019s asking me all these questions and I try to answer as best as I can with these pots of paint falling on my head, then she\u2019s like: \u2018That\u2019s brilliant, we\u2019d love to have you, we\u2019ll send you the tickets.\u2019 I hung up and just screamed.\u201d Tickets to a concert? The X Factor? Oh no. \u201cI burst out of the art store and went, to my whole class: \u2018I\u2019M GOING TO BE ON QUESTION TIME!\u2019\u201d McDowell watches the BBC politics debate every week. When there was an announcement that the show would be coming to Belfast (\u201cIt never comes to Belfast!\u201d) she immediately applied to be in the audience. A few days later, Dad dropped her off at the venue. \u201cI knew I wanted to say something but it wasn\u2019t like I had completely thought it out, it was mostly spontaneous.\u201d What she did, when she got the chance, was to calmly deliver a damning indictment of the Conservative party. \u201cDavid Cameron made the referendum policy because he didn\u2019t want to risk losing 10 or 15 seats to Ukip, and look where it has got us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has always been because Tories are playing party politics with issues that are going to be huge, generational changes for all of us.\u201d She was soon being hailed for her eloquence and clarity. She set up a Twitter account, wrote: \u201cHi, this is me,\u201d under her clip, and collected 8,000 followers overnight. Celebrities \u2013 Rob Delaney, Richard Bacon, Amanda Abbington \u2013 were retweeting it; here was the human embodiment of the argument to give the vote to 16-year-olds (a campaign that McDowell is now part of). In English class the next morning, \u201cfriends kept refreshing their phones under the desk, and going: \u2018It\u2019s on 215,000 views now.\u2019 I remember when my mate Erin just stood up and said it had hit a million. That night my friend Amy rang and she\u2019s like: \u2018Mimi, your video\u2019s on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Twitter!\u2019 Then I checked my Twitter and like John McDonnell\u2019s followed me! What\u2019s going on?\u201d It was really good, to have a platform at last, and to know people don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re talking crap when it comes to politics. But also part of me is like: there are like so many young activists my age or maybe a bit older who maybe have an understanding like mine or close to it but didn\u2019t have the chance to go on Question Time and say something. That was luck and I\u2019m very thankful for it.\u201d McDowell has certainly used her moment in the spotlight: she has been on the radio and written articles, and says she would have done more if her GCSEs had not got in the way. She is at sixth-form college now doing French, English language and biology. Not politics, incidentally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seem up myself but it\u2019s mainly things that I do already have a good understanding of.\u201d That is very clear. As well as school, and school orchestra (violin), she is a Labour party of Northern Ireland youth activist. At the end of her Question Time speech she called for a general election. Is that still what she wants? \u201cThere\u2019s obviously the danger of being so close to Brexit now, and I am quite worried that it will become another Brexit election, and we will end up with the Tories again, but I think Boris Johnson\u2019s recent moves have been an electoral disaster. I do not think he\u2019s going to get back in. So honestly part of me really wants an election because we probably would get an extension to do it and I think another government would get in even if Labour needs to be propped up for a while.\u201d After college, she hopes to go to university \u2013 Oxford is the aim, otherwise Edinburgh or UCL \u2013 to study French and Russian, and then eventually go into politics. There were people saying she should be prime minister after Question Time; what did she make of that? \u201cI\u2019m not saying right now, but maybe in the future like, if the opportunity comes up I\u2019m willing to take it.\u201d #VoteMimi Kirsty Archer, evicted renter: \u2018It shows people can actually change things\u2019 When Kirsty Archer complained to her landlord about the state of disrepair of the London flat she rented, she was served with an eviction order. Then, following the announcement that the government was going to scrap these section 21 eviction notices \u2013 which enable landlords to evict tenants for no reason at all, so long as they give them two months\u2019 notice \u2013 she agreed to be interviewed on Sky News. It did not quite go as expected. \u201cI thought if you are a case study you would have the chance to talk about what happened to you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t really go like that. She was quite critical of me; it emerged during the interview that she had been a landlord herself. I was quite surprised about the line of questioning.\u201d She is the Sky journalist \u2013 and landlord \u2013 Jayne Secker. \u201cThat\u2019s just the housing market isn\u2019t it?\u201d Secker said to Archer, on air, about the extortionate rents in London. And she went on to have a moan about some of her own experiences renting out properties to young people who don\u2019t know how to do anything around the house and can\u2019t even change a lightbulb. It had gone from a piece about scrapping section 21 to the woes of being a property owner, and Archer came away thinking it had gone really badly. \u201cShe said at the end that I swore, and apologised for me swearing.\u201d (Archer had used the term \u201cpissed off\u201d.) Archer\u2019s flatmate \u2013 and fellow evictee \u2013 did not think it had gone so badly for her, and did the sensible thing in the situation: he uploaded the clip to Twitter. Two days later \u2013 after retweets from, among others, Owen Jones, Philip Pullman and Ellie Goulding \u2013 it had garnered 4m views. The story then not only returned to being one about renters\u2019 rights, but now it also became one about patronising journalists who are wildly out of touch with the living situations of the nation\u2019s young people, and woefully ignorant of the renting crisis. Secker ended up apologising, saying that she \u201cgot the tone and content of an interview wrong\u201d and had \u201ctaken the many comments on board\u201d. \u201cObviously it resonated with a lot of people,\u201d Archer says. \u201cI think one of the nicest things was all the comments from random people online saying well done and it\u2019s so good you are speaking out for us.\u201d Archer works for the charity Rethink Mental Illness and knows a thing or two about the link between housing and mental health. She is one of the lucky ones; she got a platform. Since \u2013 and as a result of \u2013 her TV appearance she has been to the annual OECD forum in Paris, sat on panels, spoken in schools. \u201cI think it shows that if people take action and are willing to do something rather than just letting it happen, then they can actually change things and help maybe more than just themselves.\u201d The renting situation is still rubbish. The ban on letting fees is positive, likewise scrapping section 21s, although that hasn\u2019t come into effect yet, and who knows when it will, with everything else going on. Archer is renting a new place in Streatham, south London, \u00a3675 a month plus bills. The washing machine broke, but it got fixed. \u201cThe landlord is a lot more reasonable this time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>We live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural divides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC\u2019s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion.</p> <p>Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The \u201cmainstream media\u201d is the principal focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking.</p> <p>But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/oct/07/why-cant-we-agree-on-whats-true-any-more-podcast\">Why can\u2019t we agree on what\u2019s true any more? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This mentality now spans the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with \u201cmainstream\u201d institutions has become a mass sentiment.</p> <p>This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable.</p> <p>This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either individually or collectively.</p> <p>Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">publicly accused</a> of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed \u201cpost-truth\u201d). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: individuals are increasingly suspicious of the \u201cofficial\u201d stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/reasons-we-cannot-agree-on-whats-true\">Reasons we cannot agree on what\u2019s true | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions.</p> <p>But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/the-myth-of-eurabia-how-a-far-right-conspiracy-theory-went-mainstream\" title=\"\">conspiracy theorist</a>, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world?</p> <p>It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/03/how-the-news-took-over-reality\" title=\"\">unimaginable excess</a> of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable.</p> <p>And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups \u2013 millennials or the white working-class, say \u2013 are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality.</p> <p>This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become <em>too </em>concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases.</p> <p>The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/21/anti-vaxxers-delivery-ward-doctor-mother-newborn\" title=\"\">anti-vaxx</a> movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society.</p> <p>But away from these eye-catching cases, things look less clear-cut. The majority of people in northern Europe still regularly encounter mainstream news and information. Britain is a long way from the US experience, thanks principally to the presence of the BBC, which, for all its faults, still performs a basic function in providing a common informational experience. It is treated as a primary source of news by 60% of people in the UK.

If we think of an echo chamber as a sealed environment, which only circulates opinions and facts that are agreeable to its participants, it is a rather implausible phenomenon. Research by the Oxford Internet Institute suggests that just 8% of the UK public are at risk of becoming trapped in such a clique.</p> <p>Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/10/liverpool-ban-the-sun-newspaper-over-hillsborough-coverage\" title=\"\">lies about Hillsborough</a> to the BBC\u2019s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s.</p> <p>What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism\" title=\"\">anti-heroes</a> or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on individual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment.</p> <p>There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/ben-stokes-attacks-despicable-sun-story-family-tragedy\" title=\"\">Ben Stokes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/15/gareth-thomas-revealing-hiv-status-will-tackle-stigma\" title=\"\">Gareth Thomas</a>, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media\u2019s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain\u2019s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened.</p> <p>The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the \u201cmainstream media\u201d, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased \u2013 as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets.</p> <p>Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is \u201cbig data\u201d, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies.</p> <p>The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial.</p> <p>But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today\u2019s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties.</p> <p>The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged \u201cimportant\u201d to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon\u2019s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately.</p> <p>This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply \u201cspeak for itself\u201d. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention \u2013 the ultimate in scientific objectivity.</p> <p>Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that \u201cwe might describe the contemporary media moment \u2013 and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation \u2013 as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness\u201d. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data \u2013 CCTV, records of digital activity and so on \u2013 now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison.</p> <p>One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. \u201cPics or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that \u201cthe camera doesn\u2019t lie\u201d has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is \u201cso show me\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them.</p> <p>On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable.</p> <p>On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming \u2013 greater than human intelligence can comprehend \u2013 our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the \u201cframes\u201d that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning.</p> <p>What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn\u2019t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning.</p> <p>Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person\u2019s offcut is another person\u2019s revealing nugget. </p> <p>Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one\u2019s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as \u201cnutpicking\u201d). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or \u201cfake news\u201d, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation.</p> <p>Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason.</p> <p>The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with individual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4270f90ae3c597d0be74305ead9aa7c72d1e8855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4270f90ae3c597d0be74305ead9aa7c72d1e8855/73_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Maitlis \u2018rolling her eyes\u2019 on Newsnight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minor gestures pored over for hidden meanings \u2026 Emily Maitlis (left) with Nadhim Zahawi and Barry Gardiner on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/mar/13/has-emily-maitlis-captured-the-mood-of-the-nation-brexit-eyeroll-video\">rolled her eyes</a> at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2018/dec/19/corbyn-appears-to-call-may-a-stupid-woman-during-pmqs-video\" title=\"\">mouthing</a> during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions? Who took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-team-photo-partner-carrie-symonds\" title=\"\">photo</a> of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies.</p> <p>While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of \u201cbias\u201d means \u201cthat\u2019s not my perspective\u201d. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, \u201cthe fundamental question of the web\u201d is: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I consulted?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy.</p> <p>This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the \u201cwill of the people\u201d is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the individuals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/aug/08/boris-johnson-makes-policy-announcement-at-his-desk-via-facebook-live-video\" title=\"\">begun to use</a> Facebook Live to speak directly to \u201cthe people\u201d from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented.</p> <p>What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to \u201ctruth\u201d, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years.</p> <p>What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead?</p> <p>If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes.</p> <p>The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch\" title=\"\">Rupert Murdoch</a>, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the division between the two.</p> <p>Then there are those individuals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/16/bbc-james-purnell-director-radio-education-young-diverse-audiences\" title=\"\">James Purnell</a>. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/26/evening-standard-reports-loss-amid-ad-struggles-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Evening Standard</a>, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily Telegraph, which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the Telegraph website proudly includes a \u201cBest of Boris\u201d section.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism\">Why we stopped trusting elites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all \u201cmainstream\u201d democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people.

      "bodyText": "We live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural divides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC\u2019s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion. Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The \u201cmainstream media\u201d is the principal focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking. But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate. This mentality now spans the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with \u201cmainstream\u201d institutions has become a mass sentiment. This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable. This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either individually or collectively. Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are publicly accused of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed \u201cpost-truth\u201d). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: individuals are increasingly suspicious of the \u201cofficial\u201d stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves. On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions. But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the conspiracy theorist, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world? It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an unimaginable excess of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable. And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions. * * * The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups \u2013 millennials or the white working-class, say \u2013 are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality. This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become too concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases. The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the anti-vaxx movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society. But away from these eye-catching cases, things look less clear-cut. The majority of people in northern Europe still regularly encounter mainstream news and information. Britain is a long way from the US experience, thanks principally to the presence of the BBC, which, for all its faults, still performs a basic function in providing a common informational experience. It is treated as a primary source of news by 60% of people in the UK. Even 42% of Brexit party and Ukip voters get their news from the BBC. The panic surrounding echo chambers and so-called filter bubbles is largely groundless. If we think of an echo chamber as a sealed environment, which only circulates opinions and facts that are agreeable to its participants, it is a rather implausible phenomenon. Research by the Oxford Internet Institute suggests that just 8% of the UK public are at risk of becoming trapped in such a clique. Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun\u2019s lies about Hillsborough to the BBC\u2019s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s. What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, anti-heroes or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on individual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment. There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of Ben Stokes and Gareth Thomas, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media\u2019s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain\u2019s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened. The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the \u201cmainstream media\u201d, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased \u2013 as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal. * * * Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets. Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is \u201cbig data\u201d, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies. The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial. But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today\u2019s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties. The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged \u201cimportant\u201d to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon\u2019s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately. This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply \u201cspeak for itself\u201d. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention \u2013 the ultimate in scientific objectivity. Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that \u201cwe might describe the contemporary media moment \u2013 and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation \u2013 as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness\u201d. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data \u2013 CCTV, records of digital activity and so on \u2013 now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison. One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. \u201cPics or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that \u201cthe camera doesn\u2019t lie\u201d has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is \u201cso show me\u201d. * * * This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them. On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable. On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming \u2013 greater than human intelligence can comprehend \u2013 our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the \u201cframes\u201d that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning. What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn\u2019t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning. Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person\u2019s offcut is another person\u2019s revealing nugget. Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one\u2019s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as \u201cnutpicking\u201d). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or \u201cfake news\u201d, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation. Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason. The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with individual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments. Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn mouthing during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions? Who took the photo of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies. While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of \u201cbias\u201d means \u201cthat\u2019s not my perspective\u201d. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, \u201cthe fundamental question of the web\u201d is: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I consulted?\u201d * * * What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy. This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the \u201cwill of the people\u201d is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the individuals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently begun to use Facebook Live to speak directly to \u201cthe people\u201d from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented. What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to \u201ctruth\u201d, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years. What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead? If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes. The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of Rupert Murdoch, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the division between the two. Then there are those individuals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and James Purnell. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the Evening Standard, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily Telegraph, which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the Telegraph website proudly includes a \u201cBest of Boris\u201d section.) Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all \u201cmainstream\u201d democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people. One of the reasons they are able to do this is because there is a grain of truth in what they say. The financial obstacles confronting critical, independent, investigative media are significant. If the Johnson administration takes a more sharply populist turn, the political obstacles could increase, too \u2013 Channel 4 is frequently held up as an enemy of Brexit, for example. But let us be clear that an independent, professional media is what we need to defend at the present moment, and abandon the misleading and destructive idea that \u2013 thanks to a combination of ubiquitous data capture and personal passions \u2013 the truth can be grasped directly, without anyone needing to report it. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",
