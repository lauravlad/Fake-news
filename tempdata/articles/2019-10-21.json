There is a creeping erosion of respect towards some parliamentary traditions.</p> <p>Bryant, MP since 2001 for the Rhondda Valley, a former coalmining area in South Wales, has a 14,000-vote majority in the seat over Plaid Cymru, which came second in 2017.

In a special sitting of parliament this weekend, Oliver Letwin, the former Tory minister, managed to amend the motion so that parliament withheld its support until MPs were able to pass the full Brexit legislation and properly scrutinise the deal.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The bill with which the government hopes to implement its Brexit deal was introduced. Some MPs complained that the three days they were given to scrutinise the draft legislation was insufficient and amounted to an attempt to prevent proper scrutiny. Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled that it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. Bercow said it would break longstanding conventions for MPs to debate and vote on the agreement struck in Brussels last week, little more than two days after Saturday\u2019s historic sitting. \u201cToday\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion, and the house has decided the matter. Today\u2019s circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s circumstances,\u201d Bercow said in the Commons on Monday. Soft Brexit Tory MPs and independents are resisting the idea of attaching a customs union to Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill, meaning it would likely need an alliance of all opposition parties to pass. Conservative MPs and former Tories, who previously backed the idea of a customs union, suggested on Tuesday they would prefer not to reopen the issue and wanted to support Johnson\u2019s deal. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation caucus, and Oliver Letwin, who has been heavily involved in the parliamentary fight against a no-deal Brexit, both indicated they would back Johnson\u2019s deal without a customs union appended. The unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted. Peter Altmaier, a key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he believed either a technical extension to allow extra time for legislation to pass, or a longer period to accommodate a general election or second referendum would be offered. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has rejected a call by the UK government to end a case examining whether Boris Johnson broke a promise that he would not try to sabotage the request for a Brexit extension. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the Benn act but also sent another, personal, letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have the full story: Earlier, we reported that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has announced a review of the immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex, following the death of Harry Dunn. Now, a spokesman for Dunn\u2019s family, Radd Seiger, has told the Press Association: The family just has absolutely no confidence in Dominic Raab. He said we didn\u2019t go to him or his department for help while we were in the United States \u2013 that\u2019s because he is the last person we would go to for help after the meeting we had with him. The family are angry tonight. They are probably angrier now than they have been at any stage in this entire process. Dominic Raab said the ball is in Northamptonshire police\u2019s court for keeping us up to date with the investigation. The chief constable has told us he can\u2019t answer the questions we had for him. Somebody is lying and the family are sick of it. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has set out the timetabling of the bill\u2019s progress through parliament. Responding to an intervention by the Independent Group for Change MP, Anna Soubry, he has said: The second reading debate will be the normal second reading debate and will go to seven o\u2019clock tomorrow. On the second day, 12 hours of sitting divided into four sections of three hours with a specific section reserved, and the right honourable lady, the member for Broxtowe, might be pleased about this, with three hours specifically reserved for motions relating to a second referendum. So, members who are concerned about that will have the opportunity to debate it. And then, on Thursday, eight hours for proceedings on consideration up to and including third reading. The shadow Brexit secretary, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer, has accused the prime minister of seeking to prevent proper scrutiny of his bill. This is a bill to implement Boris Johnson\u2019s deeply flawed plan for Brexit. It is outrageous to deny parliament the chance to scrutinise this incredibly important legislation properly. Ministers are trying to bounce MPs into signing off a bill that could cause huge damage to our country. We can\u2019t trust this prime minister. The truth is Boris Johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal, the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities across the country. The government has been accused of trying to ram through its Brexit deal this evening. The EU withdrawal agreement bill has just been introduced for its first reading and MPs will be debating it tomorrow. After the bill\u2019s introduction, the Independent Group for Change MP, Chris Leslie, told MPs: We know, for example, that Commons committee stage of the Treaty of Rome was not three days, or two days, it was 22 days. For the Maastricht Treaty, 23 days in committee stage. The Treaty of Lisbon: 11 days. Treaty of Amsterdam: five days. Then the Single European Act four days and then the smallest of them all the Treaty of Nice three days at committee. So, in total, five days of Commons consideration for the Treaty of Nice to be reformed. So, this is an unprecedentedly short period of time to dedicate to a massive and momentous piece of legislation. And, personally Mr Speaker, I am very worried that this motion that we are now debating, (is) the first in a series of attempts by the government to stage what is essentially the ramming through of a piece of legislation, in I regard a disorderly way. The withdrawal agreement bill includes a provision to enable the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal to be ratified in time for the UK to leave with an agreement on 31 October. Under the provisions of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (CRAG), an international treaty \u2013 such as the Brexit deal \u2013 must be laid before Parliament for at least 21 sitting days before ratification to take place. However, in order for the government\u2019s timetable to be met, there is a provision in the WAB which \u201cdisapplies\u201d the relevant section of the CRAG. The withdrawal agreement bill has been given its first reading in the House of Commons, with MPs now poring over every line in the text and explanatory notes. It contains some protections on workers\u2019 rights, such as a \u201cnon-regression principle\u201d and the promise that parliament would get a vote on the negotiating mandate for the EU future relationship and the form of a final trade deal. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to convince wavering pro-deal Labour MPs to vote for it. There is also the potential for hardline Eurosceptics to balk at some elements when they look at the detail of what will happen in the transition period and the potential for that to be extended for another two years. Soft Brexit Tories may also not be convinced there are enough safeguards to stop the UK crashing out on WTO terms at the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit spokesman Tom Brake has responded to the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill, saying: The Tory Brexit plan would hurt jobs, the environment and vital public services including the NHS. The Conservative government is trying to crash this bill through Parliament before anyone realises just how bad it is. MPs have had a chance to vote on Brexit again and again, yet as the Conservative government bring another withdrawal agreement to parliament they still refuse to let the people have the final say. If parliamentarians can change their minds then the people should be able to too. Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop Brexit. Our priority is to secure a People\u2019s Vote with the option to stay in the EU. The government has published the full text of the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill. The document, which sets out how the government intends to implement the Brexit deal, runs to 110 pages and MPs have been given until Thursday to scrutinise it and vote on it. Here\u2019s a brief look at it, courtesy of Huffington Post UK\u2019s Paul Waugh: The immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex will be reviewed in the aftermath of the death of Harry Dunn, the foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said. He has told MPs: We will continue to fight for justice for them. I\u2019ve already commissioned a review of the immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the Croughton annex holding privileges and immunities under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As this case has demonstrated, I do not believe the current arrangements are right and the review will look at how we can make sure that the arrangements at Croughton cannot be used in this way again. Gove has confirmed that direct rule of Northern Ireland by Westminster would be necessary if Stormont is not back up and running once Brexit goes through. But he says it\u2019s a step \u201cno one should take lightly\u201d. In response, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said: The prime minister thinks the only way to get legislation for this sellout deal through this House of Commons is to bully and blackmail MPs with the threat of no deal. But the prime minister has lost the consent of the House. He double-crossed the DUP. He\u2019s taken a bulldozer to most of our procedures. He reminds me more than anything else of acting in the manner of the Godfather, casting confetti at a Mafia family wedding in the way that he\u2019s disposed of the goodwill of the House. Continuing his statement, Gove said: It remains the case that Northern Ireland will face unique challenges in a no-deal Brexit and we will need to take steps to ensure effective governance and to give direction to the Northern Ireland civil service. This arrangement settlement has been sustainable to date, but leaving without a deal would represent a formidable challenge to the current position. In that case, we would have to start formal engagement with the Irish government about further arrangements for providing strengthened decision-making, and that would include the real possibility of restoring a form of direct rule. We will, of course, do everything to ensure that the interests of all communities across Ireland were safeguarded in any arrangements. We all must recognise that this would be a gravestone, from which experience shows us it would be hard to return, particularly in the context of leaving without a deal. Madame deputy speaker, even as we prepare for the challenges of no-deal, we will make the case at every forum that we can for leaving with a good deal. Delivering a statement to MPs on the government\u2019s preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the minister responsible \u2013 Michael Gove \u2013 has said: Parliament had the opportunity on Saturday to support a meaningful vote which would have allowed us to proceed smoothly to ratification of our deal and exit on 31 October. But the House instead voted in such a way as to put an orderly exit on that day in doubt. With no clear agreement yet in this House to ratify our withdrawal agreement and no certainty that an extension will be granted by 31 October, I must I fear take the appropriate steps now to prepare for the increased possibility that the legal default position will follow, and we will leave on 31 October without a deal. The clear advice to me now from officials is that we must now intensify contingency arrangements. We will now accelerate our efforts to help businesses and individuals mitigate any dislocation and disruption that may ensue. Hundreds of public servants across the UK will have to be redeployed, they will transfer to work in operation centres ready to identify challenges, work together to resolve problems quickly, and implement contingency plans. And, of course, we must maintain our public information campaign, from tomorrow this will reflect the renewed urgency of preparation.\u201d Ken Clarke, now sitting as an independent MP, has said all-night Commons sittings were used when debating the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and much time was given to the original European Communities bill. Clarke, who had the Conservative whip removed after he backed attempts to block the UK leaving the EU without a deal, asked the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg: They were both debated for weeks on end with many all-night sittings. I think the Maastricht Bill we had at least 20-odd days sitting in order to satisfy the Eurosceptic members of the Conservative party who wanted full discussion of it. So, can my right honourable friend reassure me that the government is not simply to try to confine debate by narrowing the time and it is content, if the House wishes, to facilitate as much time as we need to consider it carefully? And I see no reason at all why we should just all rise in the evening so that everybody can go to dinner and not sit on a Friday for the convenience of the House of Lords. If the government is, for some reason, insistent on dashing for this completely silly and irrelevant date which it keeps staking its fate on then give some proper time for debate. Two-and-a-bit days of ordinary parliamentary hours is plainly quite insufficient. Rees-Mogg responded by describing Clarke as \u201csomebody who has always wanted us to remain in the European Union and disapproves of referendums\u201d. This is relevant, he says, because Clarke has never tried to hide his views using procedural methods. Using accelerated procedures has come about because of the deadline that we have of 31 October. And here I disagree with him: This is not a phony deadline. The deadline was set because of the work of article 50 and, the point being, that it should have ended in March. The SNP Commons leader, Pete Wishart, said: What he proposes in this business statement around the withdrawal agreement bill is totally unacceptable. Three days to consider a bill, somebody suggested it\u2019s 100 pages, how on earth are we going to have the chance to assess that properly? No economic impacts, no economic assessments. Wishart said it was only last week that the Queen \u201cput on her best crown\u201d and came to Parliament for the Queen\u2019s Speech. He asked when that would be discussed, and asked if it was just a \u201csupreme waste of time\u201d. Rees-Mogg told the Commons the \u201cBenn act and another known as the Boles Cooper act\u201d were brought through at short notice. He said: \u201cA king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week.\u201d Back to Brexit and the shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, has told MPs: At every stage, the government has been running scared of this House and democracy and it\u2019s now attempting to force through a flawed Brexit deal which sells out people\u2019s jobs, rights and our communities. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, began his reply by condemning abuse aimed at politicians after he and his son were targeted as they left Parliament on Saturday. I\u2019ve had many really kind inquiries about my son. He is a 12-year-old boy, he found nothing more exciting than being escorted home by the police \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he should have found it so exciting but he did. As a really serious point, I think it\u2019s very important that MPs can come and go from the precincts of Parliament feeling safe, and we must think about whether there\u2019s more we need to do and whether sessional orders may be helpful in that regard. Rees-Mogg said the withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s programme motion, which outlines its timetable, will be \u201cdown tonight in an orderly way\u201d before noting: \u201cThe bill, of course, won\u2019t be pulled.\u201d He also dismissed Vaz\u2019s claims and pointed to the government\u2019s two attempts to hold an election, adding: \u201cIf anybody is frit they are on the opposition benches.\u201d DUP MPs have asked for clarification from the UK government on whether Northern Ireland goods travelling to other parts of the UK will require customs declarations. The DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: Mr Speaker these responses are calamitous. Can he answer that question that was asked earlier: is it the case that Northern Ireland goods will require customs declarations to enter what is supposed to be unfettered access to the rest of their own country? To heckles of \u201canswer it\u201d from fellow DUP MPs, Smith said: On the issue of checks and forms, unfettered access is a key part of this protocol, and I\u2019ll be working to ensure we deliver on that in the interest of Northern Ireland business in the coming weeks. Calling for Stormont MLAs to have their pay reduced again due to the deadlock, Lady Sylvia Hermon said: As members of the legislative assembly at Stormont continue to be unable to fulfil their responsibilities, what consideration has the secretary of state given to cutting their salaries yet again? Smith said: I plan to review all elements relating to the assembly if we\u2019re unable to move things forwards over the coming days. The chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, suggested that the UK Parliament consider legislating on the Irish Language act to get the talks at Stormont moving. The secretary of state has provided a window which could possibly see this House overcome the hurdle which seems insurmountable for the parties in Northern Ireland and that is to legislate for the Irish Language act; therefore taking it out of the debate between the principal parties in Northern Ireland and, in my judgment, removing the hurdle which the roadblock, sorry to mix my metaphors, to getting Stormont back up and running. Responding, Smith said: The Irish Language act is one of a number of issues that are being discussed in the talks process. I\u2019d say again the most important and the best way to resolve these issues is through the Stormont talks. Dodds\u2019 colleague, Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson, said he \u201ccannot emphasise enough\u201d how important the principle of consent is to unionists. The idea that a decision of the momentous nature of the one we will be expected to take in four years\u2019 time does not reflect adequately the principle of consent \u2013 as expressed in the Belfast agreement \u2013 has serious implications for our ability to support the restoration of devolution without that safeguard. And I say with all seriousness to the secretary of state, if this issue is not addressed it goes well beyond this Brexit deal. Responding, Smith told MPS: This protocol is for a reserved matter. It is not for the assembly. The Belfast agreement is extremely clear that there will be matters which will not be subject to the consent mechanism in the assembly. The DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, accused the government of not doing enough to restore powersharing to Northern Ireland. On health, education, crime, policing, investment and all the rest of it still the government sits on its hands and allows no government for Northern Ireland. Is he now realising that with Brexit coming we have to have power in the hands of ministers whether in the assembly or here? We can\u2019t go on abdicating that decision? Smith was asked by the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd, whether he could assure MPs the Police Service of Northern Ireland has the \u201cresources in the event of any form of civic disturbance?\u201d Lloyd said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cemphasise what kind of civic disturbance there could be\u201d but said there could be a \u201cperiod of prolonged public unrest\u201d. Smith replied: The government has invested a further \u00a320m, or nearly \u00a320m, and stands ready to continue to support the PSNI financially. This is a sensitive period, with police officers under threat day in, day out. But I am comforted that the PSNI is well resourced, and I think it is doing an exceptional job. I don\u2019t see any need for any circumstance for the British Army operating in that way. The PSNI are doing all of the functions along with our security services in an exceptional manner. In the Commons, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Julian Smith, has been facing questions. He has told MPs: A new legal framework for lawful access to abortion services in Northern Ireland will be put in place by 31 March 2020, in line with the 2018 UN CEDAW report. I will be consulting on the new framework very soon. On same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships, regulations are to be made no later than 13 January 2020. There are two key areas we are going to consult on. How to allow for religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, and also the issue of conversion from civil partnership to marriage and vice-versa. At the latest, the first civil same-sex marriages will take place on the week of Valentine\u2019s Day 2020. There is clearly this concern about how does the [Northern Ireland] assembly \u2013 now the law is changing \u2013 how does it influence? It can influence, but we need to be clear that the law from tomorrow has changed across those two areas, and we can, obviously we will hear the views of the assembly, and we will work with them, but the law, from tomorrow, has changed. \u2022 Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled that it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. Bercow said it would break longstanding conventions for MPs to debate and vote on the agreement struck in Brussels last week, little more than two days after Saturday\u2019s historic sitting. \u201cToday\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion, and the house has decided the matter. Today\u2019s circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s circumstances,\u201d Bercow said in the Commons on Monday. \u2022 Soft-Brexit Tory MPs and independents are resisting the idea of attaching a customs union to Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill, meaning it would likely need an alliance of all opposition parties to pass. Conservative MPs and former Tories, who previously backed the idea of a customs union, suggested on Tuesday they would prefer not to reopen the issue and wanted to support Johnson\u2019s deal. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation caucus, and Oliver Letwin, who has been heavily involved in the parliamentary fight against a no-deal Brexit, both indicated they would back Johnson\u2019s deal without a customs union appended. \u2022 The unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted.

The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is on his feet in the House of Commons and tells MPs that the government will try to pass key Brexit legislation through the Commons in three days this week. He added that the withdrawal agreement bill would be debated at second reading and committee stage on Tuesday, with further discussion on Wednesday before the conclusion of proceedings on Thursday. Rees-Mogg also spoke about his experience, and that of his son, as they were escorted by police out of parliament on Saturday. He was one of several MPs who the police guarded amid heckling. Diane Abbott was another. \u201cMy 12-year-old son found nothing more exciting than being escorted by police,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who went on to say that it might be necessary to look at measures to ensure that MPs are able to come and go. For readers wondering where Boris Johnson was earlier when Steve Barclay was taking questions on Brexit, including some asking why the prime minister as not doing so, we\u2019ve been told by Downing Street that he is in Downing Street. But why wasn\u2019t Johnson taking questions? \u201cBecause Steve Barclay was,\u201d a spokesperson replied when asked. I\u2019ve conferred with colleagues and, as we understand it, convention is that you can\u2019t demand a particular minister replies to your urgent question. As it\u2019s urgent they might not be available, and more junior ministers do often fill in. In the Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has been taking questions about Brexit, attempts to restore the assembly at Stormont and moves to decriminalise abortion. On the latter, Smith says that a consultation is due to start in the coming days. \u201cA new legal framework for lawful access to abortion services in Northern Ireland will be put in place by March 31 2020 in line with the 2018 UN CEDAW report. I will be consulting on the new framework very soon. \u201cOn same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships, regulations are to be made no later than January 13 2020. \u201cThere are two key areas we are going to consult on. How to allow for religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, and also the issue of conversion from civil partnership to marriage and vice-versa.\u201d He added: \u201cAt the latest, the first civil same-sex marriages will take place on the week of Valentine\u2019s Day 2020.\u201d Beyond the UK and Europe, events at Westminster continue to generate head-scratching from media in other parts of the world. My colleague Daniel Avelar Guimar\u00e3es has been taking a look: In the US, the Washington Post highlighted Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201chumiliating defeat in the House of Commons\u201d on Saturday. Using a slightly more optimistic tone, the New York Times reports that Johnson \u201cstill has a surprisingly good chance of leading Britain out of the bloc\u201d because of disagreements within opposition parties regarding their strategy for Brexit. The view on Brexit from the Middle East is also far from unanimous. Israel\u2019s Haaretz said that Johnson faces a \u201cpotentially perilous ratification\u201d of his Brexit plans as opposition MPs try to amend his proposed divorce bill. On the other hand, UAE\u2019s the National said No 10 was \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that it could get parliament\u2019s approval fin an upcoming vote, and mentioned that the pound \u201creached its highest in more than five months at $1.3011\u201d amid investor optimism. And in South American media, Britain is shown as a country in turmoil. In Brazil, Folha de S.Paulo compared Johnson\u2019s increasing isolation in parliament to the failures of his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron, further describing Brexit as a \u201creputation-crushing machine\u201d for prime ministers. In neighbouring Argentina, La Nacion said divisions in the House of Commons reflected broader trends in British society, mentioning an Opinium/Observer poll that puts support for a second referendum at 42% against 43% who reject a new vote. The government is coming under fire this evening over confirmation by the Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, that Northern Irish businesses will have to complete exit declarations when sending goods to Great Britain under the terms of the Brexit deal. As reported by Politico, Barclay was correcting an answer he gave minutes earlier to the House of Lords European Union committee, when he said he did not think such forms would be required under the deal. He told peers: \u201cWe\u2019ve said in terms of [trade] from NI to GB that it will be frictionless and so there wouldn\u2019t be [declaration forms].\u201d The Labour Peer, Stewart Wood, was the committee member who pressed Barclay and has been making hay on Twitter and says that Barclay\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d confirms two things \u201c1. The GB-NI border inside the UK will, from a commercial point of view, feel like a real border. 2. The Govt is trying to push through a vote on the deal before the text of the Withdrawal Bill is seen for a reason: the contents are alarming.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit Party leader, and the east Belfast DUP MP, Sammy Wilson, have both been weighing in: Urgent Brexit questions have been concluded now - the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, is taking questions - but the Westminster focus will shift back very swiftly in a while to Brexit when MPs react to the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill. They won\u2019t have long to read it, however, as the second reading of the bill \u2013 and with it, a chance to vote \u2013 comes as early as tomorrow. If you missed it, here\u2019s the moment from earlier when the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, ruled out allowing a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, has filed this piece on how Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker ruled it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. She adds that the government, meanwhile, still hopes to push the legislation necessary to enact Brexit through parliament in time to meet the 31 October deadline despite having reluctantly been compelled to send a letter asking for an extension to article 50, The withdrawal agreement bill was expected to be published later on Monday, with the key second reading vote likely to be held on Tuesday. MPs from across the house are then likely to table a string of amendments seeking to tweak the Brexit deal, including to force the government to negotiate a customs union with the EU27 and to subject it to a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. So what happens now? There is \u201cdisappointment\u201d from Downing Street, in the first soundings coming out of the prime minster\u2019s spokesperson. Paul Waugh of Huffpost UK tweets: Meanwhile, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has been reporting on a fresh headache for the government (and anyone struggling to keep up with Brexit-related acronyms frankly): The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, is speaking now and makes the case again for a new referendum. If the prime minister was allowed to change his mind \u2013 and request an extension \u2013 then surely the British people should be allowed to do so. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, wants to know the whereabouts of Boris Johnson, who he says has been utterly humiliated by his defeat in the House of Commons on Saturday. The unsigned letter that was sent to Brussels at the weekend \u201clacked respect\u201d, he adds. Barclay replies that the crux of the issue was that the prime minister had complied with the law and had set out his well-known views on the issue. There isn\u2019t any word from him about where Johnson is. Ken Clarke is on his feet now, asking that the date of 31 October should no longer have the \u201csacred quality\u201d it has attained, though he would be personally quite happy if a withdrawal can be secured in the right way. \u201cThe date was not selected by the British public or the British government. It was a compromise selected by President Macron and others and was plucked out of the air,\u201d he adds. Barclay says that the prime minister has confirmed that the UK government would abide by the law, but has also left no one in any dount about what his position is. \u201cWe in this house want to collude with the British public to get Brexit done,\u201d he adds, sidestepping that second Corbyn question about whether some MPs are facing potential investigations for \u201ccolluding with foreign governments\u201d. Points of order have been concluded and Jeremy Corbyn is on his feet with the first of urgent questions, asking the prime minister to make a statement on his request for an extension on Brexit. Steven Barclay, the minister for Exiting the EU, responds in place of Boris Johnson by saying that the letter was sent in compliance with section one of the Benn act. The Labour leader says he admires Barclay for keeping a straight face as he gave that answer, accusing Johnson of sending the letter with \u201cposturing and attempts to distract\u201d. Despite having said that he would never request an extension, Corbyn adds that the prime minister has done so. He asks when he expects any EU extension to be granted and if the government can rule out reports that MPs could face jail for \u201ccolluding\u201d with foreign governments. Bercow says he has the sense that his ruling is \u201cprocedurally right\u201d, however irksome it is to some in the chamber. The Spectator\u2019s assistant editor, Isabel Hardman, meanwhile, separates the contributions from the floor as follows: Bercow adds: \u201cI have made a principled judgment and there is every opportunity for the government to have its way, with the approval of parliament, by the end of October.\u201d Crispin Blunt, another Tory MP, is on his feet and says he is one of the members who has formally recorded what he says has been Bercow\u2019s \u201cpartiality\u201d in the chair. Blunt asks if Bercow\u2019s ruling might be altered on the basis of what the response from Brussels might be to the letter(s) sent at the weekend by Downing Street. Cue another Bercow impression \u2013 this time of Willie Whitelaw: \u201cPersonally I think it is better to cross bridges when I come to them.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of political kickabout over a second referendum by the former Tory, now LibDem, Sarah Wollaston and the Conservative MP Desmond Swayne. Swayne says with a smile that he believes Bercow is right, but adds: \u201cBy the same logic, It\u2019s quite right for the voters not to have to answer the same question again.\u201d Bercow is warming up a bit now, telling Jenkin: \u201cWhen he was getting decisions in his favour he was not grumbling. He is grumbling now because he is getting the judgments that he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d A translation from the BBC\u2019s Andrew Sinclair: Bercow continues to defend himself under questioning, saying that one of the reason for the rules he has invoked was to prevent \u201cconflicting\u201d rulings on similar issues coming soon after the other \u201cin short order\u201d. \u201cAnd what could be shorter order than the next sitting day after the last judgment was made \u2026 and that was the rationale for the perfectly reasonable judgment that I have made,\u201d says the Speaker. Bernard Jenkin, the Brexit-supporting Tory MP, is on his feet insisting that the motion the government wanted to be voted on today was very different from the one MPs considered on Saturday. To \u201cooohs\u201d, he adds that the public administration committee, which he chairs, will be holding a hearing on the role of the Speaker. Bercow replies that that it is absolutely right for the committee to do what it wanted to to and he was \u201centirely untroubled\u201d by it. Bercow breaks off into a (not unconvincing) Tony Benn impression to repeat the Labour MP\u2019s lament that politics should be about issues, not personalities, as he comes under further questioning about his ruling. The veteran Eurosceptic and Brexit, Bill Cash, has been on his feet urging Bercow to reconsider his decision in the light of the \u201claw of the land\u201d with regards to Britain\u2019s scheduled Brexit date. Bercow says he is stating the obvious: \u201cWhen you make a judgement on these matters that is controversial, some people are going to be pleased and some are going to be displeased.\u201d \u201cI have simply sought to discharge my obligations and to do what I believe to be right, and that is what the speaker has to do.\u201d The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has ruled that he will not permit MPs to have a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal today. \u201cMy ruling is that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so,\u201d he told MPs. Bercow says he hopes that the ruling and explanation are helpful to the house, before allowing the Tory MP Peter Bone to come in with a point of order. To laughter, Bone tells him that no one knew that the prime minister was going to send a letter or not to the EU seeking a Brexit extension. Surely this something that changed the circumstances in which the vote would take place. Bercow says that the question of whether a minister of the crown \u201cwould obey the law\u201d would be a material consideration on his part was not one that he took into account. Bercow says it is clear that the motions before the house are \u201cin substance the same\u201d and that the matter was decided as recently as 48 hours ago. Bercow is on his feet and says he has been reflecting. There are two issues, one of substance and the other of circumstances, to consider, he adds. First, he has to consider if the motion tabled by the government for today is the same in substance as that which was decided during Saturday\u2019s sitting. This looks like the last question in defence questions. So which way will Bercow go? Here\u2019s Ian Dunt, the editor of Politics.co.uk on what\u2019ll happen if the Speaker (against expectations) gives a green light to a meaningful vote: And, meanwhile, a little sympathy for the notoriously shy (ahem) Mr Bercow \u2026 It\u2019s felt like a bit of a phoney war thus far today but we\u2019re minutes away from (potentially) a key moment, when we should learn if the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, will allow MPs to have a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The word is that Bercow will be on his feet at about 3.35pm London time. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and junior ministers have been taking questions and that is due to start winding up shortly. The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a backbench amendment attached, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed. Downing Street has also, meanwhile, said it would pull the vote if any amendments are selected that would \u201crender the vote pointless\u201d. \u201cThere is no point having a meaningless vote \u2013 the government would pull the motion. We will go ahead with the introduction of the WAB with second reading tomorrow,\u201d the PM\u2019s official spokesman said. An update from MEPs, via the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has just told the BBC she would be \u201cminded\u201d to vote on a customs union amendment if it is in the right form, but added quickly that her party was still intent on pushing for a second referendum. MPs need more time to scrutinise the government\u2019s deal, however, she added. As well as writing to Boris Johnson, the first ministers for Wales and Scotland have also send one to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, urging him to support an extension to Brexit that would allow MPs to scrutinise the deal \u2013 and perhaps even hold a second referendum. The BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley tweets: We heard earlier that Lisa Nandy had emerged as one of the Labour MPs who would support the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) at second reading, but it seems fairly certain that it will be opposed by her party. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, tweets: To recap, the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill is likely to be held tomorrow if it is introduced later today. The second reading will be the first occasion that members of parliament can vote on the proposed legislation. News out of Brussels, though probably not of the type that will be welcomed by Brexit supporters hoping that they might have seen the last of Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for the past number of years. He\u2019s not going away, reports Politico. The first ministers for Wales and Scotland, Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon, have written to the prime minister urging the UK government to secure an extension from the European council that respects devolution and \u201callows our legislatures to carry out their proper constitutional and democratic functions\u201d. Part of their letter states: This bill will be among the most important piece of legislation ever considered by the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament and national assembly for Wales with far-reaching implications for the whole of the United Kingdom and our future well-being. Both our governments believe the deal you have negotiated with the EU will be even more damaging to Wales, Scotland and the United Kingdom than the previous unacceptable agreement made by your predecessor. We therefore wish to state in the clearest possible terms that we and our legislatures need time to analyse and consider the draft bill. We share the view which lay behind the amendment passed by a clear majority of the House of Commons that the time between now and 31 October provides insufficient opportunity to undertake this essential scrutiny Scottish judges have delayed a final ruling on whether Boris Johnson is in contempt of court to ensure he agrees to an extension to Brexit. Lord Carloway, the country\u2019s most senior judge, said they needed to be sure the prime minister did not try to block or sabotage the application he was forced to make on Saturday night for an extension to Brexit until 31 January. The court\u2019s decision, issued after a short hearing at the court of session in Edinburgh, means Johnson faces being held in contempt if judges rule he has failed to honour pledges made to court not to frustrate the extension process. Johnson sent an unsigned letter seeking the extension after the Commons voted narrowly in favour of postponing a vote on the government\u2019s revised deal to leave the UK. The legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, also requires the prime minister to accept an extension if it is offered by Brussels and the 27 other EU member states. The number-crunching continues around whether the numbers are there at Westminster for opposition parties to put a spoke in the wheel of the government today via an amendment creating a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment. While my colleague Peter Walker reckons that Labour, Liberal Democrats and others might just about \u201csqueak it\u201d if the DUP abstained, it\u2019s looking like a tall order. Joanna Cherry - the SNP MP and lawyer behind one of the series of court cases around the UK challenging Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks \u2013 has been tweeting about an experience on the streets today, contrasting it with the protection afforded to Andrea Leadsom when the Tory minister was heckled on Saturday. An attempt by the DUP to suspend the standing orders of the Stormont assembly to push through a private member\u2019s bill that would maintain Northern Ireland\u2019s ban on abortion has failed, as expected, because it requires the election of a speaker on a cross-community basis. At the start of today\u2019s proceedings \u2013 viewed variously as a stunt designed to play to the DUP\u2019s political base at a time when the party has been wrong-footed over Brexit or an articulation of a point of principle \u2013 there was a bid by anti-abortion assembly members to fast-track a piece of private member\u2019s legislation through in a single day to thwart the abortion reform. While the DUP and other unionist members were in attendance, the rest of the chamber\u2019s benches were largely empty. Sinn F\u00e9in has made clear it will not turn up to a sitting it has described as a circus while SDLP members walked out after describing the convening of the assembly as a \u201cstunt\u201d and making it clear that they would not be participating in the election of a speaker. The developments come as the abortion law will change in Northern Ireland at midnight on Monday when the Executive Formation Act 2019 comes into effect. MPs at Westminster successfully amended the government bill in the summer to include measures to end the near blanket prohibition on abortion and introduce same sex marriage. The current speaker, Robin Newton, said a new speaker would need to be in place before the assembly could turn to such a legislative bid. Newton said a further sitting of the assembly would be required to consider the bill and highlighted that the suspension of standing orders required cross-community support. Here\u2019s some footage, via the BBC\u2019s Mark Simpson, of the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, appealing to Newton. \u2022 Downing Street has insisted that MPs must be given \u201ca straight up and down\u201d vote on its Brexit deal amid speculation that the Speaker, John Bercow, will not permit it to take place. The government also said that any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure. The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a backbench amendment attached, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed. \u2022 The unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted. Peter Altmaier, a key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he believed either a technical extension to allow extra time for legislation to pass, or a longer period to accommodate a general election or second referendum would be offered. \u2022 Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has rejected a call by the UK government to end a case examining whether Boris Johnson broke a promise that he would not try to sabotage the request for a Brexit extension. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the Benn act but also sent another, personal, letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full. \u2022 Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now from Frances Perraudin. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect, my colleague Daniel Avelar reports. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. This will be the first time in nearly three years that the parliament in Belfast has met, since legislators from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in nationalists failed to reach a power-sharing agreement after the devolved government collapsed in January 2017. The recall follows a petition promoted by anti-abortion campaigners and signed by 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), aiming to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians. MLAs would need to form an executive before the midnight deadline to block the abortion reform, but that is highly unlikely as nationalist parties said their members would not attend today\u2019s session. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, defended the recall, saying it would allow MLAs to \u201cdebate the issue\u201d of abortion in Northern Ireland, while a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson called it a \u201cpointless political stunt\u201d. As well as the decriminalisation of abortion, same-sex marriage is also due to become legal on Tuesday after a separate Westminster vote in July. Here\u2019s the full report from the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is in court in Edinburgh where Lord Carloway has rejected a call by the UK government to halt proceedings because the prime minister has met his legal requirements under the Benn act. (See my earlier post.) The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full \u2013 ie sought and, if it is offered, accepted a Brexit extension from the EU. A date for the next hearing is yet to be fixed. Labour MP Lisa Nandy has said that she would support the withdrawal agreement bill (the WAB) at second reading. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live, she said MPs should be able to debate the substance of the bill and the terms on which we leave the EU before approving the deal (as per the Letwin amendment) and to do it the other way around (passing the meaningful vote before debating the WAB) was \u201cholding the country to ransom\u201d with the threat of no deal. She said she would support the bill at second reading but that the big question was what comes next. She tweeted this this morning: The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is appearing at the Lords EU select committee, where he is talking about \u201cscrutiny of Brexit negotiations\u201d. \u201cI think the deal is a win, not just for the UK, but for the EU as well, who want to see the UK leave in a smooth and orderly way. And it was obviously frustrating, I think, for many of us on Saturday that we were not able to have the meaningful vote,\u201d he said. Barclay said MPs had already voted on a range of amendments through the indicative vote process and rejected them. He said the Letwin amendment represented a \u201cmoving of the goalposts\u201d from the opposition claiming they were concerned about the prospect of no-deal Brexit to them saying the concern was now about wanting more time. He keeps describing the withdrawal agreement as \u201cthe winding down arrangements\u201d and stressing that there will be a lots of issues for MPs to debate when it comes to the \u201cfuture arrangements\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is in court in Edinburgh where Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and two other judges will hear allegations that the prime minister broke a promise he made to the court that he would not try to sabotage the request for an extension. The UK government\u2019s lawyers pledged in writing and in court this month that the prime minister would honour the provisions of the Benn act, seeking an extension to article 50 if he failed to get a Brexit deal passed by 19 October. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the act but also sent another, personal letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. Lawyers for three anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to argue that these steps are a clear breach of the government\u2019s promises to the court. If the three judges find Johnson is in contempt, he could theoretically face a fine or even jail. Here\u2019s Severin\u2019s curtain raiser article. He\u2019ll also be tweeting from court. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, has this from the morning\u2019s lobby briefing. No 10 confirmed that the government will pull the meaningful vote if anyone tries to amend it with a \u201cLetwin 2\u201d-style change. This is all pretty hypothetical as John Bercow, the Speaker, seems likely to rule it out of order this afternoon. Why is the government so keen on a meaningful vote when it also needs to pass a withdrawal agreement bill? The theory is that if it passed, then Boris Johnson would try to rescind his request to the EU for an article 50 extension, arguing MPs have given their consent for a deal. This morning, No 10 refused to comment on whether this ruse could be tried. The European commission has confirmed that \u2013 despite the prime minister\u2019s unconventional approach to requesting a further Brexit delay \u2013 Brussels is considering the terms of a further prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership. A European commission spokeswoman said: President Tusk is now consulting leaders of the EU27 on this and it is first and foremost for the UK to explain the next steps. We from our side, of course, follow all the events in London this week very closely. What I can also add, the ratification process has been launched on the EU side. Michel Barnier debriefed EU ambassadors of the EU27 yesterday and he will debrief the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group this afternoon in Strasbourg. And as I mentioned, he will also debrief the college of commissioners. The request to extend article 50 was made by the UK\u2019s permanent representative to the EU. President Tusk acknowledged receipt of the request on Saturday and stated that he\u2019s now consulting with the EU27. So this form does not change anything. Lobby journalists are reporting that No 10 will pull the meaningful vote motion this afternoon if the Speaker allows amendments to it that render it \u201cmeaningless\u201d. \u201cThere is no point in having a meaningless vote,\u201d said the PM\u2019s spokesman. Another MP who previously backed a customs union is saying he would not support such an amendment this time. My colleague Kate Lyons has this round-up of today\u2019s papers. Some are angry at what they see as Labour\u2019s attempts to \u2013 as the Daily Mail puts it \u2013 \u201ccancel Brexit by sabotaging withdrawal legislation\u201d. The FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne has a little bit more on how the afternoon could unfold. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has been doing the maths on which MPs could back an amendment for a customs union. Damian Green, a Tory MP and former member of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, has said that he would not vote for such an amendment. This is from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. We should find out around 2.30pm if Bercow is likely to allow the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d this afternoon. The government has confirmed that its Brexit bill, which enshrines the prime minister\u2019s deal with the EU into UK law, will be published later today. A press release from the Department for exiting the European Union reads: This deal abolishes the backstop in the old deal. The Government put forward a reasonable compromise, based on the key principles of consent for the people of Northern Ireland, and the UK leaving the EU Customs Union whole and entire, which was agreed at European Council last week. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill puts those internationally agreed obligations into domestic law. This week MPs will have the chance to pass this bill, to respect the result of the referendum and to leave with a deal on October 31 in an orderly and friendly way. MPs voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 in 2017 to start the process of leaving the EU and supporting this bill is the final stage to make that happen. This will allow the country to move on and for the Government to return its focus to delivering on the people\u2019s domestic priorities: investing in the NHS, tackling serious and violent crime, and levelling up funding on schools. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is quoted: MPs and Peers will today have in front of them a bill that will get Brexit done by October 31, protect jobs and the integrity of the UK, and enable us to move onto the people\u2019s priorities like health, education and crime. Hugo Dixon, an anti-Brexit campaigner, has written this piece of analysis, accusing Boris Johnson of \u201cpeddling untruths and spraying around promises\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry QC, who was involved in recent legal action aimed at forcing Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn act, has said she supports extending Brexit negotiations until the end of 2020 if needed for a second referendum. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, she was asked if she would back an extension until the end of next year. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d she replied. \u201cBecause the current deal that\u2019s been negotiated by Boris Johnson is immensely damaging to the British economy and particularly for Scotland.\u201d She pointed out that her party backed a second Brexit referendum at its autumn conference last year. \u201cWe need to get a government in place to deliver the referendum and I don\u2019t see Boris Johnson\u2019s government doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe SNP has been very clear that Boris Johnson should be removed from office once an extension is obtained.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today programme earlier this morning. He said that any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure. Sunak said the Speaker, John Bercow, should grant the government a second Commons vote on its deal on Monday, and that it would be \u201cslightly odd\u201d if he did not. \u201cPeople who are wanting to amend legislation are ultimately wanting to frustrate, delay or cancel Brexit altogether, and we should be clear about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a deal that has been negotiated with the EU, that they themselves are happy with, and now want to get on with. I think everyone will look at that and think, this isn\u2019t the time for more games in parliament, more amendments, more procedural tricks, which are just covers for trying to frustrate Brexit altogether.\u201d Here\u2019s our story: This from the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief on Jim Shannon\u2019s earlier statement on a customs union. Here\u2019s a useful flow chart explaining what could happen this afternoon and beyond. Regardless of the possible meaningful vote this afternoon, the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) is being introduced in the Commons today. A vote on second reading could come as soon as tomorrow. Here\u2019s a useful explainer from our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. The DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon has told Sky his party would not support an amendment that would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn told BBC Breakfast there would likely be an amendment \u201cseeking to put this whole deal back to the British people\u201d, and another saying \u201cwe should remain in the customs union\u201d. A customs union amendment was thought to have a chance of succeeding \u2013 more of a chance than a second referendum amendment \u2013 but it would probably require support from the DUP. The DUP rejected Johnson\u2019s deal because it would require a border in the Irish Sea \u2013 a UK-wide customs union could solve that problem. A local branch of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has announced it will contest Labour MP Chris Bryant\u2019s seat if he succeeds in becoming Speaker, in a departure from parliamentary convention. In a statement, Rhondda Plaid said: \u201cThe Rhondda is not Buckingham, the constituency of the current Speaker, John Bercow. The Rhondda has some serious social issues that need sorting out and need the attention of a dedicated, full-time MP. The Rhondda can ill-afford to be represented by a parliamentarian more concerned with pomp than poverty. \u201cThe people of the Rhondda should not be denied a say on who represents them at Westminster while so many levers of powers are retained by the UK government. The Rhondda deserves to choose who their next MP is; Plaid Cymru will ensure that there is a choice at the next general election if Chris Bryant is elected as Speaker in the House of Commons.\u201d House of Commons convention dictates that Speakers are elected unopposed; however, the Conservative party recently announced it would contest Bercow\u2019s seat in Buckingham if he remained in the role going into the next election. There is a creeping erosion of respect towards some parliamentary traditions. Bryant, MP since 2001 for the Rhondda Valley, a former coalmining area in South Wales, has a 14,000-vote majority in the seat over Plaid Cymru, which came second in 2017. The former junior minister is not considered the frontrunner for the role, with the former deputy prime minister Harriet Harman highly tipped, but he has been attempting to woo colleagues. Over the weekend, he declared the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority should consider financial provisions to cover childcare costs for MPs when they have to attend parliament on a Saturday, when the Commons nursery is closed. Lord Pannick QC, who led the successful challenge to the legality of the prorogation of parliament, has been speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Asked about Boris Johnson\u2019s move to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension \u2013 as required under the Benn act \u2013 but declining to sign it, Pannick said he thought that \u201con this occasion\u201d the prime minister was on the right side of the law. The Benn act required him to send a letter to the president of the European council seeking an extension and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. The act doesn\u2019t requite that he sign the letter. The purpose of the act is to ensure that the EU can now make us an offer for an extension. If they do, the Benn act requires that the government accept it, so the Benn act has achieved its purpose. The act doesn\u2019t require the prime minister to abandon his political objectives and beliefs that we should leave on the 31st. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s acted unlawfully. Pannick said he was bound by the Benn act to accept an extension unless he gets legislation through parliament by the 31st and gets approval for his deal. \u201cAnd I very much hope that is achieved,\u201d he said. The European Research Group chairman, Steve Baker, spoke to the Today programme a little earlier. He did not explicitly rule out backing the deal if it is amended to include a customs union arrangement but said he would reconsider his support. \u201cThe advice I gave to my Eurosceptic colleagues is we should, number one, back the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber two, vote for the legislation all the way through unless, it has to be said, it was wrecked by opponents, in which case we would have to take a view. Baker called on the DUP to \u201cchoke down extremely difficult compromises\u201d and back the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cFor people like me, for vast areas of that withdrawal agreement are unchanged, and we are going to have to choke down our pride and vote in the national interest to get Brexit done,\u201d he said. I\u2019m not going to deny there are still problems with that withdrawal agreement, which I\u2019ve long complained about. We\u2019re going to compromise in the national interest to get us out of the European Union on time and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m asking the DUP, just as we\u2019re having to choke down extremely difficult compromises to get out in the national interest \u2026 I would ask the DUP to accept this compromise. Today\u2019s Commons order paper has events kicking off in parliament with defence questions at 2.30pm, which will wrap up around 3.30pm. The following \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d motion could then be put to MPs: That this house approves for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 the following documents laid before the House on 19 October 2019: (1) the negotiated withdrawal agreement titled Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community; (2) the framework for the future relationship titled Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom; (3) the unilateral declaration by the UK titled Declaration by Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the operation of the Democratic consent in Northern Ireland provision of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. A note on the order paper reads: \u201cThe Speaker plans to make a statement on proceedings on this motion immediately after defence questions.\u201d Here\u2019s an interesting Twitter thread from Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government. She says she would be very surprised if Bercow were to allow another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d motion. Good morning and welcome to Politics Live on what promises to be another jaw-dropping day in Westminster. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and will be taking you through all this morning\u2019s developments before handing over to my colleague Ben Quinn this afternoon. Boris Johnson is going to make another attempt at getting his Brexit deal past MPs today after he failed to do so on Saturday. In a special sitting of parliament this weekend, Oliver Letwin, the former Tory minister, managed to amend the motion so that parliament withheld its support until MPs were able to pass the full Brexit legislation and properly scrutinise the deal. The amendment forced Johnson to send a letter to the EU requesting a three-month extension to article 50, which Brussels is considering. Undeterred, Johnson will have another go at winning parliamentary backing for his Brexit deal in a straight yes or no vote this afternoon. This would be a move to show support for his EU withdrawal agreement before MPs have the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. The Speaker, John Bercow, could block Johnson holding another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the deal today, because the prime minister tried and failed to do so on Saturday, meaning parliament would be considering the same matter twice. The Labour party said last night that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force him to drop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit. You can read our full story here: According to an analysis of likely voting intentions by the Guardian\u2019s political team, support for Johnson\u2019s deal is still on a knife-edge, despite senior ministers claiming he has the numbers to get it through. Johnson appears to have got all of his 287 voting MPs on board with his plan, including his brother, Jo Johnson, who backed a second referendum but voted with the government on Saturday. He also has about 20 former Conservatives who left the party or had the whip suspended, plus likely votes from about eight Labour MPs. Another three independent MPs \u2013 former Labour ministers Ian Austin and Frank Field, plus former Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd \u2013 are all expected to back him.

For four decades the EU has set minimum standards in the workplace on protection from discrimination, pregnancy, maternity and paternity rights, part-time, fixed term and agency workers\u2019 rights, the famous working time directive, and holiday pay, and health and safety.</p> <p>There were clearly areas in which the EU did not do enough \u2013 most glaringly, on zero-hours contracts. Yet the bid by the handful of Labour MPs determined to vote through Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 to decry the EU as a set of capitalist institutions, without any social basis \u2013 is cynical. Such rights as UK workers currently enjoy have been enshrined by European law. Without provision for the protection and enforcement of those rights, they could be dismantled by a Conservative government at any time.</p> <p>To recap the Conservatives\u2019 record on this: in 2011, after the coalition government came in, David Cameron\u2019s strategy chief Steve Hilton reportedly flew the kite of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2011/jul/28/steve-hilton-conservative-blue-sky-thinking\" title=\"\">suspending maternity leave</a>, just temporarily, while they repaired the \u201cdamage done by the last Labour government\u201d. He would have been prevented by EU law. However, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40727400\" title=\"\">employment tribunal fees</a> were introduced, which effectively curtailed maternity and other rights by making it expensive \u2013 often prohibitively \u2013 for an employee to enforce them.

      "bodyText": "It is not unreasonable for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and assorted organisations concerned with the nation\u2019s prosperity, to concentrate on the future of the customs union \u2013 or more precisely, what the future for British workers will look like without it. \u201cThe jobs or wages of men with low formal qualifications working in skilled manual occupations may be under particular threat,\u201d remarked Agnes Norris Keiller, author of the IFS report, leaving \u201cas you might expect, if you decimate your manufacturing sector\u201d judiciously unsaid. However, the trade union movement is looking just as keenly at what Boris Johnson\u2019s agreement means for workers\u2019 rights. For four decades the EU has set minimum standards in the workplace on protection from discrimination, pregnancy, maternity and paternity rights, part-time, fixed term and agency workers\u2019 rights, the famous working time directive, and holiday pay, and health and safety. There were clearly areas in which the EU did not do enough \u2013 most glaringly, on zero-hours contracts. Yet the bid by the handful of Labour MPs determined to vote through Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 to decry the EU as a set of capitalist institutions, without any social basis \u2013 is cynical. Such rights as UK workers currently enjoy have been enshrined by European law. Without provision for the protection and enforcement of those rights, they could be dismantled by a Conservative government at any time. To recap the Conservatives\u2019 record on this: in 2011, after the coalition government came in, David Cameron\u2019s strategy chief Steve Hilton reportedly flew the kite of suspending maternity leave, just temporarily, while they repaired the \u201cdamage done by the last Labour government\u201d. He would have been prevented by EU law. However, employment tribunal fees were introduced, which effectively curtailed maternity and other rights by making it expensive \u2013 often prohibitively \u2013 for an employee to enforce them. (These fees were subsequently ruled unlawful by the supreme court.) They increased the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims from one to two years\u2019 employment; imposed a cap on compensation for this of one year\u2019s pay; and after their election victory in 2015, the Tories brought in the notorious Trade Union Act to make collective action \u2013 specifically strike action \u2013 harder. To reassure workers about a future Conservative government, last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech would have had to include three things: the promise of a \u201cstandstill\u201d, so that existing rights couldn\u2019t be rolled back; the promise of dynamic alignment with the EU on those existing rights, in the case of their extension; and a statement of intention on workers\u2019 rights legislation, to meet the new challenges of insecurity and low wages. The speech mentioned none of those things. Piece together the Conservative party\u2019s track record with its present rhetoric, or lack of it, and you have to accept deregulation of the workplace and disempowerment of the individual as the inevitable and deliberate consequences of this form of Brexit. And this is where they may have laid a bear-trap for themselves in the coming election. Despite those moves under Cameron, the steady erosion of workplace rights over the past decade was not pinned on any single political party. Rather, it was understood as something more amorphous: the pressures of the market, the \u201cnew rules\u201d of the innovators, and as such, the price of modernity. The introduction of tribunal fees and the undermining of union power paled into insignificance beside the far more alarming stories: the woman who gave birth in the toilet of a Sports Direct warehouse because she was afraid of missing her shift; the hyper-surveillance practices at Amazon; the heads-we-win, tails-you-lose employment model of Deliveroo and Uber, where everyone is self-employed, but no one is emancipated. \u201cZero hours\u201d became a shorthand, an umbrella term for a gig economy in which the balance of power was skewed so remarkably, so suddenly toward the employer that the much slower, more iterative cogs of parliament were seen as more or less irrelevant to it.

Yes, they have done some positive things but the letter glosses over many problems.</p> <p>The record investment in renewables and phase-out of coal power stations is largely a result of market forces because green measures have become much cheaper, and it was the Labour government that introduced the feed-in tariff leading to the huge growth in solar power. Setting a net-zero target is meaningless unless supported by action, and hosting the 2020 UN climate talks will probably simply produce more hot air than reduce CO<sub>2</sub> .</p> <p>It was the Conservatives who stopped onshore wind turbine installations, failed to act on the tidal barrage, and have locked us into a bad nuclear plant deal that will cost us three times as much for their power as that provided by renewables. It was the Conservatives who took away subsidies for plug-in hybrid cars and raised their vehicle tax to \u00a3140 per annum.

      "bodyText": "The letter from Conservative MPs listing their climate achievements makes rather sad reading (Letters, 17 October). Yes, they have done some positive things but the letter glosses over many problems. The record investment in renewables and phase-out of coal power stations is largely a result of market forces because green measures have become much cheaper, and it was the Labour government that introduced the feed-in tariff leading to the huge growth in solar power. Setting a net-zero target is meaningless unless supported by action, and hosting the 2020 UN climate talks will probably simply produce more hot air than reduce CO2 . It was the Conservatives who stopped onshore wind turbine installations, failed to act on the tidal barrage, and have locked us into a bad nuclear plant deal that will cost us three times as much for their power as that provided by renewables. It was the Conservatives who took away subsidies for plug-in hybrid cars and raised their vehicle tax to \u00a3140 per annum. Their flattening of the tax bands has led to a rise in sales of larger cars, and a 2040 target for ending diesel and petrol car sales is too late. I also seem to remember, many years ago, that it was the Conservatives who, in the face of building industry lobbying, failed to implement proposed regulations that would have mandated much higher insulation standards. Words are useless, only action counts in countering global heating. Michael Miller Sheffield \u2022 \u201cThe UK plans to lead the world\u2019s future climate ambitions\u201d (Rise of renewables may see off oil firms decades earlier than they think, 14 October) is a false claim shared by the Conservative and Labour parties, as it relies on completely blocking out the emissions that UK corporations are responsible for overseas, which are actually increasing. The UK hosts two of the world\u2019s top five privately-owned oil majors, and three of the top seven mining corporations. Richard Heede\u2019s research (Report, 10 October) shows that the CO2 equivalent emissions from these companies\u2019 products alone is five times greater than all emissions in the UK. It is time for the political establishment to admit this truth and confront the consequences. Dr Andy Higginbottom Associate professor, Kingston University \u2022 The Guardian is to be congratulated on its investigatory series on the major polluters. However, in the analysis of MPs\u2019 voting record on bills to combat climate change (Tories five times more likely than other MPs to vote against bills to tackle climate crisis, 12 October), both Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas are marked as 92% supportive on the basis they voted to \u201ckeep nuclear power subsidies relatively low\u201d. This clearly implies that voting for higher nuclear subsidies would increase their score on lowering carbon emissions. Nadhim Zahawi, the business and energy minister, compounded this view, telling parliament in a written statement on 17 October: \u201cNuclear \u2026 will continue to play an important role as we transition to a carbon neutral economy.\u201d But it is a demonstrably false viewpoint. A recent assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from differing power generation technologies by Prof Mark Jacobson indicates that nuclear CO2 emissions are between 10 to 18 times greater than those from renewables. In a newly completed chapter, Evaluation of Nuclear Power as a Proposed Solution to Global Warming, Air Pollution, and Energy Security, in his forthcoming book, 100% Clean, Renewable Energy and Storage for Everything, Jacobson argues: \u201cThere is no such thing as a zero- or close to zero-emission nuclear power plant.

But too much political reporting trivialises coverage of political events, reducing them to a crude soap opera, centred on personalities and tittle tattle, rather than explaining competing ideas or worldviews, or placing them in a broader social context. Drama takes priority over substance.</p> <p>It does help, of course, that the Tories have the active, partisan editorial support of most of the British press, while sympathisers with the main opposition party are a few isolated, mostly freelance individuals within the media ecosystem. One independent-minded political reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/1185829250768736256\" title=\"\">declared</a>: \u201cYou have to give credit to No 10 for knowing exactly how to play the UK press.\u201d But in truth, press outlets are not victims of their own gullibility, manipulated by clever mini-Machiavellis in No 10: they are willing and amenable. Their coverage is skewed to the political interests of the moguls who own the newspapers who \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 fear their economic position will be damaged by the far-reaching reforms that would be implemented after a Tory defeat.</p> <p>There is another factor that afflicts not just the print press, but the self-declared impartial broadcast media, too. Stenography \u2013 simply regurgitating the lines of the Tory political operation without analysis or context \u2013 is not political journalism. But Johnson\u2019s operation is offering access in exchange for just such pliant reporting. Those reporters who have attempted to genuinely scrutinise Johnson have found themselves frozen out. There is nothing new about this: it\u2019s how Alastair Campbell managed the media at New Labour\u2019s peak.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the end of the story, of course. While Labour\u2019s ability to push back at a Tory-crafted narrative is made extremely difficult by a press overwhelmingly sympathetic to the government\u2019s position \u2013 as the commentator Matt Zarb-Cousin puts it, being a Tory is playing politics on \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattzarb/status/1185701804551606277\" title=\"\">easy</a>\u201d mode \u2013 Labour\u2019s communication strategy is currently sorely lacking. The party has acted as though it was blindsided by Johnson\u2019s assumption of power, and it still lacks clear messages that cut through.</p> <p>Yet Labour needing to swiftly get its act together does not absolve the media of its systemic failings. On the brink of the most dramatic political upheaval for generations, we deserve thorough, intense scrutiny and a government held mercilessly to account. We are being denied that and \u2013 with it \u2013 a properly functioning democracy, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Just as Theresa May\u2019s \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d bluster collided with political reality, Johnson\u2019s demagoguery was followed by his own capitulation to the EU\u2019s red lines. Yet his embrace of a deal first offered by the EU 19 months ago \u2013 and rejected by May as something \u201cno UK prime minister could ever agree to\u201d \u2013 has been presented as an against-all-odds, critic-defying triumph. The consequences of a deal predicted to strip the country of \u00a3130bn worth of growth \u2013 making the average Briton \u00a32,250 a year poorer over the next 15 years \u2013 should be front and centre in the debate. Yet they are not. Johnson declared he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an extension: but request one he did, and die in a ditch he did not. Yet most of the British press focused on the theatrics of the prime minister not signing a letter and sending a copy of the Benn act instead. This is, of course, exactly the framing the Tories desire. There are excellent, perceptive political reporters. But too much political reporting trivialises coverage of political events, reducing them to a crude soap opera, centred on personalities and tittle tattle, rather than explaining competing ideas or worldviews, or placing them in a broader social context. Drama takes priority over substance. It does help, of course, that the Tories have the active, partisan editorial support of most of the British press, while sympathisers with the main opposition party are a few isolated, mostly freelance individuals within the media ecosystem. One independent-minded political reporter declared: \u201cYou have to give credit to No 10 for knowing exactly how to play the UK press.\u201d But in truth, press outlets are not victims of their own gullibility, manipulated by clever mini-Machiavellis in No 10: they are willing and amenable. Their coverage is skewed to the political interests of the moguls who own the newspapers who \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 fear their economic position will be damaged by the far-reaching reforms that would be implemented after a Tory defeat. There is another factor that afflicts not just the print press, but the self-declared impartial broadcast media, too. Stenography \u2013 simply regurgitating the lines of the Tory political operation without analysis or context \u2013 is not political journalism. But Johnson\u2019s operation is offering access in exchange for just such pliant reporting. Those reporters who have attempted to genuinely scrutinise Johnson have found themselves frozen out. There is nothing new about this: it\u2019s how Alastair Campbell managed the media at New Labour\u2019s peak. That\u2019s not the end of the story, of course. While Labour\u2019s ability to push back at a Tory-crafted narrative is made extremely difficult by a press overwhelmingly sympathetic to the government\u2019s position \u2013 as the commentator Matt Zarb-Cousin puts it, being a Tory is playing politics on \u201ceasy\u201d mode \u2013 Labour\u2019s communication strategy is currently sorely lacking. The party has acted as though it was blindsided by Johnson\u2019s assumption of power, and it still lacks clear messages that cut through. Yet Labour needing to swiftly get its act together does not absolve the media of its systemic failings. On the brink of the most dramatic political upheaval for generations, we deserve thorough, intense scrutiny and a government held mercilessly to account. We are being denied that and \u2013 with it \u2013 a properly functioning democracy, too. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

He added: \u201cThe motion will not be debated today, as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so.\u201d The government was defeated on Saturday by a cross-party group of MPs led by the former Tory cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, seeking to avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit and allow more time for parliament to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement. They amended the government\u2019s motion to say MPs would withhold their approval from Johnson\u2019s last-minute deal until the legislation enacting it has been implemented. That then forced the government to comply with the requirements of the Benn act, and send a letter to the EU27 requesting a delay to Brexit. Had Johnson won a vote on Monday, the letter could have been rescinded. Bercow said that did not in itself constitute a change in circumstances significant enough to justify a fresh consideration of the government\u2019s Brexit plans.

Despite having reluctantly been compelled to send a letter asking for an extension to article 50, Johnson\u2019s government still hopes to push the legislation necessary to enact Brexit through parliament in time to meet the 31 October deadline. The withdrawal agreement bill was expected to be published later on Monday, with the key second reading vote likely to be held on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "Members of Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly are due to return to the mothballed chamber on Monday for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly at Stormont. The region\u2019s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight on Monday after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. Last week the anti-abortion campaign group Both Lives Matter said 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), including 27 from the DUP, signed a petition to force a recall to discuss a motion to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians. However to block the law the special sitting will need to elect a speaker and form an executive, which would require Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s support. Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 along with the Alliance party \u2013 said it would not participate, leaving the anti-abortion gathering devoid of power. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said the recall would allow MLAs to register opposition to the law. \u201cHopefully we will be able to debate the issue,\u201d she said. Several unionists from other parties backed the petition: Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, alongside Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and his party colleagues Robbie Butler and Roy Beggs. The initiative came from former police ombudsman Nuala O\u2019Loan, who wrote a letter to Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, requesting a recall before the abortion law change. Same-sex marriage is also due to become legal on Tuesday after a separate Westminster vote in July. The first weddings can take place on Valentine\u2019s Day next year. Non-unionist parties criticised the recall. A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson called it \u201ca pointless political stunt which has literally no impact, unless its business is to appoint an executive who does have the power to effect legal change\u201d. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, also called it a stunt and said the legislation on abortion and same-sex marriage would take effect. Eastwood did not indicate whether the party would attend. One SDLP MLA, Daniel McCrossan, said he would attend. Stephen Farry, an Alliance party MLA, told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m profoundly uncomfortable that the first time people are making an effort to have the assembly reconvened is to discuss how we can deny people rights.\u201d Stormont collapsed in January 2017 amid disputes between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, leaving a political vacuum. Despite mounting frustration efforts to revive it have failed. Long campaigns by equality campaigners culminated in two Labour MPs, Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn, tabling amendments on abortion and same-sex marriage to an otherwise technical government bill connected to budgets and elections for the defunct assembly. In free votes, because they were viewed as matters of conscience, the Commons voted overwhelmingly for both. On the eve of this week\u2019s vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, Creasy accused Downing Street of preparing to hand back control of abortion rights to Stormont to help curry favour with the DUP. If there was such a plan it failed: the DUP rejected Johnson\u2019s deal.

      "bodyText": "The papers almost all focus on the prospect of a new vote on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal on Monday. While some report optomistically about Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of getting his deal through, others are furious at what they see as \u201csabotage\u201d from Labour in the form of an alliance that could possibly push for amendments, including a second referendum. The FT reports that things are looking fairly sunny for the prime minister: \u201cJohnson sticks to Brexit deal as faith rises in Westminster victory\u201d. The paper says: \u201cBoris Johnson will make a new attempt today to win parliament\u2019s backing for his Brexit deal, amid growing confidence in Downing Street that he can overcome a series of setbacks at the weekend and now has the support of the 320 MPs needed for victory.\u201d The Metro also reflects Johnson\u2019s optimism: \u201c\u2018Now we have the numbers\u2019\u201d, says its headline, which quotes the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. The Guardian reports that Labour is seeking an alliance with rebel Tory MPs and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to \u201cdrop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit\u201d. The paper says this decision means \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s hopes of winning a clear majority for his Brexit plan faced a new threat\u201d and \u201craises the prospect that a new alliance could form at the 11th hour, forcing the government into a softer departure or a confirmatory vote on whether to leave at all.\u201d The i has a similar report, with \u201cLabour to back deal \u2026 if second referendum included\u201d, saying that the shadow Brexit secretary has sought amendments to the deal \u201cincluding softer Brexit and closing the \u2018no-deal trap\u2019\u201d. Other papers are livid at the fact the deal did not pass over the weekend, and angry at what they see as Labour\u2019s attempts to, as the Daily Mail puts it, \u201ccancel Brexit by sabotaging withdrawal legislation\u201d. The paper says that Labour plans to hijack the government\u2019s legislation with amendments to keep Britain tied to the EU\u2019s customs union \u2013 and to set up a second referendum. The paper\u2019s front page coverage employs many of the words that MPs begged Boris Johnson to stop using in an emotional parliamentary debate last month, including: \u201csabotage\u201d and \u201chijack\u201d. The Express screams: \u201cHow dare they! New plot to hijack Brexit\u201d. The paper says the \u201cLabour plot\u201d was \u201cmet with fury last night\u201d. \u201cDowning Street has accused Labour of trying to \u2018frustrate and cancel\u2019 Brexit after the party announced plans to hijack Boris Johnson\u2019s deal with amendments for a second referendum and customs union with the EU,\u201d says the Times. The paper cites a cabinet minister who says the amendments \u201ccould leave [the prime minister] with no choice but to accept an extension and make a renewed push for a general election\u201d. The Telegraph says that Johnson faces a \u201c\u2018guerrilla war\u2019 over new vote on deal\u201d. The paper said \u201cSir Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative cabinet minister, conspired with Labour to destroy a historic weekend sitting of Parliament that had been expected finally to approve Brexit.\u201d The Sun\u2019s lead story is \u201cBad blood brothers\u201d, about comments made by Prince Harry in an ITV documentary that he and his brother are \u201con different paths\u201d, but it does have a small front page story on the Brexit goings-on: \u201cIt\u2019s BoJo v Brexit bandits: Round 2\u201d, says the paper, which says Johnson\u2019s \u201cmove to break the deadlock could be scuppered by Commons Speaker John Bercow and Remainer MPs.\u201d The Mirror also has the Duke of Sussex\u2019s comments on its front page, but it leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon\u2019s biggest UK warehouse, who have accused their bosses of \u201cmodern slavery\u201d.",
