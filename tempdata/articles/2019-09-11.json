It was execrable. It made the real PMQs look magisterial.</p> \n  <p>It is not that there is anything wrong with politicians using Facebook to communicate. But it did not feel as if Johnson had anything to say, and certainly nothing that he could not have expressed in a speech, or a proper interview, or even on Twitter. And if the point of the exercise was to show that he is willing to subject himself to questions, and defend what he is doing, then he needs to be questioned by something a bit more interactive than a mute iPad. Somebody who can ask a tough follow-up. Any MP who has done a radio phone-in knows that members of the public can sometimes ask far better questions than journalists, and a genuine People\u2019s PMQs might be worth watching. But this effort made Johnson look like some second-rate despot holed up in his bunker, terrified of an actual encounter with his people. </p> \n  <p>The only answer of interest came when Johnson was talking about the backstop. Ostensibly, after referring to \u201cchatter\u201d that he is moving towards a Northern Ireland-only backstop, he ruled out the idea. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. We have to solve the problem of the Northern Ireland border but we\u2019re working very hard to do that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, as he started this answer, he hinted that his determination to get rid of the backstop in its entirely was not absolute. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The backstop is going to be removed ... I very much hope, or I insist.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Was that a slip of the tongue? It sounded like this. But Johnson is well know for carefully scripting his impromptu remarks (read <a href=\"https://reaction.life/jeremy-vine-my-boris-story/\">this </a>by Jeremy Vine for a good insight into this) and so perhaps he was paving the way for an eventual climbdown. Who knows?</p> \n  <p>But he could have messaged this and submitted himself to proper questions at the same time too. His preference for a format that makes this impossible is not impressive.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T17:06:49.236Z\">at 6.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d791da98f083106f4559b51\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T16:18:19.629Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Doctors and schools need more funding.

By constitutional convention the sovereign invariably acts on the advice of the prime minister ...</p> \n   <p>The criteria adopted by the courts for identifying non-justiciable exercises of prerogative power are whether they involve matters of high policy or are political. In this way the courts have marked out the separation of power between the judicial and the executive branches of government, a fundamental feature of our unwritten constitution. In this context the essential characteristic of a political issue is the absence of judicial or legal standards by which to assess the legality of the executive\u2019s decision or action ...</p> \n   <p>The claimant\u2019s novel and wider legally enforceable concept of parliamentary sovereignty, distilled to its essence as the ability of parliament to conduct its business unimpeded, is not supported by the passages from the authority relied on ...</p> \n   <p>The constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom have evolved to achieve a balance between the three branches of the state; the relationship between the executive and parliament is governed in part by statute and in part by convention. Standing orders of both houses elaborate the procedural relationship between the executive and parliament.

But that three judges, independent judges, could come to this conclusion today is a real blow to the government, and it also backs what Liberal Democrats and others have been saying, this government should not have silenced parliament.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18c933936f1b9ef453bbf06e4a507a82b8e450a2\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c933936f1b9ef453bbf06e4a507a82b8e450a2/23_0_723_434/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Davey\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Davey</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d78dc6f8f082514879f2088\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T11:38:48.495Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In London the high court has released its full judgment explaining why it turned down the legal challenge against prorogation launched by the campaigner Gina Miller and others.</p> \n  <p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Summary-Miller-v-The-Prime-Minister-1.pdf\">the summary (pdf).</a></p> \n  <p>And here is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Miller-No-FINAL-1.pdf\">the full document (pdf).</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T11:43:36.968Z\">at 12.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d78d8138f082514879f2058\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T11:29:08.661Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Justice secretary seeks to defuse 'bias' row by saying he confidence in impartiality of judiciary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Robert Buckland,</strong> the justice secretary, has defended the Scottish judges.

There is no bold text in the original. I have inserted it to highlight the key sentences and paragraphs in the summary.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Inner House of the Court of Session has ruled that the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen that the United Kingdom Parliament should be prorogued from a day between 9 and 12 September until 14 October was <strong>unlawful because it had the purpose of stymying Parliament.</strong></p> \n   <p>A petition for judicial review was raised by 79 petitioners, 78 of whom are parliamentarians at Westminster, on 31 July 2019, seeking inter alia declarator that it would be unlawful for the UK Government to advise HM the Queen to prorogue the UK Parliament with a view to preventing sufficient time for proper consideration of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit). </p> \n   <p>A substantive hearing was fixed for Friday, 6 September, but on 28 August, on the advice of the Prime Minister, HM the Queen promulgated an Order in Council proroguing Parliament on a day between 9 and 12 September until 14 October. The Lord Ordinary (the judge hearing the case at first instance) refused to grant interim orders preventing the prorogation, but brought the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday, 3 September. On the eve of the hearing, in obedience of its duty of candour, the respondent lodged some partially redacted documents exhibiting some of the Government\u2019s deliberations regarding prorogation, going back to 15 August. </p> \n   <p>The Lord Ordinary dismissed the petition. He found that the PM\u2019s advice to HM the Queen on prorogation was, as a matter of high policy and political judgment, non-justiciable; the decision to proffer the advice was not able to be assessed against legal standards by the courts. </p> \n   <p>The reclaiming motion (appeal) was heard by the First Division of the Court of Session over 5 and 6 September. Parliament was prorogued in the early hours of Tuesday, 10 September. </p> \n   <p><strong>All three First Division judges have decided that the PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful.</strong> </p> \n   <p>The Lord President, Lord Carloway, decided that although advice to HM the Queen on the exercise of the royal prerogative of prorogating Parliament was not reviewable on the normal grounds of judicial review, i<strong>t would nevertheless be unlawful if its purpose was to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive, which was a central pillar of the good governance principle enshrined in the constitution; this followed from the principles of democracy and the rule of law. </strong>The circumstances in which the advice was proffered and <strong>the content of the documents produced by the respondent demonstrated that this was the true reason for the prorogation.</strong> </p> \n   <p>Lord Brodie considered that whereas when the petition was raised the question was unlikely to have been justiciable,<strong> the particular prorogation that had occurred, as a tactic to frustrate Parliament, could legitimately be established as unlawful. </strong>This was <strong>an egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities.</strong> It was to be inferred that the principal reasons for the prorogation were to prevent or impede Parliament holding the executive to account and legislating with regard to Brexit, and to allow the executive to pursue a policy of a no deal Brexit without further Parliamentary interference.</p> \n   <p>Lord Drummond Young determined that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether any power, under the prerogative or otherwise, has been legally exercised. It was incumbent on the UK Government to show a valid reason for the prorogation, having regard to the fundamental constitutional importance of parliamentary scrutiny of executive action. <strong>The circumstances, particularly the length of the prorogation, showed that the purpose was to prevent such scrutiny.</strong> The documents provided showed no other explanation for this.

Among other things, she gave a surprisingly candid reason as to why the government might not publish in full its Operation Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit planning documents. Here are the main points from her various interviews.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Leadsom claimed that the public would not benefit from being told the worst things that might happen under a no-deal Brexit.</strong> On Monday MPs voted for a motion binding on the government saying that by 11pm tonight it must release \u201call the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to Operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee.\u201d The government has said it plans to publish a version of the Operation Yellowhammer report, setting out what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but not when, and it has not committed to publishing all the related documents. Asked on BBC Breakfast if the government would comply with the motion, Leadsom said that the government was giving a lot of consideration to what it might publish, but officials needed to be able to offer policy advice in private. When the presenter, <strong>Dan Walker</strong>, put it to her that people had a right to know what might happen in the event of no deal, she replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You are right to say what potentially might happen. Yellowhammer is, as you know, the reasonable worst case scenario. It is by no means a prediction of anything. It\u2019s simply the government looking at every possible angle and ensuring that we have measures in place to deal with that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Walker persisted. Businesses wanted to know what might happen, he said. Then Leadsom replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I actually do not think that it serves people well to see what is the absolutely worst thing that could happen. The worst thing that could happen to me is I could walk out of here and get run over. It is not a prediction, but it is something that could happen. And simply putting out there all of the possible permutations of what could happen actually just serves to concern people. Whereas what the government is doing is working flat out to ensure that in all circumstances, including in the event of no deal, we have a smooth transition for the United Kingdom. There is so much work underway to make sure that in all circumstances the UK will absolutely thrive once we leave the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Leadsom claimed that one of the advantages of Brexit was that it would make it easier for the UK to attract talented migrants from outside the EU. </strong>Speaking on the Today programme about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/10/uk-work-visas-for-foreign-graduates-to-be-extended-to-two-years\">the government\u2019s announcement that international students will be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university,</a> instead of just being allowed to work for four months, under the rule introduced by Theresa May in 2012, Leadsom said this was in the UK\u2019s interests. She explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In leaving the EU it will be our government that\u2019s able to determine our migration policy and that\u2019s incredibly important. Now we get to decide and instead of being open to free movement from just the EU, the UK will be able to take advantage of a global talent pool of young people and workforce coming from all around the world and that\u2019s something that\u2019s a great advantage for us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As <strong>Sarah Ludford</strong>, a Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson later pointed out, Leadsom was wrong to say that being in the EU stops the UK admitting talented migrants from outside Europe.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SarahLudford/status/1171675653533569026\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Leadsom on #@BBCr4today claims that \u201coutside the EU we won\u2019t be restricted just to immigration from the EU but can take advantage of a global talent pool.\u201d<br><br>Nothing stops us now, in fact non-EU immigration greater than EU free movement.

So we are looking at getting a deal, getting a good deal that works for the UK and for the EU that is different to the one that was negotiated previously because that couldn\u2019t get through Parliament. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am:</em> Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, gives a speech on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets and rising food and fuel prices are among the possible consequences of a no-deal Brexit, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday. The content of the five-page document, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, is remarkably similar to the plan leaked to the Sunday Times in August, which was dismissed by the government as out of date. Where that document was described as a \u201cbase case\u201d; the new document claims to be a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d. One point of the document \u2013 paragraph 15 \u2013 remains redacted. Although a comparison with the original leaked document would suggest it is a warning that uncompetitive trade following a no-deal Brexit could force two major oil refineries to shut, resulting in 2,000 job loses. (See 21:09). The government refused to comply with the second of part of MP\u2019s request, which demanded the release of messages in relation to the suspension of parliament and Yellowhammer (see 20:18). A letter from Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the request was \u201cinappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals\u201d. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said that \u201cit is now more important than ever\u201d for parliament to be recalled and scrutinise the documents and prevent a no-deal. Grieve also issued a renewed call for a second referendum with remaining in the EU an option on the ballot paper. He said: As we cannot trust Boris Johnson to halt this calamity, we must trust the people. We must give the public the final say in a new referendum with the option of keeping our current deal as members of the EU.\u201d The British Medical Association said that Yellowhammer confirms concerns it has expressed regarding vital medicine supply shortages among other areas. These comments were echoed by the British Retail Consortium in relation to fresh food availability. Right, that\u2019s all from me tonight. Until next time. Michael Gove has reiterated that Yellowhammer is a \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d of what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. His tweet comes in response to comments by Luciana Berger MP on ITV\u2019s Peston programme. She said that the document illustrated what would happen in 50 days\u2019 time without a deal. \u2018We cannot trust Boris Johnson to halt this calamity\u2019 Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has responded to Yellowhammer by issuing renewed calls for a second referendum in which remaining an EU member is an option on the ballot paper. Even a partial release of the Yellowhammer documents is enough to show how deep the damage a no-deal exit from the EU would do. Boris Johnson cannot portray forcing an undemocratic no-deal on the country as patriotic. On the contrary it would be deeply damaging to our economic interests and to social cohesion. As a One Nation Conservative I am deeply fearful of the long-term damage a reckless approach - which knowingly risks prosperity, increases poverty and even threatens medical supplies - will do to both the people and our party. This must be stopped. As we cannot trust Boris Johnson to halt this calamity, we must trust the people. We must give the public the final say in a new referendum with the option of keeping our current deal as members of the EU.\u201d The government refused Grieve\u2019s request to make public internal communications between the prime minister\u2019s top advisers over Yellowhammer and prorogation, claiming it would breach their rights and various legal frameworks. \u2018Worst possible timing for the retail industry\u2019 Echoing the reaction of the BMA, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that Yellowhammer confirms its warnings on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: The Yellowhammer document confirms what retailers have been saying for the last three years - fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise. This isn\u2019t good for the British public and this isn\u2019t good for British retailers. A no-deal Brexit in November represents the worst possible timing for the retail industry and the consumers it serves. Warehousing availability will be limited as retailers prepare for Black Friday and Christmas, many fresh fruit and vegetables will be out of season in the UK, and imports will be hampered by disruption through the Channel Straits that could reduce flow by up to 60% for up to three months. While retailers are doing all they can to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, it is impossible to completely mitigate the negative impact it would have - something the Government itself has acknowledged. The fact remains that a damaging, no-deal Brexit is in no-one\u2019s interests and it is vital that a solution is found, and fast, that ensures frictionless tariff-free trade with the EU after our departure.\u201d Here is a hot take from Left Foot Forward editor Josiah Mortimer on the apparent differences between tonight\u2019s Yellowhammer document and the version leaked in August. Contempt is a term used to describe \u201cany act - or failure to act - that may prevent or hinder the work of either House of Parliament\u201d. The British Medical Association (BMA) has said that the \u201calarming\u201d Yellowhammer document confirms its concerns over the impact of a no-deal Brexit. BMA Council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul told the Press Association: Here we see in black and white the Government warning of disruption to vital medicine supplies, a higher risk of disease outbreaks due to veterinary medicine supply issues, and UK pensioners in the EU being unable to access healthcare from 1 November if there is a no-deal Brexit. The warnings around social care providers folding within months of Brexit day are particularly concerning, having a huge impact on our most vulnerable patients and the wider health service in the depths of winter.\u201d ....And here is Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response: Former education minister Sam Gyimah \u2013 one of 21 Tory rebels who had the whip withdrawn \u2013 has also taken to Twitter, accusing the government of trying to downplay the document leaked in August. The leaked document wasn\u2019t out of date. This isn\u2019t project fear. It is a sober assessment of what could happen. No deal is not \u2018vanishingly inexpensive\u2019 or a \u2018bump in the road\u2019. This is only a part of the chaos and long term damage our country would suffer. We must stop this. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has now taken to Twitter to respond to the release of Operation Yellowhammer this evening. Disruption to crime data sharing and an overstretched police force left to deal with public unrest - the Yellowhammer docs show just how much the Tories No Deal Brexit is putting our safety at risk. The document states that \u201claw enforcement data and information sharing between the UK and EU will be disrupted\u201d. It also projects that: \u201cProtests and counter-protests will take place across the UK and may absorb significant amounts of police resource. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions.\u201d Here is more from the Sunday Times\u2019 senior reporter Rosamund Urwin confirming what was contained paragraph 15 of the document originally leaked to her in August, which has seemingly been redacted in tonight\u2019s version. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has reacted to the documents \u2013 urging that parliament be recalled to prevent a no-deal Brexit. These documents confirm the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, which Labour has worked so hard to block. It is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence. Boris Johnson must now admit that he has been dishonest with the British people about the consequence of a no-deal Brexit. It is also now more important than ever that parliament is recalled and has the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal. Operation Yellowhammer contains a total of 20 \u201creasonable worst case planning assumptions\u2019\u2019 \u2013 of which one has been redacted. These assumptions are \u201cas of August 2\u201d this year. Among them is a warning that: Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK and may absorb significant amounts of police resource. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions. It is also feared that: Low-income groups will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel. It is noted that day one after the expected Halloween exit is a Friday \u201cwhich may not be to our advantage\u201d and may coincide with the end of the October half-term school holidays. This is from the Sunday Times\u2019 senior reporter Rosamund Urwin who received the original leaked Operation Yellowhammer papers in August. It suggests little of the document has changed beyond the headline. When asked whether the version she had received was redacted she replied: \u201cNo.\u201d The government has refused to comply with Parliament\u2019s request to make public internal communications between the prime minister\u2019s top advisers over Operation Yellowhammer and prorogation. A letter from Michael Gove addressed to former Attorney General Dominic Grieve states that the request would breach the rights of those named in the communications \u2013 including civil servants and special advisers. This is an unprecedented, inappropriate, and disproportionate use of [the Humble Address] procedure. To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of Parliament under this procedure. These individuals have no right of reply, and the procedure used fails to afford them any of the protections that would properly be in place. It offends against basic principles of fairness and the Civil Service duty of care towards its employees. Grieve\u2019s demand for the release of all written and electronic contact about the temporary suspension of Parliament and Operation Yellowhammer documents since July 23 to be released was approved by MPs by 311 votes to 302 on Monday. It asked for all correspondence and communications, formal or informal, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, private email accounts, text messages, iMessage and official and personal mobile phones connected to the present Government since July 23 relating to prorogation. It listed key individuals of Mr Johnson\u2019s Government, including senior adviser Dominic Cummings and director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa. Twitter users are asking why paragraph 15 of the government\u2019s six-page no-deal Brexit contingency planning document has been redacted: Paul Sweeney, Labour MP for Glasgow North East, has labelled the government\u2019s response to parliament\u2019s ruling that Operation Yellowhammer be made public as a \u201cperfunctory and insufficient effort\u201d. The redacted section follows on from this traffic warning: \u201cRegional traffic disruption caused by border delays could affect fuel distribution within the local area, particularly if traffic queues in Kent block the Dartford crossing, which would disrupt fuel supply in London and the South-East. \u201cCustomer behaviour could lead to local shortages in other parts of the country.\u201d ...And Operation Yellowhammer has now been published. Read it here. As the countdown to the release of Operation Yellowhammer continues, let us take a moment to remember where the document gets its name from. Yellowhammers \u2013 also known as the Yellow Buntings \u2013 are a type of small song-bird. They are typically six inches in length and streaked brown with a yellow-tinged head and breast. The population in decline in UK and is listed on the bird conservation charity the RSPB\u2019s most endangered \u201cred list\u201d. The name \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d is believed to have been chosen at random but, after the report was leaked to the Times in August, some on Twitter developed their own theories. This is from Stephen Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, who said he was told that the Cabinet Office has \u201ca room\u201d of people working on the Operation Yellowhammer disclosure. Aaron Walawalkar here taking over on live-blogging duties. Stay tuned for updates as the clock ticks down to the 11pm deadline for the release of the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit contingency planning documents, code-named Operation Yellowhammer. Downing Street has rejected demands from opposition MPs for an immediate recall of parliament after a Scottish court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week prorogation was unlawful. The case will now go to the supreme court next week for a final ruling. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, has said that if Johnson did mislead the Queen as to the reasons for prorogation, as the Scottish court ruling implies, he should be forced to resign. (See 12.05pm.) Johnson has said he would not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. (See 17.52pm.) The Brexit party\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, has been heavily criticised by Johnson\u2019s team as \u201cnot fit and proper\u201d in an outright rejection of his offer of a pre-election, no-deal Brexit pact. Jeremy Corbyn has firmly rejected Tom Watson\u2019s suggestion that Labour should demand a referendum on Brexit before an election. Asked about the plan, which Watson, the deputy Labour leader, set out in a speech this morning, Corbyn said: It\u2019s Tom\u2019s view. I don\u2019t accept it and I don\u2019t agree with it. Corbyn also defended his refusal to make Labour a remain-only party. In an interview he set out the party\u2019s plan to go into the election promising to hold a referendum afterwards, with remain and a credible leave option on the ballot paper. When asked if he was trying to appeal to leave votes and to remain voters, he replied: Ever since 2016, I\u2019ve sought to bring people together. People voted remain because they wanted to remain in the EU and felt it was their best option. Many voted leave because they were angry at the way their communities had been left behind, denied investment, denied good quality jobs, denied any real hope for the future. I want to lead a Labour government that will bring people together, and a relationship with Europe, either in the EU or an effective trading relationship with Europe, in which we have a dynamic relationship on regulations and rights so we don\u2019t become a Donald Trump island, on the edge of Europe, undermining the social advances that have been made, I recognise that, under the European Union. A campaign to advertise the return of limited duty-free shopping when visiting EU countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit has attracted criticism and mockery on social media. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Aaron Walawalkar is taking over now. The government is expected to publish its Operation Yellowhammer report about the impact of a no-deal Brexit later, so it won\u2019t get dull. If you thought PMQs was the most debased and pointless form of executive scrutiny in British politics - a common view, particularly below the line here, although it does not seem to stop people taking an interest - then just watch a version of Boris Johnson\u2019s People\u2019s PMQs. It was execrable. It made the real PMQs look magisterial. It is not that there is anything wrong with politicians using Facebook to communicate. But it did not feel as if Johnson had anything to say, and certainly nothing that he could not have expressed in a speech, or a proper interview, or even on Twitter. And if the point of the exercise was to show that he is willing to subject himself to questions, and defend what he is doing, then he needs to be questioned by something a bit more interactive than a mute iPad. Somebody who can ask a tough follow-up. Any MP who has done a radio phone-in knows that members of the public can sometimes ask far better questions than journalists, and a genuine People\u2019s PMQs might be worth watching. But this effort made Johnson look like some second-rate despot holed up in his bunker, terrified of an actual encounter with his people. The only answer of interest came when Johnson was talking about the backstop. Ostensibly, after referring to \u201cchatter\u201d that he is moving towards a Northern Ireland-only backstop, he ruled out the idea. He said: We will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. We have to solve the problem of the Northern Ireland border but we\u2019re working very hard to do that. But, as he started this answer, he hinted that his determination to get rid of the backstop in its entirely was not absolute. He said: The backstop is going to be removed ... I very much hope, or I insist. Was that a slip of the tongue? It sounded like this. But Johnson is well know for carefully scripting his impromptu remarks (read this by Jeremy Vine for a good insight into this) and so perhaps he was paving the way for an eventual climbdown. Who knows? But he could have messaged this and submitted himself to proper questions at the same time too. His preference for a format that makes this impossible is not impressive. Q: Doctors and schools need more funding. Are you going to help with this? Johnson says he has already mentioned extra spending for the NHS. As a Conservative he believes in opportunity. He thinks talent and skills are evenly distributed, everywhere. But not everyone has the same opportunity. That is why he is going to level things up. Every school will get the same amount of funding. That can be done without breaching fiscal discipline. And that can happen within a dynamic market economy that can pay for fantastic services. And that\u2019s it. I will post a verdict and summary shortly. Q: Are you planning to leave without a deal? Johnson says staying in the EU would cost \u00a3250m a week. That\u2019s \u00a31bn a month. Think how you could spent the money. Let\u2019s get our priorities right, and get this thing done. Q: Why can\u2019t we leave the EU? That\u2019s because parliament voted, he says. He says there is meant to be a vote on a deal. But if we don\u2019t get one, we will leave on 31 October. Q: What will happen to jobs if we leave with no deal? Johnson says he wants a deal. But the UK can manage if we leave without one. He wants a high wage, low tax economy. Q: Can you confirm we will leave the EU on 31 October? Johnson says he has probably said that five times already, but he is delighted to confirm that. We must get this done, he says. Q: How will you restore faith in politics? By doing what we promise, says Johnson. He says he wants fantastic public services, funded by a dynamic market economy. Q: \u201cI despair of what is happening. I have lost all hope of democracy.\u201d Johnson says he is on the questioner\u2019s side. He is trying to work this out. He says he has talked to Leo Varadkar and Angela Merkel. The mood is changing, he says. The ice is cracking. He says it is important to get Brexit done. Once that has happened, he can get on with brining the country together. Q: Considering parliament has blocked no deal, what is the status of the backstop? Johnson says the backstop is going to be removed \u2013 \u201cI very much hope ... or I insist.\u201d He says there has been \u201cchatter\u201d about this. But he will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. That does not work for the UK, he says. Q: Are you anti-democratic? Brexit was supposed to counter authoritarianism. But now you are being authoritarian? Johnson says he disagrees. He says people are fed up because parliament has failed to implement the people\u2019s will. People ask why he is having the Queen\u2019s speech. He wants to push on with his domestic policies. Of course, if opposition MPs disagree, then it is always open to them to take up the offer he made twice to have an election. There is nothing more democratic than an election. For mysterious reasons, the opposition declined, he says. Q: Can you confirm the extra money for the NHS will involve real, extra spending? Yes, says Johnson. He says he is asking the NHS to make sure that goes to the front line. There may be a tough winter ahead. But he will make sure the money goes to the front line. Boris Johnson says over 1m people watched the last People\u2019s PMQs. He says he fears people are disconnected from politics. This might be an answer. Q: Will you commit to putting in place a plan to end homelessness, not just rough sleeping? Johnson says he totally agrees. He had a programme as London mayor. But he accepts this is a massive, massive problem. It is important to bring everybody together, he says. Here is the link to Boris Johnson\u2019s People\u2019s PMQs. Boris Johnson is due to hold his second \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook at 5pm. This is from Gina Miller, the campaigner whose legal action led to the government having to pass a bill to trigger article 50, instead of being allowed to start the Brexit process by executive order, and who launched the legal challenge at the English high court against the prorogation decision. Here is more from the Financial Times\u2019 legal commentator David Allen Green on the Scottish court of session\u2019s judgment. Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader, has told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live that if Boris Johnson loses the prorogation court in the supreme court, he should resign. Campbell said: If it emerges there was impropriety or inefficiency or anything that undermines the advice that was given [to the Queen about prorogation] \u2013 motive for example \u2013 then in those circumstances the position of the government is very, very difficult, and I think the position of the prime minister. Campbell went on: Buckingham Palace will not be liking this one bit. Because if, as is being contended, there was information which suggested that the true purpose was the frustration of parliament, and that was not revealed to the Queen, then she would have the disadvantage of being given inaccurate or even improper advice. And since she\u2019s obliged to accept advice from the prime minister, then I think it raises into very, very sharp focus precisely the conduct of the prime minister and his very future in that role. Here\u2019s another Labour MP, Luke Pollard, using a Twitter picture to make a point about prorogation. Here are two Labour MPs making the same point, in the same way. It\u2019s a Wednesday and, if parliament were sitting, we would have had PMQs today. Because of prorogation it was cancelled. But Boris Johnson is going to stage a second of his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook this afternoon, Number 10 has announced. The first one, staged last month, lasted just 10 minutes and attracted some derision (eg here). One of Scotland\u2019s leading civil lawyers, Jonathan Mitchell QC, believes Boris Johnson is not obliged to recall parliament after a Scottish court ruled he had illegally asked the Queen to prorogue Westminster. Mitchell said the refusal by Lord Carloway, the lord president, and his two colleagues to impose an interdict or injunction ordering parliament to be reconvened meant the court had not instructed the UK government to do anything. \u201cThe court stated its opinion but it didn\u2019t do anything to be acted upon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the court did was clearly with an eye to the fact this will be decided by the supreme court in a week.\u201d Mitchell, who represented Orkney voters who tried to get Alistair Carmichael thrown out of the Commons in a rare election court in 2015, said Scottish courts were entirely justified in contradicting judges in London on whether prorogation was legal or not. Scotland has a different legal system but its courts have parity with English and Welsh courts under the UK\u2019s constitution, he said. If you\u2019re driving dangerously and if one police officer does nothing but the next one does, it doesn\u2019t matter: you\u2019ve still been arrested. That\u2019s what happened here. He said they often disagreed on less serious issues, such as immigration cases. \u201cUntil it gets to the supreme court, the two national courts have equal standing,\u201d he said. Even so the UK government did treat the Scottish court differently, by refusing to produce affidavits from civil servants for the hearings in Edinburgh. Even though the Scottish case started first, it only sent up copies of evidence and affidavits it had prepared for the later hearing in London at the last minute \u2013 less than 12 hours before the first hearing started last week. Judges in Edinburgh would have seen this as a \u201cgross discourtesy\u201d, he said, but it was not unusual \u2013 litigants often fail to submit the right evidence or do so in time. Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, told the World at One that he thought the Scottish judges were pushing back against the executive. In his opinion, prorogation was lawful, he said. He said: What I think this illustrates is that if you, as a government, do something sufficiently outrageous, and politically the prorogation of parliament was politically outrageous, you tempt judges to push the boundaries out, and it looks from the summary as if that is what the Scottish judges have done ... My own view is that this is a political issue, not a legal one, and that the case can only be resolved politically ... I\u2019m not going to give a prediction, but I think that if [the supreme court] were to decide that the Scottish judges were right, they would be making really quite significant changes to a correct understanding of our constitution because the issue is the propriety of the legal motives, and that seems to me to be a fundamentally political issue. He also said that the prorogation decision was wrong politically, but that the proper response would be to change the law. He said: I have no doubt that politically this was a disgraceful thing to do and what tends to happen is that you change the law in response to a sufficiently appalling example of abuse. From the Labour MP Seema Malhotra Around 40 MPs returned to work in parliament today in protest at its suspension and to show their support for the Scottish ruling that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue is illegal. The chair of the commons\u2019 Brexit select committee, Labour MP Hilary Benn, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier, who is standing to replace John Bercow as Speaker, were among those at the gathering outside Westminster to say they will continue to work throughout suspension, even though they cannot hold any debates or speak in the Commons\u2019 chamber. Swinson said: This is really unprecedented what\u2019s happening to our democracy. It\u2019s positive the court has ruled today that this is unlawful. There is one reason why Boris Johnson has prorogued parliament and that is because he wants to force through his no-deal Brexit without having scrutiny, without having to obey the normal rules that a prime minister has to obey by. Swinson said any suggestion the judges in the Scottish court case were politically biased was \u201cappalling\u201d. Tonight the government is due to hand over secret papers relating to its no-deal preparation project, Operation Yellowhammer, which MPs at the gathering said should have been debated in the Commons. Others complained that prorogation meant Johnson gets to duck a liaison committee meeting, where chairs of all the Commons select committees question the prime minister. Labour MP Diana Johnson said the decision to prorogue parliament was shocking and did not sit easy with the public. She said: I am carrying on representing my constituents and I want to be back in the chamber, particularly around the Yellowhammer documents that are coming so we should be back, scrutinising and asking questions. I think the public are appalled that at this time of national crisis is not sitting. Some MPs have been staging a mini protest outside the Commons to make the case for parliament to be recalled. This is from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike. And this is from the Independent\u2019s Benjamin Kentish. From the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about the reasons given by the high court in London today for its decision to reject the Gina Miller legal challenge claiming prorogation was unlawful. This is how the story starts. The prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was a political matter and not one that should be reviewed by the courts, English judges have declared. Two hours after the Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d, three of the most senior English judges explained why they had come to a diametrically opposed conclusion ... On Wednesday, the judges gave the full reasons for that decision in a 24-page judgment, which concluded with sentence: \u201cIn our view, the decision of the prime minister to advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue parliament is not justiciable in Her Majesty\u2019s courts.\u201d And here is an extract from the summary of the judgment (pdf). The court concludes on well established and conventional grounds that the claim is non justiciable - that is, it is not capable of being determined by the courts. A decision to prorogue parliament is a prerogative power, a discretionary power still in the hands of the crown. Such a decision is formally made by the Sovereign on the advice of the privy council. By constitutional convention the sovereign invariably acts on the advice of the prime minister ... The criteria adopted by the courts for identifying non-justiciable exercises of prerogative power are whether they involve matters of high policy or are political. In this way the courts have marked out the separation of power between the judicial and the executive branches of government, a fundamental feature of our unwritten constitution. In this context the essential characteristic of a political issue is the absence of judicial or legal standards by which to assess the legality of the executive\u2019s decision or action ... The claimant\u2019s novel and wider legally enforceable concept of parliamentary sovereignty, distilled to its essence as the ability of parliament to conduct its business unimpeded, is not supported by the passages from the authority relied on ... The constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom have evolved to achieve a balance between the three branches of the state; the relationship between the executive and parliament is governed in part by statute and in part by convention. Standing orders of both houses elaborate the procedural relationship between the executive and parliament. This is territory into which the courts should be slow to intrude by recognising an expanded concept of parliamentary sovereignty. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, has suggested (jokingly, we assume, but you can never by 100% sure), that Boris Johnson could get arrested next time he visits Scotland. McCluskey told Sky News: It is quite extraordinary what the Scottish courts have ruled. My advice to the prime minister is don\u2019t go up to Scotland, you\u2019re liable to face a citizen\u2019s arrest, so he\u2019d best keep in his bunker somewhere in either Eton or Westminster. Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general, has said the government should drop its appeal and recall parliament immediately. He said: [The prorogation] wasn\u2019t to reset the government and have a suspension of parliament for a short time followed by a Queen\u2019s speech. It was to prevent us holding the government to account. So, I would hope that the government would now realise the extent of the crisis it has created and recall parliament immediately. It would be much more sensible that the government should simply say we are dropping the supreme court case\u2019s appeals on both sides, Parliament will sit, and arrange for us to sit in the next 24 hours. From Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, has released the text of a letter he has sent to Boris Johnson saying that parliament should be recalled immediately, and that the PM should not leave a decision on this until after the appeal has been heard at the supreme court. Downing Street moved to defuse the row about the independence of the judiciary. Asked whether the government believed the Scottish courts were politically biased, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cAbsolutely not, we have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d He added that the government would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court - but for the moment \u201cas a matter of fact, parliament remains prorogued\u201d. He went on: We are disappointed by today\u2019s decision and we will appeal to the UK\u2019s supreme court. The UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic, legislative agenda. Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this. There are now contradictory judgments in the English and Scottish courts, and the matter will be considered by the supreme court next week. Pressed on whether the PM lied to the Queen about the reasoning behind the prorogation, Johnson\u2019s spokesman referred journalists to the arguments laid out by the government\u2019s lawyers during the court cases. The answer on why parliament has been prorogued is unchanged. As we\u2019ve said, the current parliamentary session is the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. In recent months it\u2019s been one of the least active. The PM said on his first day in the job that the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. He wants to put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme. This will be a Queen\u2019s Speech focused on helping the NHS, fighting violent crime and cutting the cost of living. Two Conservative former lord chancellors have joined those defending the independence of the judiciary \u2013 and criticising anyone in Number 10 who might (or might not - see 11.49am) have been accusing the judges of bias. From David Gauke From David Lidington The Labour MP David Lammy says Boris Johnson should resign if he loses the appeal at the supreme court. Downing Street has just finished a short lobby briefing held to respond to questions about the Scottish court decision. Here are the main points. Number 10 has ruled out recalling parliament before the supreme court considers the appeal against the Scottish judgment. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman insisted the government did not think the Scottish judges were biased. Responding to questions triggered by a Sun tweet (see 11.49am),the spokesman said: \u201cWe have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d The spokesman also referred journalists to the tweet on this from Robert Buckland, the justice secretary. (See 12.29pm.) The spokesman brushed aside suggestions that Boris Johnson may have misled the Queen about his reasons for prorogation. Asked about this, the spokesman said: The reasons that have been set out for proroguing have been consistent throughout. They were in order to bring forward a legislative programme and we have been very strong in our defence in court cases suggesting otherwise. But the spokesman did not talk directly about what the PM told the Queen (something that No 10 never normally discusses), and he did not explicitly say that claims that the Queen was misled were false. The spokesman said that it remained the government\u2019s intention to respond in due course to the Commons vote demanding the publication of the Operation Yellowhammer documents. Sir Ed Davey, the deputy Lib Dem leader, has told BBC News that he thinks this affair could lead to the resignation of Boris Johnson. Asked if this could lead to Johnson having to resign as prime minister, Davey said: It could well do. If he has been found to have misled the Queen, I think the whole nation will be deeply shocked and alarmed. This is a prime minister we already know has said he might obey a law in parliament, so he is behaving in the most disgraceful way. Now it may be that the supreme court next week overturns the decision. But that three judges, independent judges, could come to this conclusion today is a real blow to the government, and it also backs what Liberal Democrats and others have been saying, this government should not have silenced parliament. In London the high court has released its full judgment explaining why it turned down the legal challenge against prorogation launched by the campaigner Gina Miller and others. Here is the summary (pdf). And here is the full document (pdf). Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has defended the Scottish judges. He is clearly seeking to defuse the row triggered by a Sun tweet. (See 11.49am.) Buckland\u2019s decision to speak out makes a striking contrast with Liz Truss\u2019s refusal to defend the judiciary in November 2016 when the Daily Mail used a splash headline to denounce judges as \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d after they ruled that Theresa May must pass legislation before triggering article 50. At the time May\u2019s relationship with the Mail was very close, and it was said that Truss was afraid of saying anything in public that could be taken as criticism of the paper. This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister. She has also said this about the Newton Dunn/No 10 source tweet quoted earlier. See 11.49am for a discussion as to what it actually means. Parliament can only be recalled if the government chooses, the Speaker\u2019s office has confirmed. Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general and one of the 21 MPs who had the whip removed last week after rebelling over Brexit, has told BBC News that, if Boris Johnson misled the Queen about the reasons for prorogation, he should resign. If it were to be the case that the government had misled the Queen about the reasons for suspending parliament, and the motives for it, that would be a very serious matter indeed. Indeed, in my view, it would then be the moment for Mr Johnson to resign, and very swiftly. Grieve was also the MP who tabled by standing order 24 motion passed by MPs on Monday demanding the release of private messages from Johnson\u2019s aides relating to the prorogation of parliament. In the debate he said government whistleblowers who had told him what really happened thought the affair \u201csmacked of scandal\u201d. This is from Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. My view is that this No 10 source quote is not as incendiary as Newton Dunn implies. The Scots have their own legal system and, according to David Allen Green (see 10.34am), on constitutional matters the Scottish courts don\u2019t always take the same view as the English courts. The No 10 source is pointing that out. But that does not make the judges biased. \u201cBiased\u201d implies bad faith, which is different. Rightly or wrongly, Gavin Barwell, Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff when she was prime minister, has used this as a cue to denounce his successor. This is what Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told Sky News about the judgment. He said: It\u2019s a very powerful judgment. And it is incredible in one sense, that the judges have gone into this space, used the language they have, saying that essentially the prime minister, his real motive was to frustrate the process and to shut down parliament. Across the country I don\u2019t think many people actually believed the prime minister when he said this is just for a Queen\u2019s speech. But for a court to say that the documents really point one way, that they undermine his case to a point where they have ruled him unlawful, that\u2019s an incredibly powerful thing for them to have done. Starmer said it was not unusual for a court to rule that the government had acted unlawfully. But he continued: But to say that the motive or the reason that the prime minister has put forward was not the true reason, that is very powerful, and very unusual for a court. I don\u2019t think they would have done it without overwhelming evidence. Stamer also called for an immediate recall of parliament. I think the right thing for the prime minister now is to recall parliament, this afternoon or tomorrow morning, so that we can get back, do our job, and look at the judgment, as a parliament, and decide what ought to happen next. The SNP has released this formal response to the judgment from Joanna Cherry, its justice and home affairs spokesperson. She said: Today\u2019s ruling of the highest court in Scotland that Boris Johnson\u2019s plans to shut down the UK parliament ahead of Brexit are unlawful and unconstitutional is a huge victory and a vindication of our case. The prorogation must now be stopped. The court agreed it is unlawful to suspend the UK parliament for the specific purpose of preventing parliament from scrutinising the Brexit process and holding this shambolic Tory government\u2019s extreme Brexit plans to account. We have uncovered more and more evidence that this was a plot by Boris Johnson and his cronies to prevent us from stopping them taking Scotland and the UK off a Brexit cliff edge by forcing through a damaging no deal against the will of parliament. This ruling takes us one step closer to ensuring the UK government cancels their shameful prorogation and blatant plot to force through an extreme Brexit. Boris Johnson cannot be allowed to break the law with impunity. This is from Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, on the court of session\u2019s judgement. This ruling shows that, despite what Boris Johnson has spent his privileged life thinking, he is not above the law. Labour will not allow his elitist shutdown of parliament to enable him to dodge scrutiny and force through a disastrous no-deal Brexit. If you have been trying to download the summary of the court\u2019s judgment, you may have had problems. The Judicial Office for Scotland website seems to have having trouble coping with all the interest. So here it is. This is not the full judgment; just a summary issued to the media. There is no bold text in the original. I have inserted it to highlight the key sentences and paragraphs in the summary. The Inner House of the Court of Session has ruled that the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen that the United Kingdom Parliament should be prorogued from a day between 9 and 12 September until 14 October was unlawful because it had the purpose of stymying Parliament. A petition for judicial review was raised by 79 petitioners, 78 of whom are parliamentarians at Westminster, on 31 July 2019, seeking inter alia declarator that it would be unlawful for the UK Government to advise HM the Queen to prorogue the UK Parliament with a view to preventing sufficient time for proper consideration of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit). A substantive hearing was fixed for Friday, 6 September, but on 28 August, on the advice of the Prime Minister, HM the Queen promulgated an Order in Council proroguing Parliament on a day between 9 and 12 September until 14 October. The Lord Ordinary (the judge hearing the case at first instance) refused to grant interim orders preventing the prorogation, but brought the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday, 3 September. On the eve of the hearing, in obedience of its duty of candour, the respondent lodged some partially redacted documents exhibiting some of the Government\u2019s deliberations regarding prorogation, going back to 15 August. The Lord Ordinary dismissed the petition. He found that the PM\u2019s advice to HM the Queen on prorogation was, as a matter of high policy and political judgment, non-justiciable; the decision to proffer the advice was not able to be assessed against legal standards by the courts. The reclaiming motion (appeal) was heard by the First Division of the Court of Session over 5 and 6 September. Parliament was prorogued in the early hours of Tuesday, 10 September. All three First Division judges have decided that the PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful. The Lord President, Lord Carloway, decided that although advice to HM the Queen on the exercise of the royal prerogative of prorogating Parliament was not reviewable on the normal grounds of judicial review, it would nevertheless be unlawful if its purpose was to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive, which was a central pillar of the good governance principle enshrined in the constitution; this followed from the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The circumstances in which the advice was proffered and the content of the documents produced by the respondent demonstrated that this was the true reason for the prorogation. Lord Brodie considered that whereas when the petition was raised the question was unlikely to have been justiciable, the particular prorogation that had occurred, as a tactic to frustrate Parliament, could legitimately be established as unlawful. This was an egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities. It was to be inferred that the principal reasons for the prorogation were to prevent or impede Parliament holding the executive to account and legislating with regard to Brexit, and to allow the executive to pursue a policy of a no deal Brexit without further Parliamentary interference. Lord Drummond Young determined that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether any power, under the prerogative or otherwise, has been legally exercised. It was incumbent on the UK Government to show a valid reason for the prorogation, having regard to the fundamental constitutional importance of parliamentary scrutiny of executive action. The circumstances, particularly the length of the prorogation, showed that the purpose was to prevent such scrutiny. The documents provided showed no other explanation for this. The only inference that could be drawn was that the UK Government and the Prime Minister wished to restrict Parliament. The Court also decided that it should not require disclosure of the unredacted versions of the documents lodged by the respondent. The Court will accordingly make an Order declaring that the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has just told BBC News that Boris Johnson should recall parliament immediately so that MPs can start sitting again this afternoon. He said it was \u201creally rare\u201d for the courts to intervene in the political process in this way and that the judges\u2019 language was \u201cvery strong\u201d. Here is some Twitter reaction to the court decision from opposition MPs. From Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster From Labour\u2019s Ian Murray From Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney From the Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has described the decision to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament as unlawful as an important victory for democracy that could allow MPs to return to parliament. Reacting to the ruling on stage at the TUC Congress in Brighton, he urged MPs to return to Westminster so they can \u201copen those doors\u201d and hold the prime minister to account. He said: This is really important. The idea of shutting down parliament offended people across the country and then they felt they weren\u2019t being told the truth. I am really pleased with the result. For the court to make a declaration like that on an issue like this is a huge thing for us. It vindicates everything we did last week. I think that what I need to do, and what others need to do, is to get back to parliament and open those doors and get back in, and get Boris Johnson back in parliament so we can hold him properly to account. He was told of the ruling by Mark Serwotka, the TUC\u2019s president, having just delivered a speech to delegates about Johnson\u2019s failing in government and last week\u2019s dramatic week in Westminster. The UK government has responded to the Scottish court decision. A spokesman said: We are disappointed by today\u2019s decision, and will appeal to the UK supreme court. The UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this. Sources pointed out that, in a very similar case in London last week, the legal challenge against prorogation was rejected. At the hearing in Scotland, Judge Lord Carloway told the court: We are of the opinion that the advice given by the government to her majesty the Queen to prorogue parliament was unlawful and that the prorogation itself was unlawful. As PA Media reports, Carloway referred the matter to the supreme court for resolution. Campaigners said their understanding was that parliament can now reassemble if it so wishes. The UK government said it would appeal against the court\u2019s decision. A summary of the court opinion, published by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service, states: The inner house of the court of session has ruled that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen that the United Kingdom parliament should be prorogued from a day between 9 and 12 September until 14 October was unlawful because it had the purpose of stymying parliament. All three first division judges have decided that the PM\u2019s advice to the HM the Queen is justiciable, that it was motivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament and that it, and what has followed from it, is unlawful. The court will accordingly make an order declaring that the prime minister\u2019s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect.

Outside the court of session in Edinburgh the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard has just said parliament should be recalled in the light of the court of session\u2019s judgement. Even though it will go to appeal at the supreme court, Sheppard said MPs should be able to be at parliament to represent their constituents. Joanna Cherry, his SNP colleague, says the recall should happen immediately. These are from my colleague Severin Carrell in Edinburgh. The court of session in Scotland has ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. This is from Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s home affairs and justice and one of the supporters of the legal challenge. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, is due to make his Brexit speech very soon. My colleague Heather Stewart has previewed it here. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the Labour MP Owen Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in 2016, said he agreed with Watson that there was no such thing as a good Brexit. Smith said: An argument in principle that there is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, that all versions of Brexit are going to leave Britain poorer and more isolated in the world, and that\u2019s why there is no good reason why Labour should be supporting that \u2026 It\u2019s at odds with our values, it\u2019s at odds with the electoral interests of the Labour party and it\u2019s at odds with the prospects for a better future for our constituents, so we should be opposed to it and we should be clear that Labour doesn\u2019t believe Brexit is a good thing and critically we shouldn\u2019t be bamboozled or bullied by Boris Johnson into going into an election on his terms. But the Labour MP Gareth Snell said he disagreed with Watson, and that he thought the numbers \u201csimply do not exist in parliament for a referendum\u201d. The public did not want a second referendum either, Snell said. Snell said he wanted MPs to have another chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement. He said: The withdrawal agreement bill, which is a very different thing \u2013 that was the outcome of the cross-party negotiations - ought to be presented to parliament as a basis on which trying to find a deal \u2026 I think minds are sharpening, I think people are seeing what damage could be done from a no-deal Brexit. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has been doing a round of broadcast interviews this morning. Among other things, she gave a surprisingly candid reason as to why the government might not publish in full its Operation Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit planning documents. Here are the main points from her various interviews. Leadsom claimed that the public would not benefit from being told the worst things that might happen under a no-deal Brexit. On Monday MPs voted for a motion binding on the government saying that by 11pm tonight it must release \u201call the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to Operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee.\u201d The government has said it plans to publish a version of the Operation Yellowhammer report, setting out what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but not when, and it has not committed to publishing all the related documents. Asked on BBC Breakfast if the government would comply with the motion, Leadsom said that the government was giving a lot of consideration to what it might publish, but officials needed to be able to offer policy advice in private. When the presenter, Dan Walker, put it to her that people had a right to know what might happen in the event of no deal, she replied: You are right to say what potentially might happen. Yellowhammer is, as you know, the reasonable worst case scenario. It is by no means a prediction of anything. It\u2019s simply the government looking at every possible angle and ensuring that we have measures in place to deal with that. Walker persisted. Businesses wanted to know what might happen, he said. Then Leadsom replied: I actually do not think that it serves people well to see what is the absolutely worst thing that could happen. The worst thing that could happen to me is I could walk out of here and get run over. It is not a prediction, but it is something that could happen. And simply putting out there all of the possible permutations of what could happen actually just serves to concern people. Whereas what the government is doing is working flat out to ensure that in all circumstances, including in the event of no deal, we have a smooth transition for the United Kingdom. There is so much work underway to make sure that in all circumstances the UK will absolutely thrive once we leave the European Union. Leadsom claimed that one of the advantages of Brexit was that it would make it easier for the UK to attract talented migrants from outside the EU. Speaking on the Today programme about the government\u2019s announcement that international students will be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university, instead of just being allowed to work for four months, under the rule introduced by Theresa May in 2012, Leadsom said this was in the UK\u2019s interests. She explained: In leaving the EU it will be our government that\u2019s able to determine our migration policy and that\u2019s incredibly important. Now we get to decide and instead of being open to free movement from just the EU, the UK will be able to take advantage of a global talent pool of young people and workforce coming from all around the world and that\u2019s something that\u2019s a great advantage for us. As Sarah Ludford, a Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson later pointed out, Leadsom was wrong to say that being in the EU stops the UK admitting talented migrants from outside Europe. Leadsom might have been trying to make the argument that, because free movement does not allow the UK to stop people from the EU entering the country to work, it does put a constraint on how many workers from outside the EU the government might want to accept if it is worried about overall numbers. Leadsom said immigration was becoming \u201cincreasingly popular\u201d. She said: There is a move in opinion polls that suggests that migration is now increasingly popular. She suggested the government would oppose a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Asked about the proposal, she said: Well we will not do anything that undermines the UK or indeed UK internal market. So we are looking at getting a deal, getting a good deal that works for the UK and for the EU that is different to the one that was negotiated previously because that couldn\u2019t get through Parliament. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, gives a speech on Brexit. As Heather Stewart reports, he will contradict Labour\u2019s official policy on the subject, saying a referendum should come before a general election and that Labour should back remain in all circumstances. 10am: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, gives a speech to the TUC. 10am: The court of session in Edinburgh will hear an appeal against its decision to reject a legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks. 12pm: The high court in London will give its reason for deciding to reject a separate legal challenge against prorogation.

      "body": "<p>There is much good sense in Polly Toynbee\u2019s case for Jeremy Corbyn being the figurehead for opposition to a no-deal Brexit at the forthcoming general election, (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/09/boris-johnson-mps-jeremy-corbyn-no-deal-leader-alliance\" title=\"\">If Johnson quits MPs should back Corbyn to avoid no deal</a>, 10 September), but it has two significant flaws. First, the election campaign will have to be in opposition to the whole Brexit deal, with a commitment to a second vote, rather than on the narrower, though crucial, opposition to a no-deal Brexit. As yet Corbyn is far from being clear enough on the broader question. Second, all the negotiations on presenting a single anti-Brexit candidate in key seats are predicated on maximising the pro second ballot vote. On this the evidence is that a Corbyn-led \u201cunity\u201d ticket will inhibit a large tranche of voters from voting for it. It may even put off some Conservative rebels from standing on the ticket.</p> <p>Toynbee can point to some straws in the wind showing a lessening of the lethal nature of the Corbyn brand, but two years on from a general election, with a Conservative government in dire straits and disarray, the main opposition party should be 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, not 10 points behind. Toynbee\u2019s persuasive skills should be directed at persuading Corbyn to suspend his Labour leadership for the brief period involved, in favour of an interim leader who can unite the anti-Brexit forces and attract the maximum vote.

The obsession with getting rid of Corbyn has allowed the real threat from the hard right to flourish, as many of us predicted.<br><strong>Karen </strong><strong>Barratt</strong><br><em>Winchester, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Dr Simon Brodbeck warns against running a general election as a proxy single-issue referendum (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/getting-to-grips-with-labour-party-brexit-policy\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 10 September). Indeed, this was effectively what Theresa May did in 2017, and it rebounded on her. I seem to remember political agents on the doorsteps saying that austerity was an issue that came up often and presumably accounted for Labour coming up late on the rails and denying the government its necessary majority, perhaps along with annoyance at having yet another election so soon after the last one.<br><strong>David Redshaw</strong><br><em>Gravesend, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jerry Hodgkinson is correct in describing Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit as incoherent (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/at-last-the-labour-position-on-brexit\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 9 September). Your report of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s meeting with leaders of the key Labour-affiliated unions helps to emphasise this: \u201cThe policy is clear \u2013 if it is a bad Tory deal, Labour will formally back remain. If Labour is in government it will negotiate the best possible deal it can and let the people decide \u2026\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/tom-watson-to-break-labours-uneasy-truce-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Back remain to attract lost Labour voters, says Watson</a>, 11 September). If I vote for Labour in a forthcoming general election, am I voting for a remain party or a Brexit party? It\u2019s a simple question.</p> <p>I am a Labour party member. If supporters like me, who want to see the UK remain in Europe, vote Labour in the general election, will our votes be taken by some Labour leaders as supporting a renegotiation of the Brexit deal? I cannot risk my vote being used in this way. There should be no deal at all because there should be no Brexit. I will therefore vote for a party that is unambiguously in favour of remain. I hope that will be Labour, but that will be up to Corbyn.<br><strong>Shaun </strong><strong>Soper</strong><br><em>Midhurst, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a strong case for Labour to back \u201cfull remain\u201d in its election manifesto. But if Labour is unable to take that step, and keeps to its current policy of \u201crenegotiate plus people\u2019s vote\u201d, it must clarify the position a Labour government would take in a second referendum.</p> <p>If it refuses to say in advance which side it will back, voters will be unable to work out whether to support Labour in the general election. If it says it will support the deal it intends to agree with Brussels, this will make Labour a leave party, and alienate its majority remain supporters. But it cannot support the remain option either, because this would involve it negotiating in bad faith with the EU \u2013 concluding an agreement that it was intending to oppose in a public vote.</p> <p>The only credible position is for Labour to say in its manifesto that it will stay neutral as a government during the referendum campaign. The point of negotiating with the EU is to create an acceptable leave option, which it will then put to a people\u2019s vote against a remain option that is likewise acceptable. Labour members, including MPs and those in the cabinet, would then be free to campaign on either side in the referendum, while the government itself stayed above the fray. The aim must be to provide a sensible choice, step back, and let the people decide.<br><strong>Alan Carling</strong><br><em>Keighley, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Re Jerry Hodgkinson\u2019s letter, where on earth is the contradiction between attempting to achieve the best possible deal outside the EU (for the 52%) and, finding it inevitably inferior to our current deal within the EU, campaigning for remain in a second referendum? In the first we decided between two abstract propositions. In the second we\u2019d be choosing between two clearly spelled-out situations.

Karen Barratt Winchester, Hampshire \u2022 Dr Simon Brodbeck warns against running a general election as a proxy single-issue referendum (Letters, 10 September). Indeed, this was effectively what Theresa May did in 2017, and it rebounded on her. I seem to remember political agents on the doorsteps saying that austerity was an issue that came up often and presumably accounted for Labour coming up late on the rails and denying the government its necessary majority, perhaps along with annoyance at having yet another election so soon after the last one. David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent \u2022 Jerry Hodgkinson is correct in describing Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit as incoherent (Letters, 9 September). Your report of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s meeting with leaders of the key Labour-affiliated unions helps to emphasise this: \u201cThe policy is clear \u2013 if it is a bad Tory deal, Labour will formally back remain. If Labour is in government it will negotiate the best possible deal it can and let the people decide \u2026\u201d (Back remain to attract lost Labour voters, says Watson, 11 September). If I vote for Labour in a forthcoming general election, am I voting for a remain party or a Brexit party? It\u2019s a simple question. I am a Labour party member. If supporters like me, who want to see the UK remain in Europe, vote Labour in the general election, will our votes be taken by some Labour leaders as supporting a renegotiation of the Brexit deal? I cannot risk my vote being used in this way. There should be no deal at all because there should be no Brexit. I will therefore vote for a party that is unambiguously in favour of remain. I hope that will be Labour, but that will be up to Corbyn. Shaun Soper Midhurst, West Sussex \u2022 There is a strong case for Labour to back \u201cfull remain\u201d in its election manifesto. But if Labour is unable to take that step, and keeps to its current policy of \u201crenegotiate plus people\u2019s vote\u201d, it must clarify the position a Labour government would take in a second referendum. If it refuses to say in advance which side it will back, voters will be unable to work out whether to support Labour in the general election. If it says it will support the deal it intends to agree with Brussels, this will make Labour a leave party, and alienate its majority remain supporters. But it cannot support the remain option either, because this would involve it negotiating in bad faith with the EU \u2013 concluding an agreement that it was intending to oppose in a public vote. The only credible position is for Labour to say in its manifesto that it will stay neutral as a government during the referendum campaign. The point of negotiating with the EU is to create an acceptable leave option, which it will then put to a people\u2019s vote against a remain option that is likewise acceptable. Labour members, including MPs and those in the cabinet, would then be free to campaign on either side in the referendum, while the government itself stayed above the fray. The aim must be to provide a sensible choice, step back, and let the people decide. Alan Carling Keighley, West Yorkshire \u2022 Re Jerry Hodgkinson\u2019s letter, where on earth is the contradiction between attempting to achieve the best possible deal outside the EU (for the 52%) and, finding it inevitably inferior to our current deal within the EU, campaigning for remain in a second referendum? In the first we decided between two abstract propositions. In the second we\u2019d be choosing between two clearly spelled-out situations. Labour\u2019s considered response shows an active concern for democracy entirely unknown to the Tories.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is under intense pressure to recall parliament following the Scottish ruling that prorogation was unlawful, with MPs branding his refusal to do so authoritarian and an affront to democracy.</p> \n<p>Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all demanded an urgent recall of parliament to allow scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline.</p> \n<p>The prime minister was facing outrage and the prospect of more protests, as No 10 made clear that parliament would not be reinstated unless Johnson was ordered to do so at appeal.</p> \n<p>The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/boris-johnsons-prorogation-of-parliament-is-lawful-scottish-court-rules\">earlier ruling</a> that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/boris-johnson-to-prorogue-parliament-on-monday-night\">prorogue parliament</a>.</p> \n<p>Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit.</p> \n<p>The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons\">House of Commons</a>.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said it was not under any obligation to bring parliament back into session following the Scottish ruling but added that the government would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court. \u201cAs a matter of fact, parliament remains prorogued,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday evening the MPs and peers involved in the Scottish court action attempted to intensify pressure on the government to reconvene parliament.</p> \n<p>Their law firm, Balfour &amp; Manson, wrote to the UK government to insist that the court\u2019s decision meant \u201cthe legal position is that parliament is not prorogued and is still in session. Any argument that parliament is \u2018in practice\u2019 prorogued is thus spurious.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amid fury that Johnson was effectively ignoring a Scottish court\u2019s judgement, Downing Street also became embroiled in a row about whether a No 10 source had briefed anonymously against Scottish judges, implying that campaigners had chosen a court in Edinburgh because of political bias.</p> \n<p>The source told the Sun: \u201cWe note that last week the high court in London did not rule that prorogation was unlawful. The legal activists choose the Scottish courts for a reason.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman hit back at the idea that Johnson\u2019s administration was in any way attacking Scottish judges, saying: \u201cAbsolutely not, we have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are now contradictory judgments in the English and Scottish courts, and the matter will be considered by the supreme court next week,\u201d he added.<br><br>However, the damage had been done, as opposition parties seized on the briefing. The SNP released an advert saying: \u201cSources at No 10 have responded by questioning the political neutrality of the Scottish judges. The Tories at Westminster are effectively saying: Scottish democracy must be ignored. Scots Law must be ignored.\u201d</p> \n<p>Also later in the day Kwasi Kwarteng, the junior business minister, appeared to reignite the row when he said it would be \u201can extraordinary development\u201d for the supreme court to uphold the Scottish ruling, adding that there was a risk people could believe the judges were politically motivated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I would say is that the more the courts get involved in politics, that is a detriment not only to politics but also to courts,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Show. \u201cBecause many people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 that the judges are biased, that the judges are getting involved in politics.

As we\u2019ve said, the current parliamentary session is the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. In recent months it\u2019s been one of the least active. The PM said on his first day in the job that the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. He wants to put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme. This will be a Queen\u2019s speech focused on helping the NHS, fighting violent crime and cutting the cost of living.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, demanded that Johnson listen to the Scottish court and told him to \u201cabide by the rule of law\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery day that parliament remains suspended, you and the UK government are shutting down democracy,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the prime minister.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cae146af-d709-44dc-a1b4-7231dceca18c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akM2iMOcUUA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, also urged Johnson to \u201copen those doors\u201d so that MPs can hold the prime minister to account.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is really important.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under intense pressure to recall parliament following the Scottish ruling that prorogation was unlawful, with MPs branding his refusal to do so authoritarian and an affront to democracy. Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all demanded an urgent recall of parliament to allow scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline. The prime minister was facing outrage and the prospect of more protests, as No 10 made clear that parliament would not be reinstated unless Johnson was ordered to do so at appeal. The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an earlier ruling that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to prorogue parliament. Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit. The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the House of Commons. Downing Street said it was not under any obligation to bring parliament back into session following the Scottish ruling but added that the government would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court. \u201cAs a matter of fact, parliament remains prorogued,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said. On Wednesday evening the MPs and peers involved in the Scottish court action attempted to intensify pressure on the government to reconvene parliament. Their law firm, Balfour &amp; Manson, wrote to the UK government to insist that the court\u2019s decision meant \u201cthe legal position is that parliament is not prorogued and is still in session. Any argument that parliament is \u2018in practice\u2019 prorogued is thus spurious.\u201d Amid fury that Johnson was effectively ignoring a Scottish court\u2019s judgement, Downing Street also became embroiled in a row about whether a No 10 source had briefed anonymously against Scottish judges, implying that campaigners had chosen a court in Edinburgh because of political bias. The source told the Sun: \u201cWe note that last week the high court in London did not rule that prorogation was unlawful. The legal activists choose the Scottish courts for a reason.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman hit back at the idea that Johnson\u2019s administration was in any way attacking Scottish judges, saying: \u201cAbsolutely not, we have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d \u201cThere are now contradictory judgments in the English and Scottish courts, and the matter will be considered by the supreme court next week,\u201d he added. However, the damage had been done, as opposition parties seized on the briefing. The SNP released an advert saying: \u201cSources at No 10 have responded by questioning the political neutrality of the Scottish judges. The Tories at Westminster are effectively saying: Scottish democracy must be ignored. Scots Law must be ignored.\u201d Also later in the day Kwasi Kwarteng, the junior business minister, appeared to reignite the row when he said it would be \u201can extraordinary development\u201d for the supreme court to uphold the Scottish ruling, adding that there was a risk people could believe the judges were politically motivated. \u201cWhat I would say is that the more the courts get involved in politics, that is a detriment not only to politics but also to courts,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Show. \u201cBecause many people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 that the judges are biased, that the judges are getting involved in politics. I\u2019m just saying what people are saying.\u201d Downing Street was also facing accusations that Johnson had misled the Queen by advising her that prorogation was legal. With tensions rising, Dominic Grieve, the former Tory cabinet minister, who had the whip withdrawn by Johnson last week, said the prime minister must resign if it turns out that he had given her the wrong advice. \u201cBoris Johnson will find himself in an untenable position in parliament ... every member that believes in our constitution would simply say, it\u2019s over,\u201d he told the BBC. Pressed on whether the PM lied to the Queen about the reasoning behind the prorogation, Johnson\u2019s spokesman referred journalists to the arguments laid out by the government\u2019s lawyers during the court cases. \u201cThe answer on why parliament has been prorogued is unchanged.

Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, accused Johnson of authoritarianism and \u201ctrampling on the very values and principles the United Kingdom was founded upon\u201d. Some Labour MPs \u2013 including some of those who took part in Monday night\u2019s rowdy late-night scenes in the House of Commons \u2013 urged Jeremy Corbyn to issue a three-line whip to summon them back to Westminster. Clive Lewis said: \u201cI am going to be discussing this with others; but there is an argument that that judgment now stands, and that the prorogation is illegal; and until it\u2019s challenged and a new judgment is made in a higher court, the prorogation has no legal basis. \u201cThere is an argument for MPs to rock up and start taking back control of the agenda \u2013 and start going through the Yellowhammer documents, and everything else that we have asked for.\u201d He suggested Corbyn could \u201cinitiate a three-line whip\u201d, to recall colleagues.

Union leaders called on Johnson to recall parliament or face further protest and court proceedings. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB, said: \u201cShutting down parliament for your own ends at a time of national crisis, when people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods are on the line, beggars belief. \u201cThe prime minister needs to heed this warning, get MPs back to Westminster and sort out the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d Len McCluskey, the head of Unite, which is Labour\u2019s largest corporate donor, told Sky News that if Johnson goes to Scotland he could be subjected to a citizen\u2019s arrest. \u201cIt is quite extraordinary what the Scottish courts have ruled.

      "bodyText": "Scottish appeal court judges have declared Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline is unlawful. The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an earlier ruling that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to prorogue parliament. Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit. The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the House of Commons. The court issued an official summary of its decision declaring the prorogation order was \u201cnull and of no effect\u201d, but Carloway said the judges were deferring a final decision on an interdict to the UK supreme court, which will hold a three-day hearing next week. Jolyon Maugham QC, the legal campaigner whose Good Law Project funded the legal action, said he and Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the group\u2019s lawyer, believed this meant prorogation was suspended with immediate effect unless the UK government won a court order reinstating it. The UK government will appeal at the UK supreme court against the latest ruling, which also contradicts a decision in Johnson\u2019s favour by senior English judges last week. The UK supreme court has already scheduled an emergency hearing on both the Scottish and English cases for 17 September, alongside a third challenge brought in the courts in Belfast. The three Scottish judges, who will issue their reasonings in full on Friday, said unanimously the prorogation was unlawful \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymying parliament\u201d. Carloway, the lord president of the court of session \u2013 the supreme civil court of Scotland \u2013 said parliamentary scrutiny of the executive was \u201ca central pillar of the good governance principle enshrined in the constitution\u201d. Lord Brodie said that attempting to frustrate parliament in this way was \u201can egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities\u201d. The court\u2019s summary concluded that Johnson\u2019s prorogation request to the Queen and her decision to accept it \u201cwas unlawful and is thus null and of no effect\u201d. Maugham said: \u201cOur understanding is that unless the supreme court grants an order in the meantime, parliament is unsuspended with immediate effect. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that my understanding of the functioning of our democracy \u2013 that allows parliament to exercise its vital constitutional role \u2013 has been vindicated by Scotland\u2019s highest court. \u201cThis is an incredibly important point of principle.
