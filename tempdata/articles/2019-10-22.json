      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Brexit looked set to be delayed until next year at the earliest after the prime minister suffered another major Commons defeat. The European council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, said he would recommend the extension be signed off and it was suggested that 31 January 2020 would be set as the new deadline, though it would be superseded if there was an earlier ratification of Brexit by MPs. Boris Johnson paused his attempt to get his deal through parliament after MPs refused to allow him to fast-track it. Despite MPs having decided to pass the legislation that would implement the deal to the next parliamentary stage, Johnson took it off the agenda because they refused to agree to accede to his demand for a three-day timetable. Downing Street indicated the PM was likely to push for a general election, rather than continue trying to get his deal through parliament. Johnson had promised to pull the bill altogether if MPs did not go along with his fast-track timetable, as well as to seek an election. While the former did not materialise, his intention to pursue the latter was underlined in anonymous late-night briefings from No 10. The chancellor suffered a squeeze on public spending in the run-up to next month\u2019s budget after an increase in borrowing to \u00a39.4bn in September. A spending increase across Whitehall departments and the rising costs of the winter fuel allowance for pensioners pushed borrowing beyond last September\u2019s \u00a38.8bn, dealing a blow to Sajid Javid\u2019s plans to inject billions of pounds into public services and infrastructure projects in his first budget on 6 November. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Heather Stewart has the full story: If, as expected, Brexit is delayed until the end of January, a general election would have to follow, the Press Association reports, citing an unnamed No 10 source. Parliament and Corbyn have repeatedly voted for delay. On Saturday, parliament asked for a delay until January and, today, parliament blew its last chance. If parliament\u2019s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This parliament is broken. The public will have to choose whether they want to get Brexit done with Boris or whether they want to spend 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scotland with Corbyn. The prime minister did not use his opportunity at the dispatch box following his Commons defeat to refer to such a plan, preferring only to confirm he was pausing the passage of his bill, and the comments above are not attributable to an official No 10 spokesperson. But the language deployed closely follows that used by Johnson when he made a similar warning to MPs earlier today. LBC\u2019s political editor has this take: The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has said: Johnson is the author of his own misfortune. He only tried to bounce his deal through parliament because he knows it will not withstand scrutiny. A Brexit deal driven by the ideology of deregulation must be stopped. The European council president, Donald Tusk, has said he will recommend the EU accept the UK\u2019s request for a Brexit extension. As we reported earlier, it is thought the EU will favour a delay until 31 January 2020: Donald Tusk has tweeted to say he will recommend accepting the UK\u2019s request for a Brexit extension: The Tories are trying to sell this evening\u2019s votes as a victory for the prime minister on the substance \u2013 and a refusal by Labour to then let him make the progress he wants to: Labour, on the other hand, are calling it a victory for those who simply don\u2019t want to allow the deal to be rammed through parliament without proper scrutiny: And, as has become traditional on such nights, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has his own unique take: Labour MPs who voted for the government\u2019s Brexit deal at second reading this evening have called for more time to discuss it at committee stage. Gareth Snell has said: The injury inflicted this evening was a mere flesh wound, and if the Leader of the House was willing to bring forward a motion tomorrow with a more considered timetable for committee stage, it would pass this House. Some of us voted for second reading precisely so we could get on to the next stage for more scrutiny, and didn\u2019t support the programme motion because we did not believe there was sufficient time. His fellow Labour MP, Ruth Smeeth, said: All we\u2019re asking for is the opportunity to ensure that the deal which was only presented to us last night works for our constituents and my local economy \u2013 we need slightly more time. Speaking in the Commons, Lucy Powell told the Leader of the House: We could have a lot longer on committee stage and he could bring forward tomorrow morning a fresh programme motion which allows us longer in committee for us to actually put amendments in a timely fashion. Jacob Rees-Mogg replied: I am not unsympathetic to the point about time, it is simply the deadline of 31 October which was set by the European Union and, therefore, we are compressed in the time available to get this bill delivered, which is why I was willing to support the programme motion and felt that it was reasonable under the circumstances. Confronted with a similar claim from the government benches earlier in the evening, some MPs have pointed out that, despite the tight deadline, the prime minister sought to prorogue parliament. Much has been made of the significance of the prime minister\u2019s decision to \u201cpause\u201d his bill, rather than pull it altogether \u2013 as well as that of his decision not to explicitly refer to 31 October when telling the Commons the UK will still leave the EU under the terms of his deal. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has now said it is \u201cvery hard to see how it is possible\u201d for the withdrawal agreement bill to pass by that date. The Conservative MP and ardent Brexiter, Peter Bone, asked: Leader of the House, can we interpret from what you are saying that it is now impossible to get the deal through this House and the other House prior to 31 October, and in that case it is effectively dead for approval before that date. Rees-Mogg replied: Impossible is a very strong word, but it is very hard to see how it is possible. And here\u2019s a little more from the lobby on what, exactly, happened this evening and what, exactly, it means: The Times\u2019 political correspondent has another take: We\u2019re getting some reaction now from senior EU27 figures. The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: It\u2019s welcome that the House of Commons voted by a clear majority in favour of legislation needed to enact withdrawal agreement. We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps; including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension. Then there\u2019s this from the European commission spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva: Sky News\u2019 Europe correspondent reports that the EU is ready to offer a delay until the end of January 2020: We reported similar earlier this evening: But the BBC\u2019s Europe editor has this: The division list for the programme motion shows just five Labour MPs rebelled to support it. They were joined by 285 Tory MPs and 18 independents in supporting the motion. Those Labour MPs are: Kevin Barron Jim Fitzpatrick Caroline Flint Kate Hoey John Mann The list showed 233 Labour MPs opposed the motion along with 35 SNP, 19 Lib Dem, 10 DUP, four Plaid Cymru and the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas; as well as five Independent Group for Change MPs and 15 independents. No current Tory MPs rebelled but nine of those 15 independents were recently kicked out of the party for rebelling against the government. They are: Guto Bebb Ken Clarke Justine Greening Dominic Grieve Philip Hammond Richard Harrington Anne Milton Antoinette Sandbach Rory Stewart No current Conservative MPs voted against the government on the withdrawal agreement bill. But three former Tory members from whom the whip was withdrawn last month did: Dominic Grieve Justine Greening Guto Bebb In all, 19 Labour MPs rebelled to support the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill. They were: Kevin Barron Sarah Champion Rosie Cooper Jon Cruddas Gloria De Piero Jim Fitzpatrick Caroline Flint Mike Hill Dan Jarvis Emma Lewell-Buck John Mann Grahame Morris Lisa Nandy Melanie Onn Stephanie Peacock Jo Platt Ruth Smeeth Laura Smith Gareth Snell Barring Barron, Cooper, Fitzpatrick, Flint and Mann, none of those supported May\u2019s deal during any of the three meaningful votes on it. Following the programme motion vote, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told MPs: The facts of the matter are this is yet another humiliating defeat for the prime minister this evening who has sought to railroad through this house legislation that requires proper scrutiny. Furthermore, it is absolutely clear what must now happen, because there is legislation passed by this house, it is the law of the land. On the basis of not agreeing a deal, that the prime minister is instructed \u2013 instructed, prime minister \u2013 to seek an extension. The Father of the House, Ken Clarke, said: Can I ask the prime minister and everybody else to reconsider the suggestion he made that we pause the progress of the bill tomorrow? I can\u2019t quite see the logic of pausing progress on the bill when the whole house is expecting the next two days to be spent on it. It would enable us to see how quickly the house is actually proceeding, what sort of time is being looked for, it may enable then, if people start filibustering, which I hope they won\u2019t, for the government to get a majority for a timetable motion if it came back which was a modest adjustment to the one he had, because I think three or four days more would certainly do it. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is on his feet setting out how the government intends to proceed. He tells MPs there will be a debate on the Queen\u2019s speech on Wednesday and Thursday and that the Commons will not sit on Friday. The shadow leader, Valerie Vaz, reiterates Labour\u2019s offer to work to find a consensus on the Brexit bill\u2019s timetabling. Following the defeat of the programme motion, the prime minister told MPs: Can I say in response how welcome it is, even joyful that for the first time in this long saga, this house has actually accepted its responsibilities together, come together, and embraced a deal? I congratulate honourable members across the house on the scale of our collective achievement because, just a few weeks ago, hardly anybody believed that we could reopen the withdrawal agreement, let alone abolish the backstop. That is indeed what they were saying. And certainly nobody thought we could secure the approval of the house for a new deal and we should not overlook the significance of this moment. And I pay particular tribute to those members of the house who were sceptical and who had difficulties and doubts and who decided to place the national interest ahead of any other consideration. I must express my disappointment that the house has again voted for delay, rather than a timetable that would have guaranteed that the UK would be in a position to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal. And we now face further uncertainty and the EU must make up their minds over how to answer parliament\u2019s request for a delay. And the first consequence, Mr Speaker, is that the government must take the only responsible course and accelerate our preparations for a no-deal outcome. The Commons Speaker has indicated that the government intends to set out in a business statement shortly how it wants to proceed. Here\u2019s a little more on the comments made by Jeremy Corbyn immediately after the government\u2019s crucial defeat on the programme motion. He told MPs: On Saturday, this house emphatically rejected the prime minister\u2019s deal. Tonight, the house has refused to be bounced into debating a hugely significant piece of legislation in just two days with barely any notice and analysis of the economic impact of this bill. The prime minister is the author of his own misfortune. So I make this offer to him tonight. Work with us, all of us, to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this house will vote to debate, scrutinise and, I hope, amend the detail of this bill. That would be the sensible way forward, and that is the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight. \u2022 This entry was amended on 23 October 2019 because Corbyn said \u201camend\u201d, the detail of the bill, not \u201ccommend\u201d as an earlier version said. Responding to this evening\u2019s votes, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said: This is not a done deal, and I won\u2019t stop fighting for our place in the European Union. Liberal Democrat MPs will always fight to keep the best deal we have as members of the European Union. Boris Johnson tried to ram his Brexit deal through Parliament tonight, because he knows it\u2019s a bad deal. But he was thrown a lifeline by Labour MPs who voted for his deal, despite all the damage it will do to our economy, our NHS and our environment. Now parliament has rejected his timetable, it is clear that the prime minister needs to get an extension so that we can have a People\u2019s Vote and offer people the chance to remain in the European Union. Ken Clarke asks the prime minister to reconsider pausing the deal, saying he cannot see the logic of pausing progress on it when the Commons is looking for time to debate it. Boris Johnson has confirmed he will set aside the bill that would implement his deal, despite the fact the Commons has just backed it, after his proposal to fast-track it through parliament was rejected by MPs. He says he does not want a delay and will continue to discuss with EU27 leaders until they decide whether or not to grant one. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says the Commons has refused to be \u201cbounced\u201d into passing the prime minister\u2019s deal. He repeats his party\u2019s offer (see 5.58pm) to work with Johnson on the timetabling. The prime minister rises to say it is a positive development for the Commons to have backed a deal in a vote for the first time. He thanks those MPs who had concerns, but still voted with him. But, he says, he is disappointed the Commons has voted for a further delay. MPs have voted to reject the government\u2019s timetable for the passage of the bill that would implement the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. They voted against by 322 to 308; a majority of 14. Boris Johnson said earlier today he would withdraw the bill and seek a general election if he lost the vote. We\u2019re getting some speculation in the Commons on whether or not the government will win this crucial vote. We\u2019ll know for sure very soon. The ERG chairman, Steve Baker, who backs the PM\u2019s deal, tweeted: \u201cIt feels like there will be a candidate selection in Runnymede shortly.\u201d The tweet appeared to be a reference to former chancellor Philip Hammond. Here\u2019s a little reaction from Westminster correspondents to that first result tonight: MPs move immediately to vote on the programme motion. And, as they do, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has this: MPs have voted to allow the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill to pass to the next stage of the parliamentary process. They voted by 329 votes to 299; a majority of 30 on the second reading. On that last-minute offer from the government, Buckland said he would bring forward an amendment to the bill to ensure that MPs can vote on any extension to the transition period. He told MPs: This issue has been concerning members right across the house: What is to happen if there is to be potential with regard to an extension of the implementation period? We believe that we can negotiate in the time that we have now, but we accept \u2026 that parliament has a legitimate role to play. I can bring forward an amendment to that effect that would allow parliament to have its say on the merits of an extension of the implementation period. And the government will abide by that. Before concluding his remarks, Buckland had an offer for soft Brexit-backing MPs: And then the Speaker calls for MPs to vote on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill. We\u2019re expecting a result in about 10 or 15 minutes. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, is on his feet in the Commons. He\u2019ll be the final speaker before MPs vote, he says. Buckland notes that he was a remainer during the referendum campaign and says he has just heard the word \u201ctraitor\u201d muttered. He calls for the tone to be raised, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy but we\u2019re here to do \u2018difficult\u2019.\u201d Buckland adds that he is being told by voters: \u201cFor the love of God, get on with it.\u201d He implores MPs to vote for both motions because \u201cthe one will not work without the other\u201d. Buckland says the deadline of 31 October was not chosen by the government, but by the EU, and that the Commons must respect their negotiating partner. Buckland is asked what Brussels might think, in that context, of the lengthy prorogation the prime minister tried to impose on parliament when it could otherwise have been debating Brexit. He replies that the broader process has been going on for years, though he leaves out that the deal has only just been formally proposed. The Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale has raised concerns about the \u201cplight\u201d of UK citizens living in the EU, their pension rights and healthcare, saying he has received \u201charrowing\u201d emails from individuals around Europe expressing their fears about what they might face. Reading the withdrawal agreement bill, he said: Scour as I could, I found not one word of comfort for UK citizens living abroad in Europe. Sir Roger said he had spoken to the prime minister this afternoon, adding: I\u2019m pleased to say that he has taken this onboard immediately and courteously and I am assured that the rights and the concerns of UK citizens will be taken into account and that a confirmatory letter to that effect will be with me in the next couple of days. He said he hoped consultations would deliver something \u201cthat will be of great comfort to some very frightened elderly people\u201d and that it would enable him not to have to move his amendment he had in preparation. Sir Roger spoke after a parliamentary committee was told British pensioners in in continental Europe are struggling to make ends meet and fear further poverty because of Brexit: The SNP MP, Joanna Cherry, will vote against the second reading and against the programme motion, she has said. Cherry told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: What we believe should happen is that an extension should be obtained from the European Union in order to enable either a general election or a second referendum to take place. She called the programme motion for the bill: \u201cFrankly ludicrous for such complex legislation,\u201d adding that some people who have read the document are \u201cdeeply troubled by many aspects of it, not just for Scotland, but for the whole of the UK\u201d. Trade groups have expressed concern as it emerges that businesses shipping goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would be burdened with yet more Brexit red tape under the prime minister\u2019s proposed deal. The news that such goods would require exit declarations comes after the government\u2019s risk assessment on the Brexit deal flagged that the profitability of businesses trading to and from Northern Ireland could be affected by the cost of checks and administration. Businesses shipping from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are already facing customs and regulatory checks. On Monday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, acknowledged that products moving the other way will also encounter added paperwork in the form of exit summary declarations, having previously insisted the route would be frictionless. Seamus Leheny, of the Freight Transport Association, called on the government to explain why the exit declarations were part of the Brexit deal, as he claimed the EU had not insisted on the measure. Leheny said transport companies in Northern Ireland would face an added administration cost. This is another layer of administration and red tape which we were promised Brexit would remove. One of the reasons for Brexit was because of red tape, but all we are seeing for the last two and half years is the likelihood of more and more red tape. I think everyone was caught off guard by this because the EU weren\u2019t pressing for this to be implemented. When myself and other business groups met the EU about a year and a half ago, it was one of the things the EU said OK, yes, we can row back on, as part of ensuring frictionless trade from NI to GB. So, it\u2019s something the UK government has decided to implement, if it does. What it is, is an unwelcome administration burden on transport providers. Ann McGregor, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also expressed concern. The new deal includes a de facto customs border in the Irish Sea, bringing with it the concept of export summary declarations. It is still unclear what exactly these will look like, they will be discussed and agreed by the joint committee during the transition period should the prime minister\u2019s deal pass. It is, however, clear that there will be some paperwork for goods going both ways (NI to GB and GB to NI). Whatever these forms turn out to be, it will be very different from what we have now \u2013 adding a further administrative burden to businesses and slowing down the on-time delivery model that many companies operate. Labour has said it will seek a consensus with the government on the timetable for the withdrawal agreement bill, but that it will not accept the three-day process the prime minister is trying to force through. Michel Barnier has fuelled fears of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 after suggesting future negotiations on a trade deal might require more than three years of talks, our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey, reports. Speaking to the European parliament, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator appeared to concede the 14-month transition period would not allow time to reach agreement on a new trade and security arrangement. He said such talks could take \u201cthree years or more\u201d. The current transition period, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union but not be part of the EU\u2019s decision-making bodies, finishes at the end of December 2020. The withdrawal agreement allows for the transition period to be extended by \u201cone to two years\u201d but Boris Johnson has said he will not trigger such a prolongation. The FT\u2019s politics team has calculated that Boris Johnson is just two votes off passing his programme motion, which will force the Brexit bill through parliament in three days. The Irish Mirror is reporting that the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is keen to get Brexit done by 31 October because he has tickets to see Cher on 1 November. \u201cHe has tickets for the pop legend in Dublin\u2019s 3Arena on November 1 and wants to enjoy it properly,\u201d the paper reports. \u201cMr Varadkar is a self-confessed Kylie Minogue fan who sent her a personal letter and got a selfie with the Aussie when she performed here last December. \u201cBut he is also believed to love Cher and has been looking forward to the concert for months.\u201d From the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief: The Guardian has published this piece by an anonymous civil servant who works on the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer, which is responsible for preparing for a no-deal Brexit. More and more civil servants are being pulled in to work on the project, they say: The official reason we are given for this new phase is that the UK, thanks to its self-hating parliament, can\u2019t be sure that the EU will grant a Brexit extension, thus making no deal more likely. But the real reason, of course, is to help to terrify craven MPs into voting for the deal by carrying out a pre-Halloween dress rehearsal of what no deal will actually feel like. They go on to say: Much of this Yellowhammer shtick is just for show. As a civil servant I\u2019m angry about that \u2013 and so should you be. There\u2019s a risk, though, of anger giving way to boredom. Even this week, the prime minister is counting on MPs just being too bored to scrutinise the dense legalese of the 110-page withdrawal agreement bill within three backbreaking days. It\u2019s well worth a read. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson is now speaking. He says he would love to be voting for a bill, but he simply can\u2019t. He says he has no desire to stay within the EU, but he does insist that Northern Ireland leaves on the same terms as the rest of the UK. He says: We will be left in an arrangement whereby EU law on all trade, goods etc will be applied to Northern Ireland. We will be in a situation where we will be subject \u2013 despite what the prime minster says \u2013 to the full implementation of EU customs regulations and that means that goods moving from GB into Northern Ireland will be subject to declarations, checks, tariffs being imposed. And now we find out yesterday that, despite the promise of unfettered access to the UK market, checks will occur in the opposite direction for those thousands of firms in Northern Ireland that currently export to GB and don\u2019t face any impediments or costs at the moment. Dominic Grieve is speaking. He says we are at the end of a long process and we are \u201cvery tired and very weary\u201d. He says that the Brexit bill related to an international treaty and, as such, changing it unilaterally was out of the question. \u201cWe can provide some safeguards,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could put in a referendum lock and I will vote for that in due course.\u201d He questions the PM\u2019s assertion that the arrangements will \u201cmelt away\u201d once a free trade agreement is signed. But Grieve says that it is all a matter for negotiation with the EU. \u201cThe suggestion that we can get a satisfactory free trade agreement for ourselves and then insist that Northern Ireland be included in it, is simply wrong,\u201d says Grieve. He adds that this is an extraordinary thing for a unionist party to do. The shadow international trade secretary getting some shut-eye before tonight\u2019s late sitting of parliament. This from the FT\u2019s political editor \u2013 Oliver Letwin \u2013 who this weekend successfully tabled an amendment to withhold approval of the Brexit deal until the withdrawal bill is passed \u2013 has said he will back the programme motion that pushes the bill through in three days. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has suggested that a border poll on Irish unity is likely to happen within five years due to Brexit upheaval, the Press Association reports. O\u2019Neill said polls show the necessity for debate and planning to begin on preparations for a border poll, and then beyond that to a united Ireland. Sinn F\u00e9in has said they want a border poll on a united Ireland within five years, but O\u2019Neill said Brexit could cause it to happen sooner. Speaking in Dublin, she said the collapse of the Berlin Wall and subsequent reunification of East and West Germany shows that major political events such as Brexit can speed events up. Everything is moving in that direction. I believe it was moving there even before Brexit, but clearly Brexit has become a catalyst for it. What is important to note is the German example. I think with the Berlin Wall, Germany was reunited within a year ... the fact that events overtook and the country was unified within a year. The shadow chancellor tweets that the prime minister and Dominic Cummings are in a state of panic. From the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor: The DUP\u2019s Emma Little Pengelly said earlier that she has \u201cserious concerns that there has been some mistake in relation to the printing of the withdrawal agreement\u201d. She says she can\u2019t find any reference to the proposed arrangements disappearing as soon as a free trade deal has been signed. \u201cPerhaps my copy has some sort of missing pages,\u201d she says. Labour\u2019s Catherine McKinnell says she had also noticed that the PM made reference to checks and declarations on GB/NI goods being \u201ctransitory and melting away unless a majority of Northern Ireland choose to retain them\u201d. She says she shares concerns that that is not correct. Perhaps there has been some confusion between the future decision in relation to the single market and being in a customs union, and does it not highlight the challenge that we have, Mr Speaker, that not only does the prime minister appear to need additional time to consider the real implications on the decisions being taken \u2026 Back to the debate, the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says the bill will impact on people across the UK and that the government has a duty to negotiate will all of the devolved administrations. He says he regrets the SNP hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to work with the government on a compromise. \u201cMr Speaker, what on earth are we doing pushing this legislation through in a couple of days?\u201d he says. Anna Soubry says that she can\u2019t find a single part of the Brexit bill that meets a promise made by the leave campaign in the referendum. An interesting prediction on what might happen next from the FT\u2019s political editor. Jeremy Corbyn says the bill sets out a deeply damaging deal and that the prime minister knows that. \u201cWhich is why he\u2019s trying to push it through without scrutiny,\u201d he says. So Mr Speaker, Labour will seek more time to scrutinise. We will seek a very clear commitment on a customs union, a strong single market relationship, hard-wired commitment on workers\u2019 rights, non-regression on environmental standards and loopholes closed to avoid the threat of a no-deal Brexit once and for all. Lastly, Mr Speaker, the prime minister\u2019s deal should go back to the people to give them, and not just the members of this house, the final say. They always say, Mr Speaker, that the devil is in the detail and having seen the detail it confirms everything we thought about this rotten deal. A charter for deregulation across the board, paving the way for a Trump-style trade deal that will attack jobs, rights and protections and open up our precious public service [...] to even more privatisation. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, reports that shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has clashed with shadow cabinet colleagues over Labour\u2019s stance on a second referendum. She writes: At the weekly shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Starmer suggested Labour policy meant the party must support any amendment to the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill calling for a referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 and then campaign for remain. But in a debate that became testy at times, according to two people present, Starmer faced a backlash from colleagues including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. One witness said Lavery accused Starmer of \u201cramming this policy down my throat for 18 months\u201d. Jim Fitzpatrick, the MP for Poplar and Limehouse, asks Corbyn for reassurance that Labour members \u201cwho exercise their conscience this evening and don\u2019t follow the whip, will not have that whip removed any more than he had it removed when he exercised his conscience\u201d. Corbyn says he believes in the power of persuasion, but doesn\u2019t directly answer the question. \u201cI would like to persuade my honourable friend,\u201d he says. \u201cCome with us. Vote against this bill and vote against the programme motion.\u201d Here\u2019s our story on Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to pull the Brexit bill and seek an election. Boris Johnson has threatened to pull the Brexit legislation and seek an election before Christmas if MPs vote to stop him rushing it through the House of Commons in three days. Speaking in the House of Commons, the prime minister said a vote against his timetable would delay Brexit for three months if the EU decides to grant the extension. Lady Hermon pays tribute to Tony Blair, who she says was the architect of the Good Friday agreement. She says she knows the Labour party has anxiety that the new Brexit deal undermines the agreement and asks Corbyn to explain that. Corbyn says the deal creates a different trading relationship with the EU in the UK and Northern Ireland. He says while there might not be an aspiration at the moment to introduce physical custom points on road borders, that the \u201cdirection of travel is not a good one\u201d. Steve Baker, a leading Eurosceptic Tory MP, says to Corbyn that he cherishes the memory of the interview they did together on Sky News before he became leader, where they agreed the UK should leave the EU on democratic grounds. Corbyn says that parliament needs time to do its job and scrutinise the bill. He also says that as a former trade union organiser he learned that \u201cyou don\u2019t give up what you\u2019ve won\u201d. He says the bill undermines workers\u2019 rights. Gloria De Piero, the MP for Ashfield, says she is also minded to support the Brexit bill \u201cnot because I support the deal, but because I don\u2019t\u201d. She says she wants the opportunity to amend it in parliament. Corbyn says he understands her concerns and that \u201cshe is a great MP\u201d. He says he hopes that she will understand why he isn\u2019t backing it and says that she should join him in voting against the programme motion. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour is challenging the bill. He says that, in government, Labour would renegotiate a deal with the EU and would put that to a referendum. He says the deal on the table would leave open the possibility of crashing out at the end of next year. Lisa Nandy, one of the Labour MPs set to rebel and vote for the second reading of the Brexit bill, asks him whether he understands her position and that of the other rebels. He says he does understand the concerns in the heavily leave-voting constituencies that MPs like Nandy represent. \u201cMy recommendation would be to vote against this bill,\u201d he says. (Lisa Nandy is the MP for Wigan.) David Linden, the SNP MP for Glasgow East, asks the prime minister about reports on Twitter (see below), that the government will pull the withdrawal bill if the programme motion is not passed. Johnson says: I will in no way allow months more of this. If parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen and instead gets its way and decided to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in those circumstances [the government cannot] continue with this ... I must say that the bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election. I will argue at that election: \u2018Let\u2019s get Brexit done\u2019. And the leader of the opposition will make his case to spend 2020 having two referendums \u2013 one on Brexit and one on Scotland \u2026 Mr Speaker, there is another path. That is to accept, as I have done, that this deal does not give us everything that we want. And all of us can find clauses and provisions to which we can [object], as we can in any compromise. But it also gives us the opportunity to conclude that there is no dishonour in setting aside the entirely legitimate desire to deliver the perfect deal in the interest of seizing the great deal that is now within our grasp. Stephen Hammond, the MP for Wimbledon (and one of the Tory MPs to have had the whip removed), asks the PM to reconsider the \u201carbitrary deadline\u201d for EU citizens to apply for settled status in the UK. He says he has one of the highest concentrations of EU citizens living in his constituency. Johnson responds that the settled status scheme is \u201cproceeding apace\u201d and they have every hope that the 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK will register by the time of the deadline. The prime minister\u2019s brother, Jo Johnson, stands up and says: \u201cI congratulate the prime minister on getting a deal. I never doubted it for a minute.\u201d (He resigned over it, remember.) He asks for reassurance that after the bill has received royal assent, the prime minister will work tirelessly to get the closest possible relationship with the EU over science and research funding. \u201cI thank my honourable friend, and brother,\u201d says the PM, before going on to reassure him. Johnson continues: They said that we couldn\u2019t change the withdrawal agreement in the 90 days that we had. They said that we\u2019d never get rid of the backstop. They said we wouldn\u2019t be able to get a new deal. We did get a new deal. We got a great deal ... And we will get a great new free trade agreement and a new partnership for our country. That is the project that lies before us. The Green MP Caroline Lucas asks about \u201cthe trapdoor\u201d in the deal where if the UK hasn\u2019t negotiated an arrangement with the EU by the end of next year, we will \u201ccrash out\u201d. Johnson says there will be no crashing out \u201cbecause we will negotiate a great new friendship and partnership\u201d. Simon Hoare, the Tory MP for North Dorset, says that squaring the circle of delivering Brexit under the umbrella of the Good Friday agreement and maintaining peace on the island of Ireland was always going to be difficult, but that no communities are now fearful of a return to violence under the proposed deal. He says the prime minister should be congratulated. Johnson says thanks. \u201cI do intend to bring the whole house into the process of decision making,\u201d he says. The BBC\u2019s political editor reports that the government will pull the withdrawal agreement bill if MPs don\u2019t agree to its proposed timetable later this evening, and will try again for a general election. Labour\u2019s Don Valley MP, Caroline Flint, who has said she will vote for the WAB, asks for reassurance that the bill will protect the climate emergency. Johnson says: \u201cI can make that commitment.\u201d He says that if the EU brings forward new environmental legislation, parliament will be given the opportunity to bring forward laws that mirror it. My colleague Helen Pidd visited Flint\u2019s constituency this weekend and found many of her constituents supported her stance on the withdrawal bill. Johnson says there will be no checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, just some \u201clight touch measures\u201d. \u201cThe most important point is that even these measures automatically dissolve unless the majority of Stormont vote to keep them,\u201d he says. Johnson says the bill will allow the government to take action against \u201cemployers and agencies who undercut our laws, including agencies that bring in overseas labour \u2013 particularly from the EU\u201d. He says the bill would realise \u201cour vision of dynamic high-wage, low-tax economy\u201d. Tracy Brabin, the Labour MP in Batley and Spen, raises the issue of workers\u2019 rights. Johnson acknowledges that people need reassurance that the UK will not regress on the issue. He says that if the EU decides to introduce new protections, the UK parliament will automatically consider introducing them too. \u201cIn essence, it takes back to this house the powers to decide these matters,\u201d he says. Johnson adds that we shouldn\u2019t lack confidence in \u201cour collective ability\u201d to use these new powers for the public good. Owen Paterson, the Tory MP for North Shropshire, asks for a \u201ccategorical assurance\u201d that we will not use our fish stocks as a bargaining chip in future negotiations. \u201cI can confirm that we will take back 100% control of the spectacular marine wealth of this country,\u201d says Johnson. Lady Hermon, the independent MP for North Down, says the prime minister must not take the people of Northern Ireland for fools and must explain the implications of the deal to the people there. The prime minister says the vast majority of the Northern Irish economy will leave the EU with the rest of the UK. Dominic Grieve says the PM must recognise that the arrangements for Northern Ireland do not deliver \u201cthe recovery of sovereignty\u201d to that country. Johnson says: \u201cYes, of course there are transitory arrangement for some aspects of the Northern Ireland economy, but those automatically dissolve and are terminated after four years\u201d unless it is the majority decision of Stormont for them not to. \u201cThe principle of consent is at the heart of these arrangements,\u201d he says. Johnson says the deal \u201cis the biggest restoration of sovereignty in our history\u201d. Asked by Labour\u2019s Catherine McKinnell about the government\u2019s economic impact assessments, he says that getting the deal done would \u201cunleash a great tide of investment\u201d and a \u201cpowerful shot in the arm\u201d for the country. Boris Johnson is up to open the debate on the withdrawal agreement bill. (You can watch the live feed at the top of this blog.) The prime minister says he wishes the house had voted for the deal on Saturday, and that he still has \u201cthe utmost respect\u201d for Oliver Letwin, though he disagrees with him. He says he regrets being forced to ask for an extension, but today is an opportunity to put that right by getting \u201cBrexit done\u201d. MPs are taking their seats in preparation for the debate on the withdrawal agreement bill. Boris Johnson is set to open the debate, with Jeremy Corbyn opening for Labour. This is the latest from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt It\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over from Ben Quinn for the afternoon. MPs in parliament are still debating the issue of British children trapped in Syria. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has been watching the debate. The debate on the withdrawal agreement is scheduled to begin when this is finished. \u2022 Soft-Brexit Conservatives could back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to push through his deal in three days if the government agrees to close a loophole that would allow the UK to crash out on World Trade Organization terms at the end of next year. Rory Stewart, one of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn, said he and some of his fellow rebels had been negotiating \u201cthrough the night\u201d to give parliament more control over the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, including being able to vote for an extension to the talks. \u2022 Donald Tusk has in effect confirmed the EU will grant a Brexit delay beyond 31 October, with the terms of the extension of UK membership depending on developments in Westminster. As MPs prepare for their first vote on the revised Brexit deal, the president of the European council told the European parliament that the EU\u2019s final response to Boris Johnson\u2019s letter seeking an extension would be given in the coming days. \u2022 The chancellor has suffered a squeeze on public spending in the run-up to next month\u2019s budget after an increase in borrowing to \u00a39.4bn in September. A spending increase across Whitehall departments and the rising costs of the winter fuel allowance for pensioners pushed borrowing beyond last September\u2019s \u00a38.8bn, dealing a blow to Sajid Javid\u2019s plans to inject billions of pounds into public services and infrastructure projects in his first budget on 6 November. \u2022 The Scottish government has recommended that consent from Holyrood for the new Brexit deal should be withheld. The Scottish government\u2019s Brexit secretary described the attempts of the UK government to pass its new withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) as \u201cirresponsible and disrespectful\u201d to the devolved administrations. The pro-EU movement has grown in numbers and developed its own political identity based around opposing Brexit, but could it now be running out of road? In a week that could determine the Brexit outcome, Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss this and more on the the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. With the numbers looking very tight, this tweet from Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt suggests the prime minister has an eye on taking the bill off the table if it doesn\u2019t go his way. General election territory then? A fierce row broke out at the a meeting of the shadow cabinet earlier today about whether to back a Kyle-Wilson type amendment on a second referendum, according to the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart. In the House of Commons, the foreign office minister, Andrew Murrison, is responding to an urgent question on British children trapped in Syria. The debate on the withdrawal agreement is scheduled to begin afterwards. Soft-Brexit Conservatives could back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to push through his deal in three days if he agrees to close a loophole that would allow the UK to crash out on World Trade Organization terms at the end of next year, the Guardian\u2019s political team reports. It is understood No 10 is preparing to concede on some amendments but is putting pressure on the former Tories not to block the programme motion, arguing this would delay Brexit. There are believed to be only a handful of the group of former Tory MPs still threatening to vote with the opposition parties to give parliament more time to scrutinise the bill. Margot James, one of the whipless Tories, told the Guardian she was planning to support the government on all votes. Ed Vaizey, another former Conservative, also indicated he was planning to vote for Johnson\u2019s timetable, although he said he may change his mind if Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, continued to send \u201cludicrous tweets\u201d saying \u201ca vote against the programme motion is a vote against Brexit\u201d. Dozens of Labour MPs will back the \u201cconcept\u201d of the Brexit bill at second reading later today, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The Daily Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom meanwhile has this shot of the customs union amendment which was expected to be tabled to the bill: The Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason reckons that the amendment could pass if the DUP, SNP and Lib Dems row in behind the Labour and Tory support for it. On the question of the DUP, the Guardian\u2019s Rajeev Syal has this: The Scottish Government has recommended consent from Holyrood for the new Brexit deal should be withheld. Under the devolution settlement, a legislative consent motion (LCM), also known as a Sewel motion, must be lodged in the devolved parliaments when the UK Government is looking to pass a law on a matter for which Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland has power. An LCM has now been lodged in the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish government\u2019s Brexit Secretary, Mike Russell. An LCM is a political convention that does not provide the devolved administrations with the legal ability to veto decision made at Westminster and therefore is not needed for the UK Government to pass legislation. Russell has described the attempts of the UK Government to pass its new Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) as \u201cirresponsible and disrespectful\u201d to the devolved administrations. Writing to Westminster to announce the lodging of the LCM, Mr Russell said: \u201cIt is essential that it should receive scrutiny in all of the UK\u2019s legislatures, that there should be the proper opportunity for civil society to consider it and for citizens to understand its meaning and significance, and for all constitutional conventions, including the Sewel Convention, to be respected during its passage.\u201d Britain will be \u201cliving a free country\u201d in nine days if MPs vote for the bill, according to Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the Tory party\u2019s hardline pro-Brexit grouping, the European Research Group. The emperor has no clothes and it is now nakedly obvious that half of the House of Commons will never support Britain leaving the European Union, he added on BBC. Francois was followed by the Liberal Democrat\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, who had tabled an amendment in relation to the issue of settled status of EU27 nationals. The safeguards the government had brought forward were clearly not adequate given that it had emerged that EU27 nationals faced the prospect of deportation if they did not apply under a government scheme. The crunch point will come around the programme motion, used by the government to timetable the bill\u2019s progress. An organisation representing EU nationals in the UK is calling on MPs to vote down the government\u2019s timetable today to allow extra time for debate and, in its words, \u201cdeliver on the referendum promises to EU citizens\u201d. Maike Bohn, the co-founder of the3million, said there are many outstanding issues on EU citizens\u2019 rights that have not been addressed properly. The most important one is to prevent innocent people from falling into the hostile environment and even potentially face deportation. After leaving EU citizens in limbo for over three years, the government now intends to railroad through potentially life-changing legislation with just three hours of committee scrutiny. An update on timing. The debate on the Brexit bill now is not likely to start until about 1.15pm, or perhaps a little bit later. The Speaker has selected an urgent question on British children trapped in Syria, which is timed for 12.30pm. The second reading of the vote is still scheduled for 7pm, along with the second reading vote and programme motion. The chancellor has suffered a squeeze on public spending in the run-up to next month\u2019s budget after an increase in borrowing to \u00a39.4bn in September. A spending upturn across Whitehall departments and the rising costs of the winter fuel allowance for pensioners pushed borrowing beyond last September\u2019s \u00a38.8bn, knocking Sajid Javid\u2019s plans to inject billions of pounds into public services and infrastructure projects in his first budget on 6 November. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed borrowing for the first half of the financial year was up by more than a fifth, confirming that a decade-long trend of deficit reduction has come to an end even before the costs of Brexit have taken their toll. Read on. The Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says he has not read the bill, nor has he tried to \u2026 but will be voting for it. Perhaps that doesn\u2019t matter. The MP for the London constituency of Poplar and Limehouse elaborated on this position to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, telling her that this was a vote in principle. \u201cI will have read it by seven o\u2019clock tonight, I hope. I will be studying it this afternoon,\u201d he added. Some more whisperings regarding the potentially decisive position of Boris Johnson\u2019s erstwhile partners, the Democratic Unionists. Gordon Rayner of the Telegraph tweets: And Frances Elliott, the political editor of the Times, has this from Labour sources: That qualified support from some of the 21 Tory rebels appears to be on fairly fragile ground, however. Ed Vaizey, the former culture minister, tweets his distaste of some of the way Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, has framed the choices facing MPs today: The 21 MPs expelled in September from the parliamentary Conservative party after they rebelled in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit appear to be split on how they will vote today. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, has been speaking to the former minister Margot James, and tweets: The UK housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, has insisted three days is sufficient time for MPs to debate the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 and anyone who votes against it in Tuesday\u2019s crunch debate is trying to thwart Brexit. The House of Commons will hold two key votes late on Tuesday: one on the second reading of the bill \u2013 effectively on the principle of whether it should proceed \u2013 and another on the government\u2019s fast-track timetable for pushing it through parliament. If MPs reject this plan, it will be all but impossible for the prime minister to meet his promise of leaving the EU by 31 October, though he will blame the failure on parliament. The 110-page bill was published on Monday evening \u2013 and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has said he does not intend to carry out an economic impact of it, because it is \u201cself-evidently\u201d in the UK\u2019s interests to end uncertainty about Brexit. Read the story here: The influential Labour backbencher Hilary Benn has been flagging up his concerns around clause 30 of the bill, which MPs first saw last night, and how the prospect of a no-deal Brexit still looms. \u201cWhat happens if the government doesn\u2019t propose an extension?\u201d asked Benn, whose name has been unofficially attached to the act that required Boris Johnson to request a three-month Brexit delay unless he can pass a deal or get MPs to approve a no-deal exit by 19 October. \u201cParliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on the 31 December 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn\u2019t been reached by then with the EU; ie no deal.\u201d Now read this thread from the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, Peter Foster: A good way of getting up to speed on what\u2019s been happening this week - and what\u2019s likely to happen - is to take a look at the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing, which this week is written by our Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll. As a recap for today, she writes that MPs face two votes \u2013 one on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) at 7pm, then another immediately after, the programme motion. This promises to be a major flashpoint, as it will deliver or crash the government\u2019s dramatically accelerated timetable. If Johnson gets his way he will be on course for a Brexit on 31 October, albeit with a likely short extension, now being considered by EU leaders. If he fails, he could abandon the bill altogether and try to engineer a vote on a general election. Either way it is likely that an extension to article 50 will be granted. The French are against it, but Germany is keeping the door open. For those who like to read the Brussels runes, there\u2019s a bit more from Donald Tusk, who has been addressing the European parliament, regarding Boris Johnson\u2019s unsigned, half-hearted extension letter The SNP\u2019s parliamentary leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, tweets news of an amendment lodged by the party. Looks like they\u2019ve decided to take a sideways look at it (sorry). But are MPs really that scared of an election? This piece in Tribune by James Meadway, a former adviser to John McDonnell, urges Labour to believe that Boris Johnson can be beaten. To win, Labour must determine the economic agenda in an election, he writes. We want Tories chasing around after us and our announcements \u2013 just as they had to two years ago. So that means taking the 2017 manifesto as our starting point, and looking to build on it. Of course, we\u2019re going to end austerity. Of course, we\u2019re going to nationalise water, rail, and the rest. This is just political common sense now: the entire political terrain has moved. Boris Johnson should ask for an extension and show that he has listened to parliament\u2019s desire for more time, writes the Conservative commentator Iain Martin on his Reaction website (\u00a3). He adds: \u201cThere is deep disquiet among MPs about the government allowing only three days of debate. They may, later today, defeat the government\u2019s \u2018programme motion\u2019 - throwing the whole thing into chaos.\u201d \u201cThe government will then demand an election, which MPs seem in no mood to grant, because they are terrified of the voters and the epic kicking they have stored up.\u201d The question of time aside, Isabel Hardman of the Spectator reckons meanwhile that the government is currently losing the \u2018air war.\u2019 The status of EU nationals in the UK has been highlighted by Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit co-ordinator at the European parliament, where MEPs would be expected to vote on the deal later this week after it is ratified by MPs. He compared the situation of EU nationals to those Britons caught up in the Windrush scandal. We heard earlier that Rory Stewart and others had been negotiating \u201cthrough the night\u201d with Downing Street. Steven Swinford from the Times sheds some more light on what\u2019s being sought. British MEPs have been giving short addresses at the European parliament, where the Labour grouping\u2019s leader, Richard Corbett, said that there should be no mistake that the UK government was attempting to force through a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. \u201cIt will be damaging to Britain\u2019s economy and damaging to the European Union\u2019s economy,\u201d he added. Nigel Farage has also been on his feet, telling the parliament that the deal reduces the UK to the status of a colony of the EU. \u201c[Boris] wants to bounce us into this new treaty before we wake up. It\u2019s the same story every time. It\u2019s about the Tory party, not the country.\u201d Jean Claude-Juncker has been speaking in the European parliament \u2013 \u201cthe beating heart of European democracy\u201d apparently \u2013 as his five-year term as president of the European commission comes to an end. \u201cIn truth, it has pained me to spend so much of this mandate dealing with Brexit when I have thought of nothing less than how this union could do better for its citizens \u2026 a waste of time and a waste of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cI will always regret the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union but at least we can look at ourselves in the eye and say we have done all in our power to ensure that this departure is orderly.\u201d There was applause from MEPs as he added that MPs in Westminster had to first ratify the deal before MEPS did so: \u201cFirst London, then Strasbourg.\u201d The fact is that most MPs \u201cdon\u2019t read most of the words of most of the legislation most of the time\u201d, the former Conservative MP and commentator Matthew Parris has said on the BBC. But it is about the principle, he added. Here\u2019s some reaction from those who would have liked more time: \u2026 and a slightly hypnotic \u2013 I\u2019m thinking 1990s MTV music videos \u2013 Conservative party tweet hammering home that slogan The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, has told the European parliament that he is consulting EU leaders on how to respond to the UK\u2019s request for an article 50 extension. The deal reached with the UK is based on the deal agreed with Theresa May\u2019s government, Tusk added, but the changes concern the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, formerly known as the backstop \u201cPrime minister Johnson\u2019s acceptance to have customs checks at the points of entry into Northern Ireland will allow us to avoid border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and will ensure the integrity of the single market. \u201cThe revised deal was possible and acceptable to the EU because: firstly, it had the support of Ireland; secondly, it had the support of the European commission, ensuring that all our negotiating objectives were met; and thirdly, because it avoids a chaotic no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u201cThe situation is quite complex following events over the weekend in the UK, and the British request for an extension of the article 50 process. \u201cI am consulting the leaders on how to react, and will decide in the coming days. It is obvious that the result of these consultations will very much depend on what the British parliament decides, or doesn\u2019t decide. We should be ready for every scenario.\u201d \u201cBut one thing must be clear: as I said to prime minister Johnson on Saturday, a no-deal Brexit will never be our decision.\u201d The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, one of a number of MPs whose votes could make the difference for Boris Johnson, has written this piece for Labour List on why she\u2019s voting for the withdrawal agreement bill at second reading. Politics is nothing if not the hard graft of negotiating through difficult choices in the interests of the many. The rest is protest. It\u2019s time all MPs from every party stopped holding out for our perfect outcome and found the route to compromise. Nandy adds that MPs could, as one Labour colleague put it to her, \u201ckeep our hands clean\u201d, and stand on the sidelines watching the bill go through to the detriment of those they represent. Or they could allow it to be debated at second reading \u201cto fight for the vision of the future we want\u201d. She adds: If we can\u2019t get the numbers, if we can\u2019t win support, if we can\u2019t win our argument in parliament, then we have to take this argument to the country in a general election and put a real alternative to the people. This is the reality of where we are. It\u2019s time we faced it. Raphael Hogarth, an associate at the Institute for Government, has been tweeting analysis of the bill, which he describes as having \u201camusingly weak provisions on workers\u2019 rights\u201d \u201cNot so much a non-regression clause as a \u2018non-regression, unless the minister wants regression\u2019 clause,\u201d he reckons. Jenrick was asked in a BBC interview about a lack of guarantees on workers\u2019 rights in the bill, and replied that it would be for MPs to decide in the future. \u201cWe are saying that parliament will decide, and that\u2019s the point of taking back control, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he added. \u201cTrusting parliament to make important decisions on workers\u2019 rights or the environment.\u201d The secretary of state said the government was likely to improve rights \u201cfurther and faster\u201d than the EU. \u201cWe have no intention of falling behind Europe and I suspect we are going to go further and faster than our European friends,\u201d he said. Using the analogy of buying a house, he said he saw no reason why MPs could not \u201cmove quite quickly\u201d to approve Brexit. \u201cIf I had been thinking about buying that house for three years, if I\u2019d been debating it with my wife and family for 500 hours, I think I might be able to move quite quickly when the opportunity arose,\u201d the cabinet minister told the BBC. Some reaction. The government minister, Robert Jenrick, has said that MPs who want to \u201cpore over the details\u201d of the Brexit bill will have time to do so but the \u201cbig seismic questions about our future relationship\u201d will be for the future. The comments from the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on Sky News have struck some as odd, given the urgency which Downing Street has sought to inject into proceedings. Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent at Sky News, tweets: The Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has been having a go at sections of what the withdrawal act says on workers\u2019 rights, and tweets this warning at Labour MPs thinking of voting for it: The Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, Dan Boffey, has been listening to EU officials speaking at a European parliament gathering in Strasbourg, where Donald Tusk has referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit extension request. On the schedule in Brussels, the European council president, Donald Tusk, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, are to speak today in a debate in the European parliament in Strasbourg on the outcome of the last summit of European leaders. The EU\u2019s negotiator, Michel Barnier, will also be in attendance but, perhaps most significantly, we\u2019re likely to hear the first public comments from Tusk on Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request. Away from Westminster, among those poring over the details of the Brexit deal were loyalists in east Belfast who gathered to discuss what meeting organisers described as the \u201cbetrayal act\u201d. The Belfast Telegraph reports that one of the speakers was the loyalist activist Jamie Bryson, who said it was opportunity for unionists and loyalists to voice their anger. \u201cThey can take that message back to Boris Johnson. For three years Leo Varadkar and the Irish government went to the European parliament and everywhere else and said we can\u2019t have a border on the island of Ireland because it\u2019s a threat to peace, but it\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll just shaft the loyalists and put a border in the Irish Sea. \u201cI think they are entering very dangerous territory.\u201d The Northern Irish political commentator Sophie Long tweets her concerns: The withdrawal agreement bill was published last night at 8pm, giving MPs preparing to vote only 12 hours to digest details of one of the biggest constitutional changes to the UK\u2019s status in decades. But hey \u2026 it\u2019s just 115 pages long, with an extra 126 pages of explanatory notes. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent, Peter Walker, has been reading the bill, or WAB, and has penned this useful summary of what it says: Main purpose As the explanatory notes say, the bill is intended to \u201cimplement, and make other provision in connection with, the agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU\u201d over Brexit \u2013 it gives Johnson\u2019s deal legal status. Transition period As planned, this would last until the end of 2020. This can be extended by ministers for up to two more years. However, while such an extension would require the approval of parliament, the bill gives no provision for MPs to seek an extension. Rapid ratification Normally international treaties \u2013 and this is such a treaty, under law \u2013 must be before parliament for at least 21 sitting days in order to be ratified. This minimum time period is laid down in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (Crag) of 2010. But this provision is lifted for the purpose of the WAB, to allow the 31 October deadline to be met. Future relationship MPs will be given some oversight of the aims for this and must first approve a \u201cstatement on objectives for the future relationship with the EU\u201d. There\u2019s a lot more \u2013 on workers\u2019 rights, Northern Ireland and citizens rights \u2013 which you can read here. Another early morning intervention has come from Rory Stewart \u2013 the former Tory MP and one-time leadership candidate \u2013 who said he and others thrown out recently by Boris Johnson had been negotiating \u201cthrough the night\u201d to give parliament more control over the next phase of the Brexit negotiations. He said that \u201ccentral role\u201d in the trade negotiations would be more important than guaranteeing that the UK remains in a customs union with the EU, which Labour is looking to secure. Stewart, who is standing to be mayor of London, added that he a and other rebels had been negotiating for such a role with Downing Street \u201cyesterday and through the night to try\u201d. \u201cI think there is a bigger prize which is making sure that any parliament that is sitting has proper control over the mandate for the future trading negotiations,\u201d he added on Today. Voters should have another say in the form of a public vote on whether Britain should leave the European Union, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary has said. In an early morning salvo giving a taste of the choppy waters that await the government\u2019s attempts to get the legislation through today, Angela Rayner, said also that parliament must be given an opportunity to properly scrutinise the government\u2019s Brexit bill. \u201cParliament has to be at the centre of everything that happens because that\u2019s what we were doing, weren\u2019t we? Taking back control,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cAnd therefore the control is not for Boris Johnson to have his own little games, it\u2019s about parliament being able to scrutinise and have a say on what happens.\u201d The shadow cabinet minister said the public should have another say on leaving the European Union now a new deal had been struck. \u201cI also think the British people are being locked out of this. Democracy doesn\u2019t stop and end at one particular point \u2013 it continues,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are much more aware of the concerns and what could potentially happen to them and their lives. This is jobs, this is people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d Good morning and welcome to Politics Live for day two of a potentially game changing week at Westminster for Brexit. I\u2019m Ben Quinn and will be taking you through all this morning\u2019s developments before handing over to my colleague Frances Perraudin this afternoon. Boris Johnson will make a final bid on Tuesday to force Brexit through by the 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline, amid growing signs he will make a renewed push for a general election whether his deal passes or not. It comes after plan to hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal on Monday was blocked by the Speaker, John Bercow, who said it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d to go over the same ground as Saturday\u2019s vote. Johnson has already requested a delay to Brexit, by sending the letter to Brussels required by the backbench Benn act after MPs declined to support his deal on Saturday \u2013 something he said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than do. But if the government can force its Brexit bill through parliament in time, the UK could in theory still leave the EU by next Thursday\u2019s deadline. The prime minister will ask MPs to back him in two crucial votes today: \u2022 On the withdrawal agreement bill, enshrining the deal he struck in Brussels last week \u2022 And on his plan to ram it through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. Today\u2019s parliamentary schedule allows for questions on business, energy and industrial strategy questions at 11.30, followed by space for urgent questions. That means MPs are expected to start debating the Brexit deal bill \u2013 the \u2018European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill\u2019 - at 12.30pm. A second reading vote on the legislation \u2013 in which MPs would indicate their support or otherwise in principle \u2013 would then be expected at 7pm. Following that, the next hurdle Johnson would be a vote on a sped-up timetable for debating and passing the bill. Having cleared that, the legislation risks being knocked off course, or even out, as votes take place on amendments that could include attempts to link it to a new referendum.

But the defeat on the programme motion by 14 votes \u2013 a heavier defeat than many expected \u2013 is a definite reverse, and could end up scuppering the entire process.</p> <h2>What is a programme motion anyway, and why does it matter?</h2> <p>A non-amendable motion presented by ministers after a bill\u2019s second reading, these set out the timetable for the rest of its progress through the Commons. They were brought in after endless debates over the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. This particular programme motion was important to the government because it argued the compressed timetable \u2013 allowing only three Commons days for the entire process \u2013 was vital if the UK was to leave the EU by the current deadline of 31 October. Many MPs argued this was far too short a time.</p> <h2>Which MPs were crucial in the two votes?</h2> <p>Primarily, it was Brexit-minded Labour MPs, ex-Tory rebels, and the DUP. Nineteen Labour MPs, mainly from leave-supporting areas, supported the second reading, but only five backed the programme motion. Of the former Tories ejected last month, nine voted against the motion, including ex-chancellor Philip Hammond, who seems to have definitively separated himself from the party. Finally, the 10 DUP MPs opposed the government on both votes, with Johnson paying the price of his revised Brexit plans for Northern Ireland.</p> <h2>So what happens now?</h2> <p>Under a backbench-instigated law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until 31 January, despite the PM not wanting this to happen. Responding in the Commons, Johnson said he would \u201cpause this legislation\u201d and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up. For now, the bill is \u201cin limbo\u201d, Speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term.</p> <h2>Is the bill getting pulled?</h2> <p>Downing Street had strongly hinted this would be the response to losing the programme motion. However, this seems to have been a lever to pressure MPs into backing the motion. Speaking during the debate ahead of the votes, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.\u201d</p> <h2>Does all this make a general election more likely?</h2> <p>Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could push for an election.

However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure.</p> <h2>Did the government offer any last-minute concessions?</h2> <p>Yes. Closing the debate for the government, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, promised a last-minute shift aimed at Tory waverers, to give parliament more of a say on avoiding a possible no-deal situation when the transition period ends in December 2020.

      "body": "<p>The House of Commons last night successfully put the brakes on the prime minister\u2019s attempt to deliver Brexit at breakneck speed. Parliament must now attempt to steer Britain away from the rocks of a Brexit deal which was hastily conceived and which, if enacted, would leave the country to repent at leisure. Boris Johnson will claim, with justification, that the backing by MPs of a second reading for his withdrawal bill, by a majority of 30, was a significant victory. After all, Theresa May never managed as much. But the defeat of the government\u2019s programme motion by 322 votes to 308 means that the prime minister will not be able to force MPs to vote on it by Thursday evening.</p> <p>Having failed to rush his legislation through parliament, Mr Johnson has announced his intention to pause it, while the EU considers the request that he was forced to send for an extension beyond the 31 October deadline for Brexit. The prime minister will urge Brussels to make that extension short. Whatever its length, MPs who oppose his version of Brexit, which pushes the country towards a deregulated, disunited and poorer future, must now use the time to devise a coherent cross-party plan to achieve a better outcome. The Labour MPs who voted for a second reading of Mr Johnson\u2019s bill will receive fierce criticism. But most did so not because they back Mr Johnson\u2019s deal, but with the intention of amending and softening it, perhaps through a customs union.

      "bodyText": "The House of Commons last night successfully put the brakes on the prime minister\u2019s attempt to deliver Brexit at breakneck speed. Parliament must now attempt to steer Britain away from the rocks of a Brexit deal which was hastily conceived and which, if enacted, would leave the country to repent at leisure. Boris Johnson will claim, with justification, that the backing by MPs of a second reading for his withdrawal bill, by a majority of 30, was a significant victory. After all, Theresa May never managed as much. But the defeat of the government\u2019s programme motion by 322 votes to 308 means that the prime minister will not be able to force MPs to vote on it by Thursday evening. Having failed to rush his legislation through parliament, Mr Johnson has announced his intention to pause it, while the EU considers the request that he was forced to send for an extension beyond the 31 October deadline for Brexit. The prime minister will urge Brussels to make that extension short. Whatever its length, MPs who oppose his version of Brexit, which pushes the country towards a deregulated, disunited and poorer future, must now use the time to devise a coherent cross-party plan to achieve a better outcome. The Labour MPs who voted for a second reading of Mr Johnson\u2019s bill will receive fierce criticism. But most did so not because they back Mr Johnson\u2019s deal, but with the intention of amending and softening it, perhaps through a customs union. All options and potential compromises must now be explored by the opposition parties, because Mr Johnson\u2019s version of Brexit cannot be allowed to stand. The government\u2019s desire to bludgeon the withdrawal bill through the House of Commons in three days flat represented a brazen attempt to exploit a mood of national exhaustion with Brexit. To table a programme motion requiring parliament to give its verdict on Mr Johnson\u2019s deal within 72 hours was an absurdity.

MPs first saw the legal text of Mr Johnson\u2019s new deal \u2013 which proposes a far harder Brexit than Mrs May\u2019s version \u2013 on Monday evening. It is 110 pages long and separate explanatory notes run to 125 pages. Scandalously, its publication was accompanied not by an economic impact assessment, but by the blithe assurance of Sajid Javid that the deal is \u201cself-evidently\u201d in Britain\u2019s interest. It soon turned out that a guarantee of workers\u2019 rights had been removed from the withdrawal bill and placed in the non-binding political declaration. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, inadvertently misled the House of Lords by saying that no exit forms would be required to send goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. In fact, such forms will be required, much to the fury of the Democratic Unionist party. It also emerged that Mr Johnson\u2019s deal could lead to a no-deal exit on WTO terms in December 2020.

      "bodyText": "Reports that Boris Johnson may get his deal despite the DUP\u2019s refusal (18 October) miss out on the dimension of the loyalist paramilitary response to the deal. There may also be a darker side to this intransigence. Last week Arlene Foster and her senior advisers were reported to have consulted with loyalist paramilitaries, including the UDA and UVF. The UVF has not laid down its arms and is classified in UK law as a terrorist organisation. It is very concerning that the DUP still feels the need to consult loyalist paramilitaries outside of the peace process before making crucial political decisions on support or otherwise for a Brexit decision, affecting the whole of the UK and 27 European countries. Dr Joseph Mullen Eastbourne, East Sussex \u2022 Your excellent article (Invisible border: How the deal would work, from form-filling to tariffs, 17 October) illuminates the sheer dottiness of the trading arrangements envisaged for Ireland under Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d. As an importer and exporter cross-border within the EU, including Ireland, I can only marvel at the opportunities this version of Brexit will provide for paramilitary smugglers and manufacturers of red tape alike. If the satirist Jonathan Swift \u2013 thank heaven for 18th-century Irish wit and wisdom \u2013 was witness to the proposed dispensation, he would surely be writing about it. At what point did the outward-looking \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d we were promised become a cockamamie protectionist racket? J Gabriel Irwin London \u2022 Your article on the complex form-filling processes required for customs declarations after Brexit caused me a wry smile.

      "bodyText": "Labour is ready to vote for a general election as soon as EU27 leaders have signed off on a Brexit extension, despite the desire of some senior party figures to secure a referendum first, the Guardian understands. Labour has twice abstained when the prime minister asked for an election under the terms of the fixed-term parliaments act, which requires a two-thirds majority. But Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly said that once an extension was in place he would support a poll and a Labour spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday night that remained the party\u2019s position. \u201cExtension, then election,\u201d he said. Boris Johnson has threatened to make a fresh bid to secure a general election if the EU27 leaders hand the UK a three-month Brexit delay, as requested in the letter he reluctantly sent on Saturday. After the government was defeated on Tuesday in its last-ditch bid to secure Brexit by 31 October, Johnson said he would consult EU leaders about what they planned to do next and report back to parliament. He could seek a general election immediately or wait to see whether his Brexit bill is amended in some way he is unable to accept, such as by forcing him to seek a customs union. Following the vote, the Conservatives released social media messages saying Jeremy Corbyn had \u201chumiliated the country again.\u201d Nineteen Labour MPs, including Gareth Snell, Gloria De Piero and Ruth Smeeth, rebelled against the whip to help the prime minister to a healthy majority of 30 in the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill. During the debate, De Piero told Corbyn: \u201cI want to improve the deal so that it reflects the manifesto that I stood on and respects the referendum result, and so that we leave with a deal that protects jobs and trade.\u201d He replied: \u201cI fully understand both her concerns and their concerns. I commend her for her work in representing that area and the obvious friendship that exists between her and all the people she represents; she is a great MP\u201d. Seven of the group subsequently published a statement saying that, while they had reservations about the deal, they believed it was right to allow it to continue to be debated, to \u201cgive us a proper chance to get a Labour Brexit\u201d. Only five Labour MPs then supported the government\u2019s programme motion, which would have resulted in the deal being rushed through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. Labour frontbenchers discussed the timing of a potential election at a testy shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with Corbyn loyalists Laura Pidcock and Dan Carden calling for the party to back an early poll. Carden told colleagues the \u201creferendum first\u201d approach espoused by some of his colleagues was a fantasy, which wouldn\u2019t win a majority in parliament and which the government would anyway refuse to implement. The deputy leader, Tom Watson, has argued publicly that it would be better for Labour to settle the issue of Brexit in a referendum and then contest a general election on a wider set of issues. At the shadow cabinet meeting, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, clashed with colleagues over Labour\u2019s stance on a second referendum. According to those present, Corbyn opened the meeting by reminding shadow cabinet members not to stray from Labour\u2019s agreed policies in media appearances. Starmer then suggested existing Labour policy meant the party must support any amendment to the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill calling for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, and then campaign for remain. But in a debate that became fractious at times, according to two people present, Starmer faced a backlash from colleagues including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. One witness said Lavery accused Starmer of \u201cramming this policy down my throat for 18 months\u201d. In the shadow cabinet discussions about whether Labour would campaign for remain against Johnson\u2019s deal, Lavery and Trickett pointed to the motion passed at last month\u2019s Labour conference in Brighton, which said: \u201cThe party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.\u201d Party members backed the motion after Corbyn made clear he wanted the decision about its referendum stance to be taken after a Labour government came to power. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also expressed concerns about supporting a compromise similar to the Kyle-Wilson amendment. The Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson previously suggested they could support Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement if it was subjected to a confirmatory referendum. But Corbyn said he would \u201ccaution\u201d MPs against being willing to accept that quid pro quo. Abbott said last month: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it\u2019s got a referendum attached. That\u2019s why I was against Kyle-Wilson. \u201cEither it\u2019s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market \u2013 or it\u2019s not. The referendum is not an end in itself. Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don\u2019t support it.\u201d Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said publicly they would like to campaign for remain. But Trickett said earlier this month that he did not support the idea of a referendum that would pitch Johnson\u2019s deal against remain. \u201cA referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave \u2013 and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government.\u201d",

A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Labour and the TUC have warned this will leave UK workers exposed to Tory governments seeking a bonfire of regulations.</p> \n<p>Jenrick denied this. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear we have absolutely no intention of rowing back on the very high standards of workers\u2019 rights that we enjoy in this country. This government certainly doesn\u2019t: we\u2019ve just said that we intend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/30/conservatives-pledge-raise-national-living-wage-by-2024\">increase the national living wage</a> to \u00a310.50 an hour \u2013 no government would say that unless they cared about the rights of working people.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve said that if there\u2019s any suggestion that the government is going to be rowing back from workers\u2019 rights, then the ministers need to come to parliament and make a statement, and of course parliament can have its say on that if it so wishes.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe\u2019re saying that parliament can decide. And that\u2019s the point of taking back control: it\u2019s trusting parliament to make decisions on workers\u2019 rights and the environment.\u201d</p>",

The House of Commons will hold two key votes late on Tuesday: one on the second reading of the bill \u2013 effectively on the principle of whether it should proceed \u2013 and another on the government\u2019s fast-track timetable for pushing it through parliament. If MPs reject this plan, it will be all but impossible for the prime minister to meet his promise of leaving the EU by 31 October, though he will blame the failure on parliament. The 110-page bill was published on Monday evening \u2013 and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has said he does not intend to carry out an economic impact of it, because it is \u201cself-evidently\u201d in the UK\u2019s interests to end uncertainty about Brexit. Asked whether he believed MPs had enough time to scrutinise the legislation, Jenrick said: \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cThe House of Commons has had 500 hours of debates on Brexit. Many of the issues in this bill are very familiar to MPs, they\u2019ve been known for a long time \u2013 such as the provisions on EU citizens living within the UK. \u201cAnd you have to remember that the purpose of this bill is purely to put into UK law the terms of our exit from the EU: it isn\u2019t to determine our future relationship with the EU. That, we\u2019ve committed, will be subject to future debates and votes in parliament, later on, once we\u2019ve left,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.

The bill reveals that \u2013 as promised by Theresa May and confirmed by Johnson \u2013 MPs will be given a vote on the negotiating mandate for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, which would be due to take place within 30 days of Britain leaving the bloc. Jenrick said: \u201cThis is a piece of legislation which simply puts into UK law what the PM has managed to negotiate, confounding his critics, with the EU.\u201d He added: \u201cIf MPs disagree with the future relationship then that is a debate for another day \u2013 unless they actually just want to frustrate Brexit. And that is the litmus test for the debate that will come today. Those MPs who want to deliver Brexit will vote with the government today.\u201d However, the legislation also says the negotiating mandate for the future deal must be consistent with the political declaration that forms part of Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 and which specifies a \u201cfree trade agreement\u201d outside the customs union. It is this looser relationship with the EU \u2013 outside the customs union and single market \u2013 that makes Johnson\u2019s deal more appealing to the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG). Many of them, including Steve Baker and Mark Francois, have abandoned their erstwhile allies in the Democratic Unionist party to back the prime minister. As well as defending the government\u2019s timetable, Jenrick dismissed fears that workers\u2019 rights could be reduced, once they are no longer underpinned by EU law. May\u2019s withdrawal agreement included a legally binding commitment to track EU standards in areas including workers\u2019 rights, as she sought a relationship that would come as close as possible to \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade, while ending free movement. Johnson\u2019s deal transfers those \u201clevel playing field\u201d commitments to the non-legally binding political declaration, to form part of the negotiations on the future trade deal. Labour and the TUC have warned this will leave UK workers exposed to Tory governments seeking a bonfire of regulations. Jenrick denied this. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear we have absolutely no intention of rowing back on the very high standards of workers\u2019 rights that we enjoy in this country. This government certainly doesn\u2019t: we\u2019ve just said that we intend to increase the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour \u2013 no government would say that unless they cared about the rights of working people. \u201cSo we\u2019ve said that if there\u2019s any suggestion that the government is going to be rowing back from workers\u2019 rights, then the ministers need to come to parliament and make a statement, and of course parliament can have its say on that if it so wishes.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re saying that parliament can decide. And that\u2019s the point of taking back control: it\u2019s trusting parliament to make decisions on workers\u2019 rights and the environment.\u201d",

Johnson has already requested a delay to Brexit, by sending the letter to Brussels required by the backbench Benn act after MPs declined to support his deal on Saturday \u2013 something he said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than do. But if the government can force its Brexit bill through parliament in time, the UK could in theory still leave the EU by next Thursday\u2019s deadline. The prime minister will ask MPs to back him in two crucial votes on Tuesday \u2013 on the withdrawal agreement bill, enshrining the deal he struck in Brussels last week, and on his plan to ram it through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. Johnson will tell MPs: \u201cWe have negotiated a new deal so that we can leave without disruption and provide a framework for a new relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation. We are leaving the European Union but we will always be European\u201d. Johnson\u2019s plan to hold a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his deal on Monday was blocked by the Speaker, John Bercow, who said it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d to go over the same ground as Saturday\u2019s vote. With the backing of some Labour rebels and the Tories who backed Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment at the weekend, Johnson is expected to win the vote on his bill known as the second reading, signalling MPs\u2019 approval for it to proceed in principle. But Downing Street is braced for potential defeat on the so-called programme motion setting out the timetable, as it suspects some pro-deal Labour MPs and a few Conservatives may not support plans to rush it through the Commons within days. Veteran Conservative Ken Clarke said: \u201c\u201cUnless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available.\u201d The independent unionist MP Sylvia Hermon, who voted for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times, said: \u201cI would very much like the prime minister to come to Northern Ireland to explain in detail to the people why they only deserve three days\u2019 consideration of the major changes to them and how this bill will affect their futures.\u201d The DUP\u2019s chief whip, Jeffrey Donaldson, said: \u201cI have to say to the leader of the house quite frankly that what he\u2019s proposing in terms of proper scrutiny of this bill does not do justice to what the constituents that I represent need.\u201d If the programme motion falls, the government has little chance of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d, as Johnson calls it, by 31 October. If the bill continues its passage, groups of MPs are likely to try to amend the legislation \u2013 with Labour hoping to push for a customs union and for a second referendum to be attached. Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he could not live with a customs union, as have several key cabinet ministers including Dominic Raab and Priti Patel. If such an amendment passed, he would face the choice of accepting it or making a fresh bid to call a general election. One Conservative adviser said pro-Brexit cabinet ministers and Tory backbenchers would never be able to live with a customs union attached to the bill, so it was \u201cnot going to happen\u201d. The aide said this scenario would probably lead to renewed push for an election, with Conservative party headquarters still preparing for a pre-Christmas poll \u2013 regardless of whether the Brexit bill passes or not. He also suggested that, with an election on the way, Johnson could part ways with Dominic Cummings, his controversial chief adviser, who had only ever planned to stay until Brexit was done and is due to have a major operation. \u201cBoris created the monster, so Boris could slay it,\u201d the aide said, arguing that it could be an olive branch to former Tories who lost the whip and part of his pivot to a more centrist position on domestic issues. Johnson has struck a notably more emollient tone in recent days, stressing his \u201clove\u201d of Europe and dialling down his criticism of the \u201csurrender act\u201d. Another senior Conservative suggested Johnson\u2019s team believed they were in a strong position, even if he broke his promise of achieving Brexit by 31 October. \u201cIn any of the scenarios now, we\u2019re probably quite well-placed,\u201d he said. He added that the passing of the Letwin amendment on Saturday, withholding support from Johnson\u2019s deal until the legislation is through parliament, would help Johnson to blame troublemaking MPs for the delay. \u201cLetwin\u2019s given us quite a lot of cover on this,\u201d he said. The 110-page withdrawal agreement bill was published on Monday evening. It confirms that MPs will have the opportunity to vote on what the government\u2019s mandate should be for the next phase of negotiations. And, as the government announced on Friday, ministers will have to seek the support of parliament when they depart from EU standards on workers\u2019 rights. The legislation may alarm some Eurosceptics by confirming - as Theresa May conceded back in 2017 - that EU law will continue to hold sway during the transition period. The transition is due to end in December 2020, but could be extended by two years with parliament\u2019s approval. Some Conservative MPs, including the former chancellor Philip Hammond, are seeking reassurances that the government will request such an extension if no trade deal has been agreed in time. MPs\u2019 concerns about the risks of rushing through the bill were underlined on Monday when the chancellor, Sajid Javid, conceded to MPs on the Treasury select committee that he had no plans to carry out a detailed economic assessment of the deal, which he claimed was \u201cself-evidently in our economic interest\u201d. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused Javid of \u201cflying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy\u201d. The government\u2019s claims that the Brexit bill could be properly scrutinised within three days was further undermined when Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, blundered over the implications of the bill for Northern Ireland, suggesting even he was not on top of the detail. In a Lords EU committee, he initially claimed that Northern Ireland businesses would not have to fill out customs declarations to send goods to the rest of the UK. But after correction from the Treasury, he said: \u201cThe exit summary declarations will be required.\u201d The admission provoked fury from the DUP, with one of the party\u2019s 10 MPs, Gavin Robinson, demanding: \u201cIs it the case that Northern Ireland goods will require customs declarations to enter what is supposed to be unfettered access to the rest of their own country?\u201d Conservative whips are seeking to warn MPs in their party that voting against the programme motion risks scuppering the bill.
