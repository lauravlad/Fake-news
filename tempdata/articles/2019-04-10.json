      "bodyText": "Conservative MPs have said they are now unhappily resigned to a long extension to the date for leaving the EU, with several expressing distress at the party\u2019s paralysis and the lack of appetite for cabinet resignations. While Eurosceptic Conservative MPs are furious about the delay to Brexit, many Tories now believe the tipping point for May\u2019s leadership is more likely to come if she were to sign up to a customs union with Labour, with many now speculating that she might not be able to get such a deal through parliament even with opposition votes. As Theresa May met EU leaders in Brussels, plans by backbench MPs to present the prime minister with a departure timetable appeared to hit a roadblock and Tories meeting in parliament deflected the blame for extension on Brexiters who had refused to vote for May\u2019s deal. At a brief meeting of Tory MPs on Wednesday night, the veteran Brexiter John Redwood demanded to know why more Tory MPs had not voted against extension on Tuesday night \u2013 saying they had missed the chance to send a message to the government. In turn, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, turned his fire on Redwood, blaming him for not voting for May\u2019s deal, and then walking out of the room in disgust, according to sources in the room. \u201cThere is resignation that the prime minister will not be forced out, that could only happen if half the cabinet resign,\u201d one moderate MP said. \u201cThat scenario hinges on what happens with Labour.\u201d A Eurosceptic cabinet source said that the extension was not in itself a resigning matter for cabinet ministers. \u201cNobody wants this but it\u2019s the reality. She will never go for a no deal. So Brexiters stay and live with a long extension, but they could not live with a locked-down, inflexible customs union, where you cannot get out of it.\u201d Simon Hart, a Conservative MP who leads the loyalist Brexit Delivery Group, insisted there was still appetite among many in the party for May to come up with a negotiated deal but many could not stomach a permanent customs union. \u201cWe remain loyal to our ambition to see a negotiated outcome above all else.

Her decision to go at the next stage of the negotiations seems a very long way away now.\u201d Under party rules, no mechanism exists to force May\u2019s departure until December at the earliest as she was given a year\u2019s grace by winning the no-confidence vote against her before Christmas. Iain Duncan Smith, who led the party between 2001 and 2003, urged May not to wait until she was ousted by a second vote of confidence in December and said she should make it clear she would leave office before the autumn party conference. \u201cMy recommendation to the prime minister is: don\u2019t go to second vote of confidence because it is almost certain that will be lost and it would be a humiliation for her,\u201d he said. One of May\u2019s most vocal critics, Steve Baker, said that MPs were not yet prepared to take the kamikaze step of voting with Labour in a no-confidence motion against the government, in the hope of forcing May\u2019s resignation. He said he believed the prime minister would resist any pressure to step down \u2013 a stance he said that was \u201cverging towards tyranny\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just really not convinced the prime minister would go if she lost a confidence motion,\u201d Baker told Bloomberg. \u201cShe would probably stay and dare us to vote against a second time, causing a general election.\u201d Tory MPs leaving the meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Wednesday night appeared resigned that there was little they could do to force a change. No cabinet minister responded to the invitation to address the meeting \u2013 despite the prime minister traditionally attending the last meeting before recess. Sir Graham Brady, the chair, ruled that party rules could not be changed to allow an indicative ballot on her leadership at this point \u2013 after almost an hour of debate among members of the committee. Brexiter MPs on the 1922 Committee\u2019s executive, including Nigel Evans and Sir Bernard Jenkin, are understood to have been taking the toughest line on May\u2019s future. Instead, MPs have been encouraged to begin again the processing of submitting letters of no confidence to quantify the extent of discontent within the party. Conservative MPs including Andrea Jenkyns, Mark Francois and Lee Rowley have publicly stated that they have sent fresh letters of no confidence to Brady.

As a former senior social work manager in children\u2019s services and recruiter of permanent, agency and foreign staff, I believe there are many underlying reasons for staffing shortages. Pay is one factor for sure, but a sense that what you are doing is valued at societal and government level is crucial. Time and again when public-sector pay is talked about, police, nurses and teachers are mentioned, but never social workers. Local authority social workers are tarred with the same perceptions as local authorities in general \u2013 that they are inefficient and ineffective, only there to blight people\u2019s lives, not support them.</p> <p>Social workers generally want to stick with the profession, demanding though it is, but agency work gives them reward and flexibility that local authority contracts do not.</p> <p>In terms of wider funding issues, early intervention support to families has reduced massively in the last decade. People referring concerns to children\u2019s services face a number of bureaucratic hoops, partly as a way of rationing sparse resources and coping with the huge upswing in demand. By the time a social worker gets involved, their scope to do any remedial work is much diminished. Years of that can wear you down. Therein lies the premium: agencies know local authorities need social workers and rates reflect that market. Nadhim Zahawi may be happy to mention higher numbers of social workers, but I doubt we are talking about large volumes of experienced staff, used to dealing with complexity, able to assess situations in a context and act in a complex legal framework, yet perform day in day out \u2013 let alone year in year out.<br><strong>Alec Baseley</strong><br><em>Bishops Castle, Shropshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 You list a number of local authorities whose agency-supplied social workers for children and families run in excess of 34%. It is important to convert these percentages into the number of staff, which means for Croydon, for example, where the figure you give is 47% and there are about 350 social work staff, about 160 would be agency staff. Now if we look at the usual workload ratios of 12-15 open cases at any one time for each social worker, and possibly 8-10 new referrals a month, just think what this means as regards the children and families being supported and the potential for low continuity of that support. We are not told the agency staff turnover rates but if it is anything like what I witnessed in boroughs in west London a family might have 4-6 case workers in any 12-month period. It is not surprising therefore that many children being supported are not making progress and as a society we are storing up major social problems. It is time to act now with or without Brexit excuses.<br><strong>Michael Cross</strong><br><em>Richmond, London </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

Therein lies the premium: agencies know local authorities need social workers and rates reflect that market. Nadhim Zahawi may be happy to mention higher numbers of social workers, but I doubt we are talking about large volumes of experienced staff, used to dealing with complexity, able to assess situations in a context and act in a complex legal framework, yet perform day in day out \u2013 let alone year in year out. Alec Baseley Bishops Castle, Shropshire \u2022 You list a number of local authorities whose agency-supplied social workers for children and families run in excess of 34%. It is important to convert these percentages into the number of staff, which means for Croydon, for example, where the figure you give is 47% and there are about 350 social work staff, about 160 would be agency staff. Now if we look at the usual workload ratios of 12-15 open cases at any one time for each social worker, and possibly 8-10 new referrals a month, just think what this means as regards the children and families being supported and the potential for low continuity of that support. We are not told the agency staff turnover rates but if it is anything like what I witnessed in boroughs in west London a family might have 4-6 case workers in any 12-month period. It is not surprising therefore that many children being supported are not making progress and as a society we are storing up major social problems. It is time to act now with or without Brexit excuses.
