      "bodyText": "Hundreds of residents have been told they cannot return to their high-rise Melbourne home after a fire sparked concerns about the building\u2019s cladding, which is the same material that covered London\u2019s Grenfell Tower. Eighty firefighters were deployed to the building in Melbourne\u2019s Spencer Street on Monday morning to battle a blaze that has prompted fresh concerns about combustible cladding on apartment buildings. The fire began shortly before 6am at the Neo 200 complex and shot up several floors of the apartment complex, prompting the Metropolitan Fire Brigade to upgrade the emergency. The fire brigade said the fire had started on the 22nd floor and quickly moved up the outside of the tower to the 27th floor. Ambulance Victoria said paramedics had treated one man in his 20s for smoke inhalation. He was taken to Royal Melbourne hospital in a stable condition. Victoria police assisted with the evacuation and relocation of residents. Dan Stephens, the chief officer for the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, said crews believed the building was clad in the same material as the Grenfell Tower in London, which caught fire in 2017 and killed 72 people. \u201cMy understanding is that the building is cladded with aluminium composite materials, so the cladding that was on the Grenfell Tower,\u201d he said. Victoria\u2019s planning minister, Richard Wynne, later said the building was only partially clad in the flammable material. Trent Curtin, the assistant chief officer of the brigade, said sprinklers had activated on four of the floors and contained the fire to the balcony and apartment. Firefighters had undertaken an \u201cinternal fire attack\u201d, fighting the fire directly inside the building. \u201cThe fire escalated quite rapidly from the 22nd floor,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cWe can assume, but can\u2019t confirm, that the cladding escalated the speed of the fire.\u201d On Monday afternoon the City of Melbourne issued an emergency order after the municipal building surveyor identified \u201cessential safety measures\u201d had been compromised by the fire. \u201cThe emergency order requires that the building not be occupied for 48 hours or until these systems can be recommissioned and confirmed as operational,\u201d a council spokesperson said. Smoke controls, sprinklers and emergency warning systems are among the functions that could have been compromised. The apartment building was one of more than 2,000 that have been inspected since the Grenfell Tower fire by the Victorian Building Authority, chief executive Sue Eddy confirmed. She said the building had been declared a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d and two notices were issued, requiring smoke alarms be installed in bedrooms adjacent to walls covered with the cladding. Former premier Ted Baillieu, who co-chairs the Victorian Cladding Taskforce, said building notices were issued last July and October, identifying the problem. \u201cThe important task is to find these buildings with cladding, to fix them and to fund them and then to prevent it happening in the future,\u201d Baillieu said. Some 360 private buildings had been deemed high-risk, he said. Cities across the world began assessing buildings following London\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 when an inferno engulfed the 24-storey block of flats, killing 72 people. Fire safety inspectors, investigation specialists and the Melbourne city council municipal building surveyor immediately began working to determine the cause of the blaze. Curtin said crews had already identified potential fire safety issues with the building, including that some residents had covered their smoke alarms with plastic. \u201cOne of those issues is that occupants have been covering smoke alarms with plastic to stop them going off from cooking or false alarms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially others [fire safety issues] but we\u2019re unclear at this stage.\u201d Curtin said crews had also encountered residents who refused to evacuate from the building. The complex has 371 apartments and, at 10am, Curtin said crews were still struggling to get some people to leave. \u201cFirefighters went floor to floor in the early stages of the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with a notification to evacuate, some people refused to evacuate.\u201d Spencer Street was initially closed in both directions and a spokesman for the fire brigade said crews had been able to bring the fire under control by 7am. By 10am the street had reopened in a northbound direction. The fire brigade expects crews to be on site for most of the day. The City of Melbourne set up at relief centre in Swanston Hall on the ground floor of Melbourne Town Hall and said around 200 people had attended. \u201cThe relief centre will be open to provide food, counselling and relief services while the status of the apartment building is being assessed,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Age reported that pieces of the building could be seen falling from the complex on the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets during the fire.",

Previously, children with the genetic disorder did not often survive to adulthood and even today, half will be dead before the age of 32.

And ministers stand in the way | Christina Walker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Countries all over the world are struggling with the high prices of new medicines, which has led to anger and campaigning, particularly over cancer drugs. The NHS has forced down prices by requiring drugs to go through a cost-effectiveness appraisal and capping the price it will pay.</p> \n<p>Vertex, based in Boston in the US, has priced the drug at \u00a3105,000 per patient per year, which NHS England says is unaffordable. Vertex turned down its offer in July of \u00a3500m over five years for access to Orkambi and its other cystic fibrosis drugs, saying it was inadequate and unfair. It has also withdrawn the newer and more effective drug Symkevi from the approval process, which means it will not be available to any NHS patients.</p> \n<p>Campaigners have said the company had earned $2.5bn from sales of the drug in 2017, which was discovered thanks to funding from a cystic fibrosis charity and taxpayers\u2019 money from the National Institutes of Health in the US. Vertex paid $3.3bn for the patents. Its chief executive, Dr Jeff Leiden, was paid at least $17.2m in 2017, according to SEC filings reported by Reuters last year.</p> \n<p>There is an urgency to the campaigning. Christina Walker, whose eight-year-old son Luis has the disorder, said: \u201cWe think the government has got to step in otherwise it could be months and months. It could be another year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9e96dd3f-d37a-4ac8-b3f8-afabb6d18d59\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Are there precedents for the battle over the cost of Orkambi?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The fight for access to Orkambi \u2013 which manufacturers have set at more than \u00a3100,000 per patient per year \u2013 has much in common with the fight for the breast cancer drug Herceptin back in 2006. The underlying issues are the same \u2013 new, innovative drugs are launched at sky-high prices that pharmaceutical companies claim are necessary to recoup their costs, but healthcare providers and patients say they cannot afford.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How can a drug be so expensive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The drugs with the highest price tags are often those for which there are fewer patients, so less profit to be made.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/cystic-fibrosis\">Cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;is a rare disease, affecting 10,400 people in the UK, where the genetic fault is most common, and about 100,000 worldwide.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/science/drugs\">Drugs</a>&nbsp;that cure a disease may be more expensive than those that have to be taken for many years.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does the NHS try to control the cost of drugs?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2017, the NHS drugs bill was \u00a316bn and rising at 7% a year. The NHS has actively tried to keep costs down by bringing in an appraisal mechanism, run by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), to ensure only drugs that are value for money are used. This has effectively capped and reduced drug prices.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has that effort been successful in the past?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The biggest pharmaceutical companies are multinational and all of them look to world markets, making it more difficult to secure price reductions. But the NHS has been relatively successful in negotiating prices down.

My little boy has got an infection he may never eradicate that is multi-resistant to antibiotics. The cumulative effect is what shortens people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaigners want the government to set aside Vertex\u2019s patent on Orkambi to allow cheap versions to be made through a legal provision called crown use. Under the 1977 Patents Act, the state can effectively override a patent in the national interest. It has rarely been used, but was invoked in the 1960s to obtain cheap generic versions of the antibiotic tetracycline for NHS hospitals from Italy, against the wishes of the patent holder Pfizer. It has more recently been threatened but not used in disputes over hepatitis C diagnostic tests and machines for treating kidney stones.</p> \n<p>Vertex would be compensated under the UK law with a much smaller sum than it could otherwise earn from its monopoly of the three cystic fibrosis drugs. Another combination is also in the pipeline that Vertex hopes could treat 90% of patients.</p> \n<p>Bill Wiggin, the Conservative MP for North Herefordshire, will ask the government to invoke crown use for Orkambi in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on Monday. \u201cVertex refused the largest ever financial offer the NHS has made in its entire history for this medicine,\u201d said Wiggin.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cCrown use licensing can prevent pharmaceutical companies from taking advantage of incredibly vulnerable people.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4393895a7b7d0b09a4965b5a0ff8cfd30cde27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e4393895a7b7d0b09a4965b5a0ff8cfd30cde27/0_154_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Walker with her son Luis, who has cystic fibrosis which clogs up the lungs and and uses a nebuliser to help him breathe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Walker with her son Luis, who has cystic fibrosis, which clogs up the lungs.

The anguish in knowing that a drug exists that can change that \u2013 sparing them unnecessary suffering and decline in health \u2013 but that they are denied access, is unbearable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Andrew Hill of the pharmacology department of the University of Liverpool advised the access to medicines group <a href=\"http://www.justtreatment.org/planb\">Just Treatment</a>, which is launching the campaign with the parents, on the likely cost of a generic version of Orkambi. \u201cIt could be made for a maximum of \u00a35,000 [per patient, per year],\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>He said drug companies were not respecting the value for money judgments of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which advised NHS England that the cost was prohibitive. \u201cIt is happening with so many cancer drugs and now cystic fibrosis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has to have some more teeth.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners are calling on the government to urgently intervene over the cost of a drug that could extend the lives of thousands of children but which manufacturers have set at \u00a3105,000 per patient per year, a price the NHS cannot afford. For more than two years an emotive battle has been raging over Orkambi, which tackles the cause of cystic fibrosis. Previously, children with the genetic disorder did not often survive to adulthood and even today, half will be dead before the age of 32. Orkambi could extend lives, but negotiations over the price the NHS should pay have been in stalemate since July, with the pharma company that makes it refusing to reduce the price. Countries all over the world are struggling with the high prices of new medicines, which has led to anger and campaigning, particularly over cancer drugs. The NHS has forced down prices by requiring drugs to go through a cost-effectiveness appraisal and capping the price it will pay. Vertex, based in Boston in the US, has priced the drug at \u00a3105,000 per patient per year, which NHS England says is unaffordable. Vertex turned down its offer in July of \u00a3500m over five years for access to Orkambi and its other cystic fibrosis drugs, saying it was inadequate and unfair. It has also withdrawn the newer and more effective drug Symkevi from the approval process, which means it will not be available to any NHS patients. Campaigners have said the company had earned $2.5bn from sales of the drug in 2017, which was discovered thanks to funding from a cystic fibrosis charity and taxpayers\u2019 money from the National Institutes of Health in the US. Vertex paid $3.3bn for the patents. Its chief executive, Dr Jeff Leiden, was paid at least $17.2m in 2017, according to SEC filings reported by Reuters last year. There is an urgency to the campaigning. Christina Walker, whose eight-year-old son Luis has the disorder, said: \u201cWe think the government has got to step in otherwise it could be months and months. It could be another year. \u201cCystic fibrosis doesn\u2019t wait for all this. My little boy has got an infection he may never eradicate that is multi-resistant to antibiotics. The cumulative effect is what shortens people\u2019s lives.\u201d The campaigners want the government to set aside Vertex\u2019s patent on Orkambi to allow cheap versions to be made through a legal provision called crown use. Under the 1977 Patents Act, the state can effectively override a patent in the national interest. It has rarely been used, but was invoked in the 1960s to obtain cheap generic versions of the antibiotic tetracycline for NHS hospitals from Italy, against the wishes of the patent holder Pfizer. It has more recently been threatened but not used in disputes over hepatitis C diagnostic tests and machines for treating kidney stones. Vertex would be compensated under the UK law with a much smaller sum than it could otherwise earn from its monopoly of the three cystic fibrosis drugs. Another combination is also in the pipeline that Vertex hopes could treat 90% of patients. Bill Wiggin, the Conservative MP for North Herefordshire, will ask the government to invoke crown use for Orkambi in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on Monday. \u201cVertex refused the largest ever financial offer the NHS has made in its entire history for this medicine,\u201d said Wiggin. He added: \u201cCrown use licensing can prevent pharmaceutical companies from taking advantage of incredibly vulnerable people.\u201d Parents backing the proposal said in a letter to Theresa May and health secretary Matt Hancock that access to the drugs was urgent. They wrote: \u201cWe cannot explain, let alone expect you to understand, the sheer dread and helplessness it causes us to know that we are likely to outlive our children. The anguish in knowing that a drug exists that can change that \u2013 sparing them unnecessary suffering and decline in health \u2013 but that they are denied access, is unbearable.\u201d Dr Andrew Hill of the pharmacology department of the University of Liverpool advised the access to medicines group Just Treatment, which is launching the campaign with the parents, on the likely cost of a generic version of Orkambi. \u201cIt could be made for a maximum of \u00a35,000 [per patient, per year],\u201d he told the Guardian. He said drug companies were not respecting the value for money judgments of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which advised NHS England that the cost was prohibitive. \u201cIt is happening with so many cancer drugs and now cystic fibrosis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has to have some more teeth. It needs to do something different.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cIt is absolutely right that patients should have access to cost-effective, innovative medicines on the NHS at a price we can afford. \u201cDespite being offered in the region of \u00a3500m over five years \u2013 the largest ever commitment of its kind in the 70-year history of the NHS \u2013 Vertex has refused to accept, putting Orkambi out of reach of patients. \u201cWe\u2019re aware there may be other avenues open to resolve this issue, but our approach remains urging Vertex to accept NHS England\u2019s generous offer.\u201d The House of Commons health and social care select committee has launched an inquiry into the availability of Orkambi and will hold a public hearing in March.

      "bodyText": "It was consummate timing, impeccably planned to demonstrate the contemptuousness with which Bahrain has treated international sport throughout the travesty of justice regarding Hakeem al-Araibi. On the day of the 2019 Asian Cup final, under the auspices of Fifa and in the presence of its president, Gianni Infantino, the Bahrain government\u2019s iniquitous extradition order was submitted to a court hearing by Thai authorities. The order prolongs the psychological distress of a football player and refugee in a Thai jail for at least another 60 days, although the prime minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, has discretion throughout to reject this politically motivated, retributive case at any time. We continue to urge him to do so in the interests of Thailand\u2019s international reputation and stated commitment to international law. Infantino joined the Asian Football Confederation president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa \u2013 the Bahraini who had been silent throughout \u2013 to hand out the winners\u2019 medals in Abu Dhabi. It came after Sheikh Salman announced he felt able to recuse himself from the most basic obligation of any football official to protect a player\u2019s human rights. The message was clear: we are above international law, and above Fifa. This, only days after the Fifa secretary-general, Fatma Samoura, had met with me and Brendan Schwab, the executive director of World Players Association, and was briefed on extremely concerning aspects of Al-Araibi\u2019s case. She was moved to issue a joint communique escalating Al-Araibi\u2019s plight to emergency status and calling on both Bahrain and Thailand to withdraw. Bahrain responded by effectively declaring war on international sport, on the day their regional confederation held its showpiece event, in which Al-Araibi should have been participating had he not been incarcerated, tortured and convicted in absentia some years ago. This has now become a battle for the soul of all sport and the question is: how does football and the Olympic movement respond? Fifa has requested a meeting with the prime minister of Thailand, to no avail. Pressure must be maintained on both sides but it is clear the power lies with Bahrain. The challenge for Infantino and Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, is to ensure the principles of sport that we sell to the world, that commercial partners pay billions to be associated with and that players truly believe in, are upheld. These values reside in Al-Araibi, a human rights defender and brave young man, and present the most severe challenge to the world\u2019s two major sporting bodies in recent memory. It is Bahrain who have sought to have Al-Araibi refouled, who have pressured the Thai government to acquiesce, and who have shown the world their law is above that of the international community of nations. And the world needs to understand very clearly both the dynamics of this case, and the challenge it represents to the foundations of global sport. Al-Araibi has become a symbol of hope and that is the most dangerous quality of all for those who seek to maintain rule. Nothing is going to stop this process without the most strenuous response from international sport and governments because ultimately, this is not about extradition, it is about control, authority and retribution. And sport will need to reevaluate its priorities, immediately. Politics and the influence of money have seeped slowly into the arteries of global football, spreading like a virus until, one day, it flexes its authority and changes the foundations of a game. And a world. Sheikh Salman was implicated in the crackdown of athletes in 2011-12, as was head of the Bahrain Olympic Committee, Prince Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and yet, ruinously, they sit in positions of immense prestige and authority in global sport. And now it is time for sport to pay the price. An athlete and football player may be sacrificed against international legal norms to exert authority, against every value that sport stands for. Membership of the international sporting community carries the basic obligation to respect humanitarian values and to treat participants, of all people, with the utmost care and respect. And when this is breached, membership of both nations should be in immediate endangerment. A ruling family has one member in charge of their Olympic committee and another the Asian Football Confederation. And their government is moving apace to refoul a footballer for retributive purposes against the fundamentals of international law, which both Fifa and the IOC have committed to uphold. Sport has not faced such a challenge under the tenure of Infantino and Bach, who will each be defined by the response they make. Either they will override all political and economic considerations and consider the suspension of both nations from the international sporting community, or the new reality of world sport will cost a young man\u2019s freedom and rights, perhaps even his life.

A search boat hired privately by Sala\u2019s Argentinian family \u2013 thanks partly to a crowdfunding appeal \u2013 located the wreckage on Sunday morning. The crew passed the details of the location on to government investigators, who used a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to examine the spot. There was no immediate official confirmation of what was found but the shipwreck specialist leading the private investigation, David Mearns, said the plane had been discovered.

And we\u2019ll be there.\u201d Asked when he would withdraw from Syria, the president said he would first move troops to Iraq and ultimately bring them home. \u201cWe have to protect Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to protect other things that we have. But we\u2019re \u2013 yeah, they\u2019ll be coming back in a matter of time. Look, we\u2019re protecting the world. We\u2019re spending more money than anybody\u2019s ever spent in history, by a lot.\u201d Claiming the US has spent $50bn a year in Afghanistan over five years, Trump said he was prepared to maintain an intelligence presence there. \u201cIf I see nests forming, I\u2019ll do something about it,\u201d he said. The president also dismissed Republicans in Congress who have said they do not agree with his policy. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said, of Afghanistan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting for 19 years. Somebody said you were precipitously bringing to \u2013 precipitously? We\u2019ve been there for 19 years. I want to fight. I want to win, and we want to bring our great troops back home.\u201d US troops led the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, a little over 17 years ago. Asked about reported progress in talks with the Taliban, Trump said he would \u201csee what happens \u2026 they want peace. They\u2019re tired. Everybody\u2019s tired. We\u2019d like to have \u2013 I don\u2019t like endless wars. This war. What we\u2019re doing has got to stop at some point.\u201d Challenged by the host Margaret Brennan that he was repeating the mistake he has accused Obama of making, of broadcasting his moves to America\u2019s enemies, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not telegraphing anything. No, no, no. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d Trump also repeated a claim made to the New York Times this week, that he asked the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, to resign. The retired marine general quit in December with a stinging resignation letter that criticised Trump\u2019s foreign policy. It was reported at the time that it was his own decision.",

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Les Mis\u00e9rables on the BBC. Please do not read on if you are not up to date.</em></p> <p>Wow. So that\u2019s it. What a strange and, ultimately, great episode, but boy oh boy did we take a long time to get to the end. It started with an unusual approach to revolution: \u201cSmug marrieds and breadwinners, you may go home.\u201d But it unfurled beautifully, if interminably. Here was a 75-minute bonanza which exhausted the BBC\u2019s fake blood supply, the prop department\u2019s collection of French street signs and Dominic West\u2019s lifetime allocation of \u201cwoe is me\u201d expressions. It all came good \u2013 or, rather, bad \u2013 in the end.</p> <p>I tend to agree with commenters who suggested the BBC could have learned from War and Peace and given this eight or 10 episodes. But much of this latter part of the plot was taken up with revolutionary firebrands we don\u2019t know or care about. Let\u2019s protect our blood pressure and not get too annoyed about the fact that Jean Valjean just happens to find the barricade where Marius is, and that that was just the start of the coincidences. (\u201cOh who is this, mere yards away from Javert when he jumps into the river \u2026? Why, it\u2019s Thenardiers!\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"311af4cb463320e1089ce1f438979ceef31bcae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/311af4cb463320e1089ce1f438979ceef31bcae5/0_232_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic West uses up his lifetime allocation of \u2018woe is me\u2019 expressions as Jean Valjean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic West uses up his lifetime allocation of \u2018woe is me\u2019 expressions as Jean Valjean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Lookout Point/Robert Viglasky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The highlight of the series? West as Valjean. Although David Oyelowo\u2019s obsessive, brooding Javert comes a close second: \u201cEverything I ever believed to be true \u2026 Everything I lived my life by \u2026 And he \u2026 He \u2026 No matter.\u201d Oyelowo is one of those actors whose performance is so compelling that you feel as if the camera is zooming in on his facial expression even when it isn\u2019t. He draws you to him. \u201cIf he lives, he intends to rob me of all my happiness.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you \u2026 Are you insane?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I think we know you\u2019re both insane by this point. The question is which one of you is more sympathetic as a human being. In the end, Javert just could not live with his own humanity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33423f7c138ca73af36bfca13a7c01d8a6a165e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33423f7c138ca73af36bfca13a7c01d8a6a165e6/0_273_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I had my own inn.

This was incredible and terrifying but narratively (blaming Victor Hugo here) I just kept thinking, \u201cFor the love of magnificent trousers, has this man not suffered enough?\u201d Still, his bestial roar of rage was astonishing. Wherever there\u2019s a stink, Thenardiers is not far away. \u201cYou ruined my life. I had my own inn. Now I live like a rat in the shitty darkness.\u201d Oh dear; we all feel like that some days, mate.</p> <p>All the massive questions raised by Hugo had to be encapsulated in just a few moments. What does it mean to have everything you believe in vanish in a flash? What does it feel like to lose the one person to whom you have given everything? Why is the choice to be a good person such a lonely one? This series has been a difficult task for the actors to pull off. The scenes are short, sometimes only seconds long. The narrative moves at breakneck speed and ridiculous coincidences drive the plot constantly. To maintain the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief is no easy ask. But they all rose to it brilliantly, inspired, I suspect, by West, who appeared to live and breathe that character. Valjean, we salute you and wish you the sweet sleep of angels.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Les Mis\u00e9rables on the BBC. Please do not read on if you are not up to date. Wow. So that\u2019s it. What a strange and, ultimately, great episode, but boy oh boy did we take a long time to get to the end. It started with an unusual approach to revolution: \u201cSmug marrieds and breadwinners, you may go home.\u201d But it unfurled beautifully, if interminably. Here was a 75-minute bonanza which exhausted the BBC\u2019s fake blood supply, the prop department\u2019s collection of French street signs and Dominic West\u2019s lifetime allocation of \u201cwoe is me\u201d expressions. It all came good \u2013 or, rather, bad \u2013 in the end. I tend to agree with commenters who suggested the BBC could have learned from War and Peace and given this eight or 10 episodes. But much of this latter part of the plot was taken up with revolutionary firebrands we don\u2019t know or care about. Let\u2019s protect our blood pressure and not get too annoyed about the fact that Jean Valjean just happens to find the barricade where Marius is, and that that was just the start of the coincidences. (\u201cOh who is this, mere yards away from Javert when he jumps into the river \u2026? Why, it\u2019s Thenardiers!\u201d) The highlight of the series? West as Valjean. Although David Oyelowo\u2019s obsessive, brooding Javert comes a close second: \u201cEverything I ever believed to be true \u2026 Everything I lived my life by \u2026 And he \u2026 He \u2026 No matter.\u201d Oyelowo is one of those actors whose performance is so compelling that you feel as if the camera is zooming in on his facial expression even when it isn\u2019t. He draws you to him. \u201cIf he lives, he intends to rob me of all my happiness.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you \u2026 Are you insane?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I think we know you\u2019re both insane by this point. The question is which one of you is more sympathetic as a human being. In the end, Javert just could not live with his own humanity. West should also get an award for acting in a sewage tunnel. This was incredible and terrifying but narratively (blaming Victor Hugo here) I just kept thinking, \u201cFor the love of magnificent trousers, has this man not suffered enough?\u201d Still, his bestial roar of rage was astonishing. Wherever there\u2019s a stink, Thenardiers is not far away. \u201cYou ruined my life. I had my own inn. Now I live like a rat in the shitty darkness.\u201d Oh dear; we all feel like that some days, mate. All the massive questions raised by Hugo had to be encapsulated in just a few moments. What does it mean to have everything you believe in vanish in a flash? What does it feel like to lose the one person to whom you have given everything? Why is the choice to be a good person such a lonely one? This series has been a difficult task for the actors to pull off. The scenes are short, sometimes only seconds long. The narrative moves at breakneck speed and ridiculous coincidences drive the plot constantly. To maintain the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief is no easy ask. But they all rose to it brilliantly, inspired, I suspect, by West, who appeared to live and breathe that character. Valjean, we salute you and wish you the sweet sleep of angels. You were never a thief to us. Least convincing romantic encounter The bromance between Valjean and Marius took a while to warm up, but we got there in the end as Marius was dragged into the cellar. Cosette and Marius\u2019 relationship became the focus by the end, but I still struggled to believe in it.

The New Yorker did not demur when he was described as a fan of the Patriots, whose owner, Robert Kraft, is a friend, and he predicted a New England win. The president also passed comment on lingering controversy over the Rams\u2019 win over the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game, in which, at a crucial juncture, officials failed to see and penalise pass interference on Saints wide receiver Tommylee Lewis by Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman inside the five-yard line. \u201cWell it was certainly a bad call,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you know the Saints are a wonderful team with a great quarterback [Drew Brees]. And it\u2019s a shame that we couldn\u2019t have seen that game finished out, because that was a beautiful pass. And it was a perfect pass.\u201d In a remark that perhaps jarred with his earlier expression of concern regarding football and safety, he added: \u201cAnd he was not just interfered with, he was \u2013 he was really hit hard.\u201d",

The policy resembles a key component of the bill introduced by the independent MP Kerryn Phelps that is due to go before parliament next week, but does not allow doctors to override the department blocking critically ill people transferring to Australia for treatment. The government has strenuously opposed the bill, claiming it is the first step in dismantling its offshore detention policy, but fears it will lose the vote against Labor, Greens and crossbenchers unless Labor reverses its support. In the letter to Bill Shorten, seen by Guardian Australia, Morrison announced the creation of a medical transfer clinical assurance panel to oversee the department of home affairs\u2019 transfer decisions. Morrison said the panel will be chaired by a nominee of the commonwealth medical officer and will include respected clinicians including members with mental health and trauma experiencing. The panel will report to the joint standing committee on migration and can raise issues with the department of home affairs secretary at any time. Morrison said the improvements were being made \u201cwithout any conditions\u201d, but implored Labor to rescind its support for the Phelps bill. \u201cThe reason that the amendments passed by the Senate will end offshore processing is simply that they take the final decision of who comes to Australia out of the hands of the elected government of this country.

Coleman also announced the government had been working with the Port Moresby Pacific International Hospital to establish an inpatient mental health service. Phelps said she had not seen the detail of the proposal reported on Monday, but she did not believe there was anything in the reports that \u201clooks better than the legislation that is before the parliament next week\u201d. She told Guardian Australia she had heard nothing to suggest the other crossbenchers were swayed by the proposal. Independent MP Cathy McGowan said later on Monday morning her position on getting refugees out of indefinite detention was \u201cunchanged\u201d, but she welcomed the government continuing to listen to crossbenchers and would confirm her position on the legislation next week. The former Liberal MP turned independent Julia Banks told Guardian Australia she still supported Phelps\u2019s bill, as did the Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie. \u201cThis bill is about the temporary transfer of people for assessment and treatment of medical issues identified by medical professionals,\u201d Sharkie said. \u201cQuite frankly I trust the doctors over the politicians.\u201d Phelps\u2019s bill would provide for two or more \u201ctreating doctors\u201d to inform the home affairs department that a person needed medical or psychiatric care they were not receiving, prompting a transfer within 24 hours. The transfer could be refused if the minister rejected their assessment of necessity or if the transfer affected national security. The refusal would then go to a medical panel who could override the minister\u2019s refusal on the grounds of medical necessity but not on national security. Phelps told Radio National the proposal was a recognition from the government that \u201cthe system is broken\u201d but said it would not solve the problem because it still meant bureaucrats would make the decision about transfers. \u201cThis is about emergency medical transfers of critically ill people from Manus Island and Nauru, and until now there has been a long, lengthy delay, and almost obsessive legal intervention to try and stop people who are ill from being transferred over to Australia for the care that they need.\u201d Phelps said her bill gave the minister veto powers on grounds of national security grounds but not on medical grounds, and was still the better apparatus. The independent senator Tim Storer told Guardian Australia he welcomed the government \u201ctaking steps to improve the process\u201d for medical evacuations. However the proposed panel \u201cwill have no power to overturn decisions made by the department\u201d, he said. \u201cIt will simply be able to request a review by the department itself. I stand by my amendment to that passed by the Senate late last year. It will ensure that judgments on the medical needs of sick refugees are made by doctors, not departmental officials, while preserving ministerial veto on national security grounds.\u201d He said claims that the bill would weaken border security were wrong and \u201canother distasteful attempt to politicise what is a humanitarian issue\u201d. Twelve people have died in offshore detention, including by suicide and medical neglect. There are about 600 men still on Manus Island, the majority of whom are refugees, and who report increasing rates of mental illness and distress, and inadequate treatment at both the local clinic and the hospital in Port Moresby. On Sunday the government announced that the final four children on Nauru under the offshore processing policy were scheduled to leave for US resettlement. About 120 children and their families have been transferred off the island since late last year, after a high-profile campaign by a coalition of charities and human rights groups, and dozens of legal actions brought against the government to bring people to Australia for treatment. Guardian Australia reported last year that the government had spent about $750,000 in 15 months on extraneous legal fees responding to or fighting against attempts to have critically ill people medically evacuated to Australia.",

He\u2019s always up to something; it\u2019s just not what you would consider typical structure.\u201d</p> \n<p>The latest leak appears to place Trump, an early riser, in executive time for the first five hours of any day, before he gets to the Oval Office.</p> \n<p>He reportedly spends his mornings \u201cin the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the US morning briefing\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for the US morning briefing\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His first meeting, generally around 11am or 11.30am, is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, when the Axios story broke, Trump was finishing up a round of golf with Mulvaney at his golf club in Jupiter, Florida.</p> \n<p>The president did not immediately tweet a response, preferring to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1092169520469471233\">eulogise</a> his Saturday golf partners, the multiple major winners Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. He told CBS he planned to watch the Super Bowl at his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/trump-executive-time-presidents-historical\">'Executive time': Trump mocked for taking it easy \u2013 but so did other presidents</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement to Axios: \u201cPresident Trump has a different leadership style than his predecessors and the results speak for themselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders also said that while Trump spends \u201cmuch of his average day in scheduled meetings, events and calls, there is time to allow for a more creative environment that has helped make him the most productive president in modern history.\u201d</p> \n<p>On some days, Axios reported, executive time comfortably exceeds scheduled time. On 18 January, for instance, Trump had one hour of scheduled meetings with Mulvaney and the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and seven hours of executive time. On 7 November, the day after Democrats regained the House in the midterms, Trump also had just <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5720284-Axios-President-Donald-Trump-Private-Schedules.html\">30 minutes</a> of scheduled meetings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"adca73cb-2f26-47ea-86b8-e4e0729ff96f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mztHIJ1DB7k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cExecutive time\u201d does not necessarily preclude meetings, Axios said, since they may be organised on the spur of the moment and include calls with heads of state, political meetings and meetings with counsel in the White House residence.</p> \n<p>After the 2018 leak, spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters that \u201cto describe [Trump\u2019s] work ethic as anything other than yeomanlike is ridiculous, and everyone knows it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Historian Evan Thomas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/trump-executive-time-presidents-historical\">told the Guardian then</a> that Richard Nixon, who \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep and was an insomniac\u201d, used to have \u201cstaff time\u201d every afternoon, in order to take naps.

His door was closed, he was in the Oval Office, he was in the residence.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut with Trump because he\u2019s tweeting and his tweets in many cases are clearly inspired by some Fox News segment only 10 minutes ago, it\u2019s pretty obvious what he\u2019s spending his time doing, at least in the early part of the day.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "What does Donald Trump do with his time? The mystery was at least partially solved on Sunday, with an extensive leak of his private schedule. According to the website Axios, since 7 November, the day after the midterm elections, the president has spent almost 300 hours in relatively unstructured \u201cexecutive time\u201d and only 77 hours in scheduled meetings covering policy planning, legislative strategy and video recordings. According to Axios, the \u201cunusually voluminous leak\u201d from an unnamed White House source gives unprecedented visibility into how Trump spends his days. The schedules show Trump spends around 60% of each day in \u201cexecutive time\u201d, a concept introduced by his former chief of staff John Kelly because the president detests being locked into a regular schedule. In January 2018, a similar leak to the same publication introduced \u201cexecutive time\u201d to an incredulous world. It said Trump often started his official duties around 11am, and held far fewer meetings than in the early days of his presidency. Executive time, the publication asserted then, \u201calmost always means TV and Twitter time alone in the residence\u201d. This time round, a White House staffer said Trump was \u201calways calling people, talking to people. He\u2019s always up to something; it\u2019s just not what you would consider typical structure.\u201d The latest leak appears to place Trump, an early riser, in executive time for the first five hours of any day, before he gets to the Oval Office. He reportedly spends his mornings \u201cin the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers\u201d. His first meeting, generally around 11am or 11.30am, is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. On Sunday, when the Axios story broke, Trump was finishing up a round of golf with Mulvaney at his golf club in Jupiter, Florida. The president did not immediately tweet a response, preferring to eulogise his Saturday golf partners, the multiple major winners Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. He told CBS he planned to watch the Super Bowl at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement to Axios: \u201cPresident Trump has a different leadership style than his predecessors and the results speak for themselves.\u201d Sanders also said that while Trump spends \u201cmuch of his average day in scheduled meetings, events and calls, there is time to allow for a more creative environment that has helped make him the most productive president in modern history.\u201d On some days, Axios reported, executive time comfortably exceeds scheduled time. On 18 January, for instance, Trump had one hour of scheduled meetings with Mulvaney and the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and seven hours of executive time. On 7 November, the day after Democrats regained the House in the midterms, Trump also had just 30 minutes of scheduled meetings. \u201cExecutive time\u201d does not necessarily preclude meetings, Axios said, since they may be organised on the spur of the moment and include calls with heads of state, political meetings and meetings with counsel in the White House residence. After the 2018 leak, spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters that \u201cto describe [Trump\u2019s] work ethic as anything other than yeomanlike is ridiculous, and everyone knows it.\u201d Historian Evan Thomas told the Guardian then that Richard Nixon, who \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep and was an insomniac\u201d, used to have \u201cstaff time\u201d every afternoon, in order to take naps. Dwight Eisenhower built in White House nap time too, Thomas said. David Karol of the University of Maryland said: \u201cIf [Ronald] Reagan was taking a nap or watching an old movie, people didn\u2019t know. His door was closed, he was in the Oval Office, he was in the residence. \u201cBut with Trump because he\u2019s tweeting and his tweets in many cases are clearly inspired by some Fox News segment only 10 minutes ago, it\u2019s pretty obvious what he\u2019s spending his time doing, at least in the early part of the day.\u201d",

The local taverna owner is unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through two eruptions and never known anyone to be killed by the volcano,\u201d he shrugs. One active volcano is nothing compared with centuries of destruction wreaked by man.</p> <p>In Senegal Adepitan finds that fish are, as the international sea shanty goes, increasingly scarce. That is due to the 116 foreign industrial fishing boats out there, turning it into fishmeal for western cattle and farmed salmon. Adepitan asks a fisherman who is to blame. \u201cThe sorry state of Africa is Europe\u2019s fault,\u201d he replies. \u201cThey take all of Africa\u2019s resources. There\u2019s another kind of slavery now.\u201d</p> <p>Next, Nigeria, the most populated country in Africa, and to Lagos, where Adepitan was born. He visits some fellow polio survivors who, like him, are disabled and love sport. They career about on skateboards, or rather scraps of wood attached to wheels, playing the most impressive game of football I\u2019ve seen. One man, Ortega, takes Adepitan out on his tuk-tuk, modified so it works with hand controls. He shows him the bridge under which he lives.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s on to a megachurch which looks more like a football stadium and can apparently hold a million evangelical Christians. Nevertheless, they are building a bigger one. A squirming encounter with a representative from the Redeemed Christian Church of God ensues. He says the church\u2019s vision is to \u2026 help more Africans out of poverty? Nah. To build churches all over the world. Adepitan does ask him about the pastor\u2019s private jet and notorious wealth, which he defends on the grounds that it is a necessity. Ducking both an invitation to join the church or probe further, Adepitan moves on swiftly. \u201cIf you get a rollercoaster I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d are his parting words, which feels somewhat satirical considering there is an actual funfair in the town surrounding the church headquarters. This world. You couldn\u2019t make it up.</p>",

The local taverna owner is unperturbed. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through two eruptions and never known anyone to be killed by the volcano,\u201d he shrugs. One active volcano is nothing compared with centuries of destruction wreaked by man. In Senegal Adepitan finds that fish are, as the international sea shanty goes, increasingly scarce. That is due to the 116 foreign industrial fishing boats out there, turning it into fishmeal for western cattle and farmed salmon. Adepitan asks a fisherman who is to blame. \u201cThe sorry state of Africa is Europe\u2019s fault,\u201d he replies. \u201cThey take all of Africa\u2019s resources. There\u2019s another kind of slavery now.\u201d Next, Nigeria, the most populated country in Africa, and to Lagos, where Adepitan was born. He visits some fellow polio survivors who, like him, are disabled and love sport. They career about on skateboards, or rather scraps of wood attached to wheels, playing the most impressive game of football I\u2019ve seen. One man, Ortega, takes Adepitan out on his tuk-tuk, modified so it works with hand controls. He shows him the bridge under which he lives. Then it\u2019s on to a megachurch which looks more like a football stadium and can apparently hold a million evangelical Christians. Nevertheless, they are building a bigger one. A squirming encounter with a representative from the Redeemed Christian Church of God ensues. He says the church\u2019s vision is to \u2026 help more Africans out of poverty? Nah. To build churches all over the world. Adepitan does ask him about the pastor\u2019s private jet and notorious wealth, which he defends on the grounds that it is a necessity. Ducking both an invitation to join the church or probe further, Adepitan moves on swiftly. \u201cIf you get a rollercoaster I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d are his parting words, which feels somewhat satirical considering there is an actual funfair in the town surrounding the church headquarters. This world. You couldn\u2019t make it up.",

At 4am on Monday, the dam\u2019s water levels were still at 242% of capacity, and had not dropped significantly. On Monday morning the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, praised emergency workers for putting their lives on the line overnight, calling the floods a \u201cone in a century event\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d she told the Nine network. \u201cIn Queensland, of course, we\u2019re used to seeing natural disasters, but Townsville has never seen the likes of this.\u201d Palaszczuk said there were more than 900 people in the evacuation centres and that was expected to increase during the day. She warned residents to stay away from the floodwaters and said the worst might yet be to come. \u201cDon\u2019t go sightseeing, if you don\u2019t need to be out on the roads, don\u2019t be. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet got to the peak \u2026 this monsoonal pressure will keep shifting, so we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to dump the water.\u201d Palaszczuk said the decision to open the dam floodgates had not been taken lightly, but it had to be done \u201cto make sure the water had somewhere to go\u201d. Townsville families who had fled their homes were waiting nervously to see just how far floodwaters would rise, and how long the emergency situation in the city would last. Soldiers, police and SES workers patrolled at-risk parts of the city overnight, helping people move from vulnerable homes. Two police officers who were evacuating people in the suburb of Hermit Park had to be rescued themselves when fast rising waters washed away their patrol car and left them clinging to trees. Two other people were plucked to safety from the roof of their car at nearby Hyde Park. The overnight rainfall was not as bad as had been feared, but the Bureau of Meteorology estimated that a further 450mm of rain would have fallen over the Ross River dam catchment in the 24 hours to 9am on Monday. The order to open the dam floodgates sparked warnings of flash flooding across 21 suburbs, including high velocity flows that could kill people. On Sunday between 400 and 500 homes had been inundated, but that was before the dam releases, which it was feared would threaten thousands more. One of the city\u2019s five evacuation centres is now full and unable to accept any more people. Authorities warned that the floodwaters were full of snakes, and crocodiles have been spotted outside suburban homes. A decision was due to be made early on Monday about whether to reopen the city\u2019s airport after all flights were cancelled late on Sunday. The trough that has been dumping flooding rain on north Queensland\u2019s east coast, as well as drought-hit parts of western Queensland, will drive the state\u2019s emergency for days to come. Intense rain with significant flash flooding was expected between Ingham and Bowen on Monday, and possibly as far south as Mackay, extending inland to Mount Isa near the Northern Territory border. Authorities have also warned of the potential for tornado-strength winds, and have observed offshore tornadoes, but so far tornadoes have not been seen in coastal communities.",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are back to their best after Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hat-trick secured a 3-1 win against Arsenal, with the manager admitting they did not \u201crecognise\u201d themselves after the defeat at Newcastle United last week. The result closes the gap behind Liverpool at the top of the table to two points, with J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team to play their game in hand at West Ham United on Monday. Guardiola\u2019s side bounced back from the surprise loss at St James\u2019 Park thanks to Ag\u00fcero\u2019s treble \u2013 the 14th of his City career \u2013 after Laurent Koscielny had pulled Arsenal level in the first half. Guardiola said: \u201cWhat is important is being ourselves. That\u2019s what I want. We spoke in the last days. We didn\u2019t recognise our team in the last game. They know it \u2013 they felt the same way. Today at least we came back.\u201d Liverpool might have gone seven points ahead if they had beaten Leicester City last Wednesday but they could only draw, and City\u2019s manager admitted his side must concentrate only on their own results, with a trip to Everton to come on Wednesday. \u201cSeven [would have been] difficult but football is unpredictable. Now we are two behind and it can be five again or three. But we are the only ones playing in midweek [at Everton] and we have to prepare to win three points,\u201d he said. Guardiola refused to be drawn regarding whether Liverpool might slip at the London Stadium. \u201cReally I don\u2019t know.

Sead Kolasinac 7 Won the corner that led to Arsenal\u2019s goal but he should have given Monreal more help down left.

Bushfires were also threatening homes south of Gillingill, and warnings were issued for areas including Butchers Ridge, Deddick Valley, Gelantipy, W Tree, Yalmy, Murrindal and Wulgulmerang West. In Tasmania several towns were again under serious threat from raging bushfires whipped up by winds, with authorities warning property loss was \u201chighly likely\u201d.

The chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, Anna Bligh, said banks had \u201cnot lived up to the high standards Australians rightly expect of the industry\u201d. With the banks facing their day of reckoning, and the government response in the spotlight, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, will use the Chifley oration to lay down markers in the economic policy debate in the run-up to the federal election.

Donald Trump says he has \u201cset the table beautifully\u201d for the next stage of his confrontation with congressional Democrats, indicating that to secure funding for a wall on the border with Mexico, he will declare a national emergency on 15 February. Newly unsealed documents about the Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n contain claims by witnesses that he had sex with minors as young as 13. The billionaire prime minister of the Czech Republic faces an unlikely political threat, after his local council found him guilty of breaching conflict of interest rules by owning major media outlets while holding high office. Yemen peace talks have been held onboard a UN-chartered boat anchored in the Red Sea in an attempt to find a neutral venue acceptable to both sides.

      "bodyText": "The South Australian Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick is calling for cotton exports to be banned in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of the Murray-Darling river system and the over-extraction by irrigators. The senator is preparing to introduce a bill when parliament resumes next week. It would impose a ban on exporting cotton in three years\u2019 time. His proposal is driven by frustration that the states and the commonwealth have expressed an unwillingness to address the problems of the Murray-Darling basin, and have largely dismissed the South Australian royal commission\u2019s findings that the basin plan is failing and needs an overhaul. Patrick said the commonwealth had exclusive powers over exports and could act unilaterally to ban cotton exports. \u201cWe export 90% of the cotton grown in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 20% of the basin water goes to cotton. \u201cIt\u2019s like exporting 20% of the Murray-Darling to China and India.

Exports of uranium were restricted from the Olympic Dam mine and the government was looking at restrictions on live sheep exports in the interests of animal welfare. \u201cWe are not saying you can\u2019t grow cotton. We can use it here and we can look at growing a local processing industry if it makes economic sense.\u201d The chief executive of Cotton Australia, Adam Kay, called Patrick\u2019s proposal \u201ca reckless attack on rural communities and hardworking Australian farmers\u201d. \u201cOnce again we are seeing some politicians, mainly those from South Australia where no cotton is grown, kick our hardworking growers in an attempt to score easy political points. These farmers are enduring one of the toughest droughts in our nation\u2019s history and do not deserve to be targeted so unfairly,\u201d Kay said. He said the idea that more water would be saved for the environment if cotton was banned was \u201cludicrous\u201d, and pointed to the findings of the royal commission that rhetoric about \u201cthirsty crops\u201d and \u201cgreedy farmers\u201d should be rejected. \u201cCotton is an annual crop that is only grown when sufficient water is available,\u201d Kay said. \u201cIf cotton was to be banned in Australia, farmers would use their water to grow the next most profitable crop.\u201d Patrick\u2019s bill, while unlikely to get support from the government or the opposition, is likely to focus attention on the issues facing the basin and would probably be referred to a Senate committee, keeping the issue in the news in the lead-up to the federal election. The Greens have called for a federal royal commission, similar to the South Australian inquiry, though that too is unlikely to get support from the major parties, despite last month\u2019s fish deaths at Menindee. The South Australian commission recommended that the federal government again buy back water rights from farmers and irrigators \u2013 something that the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce put a stop to. New South Wales has threatened to pull out of the plan if buybacks are resumed. The NSW independent Jeremy Buckingham is supporting more buybacks and has called on the state to make immediate changes to its Barwon-Darling water sharing plan, including buying back all the A-class high-security water licences to ensure a flow through the Darling. Buckingham says this would cost $20m and would result in 1,250 megalitres a day for the river system. \u201cThese licences are almost exclusively used by two big cotton irrigators in northern NSW,\u201d he said. \u201cCompulsory acquisition is an effective way to ensure connectivity along the Darling to Menindee during drier times.\u201d He also wants changes to the rules which allow irrigators to take 300% of their allocation in one year, regardless of the actual flows in the river. But the prospect of Patrick\u2019s move getting support or even the chances of the Murray-Darling basin plan being revised appears slim despite the highly critical findings by the South Australian royal commission. Both Labor and the government appear reluctant to reopen discussions on the environmental water recovery target of 2,750 gigalitres that is central to the plan and have instead been focused on a political compromise. Patrick has also flagged that the current plan is likely to be invalid because it took account of considerations not permitted under the Water Act. The agriculture and water minister, David Littleproud, immediately ruled out lifting the cap on water buybacks or a bigger water saving target. \u201cNo, the Australian parliament agreed that the cap on buybacks should be 1,500 litres,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Landline. He said the government had already reached 1,200GL and that only small purchases were required in isolated catchments to meet that cap. \u201cSo we will not be revisiting that.\u201d He said: \u201cWe believe the best way is through efficiency measures, through using technology and investing in our brightest in being able to get those water efficiencies that deliver water to the environment and away we expect it to, and that is what we have done and that is the we will continue on.\u201d Littleproud also rejected increasing water for the environment, saying that as late as September last year the Senate had voted for measures which cut the water recovery target in the northern basin by 70GL and voted to allow alternative measures other than buybacks, such as water-saving projects, to achieve 605GL in the southern basin. The commissioner was highly critical of both changes and said they further undermined the plan. There is also no sign that Labor will shift its stance on the plan, which was developed when it was in government. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has asked a panel of scientists to report on the fish kills in the Menindee lakes in January, but so far there are no signs that he or his water spokesman are backing any review of the targets inherent in the plan. Labor\u2019s water spokesman, Tony Burke, has criticised the commission\u2019s finding that the plan, developed when he was minister, was invalid because it considered a triple bottom line approach rather than being based on environmental concerns only. But he did not take part in the commission\u2019s hearings and his recollection was not part of the evidence. Burke has been critical of Joyce\u2019s administration of the plan, which he said effectively ended a compromise that would have delivered a further 450GL to the plan in the future. He has said he would support more water buybacks if the projects designed to deliver 605GL of equivalent water to the environment didn\u2019t stack up. But that\u2019s a long way short of what the commission wants to see. It was highly critical of many of the projects that make up that 605GL because their outcomes were highly uncertain and also because it was a very expensive way to claw water back for the environment. But Burke was silent on the commission\u2019s central thrust: that the target should be raised and the buybacks resumed as soon as possible.",

The gifted 17-year-old, on as a substitute at half time for Charlie Devlin, took only five minutes to give the visiting side the lead as Jess Sigsworth\u2019s ball from the right allowed her to side-foot in from the edge of the box. Siobhan Chamberlain, often with so little to do between the posts, then showed why, despite playing in the Championship, she is not out of contention for a spot in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad as she dived low to her right to keep out a Danni Buet penalty after Kayleigh Green was cleared out by Amy Turner in the box.</p> <p>With 90 minutes on the clock James then went on a mazy run down the right, muscling off two the benign challenges before sweeping past Sophie Harris to seal the 2-0 win. But this day belonged to Wasps.</p> <p>The muddy field down Tinsley Lane where Oakfield FC men play was packed with an impressive 1,550 sell-out crowd, far outnumbering the 764 in the 6,134-seater up the road with the back-to-back matches taking place a 10-minute drive apart.

The quaint ground with its two tiny stands holding no more than 60 people each was heaving. Lines of people hugged the railings round the perimeter waving yellow and black paper flags.

Crippled by injury and taking the opportunity to rest players when facing a team 33 places below them, the Gunners lacked their customary free-flowing swagger. Crawley, looking to go one better than the town\u2019s men\u2019s team, and having beaten QPR, Chichester and Coventry after navigating two qualifiers just to make it here, did not just make up the numbers.

And with their top scorer, Vivianne Miedema, rested, it was the captain, Kim Little, who took a hold of the game and put the visitors ahead on 20 minutes, shifting into space before shooting low past Frankie Gibbs. Then, on the stroke of half-time, the 16-year-old Ruby Grant fired into the roof of the net to double the lead. Little, Katie McCabe and Danielle van de Donk were substituted and the young Gunners went to work.

Siobhan Chamberlain, often with so little to do between the posts, then showed why, despite playing in the Championship, she is not out of contention for a spot in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad as she dived low to her right to keep out a Danni Buet penalty after Kayleigh Green was cleared out by Amy Turner in the box. With 90 minutes on the clock James then went on a mazy run down the right, muscling off two the benign challenges before sweeping past Sophie Harris to seal the 2-0 win. But this day belonged to Wasps. The muddy field down Tinsley Lane where Oakfield FC men play was packed with an impressive 1,550 sell-out crowd, far outnumbering the 764 in the 6,134-seater up the road with the back-to-back matches taking place a 10-minute drive apart. But the player-led decision to turn down the offer of Crawley Town for use of their turf made sense \u2013 Town\u2019s manager Gabriele Cioffi was in the stands to support the neighbouring side. The atmosphere was ample reward. The quaint ground with its two tiny stands holding no more than 60 people each was heaving. Lines of people hugged the railings round the perimeter waving yellow and black paper flags. Wasps are one of a dwindling number of sides not affiliated to a men\u2019s club and it might have been expected that the scoreline would be painful. Instead the 4-0 victory flattered Arsenal. Crippled by injury and taking the opportunity to rest players when facing a team 33 places below them, the Gunners lacked their customary free-flowing swagger. Crawley, looking to go one better than the town\u2019s men\u2019s team, and having beaten QPR, Chichester and Coventry after navigating two qualifiers just to make it here, did not just make up the numbers. They were tough in the tackle and crisp in passing when they could be. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of the performance of the ladies today,\u201d their manager, Paul Walker, said. \u201cThey came up against a top side in Arsenal but I\u2019d be very surprised if anyone thought there was four levels of difference in those squads.\u201d For Arsenal, it was about getting the job done before Thursday\u2019s Continental Cup semi-final against Manchester United. And with their top scorer, Vivianne Miedema, rested, it was the captain, Kim Little, who took a hold of the game and put the visitors ahead on 20 minutes, shifting into space before shooting low past Frankie Gibbs. Then, on the stroke of half-time, the 16-year-old Ruby Grant fired into the roof of the net to double the lead. Little, Katie McCabe and Danielle van de Donk were substituted and the young Gunners went to work. Grant was their outlet and she picked up a through ball and sent it in to the bottom corner for her second before securing a hat-trick with five minutes remaining. \u201c1,550 people came today, we sold out of tickets,\u201d said Walker. \u201cThat\u2019s a WSL-level crowd and it shows the excitement that has been generated across the town and I hope everyone goes away thinking we put on a spectacle today. I don\u2019t think this will be a one-off. This club is going from strength to strength.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Drying ground robbed the second afternoon of the Dublin Festival meeting of several significant runners here on Sunday but Ireland still emerged from the weekend with its challenge for Cheltenham Festival\u2019s championship events enhanced, not least following news of an abrupt change of plan for Apple\u2019s Jade, the exceptional winner of the Irish Champion Hurdle on Saturday. The initial suggestion after Apple\u2019s Jade 16-lengths success was that she would run in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle at Cheltenham next month rather than switch to the more prestigious Champion Hurdle to face Buveur D\u2019Air, the winner of the race for the past two years. Having slept on it, though, Gordon Elliott and Michael O\u2019Leary \u2013 the mare\u2019s trainer and owner respectively \u2013 were more attuned to the wishes of the overwhelming majority of racing fans. The Champion Hurdle is the new plan A and Apple\u2019s Jade is second\u2011favourite at 5-2 in the ante\u2011post betting, half a point behind Buveur D\u2019Air at 2-1. \u201cI would say we were borderline shocked [by her win on Saturday],\u201d O\u2019Leary said on Sunday. \u201cI thought she would genuinely get beaten yesterday, I thought back to two miles, particularly on very good ground, they would take her off her feet. \u201cThe plan was that we\u2019d go to the Mares\u2019 but she did it so well that you really have to factor in, maybe we do go for the Champion Hurdle. I talked to Eddie [O\u2019Leary, his brother and racing manager] and Gordon this morning and we decided that, if she\u2019s fit and well in six weeks\u2019 time and she\u2019s in the same form and she\u2019s not in season, let her go for the Champion Hurdle, I would think.\u201d The Irish Gold Cup, the feature race of the Dublin Festival\u2019s second day, was reduced from 10 to four runners following a change in the going to good, good-to-firm in places. Despite the small field, however, the finish was a memorable one, as Ruby Walsh and Bellshill hauled themselves past Road To Respect, the odds\u2011on favourite, in the final stride. Bellshill had a length to find on Road To Respect at the final fence and the leader jumped it well to take what appeared to be a decisive lead into the run-in. Walsh, though, coaxed everything possible from Bellshill, as Sean Flanagan did his best to hold him off, and it was just enough. Mullins might well give up at least a couple of his 10 wins in Ireland\u2019s Gold Cup in return for a single success in the Cheltenham equivalent, in which he has saddled the runner-up six times. Bellshill will now join Mullins\u2019s team for this year\u2019s Gold Cup, though he needs to find nine lengths with Kemboy, seemingly Mullins\u2019s prime contender, on their form in the Savills\u2019 Chase at Leopardstown\u2019s Christmas meeting. \u201cWe thought he needed the run at Christmas and I think he\u2019s improving all the time,\u201d Mullins said of Bellshill. \u201cWhen Ruby wanted a jump down the back, he was absolutely fantastic. Now we know he has that up his sleeve it\u2019s good for the future. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting Kemboy over there, too. Kemboy has probably improved more than I thought he could and this fellow is still improving.\u201d Kemboy is still preferred in the betting at odds ranging from 7-1 to 10-1, while Bellshill is top\u2011priced at 16-1. Mullins also added two live chances to his team for the Supreme Novice Hurdle when Klassical Dream and Aramon were separated by a head in the Grade One Chanelle Pharma Novice Hurdle, while Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Sir Erec also confirmed his status as a leading Irish-trained contender for the Festival meeting with an emphatic success in the Spring Juvenile Hurdle. He is now a clear favourite at 11-4 to give O\u2019Brien his first official winner at the Festival in the Triumph Hurdle. Seven runners and three winners at last year\u2019s Dublin Festival went on to win at Cheltenham the following month and La Bague Au Roi, who took the Flogas Chase, would be a short price to follow up were she to run in the RSA Chase. However, Warren Greatrex, her trainer, feels Aintree in April is more likely to play to her strengths and Santini, who was behind La Bague Au Roi at Kempton\u2019s Christmas meeting, remains the 3-1 favourite for the RSA with La Bague Au Roi available at 12-1.",

His fears are about the knock-on effect on the hundreds of local businesses that rely on Nissan. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just Nissan, it\u2019s all the jobs in the area. As soon as one big company leaves, the rest will follow. They will all fall like dominoes,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s all to do with Brexit. The firms don\u2019t want to have to pay the tariffs for imports.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had known then what I know now I wouldn\u2019t have voted that way. All the promises that were made have not come true. I think a lot of people in Sunderland latched on to the \u2018they\u2019ve come to take our jobs\u2019 argument. It would be a lot easier if we didn\u2019t leave now.\u201d</p> <p>But Bob Hackett, 66, who worked as a trainee assessor at Gateshead College arranging placements for students at Nissan and whose nephew works there, was sceptical about the Brexit connection.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people will lose their jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion it was on the cards to start with. It\u2019s just scaremongering. I think they\u2019re hedging their bets and waiting to find out about tariffs. They are just playing it out. I think Nissan will do anything to get more money from the government.</p> <p>\u201cThey keep a lot of people around here in employment. It\u2019s so central to the area that the government will probably subsidise any tariffs Nissan should be subjected to.\u201d</p> <p>A current employee at Nissan who did not want to be named says: \u201cI think all of this was coming anyway.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to produce the X-Trail. The money for a new model was never released. They\u2019re just using Brexit as an excuse. I don\u2019t think leaving the EU will even make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, John Metcalfe, a 72-year-old pensioner who voted to remain, says the news has had a devastating impact on the area. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive shock,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary for the workers. Most of the people at Nissan voted to leave the EU and I can\u2019t think why. I was so surprised when I saw Sunderland had voted out of the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWith all the taxes and tariffs that will be imposed because of Brexit, people are going to lose jobs and we need jobs up here. There aren\u2019t any other major employers. I really worry about the future of this city.\u201d</p> <p>Charity worker Katie Hopper, 26, talks of her frustration at those people in her city who voted to leave. She says: \u201cI think Brexit is going to ruin Sunderland. It makes no sense that people of Sunderland and this workforce voted to leave the EU.\u201d</p> <p>The news has caused many to view the future with trepidation. One of those was Keith Scott, 35, a father of two young children, who has many close friends and family who work at the plant.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was obvious this was going to happen and of course it\u2019s to do with Brexit. I have no idea why people voted to leave the EU,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI know Nissan had the assurances from the government but obviously that wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>\u201cThings like this are going to continue to happen until Nissan in Sunderland disappears completely, which will be devastating for the area. I dread to think of the future.\u201d</p>",

Just hours earlier, the Japanese carmaker confirmed it was abandoning plans to build a new model of one of its flagship vehicles at the plant. At the Hylton Riverside shopping centre, just a few miles away, locals say there had been an inevitability to the announcement. Sunderland had a sizeable pro-leave vote at 61% but now there is widespread frustration at the impact that Brexit could have on the city. Nissan employs 6,700 people at the plant. On this morning, the shopping centre, which itself relies on trade from the Nissan workers, was quieter than usual. Those that the Guardian spoke to say they had been preparing for \u201cbad news\u201d \u2013 they say a sense of resignation had gripped the Tyne and Wear city in recent months. Retired firefighter Vincent O\u2019Neill, 55, was one of those who voted to leave. He says he now regrets his decision. His fears are about the knock-on effect on the hundreds of local businesses that rely on Nissan. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just Nissan, it\u2019s all the jobs in the area. As soon as one big company leaves, the rest will follow. They will all fall like dominoes,\u201d he says. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s all to do with Brexit. The firms don\u2019t want to have to pay the tariffs for imports. \u201cIf I had known then what I know now I wouldn\u2019t have voted that way. All the promises that were made have not come true. I think a lot of people in Sunderland latched on to the \u2018they\u2019ve come to take our jobs\u2019 argument. It would be a lot easier if we didn\u2019t leave now.\u201d But Bob Hackett, 66, who worked as a trainee assessor at Gateshead College arranging placements for students at Nissan and whose nephew works there, was sceptical about the Brexit connection. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will lose their jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion it was on the cards to start with. It\u2019s just scaremongering. I think they\u2019re hedging their bets and waiting to find out about tariffs. They are just playing it out. I think Nissan will do anything to get more money from the government. \u201cThey keep a lot of people around here in employment. It\u2019s so central to the area that the government will probably subsidise any tariffs Nissan should be subjected to.\u201d A current employee at Nissan who did not want to be named says: \u201cI think all of this was coming anyway. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to produce the X-Trail. The money for a new model was never released. They\u2019re just using Brexit as an excuse. I don\u2019t think leaving the EU will even make a difference.\u201d Nonetheless, John Metcalfe, a 72-year-old pensioner who voted to remain, says the news has had a devastating impact on the area. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive shock,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really scary for the workers. Most of the people at Nissan voted to leave the EU and I can\u2019t think why. I was so surprised when I saw Sunderland had voted out of the EU. \u201cWith all the taxes and tariffs that will be imposed because of Brexit, people are going to lose jobs and we need jobs up here. There aren\u2019t any other major employers. I really worry about the future of this city.\u201d Charity worker Katie Hopper, 26, talks of her frustration at those people in her city who voted to leave. She says: \u201cI think Brexit is going to ruin Sunderland. It makes no sense that people of Sunderland and this workforce voted to leave the EU.\u201d The news has caused many to view the future with trepidation. One of those was Keith Scott, 35, a father of two young children, who has many close friends and family who work at the plant. \u201cI think it was obvious this was going to happen and of course it\u2019s to do with Brexit. I have no idea why people voted to leave the EU,\u201d he says. \u201cI know Nissan had the assurances from the government but obviously that wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThings like this are going to continue to happen until Nissan in Sunderland disappears completely, which will be devastating for the area. I dread to think of the future.\u201d",

While Liverpool didn\u2019t play very well against Leicester on Wednesday night, the real story of the week was yet another damaging defeat for City, who fell further behind the Premier League\u2019s pacesetters after contriving to chuck away a lead against Newcastle. The heat on the champions is increasing. Inconsistency threatens to loosen their grip on the title, leaving them with little room for manoeuvre as they attempt to make Liverpool sweat about bringing the title to Anfield for the first time since 1990. If losing to Chelsea at the start of December was unfortunate - even Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Chelsea - then following it up by falling to Crystal Palace, Leicester and Newcastle was downright careless. It\u2019s enough to make you want to refer to Pep Guardiola as ... BALD FRAUDIOLA.</p> <p>Too much? Probably. Yet these are difficult times for Guardiola, with his team just lacking that crucial extra yard, that vital extra spark of intensity and inspiration, and now City find themselves in a position where almost every game is a must-win. They can\u2019t wait for Liverpool to wobble; they have to do all they can to force it by going on a long winning run, which needs to start against Arsenal today. For the past two months many people have said that City are too good not to win this catch-up, that they are bound to reel Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side in eventually. But it isn\u2019t going to happen if they continue to stumble here and there. They have to be at full throttle every week now.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be easy. By mid-March City will have met Chelsea in the League Cup final, face Schalke in the last 16 of the Champions League, have an FA Cup weekend and travel to Old Trafford for a derby with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s rejuvenated Manchester United in the league. But who look that far ahead when the next week sees Guardiola\u2019s side travel to Goodison Park on Wednesday and host Chelsea next Sunday? The games are coming thick and fast, testing desire and stamina, and before all that first City have to deal with Arsenal, who have come a long way since losing to Guardiola\u2019s side on the opening day of the season.</p> <p>No doubt things have changed since 12 August. Back then City looked dead certs to retain their title, sweeping a new-look Arsenal aside with impeccable ease. Yet Unai Emery has started to make his presence felt in the post-Wenger era. Arsenal remain a little fragile at the back, a little open in midfield, a little unreliable in attack at times, and there have been plenty of days when it hasn\u2019t been easy to work out Emery\u2019s plan. There have been a lot of lost first halves. But if you\u2019re looking for progress, ignore how Arsenal reverted to type as they were picked off on the counterattack by United in the FA Cup last weekend and focus instead on stirring home wins over Chelsea and Tottenham in the league. Emery\u2019s men are three points off fourth-placed Chelsea and, with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in scorching form, City will have to be at their sharpest. The opportunity is there to go two points behind Liverpool, who visit West Ham tomorrow night. City can\u2019t afford to pass it up.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 4.30pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T15:13:09.983Z\">at 3.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

As for Arsenal, they remain in sixth place, a point behind Ole\u2019s boys, three behind the Sarriball Art Experiment. They just aren\u2019t capable of matching the top sides for 90 minutes. They still make too many mistakes at the back and Unai Emery will feel that a lot of his players aren\u2019t good enough. Emery needs time. He\u2019s done well to get them so close to the top four, but he\u2019s working with a very unbalanced squad. Sergio Aguero, who now has 10 hat-tricks in the Premier League, is asked if his third goal was handball. \u201cIt\u2019s important to win. The other day I scored early, 25 seconds, and we lose. Today I am very happy. I think the third goal was off my chest. Now I see on TV it was a handball.\u201d Fernandinho speaks! \u201cWe wanted to go back on track. Playing good football and today we deserved it. We scored another early goal and I think we deserved the win. They are very dangerous on set-pieces. I think we didn\u2019t drop the level. We maintained our rhythm and we scored a second goal and in the second half we controlled the game.\u201d An odd game. Manchester City flew out of the traps. Sergio Aguero scored within a minute, then they lost their way and gave Arsenal an equaliser. It looked ropey for a while. Arsenal even sensed they were in with a chance of stealing the points. But they couldn\u2019t contend with a finisher of Aguero\u2019s class. The striker\u2019s hat-trick settled City down and ensured they were comfortable long before the final whistle. The champions go two points behind Liverpool, who will be under pressure when they travel to West Ham tomorrow night. If Liverpool lose or draw at the London Stadium, City would go top with a win against Everton on Wednesday. Are you ready for all the twists and turns to come? That\u2019s your lot. City go two points behind Liverpool with a routine win, albeit having played a game more. 90 min: Mahrez bends one wide from 20 yards. There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Riyad Mahrez replaces the excellent Kevin de Bruyne. 87 min: Now Sterling goes on a solo power surge, but Guendouzi blocks his shot. Moments later De Bruyne goes down with what appears to be cramp. His afternoon\u2019s over, but just because of fatigue. 85 min: With options left and right, Jesus decides to go alone. He ignores Sterling, who was free to his right, and scuffs straight at Leno. You can tell he wants to make the most of his brief cameo, but I think he\u2019d have impressed Guardiola more by passing to Sterling. 82 min: There\u2019s more chance of a fourth for City than a second for Arsenal. Now David Silva has a go from the edge of the area, but Leno pushes his firm drive away. 81 min: Gabriel Jesus replaces Sergio Aguero, City\u2019s hat-trick hero. De Bruyne, still full of mischievous intent, breaks down the right. His low ball towards Sterling\u2019s cleared. 79 min: Konstantinos Mavropanos replaces Shkodran Mustafi, which means we won\u2019t be seeing Mesut Ozil today. Arsenal have used up their substitutes. It\u2019s abundantly clear that Emery has no use for Ozil. 78 min: Arsenal have run out of steam. Have they had a shot in the second half? I can\u2019t remember a shot from them in the second half. That\u2019s a shame - they played well before going 2-1 down on the stroke of half-time. 76 min: A free-kick to City deep on the left. De Bruyne whips it in and it\u2019s headed to Aguero, who\u2019s lurking unmarked on the edge of the area. He\u2019s on to the loose ball in a flash and jabs a shot goalwards, only for Leno to make a smart stop. Arsenal survive. However, Mustafi has gone down with an injury. Unai Emery won\u2019t want to lose another centre-back. 74 min: \u201cLichtsteiner is rubbish,\u201d Caleb Jones roars. \u201cPassion is no substitute for skill.Moreover maybe buying over the hill defenders from a joke league to start half your games isn\u2019t a good plan. Beepty beep.\u201d He\u2019s not got the pace to start in this kind of game, sadly. He was a very effective player for Juventus for many years, but it seems the Italians knew what they were doing when they let him leave. 71 min: Barring a City collapse, which looks unlikely, thoughts are turning to whether Liverpool can hold their nerve against West Ham tomorrow. It won\u2019t be straightforward. Probably. West Ham\u2019s form is poor, but they\u2019ve been decent against the big sides at home under Manuel Pellegrini. 68 min: \u201cHow would Neville know about keepers?\u201d says James Robinson says. \u201cPlaying in front of Schmeichel probably.\u201d How does that make him an expert on goalkeeping technique? 67 min: Arsenal make a double change, Denis Suarez replacing Sead Kolasinac, Aaron Ramsey on for Alex Iwobi. Suarez used to be at City, you know. 66 min: Every City goal has originated down the left. They\u2019ve certainly identified Lichtsteiner as Arsenal\u2019s weak link. Correction: one of Arsenal\u2019s weakest weak links. \u201cAg\u00fcero has scored a perfect hat-trick, head, leg and arm,\u201d Kari Tulinius says. 65 min: Gundogan bursts into the Arsenal area and falls over a nothing challenge from Mustafi. He\u2019s booked for diving. 63 min: Gary Neville is banging on about goalkeepers parrying shots instead of catching them. How would he know? With Arsenal\u2019s defenders looking leggy, Raheem Sterling finds space on the edge of the area, scoots down the outside and drives the ball into the six-yard box. It goes past Leno and reaches the sliding Aguero. But after the cross hits the striker\u2019s midriff, the final touch appears to come off the striker\u2019s left arm. Unable to stop the ball from trickling over the line, Arsenal appeal in vain for handball, but it would have been tough for Martin Atkinson to spot it. Plus, it would be tough to argue it was deliberate handball from Aguero. If it was handball at all. So it\u2019s just as well that City have Aguero up front, though there\u2019s a large dollop of controversy about the way he\u2019s completed his hat-trick. 59 min: Arsenal probe down the left, but Kolasinac\u2019s low ball\u2019s too close to Ederson. But that\u2019s a minor warning for City, a message they they need to be more ruthless at the other end. Arsenal definitely have an equaliser in them. 56 min: City are playing some good stuff. With Arsenal exerting little pressure in midfield, they move through too easily, flicking the ball with giddy abandon, Sterling slipping a pass through to De Bruyne, who only has Leno to beat. But De Bruyne scuffs his shot at Leno, who saves with his feet. 56 min: Mustafi seems to be struggling with a knock. He\u2019s wincing and clutching his leg. 53 min: With City pressing for a third, De Bruyne has another sighter from the edge of the area. He whips it with his right foot, hitting it so crisply and with such fine timing, and forces Leno to plunge low to his left to push the ball away. It comes to Sterling, who\u2019s offside. 51 min: De Bruyne clips a shot straight at Leno from 20 yards. Leno almost spills it at David Silva\u2019s feet, only to recover just in time. 48 min: Bernardo Silva scoops a dismal shot into the top tier from 25 yards. Useless. Retire. 46 min: City get the second half underway. \u201cThis match represents an almost perfect storm for Gary Neville on commentary,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cIf City win, they\u2019ll be very happy, and keeping up the chase for the league. Bad news for him. If Arsenal win, it would be an amazing result for them, leaving them ecstatic, AND strengthening Liverpool\u2019s league position. Both bad news for Neville. If only Leeds could get involved somehow...\u201d A strange half comes to a close. City made a blistering start, took the lead and then entered panic mode after Laurent Koscielny\u2019s equaliser. But Sergio Aguero\u2019s second goal of the afternoon means they lead. This is fascinatingly poised. 45 min+1: Bernardo Silva strokes a pass through to De Bruyne on the right, but the Belgian\u2019s low cross-shot\u2019s neither here nor there, wide of the far post and too far in front of the sliding Sterling to reach. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. After 10 minutes of struggle, this is a brilliant way for City to restore their lead. Sterling plays a pass back to Gundogan from the left and Lichtsteiner falls asleep. Gundogan instantly pops a pass over the Arsenal defence, leaving Sterling to cushion the ball across the face of goal for Aguero, who isn\u2019t going to miss from two yards out! City have been wobbling, but their main striker has two and they\u2019re in front again. This is magnificent. 42 min: City are beginning to lose the midfield battle, which isn\u2019t surprising given that Fernandinho is playing in defence. Arsenal swamp them again and stream forward. Aubameyang\u2019s played into space down the inside-right channel, but his shot\u2019s deflected over. City deal with the corner. 40 min: Torreiera has been booked for chopping down De Bruyne during that City break. 39 min: This is very entertaining. Kolasinac has a dig from the edge of the City area, stinging Ederson\u2019s palms. Then Torreira sees a powerful drive blocked. Lacazette almost makes something from nothing and then City attack, De Bruyne leading a counter. You attack, we attack. Eventually Arsenal quell the danger. They\u2019re playing on City\u2019s anxiety. 37 min: David Silva wriggles down the left, burrowing into one of his favourite positions, and digs a cross into the middle. Leno claws the ball away unconvincingly and is lucky to see it land at the feet of Monreal, who mops up. 35 min: When Arsenal win possession just inside their half, Lacazette shrugs off Bernardo Silva, looks up and slides a wonderful pass towards Aubameyang, who\u2019s peeled into enviable space. He has the pace to beat his markers, who are grateful to see Ederson storm from his area and boot the ball away. 32 min: Arsenal fancy their chances in attack. A cross from the right\u2019s just too high for Aubameyang at the near post. But the visitors reckon they can find holes in this City defence. They also know Aubameyang and Lacazette are good enough to take advantage if they get a sight of goal. 30 min: City are nervous. They aren\u2019t playing badly, but everything\u2019s slightly hurried, slightly panicky. They\u2019ve been in a lot of good positions in Arsenal\u2019s half, but they can\u2019t get their final ball right. 28 min: Torreira boots a pass straight against Martin Atkinson, who can\u2019t do anything to stop the ball from rebounding to Sterling on the edge of Arsenal\u2019s area. Controversy beckons - but the danger passes when De Bruyne lashes a shot over from 25 yards. 27 min: A rare Arsenal attack sees Lacazette slip a pass through to Kolasinac on the left, but the Bosnian\u2019s cross is poor. 25 min: City have had 78% of the possession in the last 10 minutes. 23 min: De Bruyne slides a clever pass through to David Silva on the right. His cutback\u2019s knocked behind for a corner. Guendouzi is having a tough time tracking City\u2019s creative midfielders. There are too many for him to keep tabs on. 21 min: Arsenal are starting to look a bit more comfortable. But appearances can be deceptive. 18 min: City are continuing to attack in relentless waves. The corner\u2019s cleared to Sterling, who sees a weak volley cleared by Guendouzi. Walker puts the ball back into the area. It\u2019s headed down to Otamendi, who fires straight at Leno. He didn\u2019t catch it properly. 17 min: Laporte, who\u2019s playing a bit like Roberto Carlos, pings in another cross from the left. It leads to a corner. 15 min: De Bruyne darts down the right and lifts a cross to the far post, but it\u2019s too high for Sterling. City probe down the left and Sterling threatens to break clear, only for Torreira to deny him. \u201cI agree that Aguero and City have a point to prove,\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cAs a Liverpool fan, I hope that\u2019s all they get today. A point.\u201d 14 min: The scoreline is quite incredible. Arsenal barely had a kick in the first 10 minutes, but they\u2019ve equalised with their very first attack, which will do nothing to alter the impression City are becoming a soft touch at the back. The corner comes in from Lucas Torreira from the left. Monreal darts to the near post and flicks it into the six-yard box, where Koscileny powers through the bodies to head past Ederson from close range! What a response from Arsenal, who were looking on the verge of total collapse! As for City, it\u2019s another squandered lead. It probably didn\u2019t help that Sterling was marking Koscielny. Arsenal equalise after the longest 11 minutes in their entire history! 10 min: Arsenal mount their first attack, Iwobi making a nuisance of himself and working the ball to Aubameyang on the edge of the area. Aubameyang\u2019s hopeful pass hits Otamendi, deflects into the area and forces Walker to hack behind for a corner. From which... 9 min: Monreal gives away a free-kick for handball on the right. De Bruyne whips in a magnificent delivery and Laporte heads past Leno \u2013 but the flag\u2019s up for offside straight away. He was a yard or two off. 7 min: Gary Neville is losing the plot with Arsenal on Sky. Instead of a back three, it looks like they\u2019ve lined up in a 4-4-2 system, with Kolasinac and Iwobi in the wide midfield positions. Let\u2019s just be polite and say it isn\u2019t working. 5 min: Bernardo Silva has some fun down the right, dribbling inside, cutting on to his left and seeing a cross-shot deflected behind. Gundogan\u2019s corner is headed away as far as Sterling, 25 yards out. He takes a touch and lets fly, forcing Leno to dive to his left and beat the ball away to safety. The move fizzles out after a poor pass from Gundogan. 3 min: Arsenal are all over the place. Now De Bruyne pokes a pass through to Aguero, who\u2019s pulled back by the incompetent Mustafi. The German is very lucky not to concede a penalty. Arsenal need smelling salts. City could kill this here and now. Then again, Aguero did score after 24 seconds against Newcastle. It\u2019s fair to say Manchester City look like a team with a point to prove. They set about Arsenal immediately, Sterling and the Silvas causing havoc down the left, De Bruyne almost latching on to the ball in the six-yard box. Arsenal hack it clear, but they\u2019re under the cosh, and the last thing they need is for Iwobi to give the ball straight to Laporte deep on the left. Laporte steps in firmly, looks up and pings a cross into the middle for the unmarked Aguero to head past Leno from close range! Aguero scores after 50 seconds! Peep! Arsenal, in their famous red and white, get the game underway! And they\u2019ll be very interested to see Fernandinho lining up in a back four for Manchester City. What does that say about how Pep Guardiola regards John Stones? No time to think about that, though. Because... Here come the teams! We\u2019ll have football soon! \u201cAnother baffling team selection by Emery: he\u2019s left three of our most creative midfielders out of the team,\u201d Richard Arthur says. \u201cAnd Lichsteiner is completely past it, but Jenkinson does not even make the bench. Emery seems also to have lost faith in Xhaka lately. It\u2019s as if he has cards with the players\u2019 names on and just pulls them out of the bag. I hope he proves me wrong.\u201d I think the loss of Hector Bellerin makes a big difference to this Arsenal side. He was very good against Chelsea and they don\u2019t really have a proper replacement for him. Ultimately it doesn\u2019t seem that Emery rates a lot of these players; he needs a few windows to sort it out. Arsenal start in sixth place after Manchester United\u2019s win over Leicester. Stuart James was at the King Power Stadium. Unai Emery is asked about starting Aubameyang and Lacazette for the first time in an away game against a top-six rival. \u201cThey have played a lot of matches together. Sometimes you cannot play both strikers. I want to find the best individual performances from them to help the team.\u201d Pep Guardiola speaks! \u201cThe mentality is always good. It is not the first season together. They show up every time. They try to do their best. Sometimes you don\u2019t have a good performance but that is enough. The mentality is always there. We need an incredible performance. We are playing one of the top sides and they have a top manager. It is going to be tough. But I am always confident with my players.\u201d Does this title race remind anyone of the 94-95 season? Obviously the storylines are slightly different - I can\u2019t see anyone in Man City\u2019s squad kung-fu kicking a Crystal Palace fan. In terms of the football, though, United didn\u2019t do too much wrong that season, but a couple of dodgy results here and there were enough to let Blackburn take advantage and set up a big enough lead. United almost came back at the end and Blackburn, choked by nerves, only won two of their final six games. United probably would have won it if it had gone on for another week or two. Charles Antaki takes exception with my suggestion that \u201cCity will have to be at their sharpest\u201d - \u201cAh! Arsenal fans will be saying, if only. Given the success of not-especially-sharp forward lines of, say, West Ham, Brighton and Southampton, you might reasonably expect the Ag\u00fceros, Sanes and DeBruynes of this world to have a good deal of fun with a defence now down to the last three men standing. Sharpness, sadly, may not be necessary.\u201d Pep Guardiola picks a team that suggests he hasn\u2019t slept since Tuesday night. He\u2019s gone into ultra-Pep mode, going without any left-backs, picking five midfielders, both Silvas in, Gundogan too, De Bruyne too. It\u2019s a midfielder party. Could be inspired. Could be overkill. Only one way to find out. Arsenal, by contrast, are far more restrained. Unai Emery appears to have gone with a back three, but it\u2019s a relatively cautious line-up from the Spaniard. Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Ozil only make the bench, where they\u2019re joined by Denis Suarez after his loan move from Barcelona. Manchester City: Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Laporte; Fernandinho; Sterling, Gundogan, De Bruyne, D Silva, B Silva; Aguero. Subs: Muric, Danilo, Stones, Delph, Sane, Mahrez, Jesus. Arsenal: Leno; Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Lichtsteiner, Guendouzi, Torreira, Kolasinac; Iwobi; Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Cech, Elneny, Xhaka, Suarez, Ramsey, Ozil, Mavropanos, Nketiah. Referee: Martin Atkinson. Hello. For all the talk of Liverpool showing the first signs of losing their nerve in the past few days, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the situation is far more precarious for Manchester City at the moment. While Liverpool didn\u2019t play very well against Leicester on Wednesday night, the real story of the week was yet another damaging defeat for City, who fell further behind the Premier League\u2019s pacesetters after contriving to chuck away a lead against Newcastle. The heat on the champions is increasing. Inconsistency threatens to loosen their grip on the title, leaving them with little room for manoeuvre as they attempt to make Liverpool sweat about bringing the title to Anfield for the first time since 1990. If losing to Chelsea at the start of December was unfortunate - even Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Chelsea - then following it up by falling to Crystal Palace, Leicester and Newcastle was downright careless. It\u2019s enough to make you want to refer to Pep Guardiola as ... BALD FRAUDIOLA. Too much? Probably. Yet these are difficult times for Guardiola, with his team just lacking that crucial extra yard, that vital extra spark of intensity and inspiration, and now City find themselves in a position where almost every game is a must-win. They can\u2019t wait for Liverpool to wobble; they have to do all they can to force it by going on a long winning run, which needs to start against Arsenal today. For the past two months many people have said that City are too good not to win this catch-up, that they are bound to reel Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side in eventually. But it isn\u2019t going to happen if they continue to stumble here and there. They have to be at full throttle every week now. It won\u2019t be easy. By mid-March City will have met Chelsea in the League Cup final, face Schalke in the last 16 of the Champions League, have an FA Cup weekend and travel to Old Trafford for a derby with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s rejuvenated Manchester United in the league. But who look that far ahead when the next week sees Guardiola\u2019s side travel to Goodison Park on Wednesday and host Chelsea next Sunday? The games are coming thick and fast, testing desire and stamina, and before all that first City have to deal with Arsenal, who have come a long way since losing to Guardiola\u2019s side on the opening day of the season. No doubt things have changed since 12 August. Back then City looked dead certs to retain their title, sweeping a new-look Arsenal aside with impeccable ease. Yet Unai Emery has started to make his presence felt in the post-Wenger era. Arsenal remain a little fragile at the back, a little open in midfield, a little unreliable in attack at times, and there have been plenty of days when it hasn\u2019t been easy to work out Emery\u2019s plan. There have been a lot of lost first halves. But if you\u2019re looking for progress, ignore how Arsenal reverted to type as they were picked off on the counterattack by United in the FA Cup last weekend and focus instead on stirring home wins over Chelsea and Tottenham in the league. Emery\u2019s men are three points off fourth-placed Chelsea and, with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in scorching form, City will have to be at their sharpest. The opportunity is there to go two points behind Liverpool, who visit West Ham tomorrow night. City can\u2019t afford to pass it up. Kick-off: 4.30pm.",

The principle that intellectual property rules cannot automatically outweigh health considerations is well established, and not only in public opinion; it is recognised in the WTO\u2019s Doha declaration of 2001. Mr Hancock should heed the campaigners\u2019 call. The hopes raised by this powerful drug should not be dashed. If crown use sent a broader message on acceptable pricing, all the better.",

They have scored at least twice in every home match this season and would dearly appreciate a favour from West Ham when the leaders play in London on Monday.</p> \n<p>Ag\u00fcero\u2019s performance, comprising the 217th, 218th and 219th goals of his City career, certainly warranted the crowd\u2019s acclaim when Guardiola replaced him with Gabriel Jesus at the 80-minute mark.</p> \n<p>The Argentinian had scored after only 24 seconds in City\u2019s previous game at Newcastle. This time his first one was timed at 46 seconds and, unlike the trip to St James\u2019 Park, there could be no accusation of City\u2019s players looking bored with their own brilliance \u2013 or the word that every elite manager despises: complacency.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/manchester-city-arsenal-player-ratings-sergio-aguero\">Manchester City v Arsenal: player ratings | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The visitors did toy with the idea of making a fist of it after Laurent Koscielny had surprised everyone, perhaps even Arsenal themselves, by scoring with an 11th-minute header. Unai Emery and his players were aggrieved that Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hat-trick goal was not ruled out for handball. Yet they will also know it could well have been a more emphatic victory for City on the balance of play. Ag\u00fcero had restored City\u2019s lead late in the first half and the home side\u2019s domination after the break was a reminder that Liverpool will have to play exceptionally well to shake them off between now and May. In the second half City managed 13 attempts at goal, Arsenal zero.</p> \n<p>Not that this was a lopsided display from the winning team. Right from the start City seemed intent on getting the defeat at Newcastle out of their system. Guardiola\u2019s side love to take early control, to worry their opponents from the first whistle, and it resulted here in one of their defenders, Aymeric Laporte, venturing forward to dispossess Alex Iwobi on the edge of Arsenal\u2019s penalty area and set up the opening goal. Ag\u00fcero, alert as ever, was waiting for the cross, twisting his body to direct a stooping header past Bernd Leno, the goalkeeper.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b67ded275876b9e5c64e5ad9600213e79ebb033d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b67ded275876b9e5c64e5ad9600213e79ebb033d/3_0_3326_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ag\u00fcero looks on as the ball trickles over the line for his third goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ag\u00fcero looks on as the ball trickles over the line for his third goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For a while it looked as though Arsenal would be overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of City\u2019s early pressure. All of which made it surprising, to say the least, when the away team emerged from the onslaught to equalise. Lucas Torreira whipped a corner over, Nacho Monreal won the first header and Koscielny had broken away from Raheem Sterling \u2013 a strange choice of marker \u2013 to score with the next one.</p> \n<p>The corner, the flick-on and the back-post finish \u2013 and, for City, the slightly worrying statistic that exactly half of the 20 goals they have conceded in the league this season have come from set plays. It is the highest percentage in the top division and something, presumably, that not just Emery will have noted among opposition managers.</p> \n<p>For Guardiola a little insecurity at the back is the downside, perhaps, of being so attack-minded \u2013 they set up here with Fernandinho operating as both a midfielder and auxiliary centre-half. When City were going forward, Laporte and Kyle Walker both had carte blanche to break out of defence and spread play by moving wide and morphing into attacking full-backs.</p> \n<p>Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was sometimes the only player left back, with Fernandinho drifting between his two positions and often joining Ilkay G\u00fcndogan in midfield. Ahead of them, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva had Sterling and Bernardo Silva operating either side of Ag\u00fcero. It was a formidable lineup, albeit one that occasionally threatened to leave City open to the counterattack.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For that to happen, however, Arsenal needed to get the ball first. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second goal came from close range after a lovely exchange of passes involving Sterling and G\u00fcndogan and the striker dived in to complete his hat-trick just after the hour.</p> \n<p>Again it was Sterling playing the decisive pass across the six-yard area. Arsenal\u2019s players gathered round the referee, Martin Atkinson, to protest that it was handball but Ag\u00fcero was already wheeling away, with that familiar smile, the arm raised and the guarantee of another ball for his personal collection.</p>",

For Arsenal it has been a long time since they held that information for themselves and they have fallen to sixth position. City, in contrast, have moved within two points of Liverpool. They have scored at least twice in every home match this season and would dearly appreciate a favour from West Ham when the leaders play in London on Monday. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s performance, comprising the 217th, 218th and 219th goals of his City career, certainly warranted the crowd\u2019s acclaim when Guardiola replaced him with Gabriel Jesus at the 80-minute mark. The Argentinian had scored after only 24 seconds in City\u2019s previous game at Newcastle. This time his first one was timed at 46 seconds and, unlike the trip to St James\u2019 Park, there could be no accusation of City\u2019s players looking bored with their own brilliance \u2013 or the word that every elite manager despises: complacency. The visitors did toy with the idea of making a fist of it after Laurent Koscielny had surprised everyone, perhaps even Arsenal themselves, by scoring with an 11th-minute header. Unai Emery and his players were aggrieved that Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hat-trick goal was not ruled out for handball. Yet they will also know it could well have been a more emphatic victory for City on the balance of play. Ag\u00fcero had restored City\u2019s lead late in the first half and the home side\u2019s domination after the break was a reminder that Liverpool will have to play exceptionally well to shake them off between now and May. In the second half City managed 13 attempts at goal, Arsenal zero. Not that this was a lopsided display from the winning team. Right from the start City seemed intent on getting the defeat at Newcastle out of their system. Guardiola\u2019s side love to take early control, to worry their opponents from the first whistle, and it resulted here in one of their defenders, Aymeric Laporte, venturing forward to dispossess Alex Iwobi on the edge of Arsenal\u2019s penalty area and set up the opening goal. Ag\u00fcero, alert as ever, was waiting for the cross, twisting his body to direct a stooping header past Bernd Leno, the goalkeeper. For a while it looked as though Arsenal would be overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of City\u2019s early pressure. All of which made it surprising, to say the least, when the away team emerged from the onslaught to equalise. Lucas Torreira whipped a corner over, Nacho Monreal won the first header and Koscielny had broken away from Raheem Sterling \u2013 a strange choice of marker \u2013 to score with the next one. The corner, the flick-on and the back-post finish \u2013 and, for City, the slightly worrying statistic that exactly half of the 20 goals they have conceded in the league this season have come from set plays. It is the highest percentage in the top division and something, presumably, that not just Emery will have noted among opposition managers. For Guardiola a little insecurity at the back is the downside, perhaps, of being so attack-minded \u2013 they set up here with Fernandinho operating as both a midfielder and auxiliary centre-half. When City were going forward, Laporte and Kyle Walker both had carte blanche to break out of defence and spread play by moving wide and morphing into attacking full-backs. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was sometimes the only player left back, with Fernandinho drifting between his two positions and often joining Ilkay G\u00fcndogan in midfield. Ahead of them, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva had Sterling and Bernardo Silva operating either side of Ag\u00fcero. It was a formidable lineup, albeit one that occasionally threatened to leave City open to the counterattack. For that to happen, however, Arsenal needed to get the ball first. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second goal came from close range after a lovely exchange of passes involving Sterling and G\u00fcndogan and the striker dived in to complete his hat-trick just after the hour. Again it was Sterling playing the decisive pass across the six-yard area. Arsenal\u2019s players gathered round the referee, Martin Atkinson, to protest that it was handball but Ag\u00fcero was already wheeling away, with that familiar smile, the arm raised and the guarantee of another ball for his personal collection.",

There are 212 beds for rough sleepers this winter, including 39 beds funded by the temporary rough sleeper initiative, and a new multi-agency hub getting people off the streets more quickly. From next winter, we aim to create a new assessment centre that will provide winter-long emergency accommodation for rough sleepers.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics says the average age of death for a homeless person is 44 for men and 42 for women, compared with 76 and 81 in the general population. But nobody needs to die on the streets in Oxford during periods of freezing winter weather, when we activate our severe weather emergency protocol and offer emergency beds to any rough sleeper in our city.</p> <p>It is right to highlight the lack of drug, alcohol and mental health support that many rough sleepers need to successfully rebuild their lives, and this is a direct consequence of austerity. Since 2010, Oxfordshire county council has had to make more than \u00a3300m in cuts that include many of these services \u2013 and the consequences are all too evident on our streets.

Sharron was a bright, lively and sensitive girl. She was a keen cyclist and an all-round athlete.

      "bodyText": "Nobody should have to sleep rough in Oxford (Report, 1 February), and Oxford city council and our partners \u2013 including Homeless Oxfordshire \u2013 are doing more than ever to provide accommodation and support. There are 212 beds for rough sleepers this winter, including 39 beds funded by the temporary rough sleeper initiative, and a new multi-agency hub getting people off the streets more quickly. From next winter, we aim to create a new assessment centre that will provide winter-long emergency accommodation for rough sleepers. The Office for National Statistics says the average age of death for a homeless person is 44 for men and 42 for women, compared with 76 and 81 in the general population. But nobody needs to die on the streets in Oxford during periods of freezing winter weather, when we activate our severe weather emergency protocol and offer emergency beds to any rough sleeper in our city. It is right to highlight the lack of drug, alcohol and mental health support that many rough sleepers need to successfully rebuild their lives, and this is a direct consequence of austerity. Since 2010, Oxfordshire county council has had to make more than \u00a3300m in cuts that include many of these services \u2013 and the consequences are all too evident on our streets. It is a vicious cycle, as it takes more than a roof to end homelessness, and people remain on the streets because of the lack of other support needed to engage with us and come inside. Councillor Linda Smith Deputy leader Oxford city council and board member for leisure and housing \u2022 The death of Sharron Maasz, though the subject of a coroner\u2019s inquest, would probably otherwise have passed unnoticed. I knew Sharron well. I taught her when I was head of her middle school. Her father, a single parent, was a friend and was for a number of years a governor. Sharron was a bright, lively and sensitive girl. She was a keen cyclist and an all-round athlete. This may be her only obituary. She is quoted as saying: \u201cI just want to get my life sorted \u2026 I always wanted to get clean.\u201d She didn\u2019t get sorted or clean. Instead, she died in a short-term home, a last refuge provided for those in desperate need. She had been living alone on the freezing streets of our leading university city. I do not have solutions. I only know that the dreams that Sharron, a lovely child, had until her death, have perished in the wreckage of an austerity programme that has literally killed her and her like.

We discovered, when challenging the closure of High Peak magistrates court, that we were \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d. It\u2019s hard campaigning to keep such a service because, as her article concludes, it is \u201cone of the dangers voters care least about\u201d. Most people don\u2019t expect to have to appear in court, so why commit to save it?</p> <p>Interestingly she highlights the small amount raised so far in selling off the buildings. The Buxton court is still empty as it belongs to Derbyshire county council. Underused courts as mentioned in the article, are clearly the knock-on effects of the staffing cuts she also highlighted. Magistrates have to travel further, increasing travel costs, and some have retired early as a result. Cheap is not cheerful nor justice.<br><strong>Christine Walters</strong><br><em>Retired magistrate, Buxton</em></p> <p>\u2022 Government justice policy needs to be called out for what it is: a further concerted attack on the poor. The government does not appear to collect information regarding the social class of those in our criminal courts, but a trip there will leave you in little doubt. The cuts to legal aid removed one of the vital checks and balances in a system already weighted against the disadvantaged. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, for this government, offenders are the \u201cundeserving poor\u201d so why waste money on them?<br><strong>Peter Jeffries</strong><br><em>Canterbury</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

Diane Astin Brunel University, Uxbridge \u2022 Afua Hirsch (If it\u2019s done on the cheap, it\u2019s not justice, 30 January) hits several nails on the head regarding court closures. We discovered, when challenging the closure of High Peak magistrates court, that we were \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d. It\u2019s hard campaigning to keep such a service because, as her article concludes, it is \u201cone of the dangers voters care least about\u201d. Most people don\u2019t expect to have to appear in court, so why commit to save it? Interestingly she highlights the small amount raised so far in selling off the buildings. The Buxton court is still empty as it belongs to Derbyshire county council. Underused courts as mentioned in the article, are clearly the knock-on effects of the staffing cuts she also highlighted. Magistrates have to travel further, increasing travel costs, and some have retired early as a result. Cheap is not cheerful nor justice. Christine Walters Retired magistrate, Buxton \u2022 Government justice policy needs to be called out for what it is: a further concerted attack on the poor. The government does not appear to collect information regarding the social class of those in our criminal courts, but a trip there will leave you in little doubt. The cuts to legal aid removed one of the vital checks and balances in a system already weighted against the disadvantaged. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, for this government, offenders are the \u201cundeserving poor\u201d so why waste money on them?

      "bodyText": "Trevor Bayliss held a crisis meeting with his England players on Sunday after a defeat by West Indies that he described as a \u201cshock to the system\u201d. The head coach, however, has also accepted his mantra of positivity may have led to a blurring of the lines between how the Test and one-day teams approach their batting. In the aftermath of England\u2019s 10-wicket loss here \u2013 a three-day mauling that once again highlighted the fragility of their lineup and saw the series lost with one to play \u2013 Bayliss set his players a series of questions to be ruminated on overnight by individuals, before sharing their answers at the team hotel 24 hours later. England, perhaps expecting the slow, low pitches in the Caribbean on which the Lions were beaten 3-0 last year, have been blown away by a relentless four-man West Indies pace attack across two Tests, losing a wicket every 32 balls. Joe Root, the captain, has 40 runs to show from four innings and Jonny Bairstow is their leading scorer with 108 \u2013 less than half that of Jason Holder\u2019s aggregate of 229 from No 8. The die almost felt cast at the end of day two in Antigua when Stuart Broad (admittedly no batsman these days) said England would need to \u201cmove the game on\u201d in their second innings. The result was 132 all out in 42.1 overs, nearly half the time a largely shotless Darren Bravo alone spent grinding his way to 50 from 219 balls across 78.2 overs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seemed to have the will to fight,\u201d said Bayliss, under whom England have now lost 23 Tests, as many as they have won. \u201cThere\u2019s been some very loose shots and other guys have been very tentative.

Pleasant has the genetic mutation that is targeted by Orkambi, a new type of drug called a CFTR modulator that for the first time works on the underlying causes of the disease, rather than the symptoms. That\u2019s a huge breakthrough.</p> \n<p>Orkambi represents hope for 40% of the 10,400 people with cystic fibrosis in the UK who have the same genetic fault as Pleasant. But they cannot have it on the NHS, because Vertex, the US-based manufacturer, wants more than \u00a3100,000 per patient per year for a drug that must be taken for life. NHS England says that is unaffordable.</p> \n<p>People with cystic fibrosis have faulty genes that stop production of a protein governing the movement of salt and water between cells. It causes a build-up of mucus in the lungs, meaning it is hard for them to breathe and they are susceptible to infections.</p> \n<p>\u201cWinter is obviously extremely hard,\u201d said Pleasant, who woke in the night feeling unwell and worried that she was heading back to hospital. In October she spent three weeks in isolation, cared for by staff in gowns and gloves and masks, with intravenous lines from elbow to chest to pump her full of heavy-duty antibiotics. Cystic fibrosis patients get multi-drug-resistant infections.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed out without being escorted by a CF nurse in case we meet other CF patients. We are so dangerous to be around each other. It\u2019s lonely.

The underlying issues are the same \u2013 new, innovative drugs are launched at sky-high prices that pharmaceutical companies claim are necessary to recoup their costs, but healthcare providers and patients say they cannot afford.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How can a drug be so expensive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The drugs with the highest price tags are often those for which there are fewer patients, so less profit to be made.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/cystic-fibrosis\">Cystic fibrosis</a>&nbsp;is a rare disease, affecting 10,400 people in the UK, where the genetic fault is most common, and about 100,000 worldwide.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/science/drugs\">Drugs</a>&nbsp;that cure a disease may be more expensive than those that have to be taken for many years.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does the NHS try to control the cost of drugs?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2017, the NHS drugs bill was \u00a316bn and rising at 7% a year. The NHS has actively tried to keep costs down by bringing in an appraisal mechanism, run by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), to ensure only drugs that are value for money are used. This has effectively capped and reduced drug prices.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has that effort been successful in the past?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The biggest pharmaceutical companies are multinational and all of them look to world markets, making it more difficult to secure price reductions. But the NHS has been relatively successful in negotiating prices down. Cancer drug Kadcyla arrived in 2015 priced at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/2016/dec/29/breast-cancer-drug-kadcyla-rejected-for-nhs-use-on-cost-benefit-grounds\">\u00a390,000 per patient</a>&nbsp;per year.

She calls it \u201can immoral and unbearable situation\u201d. She is one of the parents who have signed a letter to the prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, calling for the government to override Vertex\u2019s patent and allow cheaper generic versions of the drug to be made.</p> \n<p>She is also one of those behind <a href=\"https://www.cfsupportgroup.org/letter-to-jeffrey-leiden\">a letter sent to the CEO of Vertex, Dr Jeff Leiden</a>, earlier this week, calling on him to \u201cend the threat to life from cystic fibrosis worldwide\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was contacted by a Polish parent desperate for Orkambi; she told me Vertex has not applied to the authorities in Poland,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed220b8098923eaeefefd1b2497944df47bbf59c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed220b8098923eaeefefd1b2497944df47bbf59c/0_0_2780_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vertex headquarters in Boston, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vertex headquarters in Boston, US.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAt the same time I discovered that both Kalydeco (ivacaftor, which can help only 5% of patients) and Orkambi (ivacaftor with lumacaftor) remain unavailable in New Zealand. I know that in the US, where the company developed the drugs, patients struggle with affordability due to the level of co-pays [the excess demanded by insurers]. The situation is tragic because these are the first and only drugs to tackle the root cause of CF, extending the lives of people with the cruel, genetic condition. I watch my son suffer daily and know that he will only get worse as his disease progresses without access to modulator drugs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vertex, which declined to discuss the pricing controversy with the Guardian, replied to the parents pledging its \u201cunwavering commitment to ensuring broad and timely access to the life-changing cystic fibrosis medicines that we have already discovered and developed in our research labs and the new ones that are on their way\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are at a pivotal moment for the global CF community. Within a few years, with continued investment and research, we hope to offer life-changing treatments for 90% of people with CF,\u201d wrote CEO Jeff Leiden. Vertex had \u201cembarked on a hugely ambitious program of investment and research, with no guarantee of success\u201d 20 years ago and had reinvested nearly 70% of its profits in the last five years. \u201cHowever, our work in CF is not done and we need to continue to invest at very high levels if we are to achieve our goal of developing such medicines for the 90% of CF patients we think we can help.</p> \n<p>\u201cVertex shares the responsibility with governments and regulators to do all that we can to agree to a fair price that reflects the value of these medicines in all countries where they are needed \u2026 importantly, in the countries where access is still not agreed, our position is always the same \u2013 we are doing everything we can to work constructively with the government authorities to find workable solutions.\u201d </p> \n<p>In the US, Juliana Keeping has a son with cystic fibrosis, six-year-old Eli, who she says \u201cis doing very well. He\u2019s in kindergarten, he loves pizza and Lego\u201d. Eli has been taking Orkambi for the last two weeks, paid for by their health insurance.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy hope is that it staves off the decline that happens with cystic fibrosis,\u201d she said. She wants him to gain more weight and get a little taller and \u201crecover from colds on his own instead of needing antibiotics\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/nhs-england-ban-gps-advertising-private-services\">NHS England to ban GPs from advertising private services</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The future looks good as long as they have insurance and can meet the extra costs of these drugs, but <a href=\"https://www.patientsforaffordabledrugs.org/2018/05/17/cystic-fibrosis-community/\">Keeping is campaigning </a>for the many who cannot afford Orkambi. \u201cI admire the science behind these medications. We are grateful that the company is making them. But they brought the drug to market basically at the same price as a mortgage on a home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her friend Laura Moser, from Texas, was on Orkambi, but has had to stop it because she cannot afford the co-pay her husband\u2019s insurance requires. Yet Moser\u2019s parents worked throughout her childhood to raise money for research that helped fund the development of these drugs \u2013 she estimates they raised $750,000 over her lifetime.</p> \n<p>Vertex did not pay for the earliest research. Much of the money came from donations to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the US \u2013 from parents of affected children such as the Mosers \u2013 and from the federally funded National Institutes of Health. Vertex bought the patents for $3.3bn. It has already made nearly that amount back from sales.</p> \n<p>Concerns about the ethics of setting such high prices were aired as early as 2012, when the first drug, Kalydeco, came to market at $294,000 (\u00a3257,000) a year. A group of 24 US doctors and researchers involved in the development of the drug wrote to Vertex\u2019s CEO.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have invested our lives and careers toward the success of these inspiring therapeutic agents. We also write with feelings of dismay and disappointment that the triumph and honor that should be yours is diminished by the unconscionable price assigned to Kalydeco,\u201d they said in their letter.</p> \n<p>The UK campaigners calling on the government to set aside Vertex\u2019s patent and allow cheaper generic production of these drugs argue that the company did not take all the risk and has already made substantial profits. \u201cBy June of last year Vertex had accrued $2.8bn in cash and cash equivalents,\u201d they say in their briefing for the government. \u201cAnalysts conservatively estimate they will generate profits of $13bn on Orkambi and another related drug, Kalydeco, alone.</p> \n<p>\u201cTens of thousands of patients in over dozens of countries around the world are currently without access to this important medicine as the company hold out for the highest possible price.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Ramsden, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said that in Monday\u2019s debate, \u201cthe government will have the opportunity to demonstrate how seriously it has considered all options at its disposal to achieve access to life-changing medicines for thousands of people with cystic fibrosis. They and their families are desperate for progress and despair at all those responsible for failing to deliver a deal. The wait must end!\u201d</p>",

That\u2019s a huge breakthrough. Orkambi represents hope for 40% of the 10,400 people with cystic fibrosis in the UK who have the same genetic fault as Pleasant. But they cannot have it on the NHS, because Vertex, the US-based manufacturer, wants more than \u00a3100,000 per patient per year for a drug that must be taken for life. NHS England says that is unaffordable. People with cystic fibrosis have faulty genes that stop production of a protein governing the movement of salt and water between cells. It causes a build-up of mucus in the lungs, meaning it is hard for them to breathe and they are susceptible to infections. \u201cWinter is obviously extremely hard,\u201d said Pleasant, who woke in the night feeling unwell and worried that she was heading back to hospital. In October she spent three weeks in isolation, cared for by staff in gowns and gloves and masks, with intravenous lines from elbow to chest to pump her full of heavy-duty antibiotics. Cystic fibrosis patients get multi-drug-resistant infections. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed out without being escorted by a CF nurse in case we meet other CF patients. We are so dangerous to be around each other. It\u2019s lonely. It\u2019s scary.\u201d Orkambi is not a cure, but it offers stability, she says. \u201cI will be able to keep well and get stronger instead of trying to fight the inevitable decline.\u201d Christina Walker is fighting for Orkambi for her eight-year-old son, Luis, who this week was off school again with an infection. She calls it \u201can immoral and unbearable situation\u201d. She is one of the parents who have signed a letter to the prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, calling for the government to override Vertex\u2019s patent and allow cheaper generic versions of the drug to be made. She is also one of those behind a letter sent to the CEO of Vertex, Dr Jeff Leiden, earlier this week, calling on him to \u201cend the threat to life from cystic fibrosis worldwide\u201d. \u201cI was contacted by a Polish parent desperate for Orkambi; she told me Vertex has not applied to the authorities in Poland,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time I discovered that both Kalydeco (ivacaftor, which can help only 5% of patients) and Orkambi (ivacaftor with lumacaftor) remain unavailable in New Zealand. I know that in the US, where the company developed the drugs, patients struggle with affordability due to the level of co-pays [the excess demanded by insurers]. The situation is tragic because these are the first and only drugs to tackle the root cause of CF, extending the lives of people with the cruel, genetic condition. I watch my son suffer daily and know that he will only get worse as his disease progresses without access to modulator drugs.\u201d Vertex, which declined to discuss the pricing controversy with the Guardian, replied to the parents pledging its \u201cunwavering commitment to ensuring broad and timely access to the life-changing cystic fibrosis medicines that we have already discovered and developed in our research labs and the new ones that are on their way\u201d. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment for the global CF community. Within a few years, with continued investment and research, we hope to offer life-changing treatments for 90% of people with CF,\u201d wrote CEO Jeff Leiden. Vertex had \u201cembarked on a hugely ambitious program of investment and research, with no guarantee of success\u201d 20 years ago and had reinvested nearly 70% of its profits in the last five years. \u201cHowever, our work in CF is not done and we need to continue to invest at very high levels if we are to achieve our goal of developing such medicines for the 90% of CF patients we think we can help. \u201cVertex shares the responsibility with governments and regulators to do all that we can to agree to a fair price that reflects the value of these medicines in all countries where they are needed \u2026 importantly, in the countries where access is still not agreed, our position is always the same \u2013 we are doing everything we can to work constructively with the government authorities to find workable solutions.\u201d In the US, Juliana Keeping has a son with cystic fibrosis, six-year-old Eli, who she says \u201cis doing very well. He\u2019s in kindergarten, he loves pizza and Lego\u201d. Eli has been taking Orkambi for the last two weeks, paid for by their health insurance. \u201cMy hope is that it staves off the decline that happens with cystic fibrosis,\u201d she said. She wants him to gain more weight and get a little taller and \u201crecover from colds on his own instead of needing antibiotics\u201d. The future looks good as long as they have insurance and can meet the extra costs of these drugs, but Keeping is campaigning for the many who cannot afford Orkambi. \u201cI admire the science behind these medications. We are grateful that the company is making them. But they brought the drug to market basically at the same price as a mortgage on a home.\u201d Her friend Laura Moser, from Texas, was on Orkambi, but has had to stop it because she cannot afford the co-pay her husband\u2019s insurance requires. Yet Moser\u2019s parents worked throughout her childhood to raise money for research that helped fund the development of these drugs \u2013 she estimates they raised $750,000 over her lifetime. Vertex did not pay for the earliest research. Much of the money came from donations to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the US \u2013 from parents of affected children such as the Mosers \u2013 and from the federally funded National Institutes of Health. Vertex bought the patents for $3.3bn. It has already made nearly that amount back from sales. Concerns about the ethics of setting such high prices were aired as early as 2012, when the first drug, Kalydeco, came to market at $294,000 (\u00a3257,000) a year. A group of 24 US doctors and researchers involved in the development of the drug wrote to Vertex\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe have invested our lives and careers toward the success of these inspiring therapeutic agents. We also write with feelings of dismay and disappointment that the triumph and honor that should be yours is diminished by the unconscionable price assigned to Kalydeco,\u201d they said in their letter. The UK campaigners calling on the government to set aside Vertex\u2019s patent and allow cheaper generic production of these drugs argue that the company did not take all the risk and has already made substantial profits. \u201cBy June of last year Vertex had accrued $2.8bn in cash and cash equivalents,\u201d they say in their briefing for the government. \u201cAnalysts conservatively estimate they will generate profits of $13bn on Orkambi and another related drug, Kalydeco, alone. \u201cTens of thousands of patients in over dozens of countries around the world are currently without access to this important medicine as the company hold out for the highest possible price.\u201d David Ramsden, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said that in Monday\u2019s debate, \u201cthe government will have the opportunity to demonstrate how seriously it has considered all options at its disposal to achieve access to life-changing medicines for thousands of people with cystic fibrosis. They and their families are desperate for progress and despair at all those responsible for failing to deliver a deal. The wait must end!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition politician leading the push to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has urged one of the Venezuelan president\u2019s key international backers, China, to abandon him. His remark comes after Beijing said it hoped to continue working with Caracas \u201cno matter how the situation evolves\u201d, suggesting China was now preparing for a future without Maduro. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Guaid\u00f3 said China, which under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez became Venezuela\u2019s biggest foreign creditor, had \u201cextraordinary potential\u201d to help rebuild his economically stricken nation. \u201cMaduro is increasingly isolated and is largely acting alone,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said, calling China \u201ca fundamental global player with whom we would like to relaunch our relationship\u201d. He added that Beijing had seen up close Maduro\u2019s \u201cplundering of our state resources\u201d. Last month Guaid\u00f3 declared himself Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president, a move recognised by Washington and others. His comments come after China\u2019s foreign ministry, which officially continues to back Maduro, hinted its support for the president may not be everlasting. \u201cNo matter how the situation evolves, China-Venezuela cooperation should not be undermined,\u201d a spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters on Friday on the eve of the latest round of mass protests in Venezuela against Maduro. China is estimated to have given Venezuela up to $62bn (\u00a347bn) of loans since 2007 in an attempt to secure oil resources, construction contracts and a geopolitical foothold in a region the US has long considered its \u201cbackyard\u201d. Experts believe that, to Beijing\u2019s exasperation, almost half has yet to be repaid. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, Li Baorong, congratulated Maduro on his new term at a function in a Caracas hotel last month and said China opposed \u201chegemonism and interventionism\u201d. \u201cWe insist on our policy of non-interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs,\u201d he said. Venezuela\u2019s vice-president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, thanked Li and China for standing against Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cimperial madness\u201d, adding: \u201cAll the oil China needs, Venezuela has.\u201d But Margaret Myers, the director of the China and Latin America programme at the US-based thinktank Inter-American Dialogue, said Beijing had become increasing aware the situation in Venezuela was \u201cunsustainable\u201d and it was unlikely to mourn Maduro\u2019s political passing, if it came. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any love lost over Maduro. They find the relationship to be a very challenging one,\u201d she said, pointing to increased contact between Chinese officials and Venezuela\u2019s opposition since Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 2013 death. \u201cMy sense is that the Chinese government, although they would never say so, is hoping for a quick resolution to this and even for a new leadership that would be perhaps a better partner, even if it is an opposition one.\u201d Myers added: \u201cThe Chinese relationship with Venezuela is a very opportunistic and pragmatic one \u2026 They are not in any way tied to working with chavistas. They don\u2019t have an ideological preference here. It is more a matter of maintaining stability and maintaining strong ties and working with whatever new government to ensure some form of payment for the loans they have distributed so far.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told the Sunday Morning Post he also hoped to work with Beijing: \u201cWe are ready to begin a constructive relationship and dialogue with China as soon as possible.\u201d On Sunday, protesters who poured on to the country\u2019s streets the previous day expressed optimism that their campaign to force out Maduro was advancing. Sol Castro S\u00e1nchez, a retired university professor, said: \u201cIt is always very encouraging to know that \u2026 there are still people coming out and protesting their refusal to live under these conditions. The people are fed up. They are sick and tired of living like this.\u201d But there are also fears the political crisis could descend into conflict. In an interview with CBS broadcast on Sunday, Trump repeated his assertion that a US military intervention was possible if Maduro refused to budge. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s something that\u2019s on the \u2013 \u2026 it\u2019s an option.\u201d Such threats have stirred fears over the potential for a proxy war in Venezuela, pitting China or Russia against the US. \u201cThe Republic [of Venezuela] stands at the gates of a suicidal war \u2026 The situation is extreme. We are in the pre-war phase,\u201d wrote the columnist F\u00e9lix Cordero Peraza in El Universal newspaper. Myers said she thought Beijing was unlikely to become embroiled in a confrontation with the Trump administration over the country. \u201cIf there was interest in getting into a toss-up or conflict over Venezuela with the US, we would see far more aggressive actions or statements on the part of China. And we haven\u2019t seen that thus far \u2026 I don\u2019t think they are interested in ruffling US feathers,\u201d she said.",

Some who voted against, such as John Mann, have been talking to Theresa May\u2019s government about a Brexit deal that could mean extra funding for their constituencies via a national renewal fund.

Over the weekend, speculation resumed that half a dozen Labour MPs could quit and form a breakaway group at Westminster, with the persistent Corbyn critics Angela Smith, Chris Leslie and Berger named as among those likely to be involved. Those familiar with the group\u2019s thinking said there were no immediate plans to announce a split from Labour \u2013 although one said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dismiss the possibility either\u201d \u2013 and the immediate focus remained to oppose Brexit. Sources close to the Labour leadership said they were not taking the threat of a centre party seriously, adding: \u201cA new party to protect the status quo will rightly be seen as an establishment stitch-up.\u201d Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said on Sunday that Labour MPs such as Mann were being selfish in trying to negotiate special deals for mining constituencies such as theirs, as he sought to smooth over the party\u2019s Brexit divisions.

Gardiner said he supported a soft Brexit, adding: \u201cWe are trying to deliver in a way that does minimal damage.\u201d There has been growing unease in some quarters of the parliamentary Labour party that by not immediately disciplining MPs who voted against or abstained on the Cooper amendment, the party\u2019s leadership is tacitly allowing a small group of rebels to support any revised Brexit deal from the prime minister. May is also gearing up to offer legislation to ensure workers rights and protections are not reduced below EU levels after Brexit.

I didn\u2019t want to deprive him of the opportunity to take to the field and I know he wanted to do something special for his mum. Credit to him. I felt it personally when I got the news.

Trevor Bayliss himself acknowledges the proliferation of natural No 6s in the team. The solution is trickier. They cannot find an efficient top order. The openers rotate as if operated by a pinball wizard. The blunt figures suggest that Jonny Bairstow has been a modest success at three \u2013 in three matches he averages 38.33 there as opposed to 37.29 in all Test cricket \u2013 yet it is no secret that he does not really want to bat there. Nor does Root.</p> \n<p>Nor do any of the other natural sixes. Perhaps there will be further experimentation in St Lucia \u2013 especially if Ben Foakes is unfit. It may be that Jos Buttler, originally recalled as a novel No 7, will be elevated but such a move stems from a certain desperation: he is willing; in a selfless way he is prepared to give it a try but it is a bit like playing Raheem Sterling at centre-half. Buttler, Ben Stokes and Bairstow are all more dangerous when they have the freedom to attack.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The frustration is the lack of young alternatives queuing up to grab a place in the team at the top of the order and this situation is unlikely to change.

Holder explained afterwards. \u201cIt took a lot of heart for him [Joseph] to be on the field. A lot of people would not be able to do that. It was up to him. I didn\u2019t want to deprive him of the opportunity to take to the field and I know he wanted to do something special for his mum. Credit to him. I felt it personally when I got the news. To see him in tears in the morning was even harder. When we came together in the huddle we just wanted to do it for him, to dedicate the day to him and his mum and also to his family. He\u2019s a champion.\u201d For Root the optimism generated by the trip to Sri Lanka has been swept away in the space of seven days. In Barbados England picked a team that would have been described as \u201cbrave\u201d by Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister, an adjective that sent shivers down the spine of his boss. In fact, having Sam Curran and Adil Rashid as their fourth and fifth bowlers was more foolhardy than brave. But the main issue has been England\u2019s lamentable batting. It has not helped that Root has been runless; in Antigua he was probably blameless as well since he was the recipient of nasty deliveries in both innings. \u201cCut off the head and the rest will follow,\u201d was the mantra of the old West Indies side and England are desperately fragile if their captain is not scoring runs. Anyone can identify the problem. Trevor Bayliss himself acknowledges the proliferation of natural No 6s in the team. The solution is trickier. They cannot find an efficient top order. The openers rotate as if operated by a pinball wizard. The blunt figures suggest that Jonny Bairstow has been a modest success at three \u2013 in three matches he averages 38.33 there as opposed to 37.29 in all Test cricket \u2013 yet it is no secret that he does not really want to bat there. Nor does Root. Nor do any of the other natural sixes. Perhaps there will be further experimentation in St Lucia \u2013 especially if Ben Foakes is unfit. It may be that Jos Buttler, originally recalled as a novel No 7, will be elevated but such a move stems from a certain desperation: he is willing; in a selfless way he is prepared to give it a try but it is a bit like playing Raheem Sterling at centre-half. Buttler, Ben Stokes and Bairstow are all more dangerous when they have the freedom to attack. The frustration is the lack of young alternatives queuing up to grab a place in the team at the top of the order and this situation is unlikely to change. In 2020 our best young batsmen will be hell-bent on excelling in the two short-form competitions in around 30 matches that will take place in the heart of the summer from June to August. That is where they can earn a good living. Striving to bat for five hours against a red ball will, increasingly, become a mug\u2019s game.",

To keep up with an overwhelming number of technological advancements, capitalism has hitched itself a digitised ride.</p> <p>With the birth of the world wide web, the market expanded: first from local, family-run grocers, to large shopping malls that house mass-produced goods, and finally to a smorgasbord of online stalls and outlets.</p> <p>There are now myriad instant and public ways for individuals to \u201crate\u201d those they buy services from. A song or podcast is only as good as its iTunes rating; a burger joint <a href=\"https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap\">only as \u201cauthentic\u201d as Yelp allows</a>; a hotel only worth staying at on TripAdvisor\u2019s say so; a book only a good read if Goodreads agrees.A smile is worth a pixellated star.

It will afford everybody a personal scorecard, assessed via complex and intrusive surveillance methods.

Lacie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is meant to be all of us: an anxious \u201clife performer\u201d who frolics about nervously in a world where people are rated. And their ratings loom above their heads like some kind of terrifying faux crown, following them into coffee shops, bus terminals, public bathrooms, their homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71e6967a83b2e86f96b7daeeb5cc43f96d6373/0_0_4751_3168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Mirror episode Nosedive encapsulated something about the way that social interactions become performances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dettmann/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This world, an eerie three-dimensional rendering of a formulaic Instagram post, is explicit. Everybody is working to raise ratings through cheap smiles and shallow gestures. There are no secrets.</p> <p>This was what I didn\u2019t like: how blatant the surface acting was. What\u2019s so terrifying, perhaps, about the way emotional labour is practised in our digitised world is that it is insidious and quiet. It dictates our interactions softly.</p> <p>We don\u2019t yet have the appropriate means or language to discuss how all of us stage kindness online. Or goodness. Or intelligence. Or whatever else it is we want to convey. How, when we draft a tweet, or order a pizza, or swipe right in a search for a new lover, we\u2019re signing on to 4G shiftwork: hoping for love heart-shaped tips, or reciprocated online attraction, or a hike in our Uber rating.</p> <p>Recently my grandmother complained to me about the number of Facebook friends she had lost; their profiles disappearing from her feed once she started to draft statuses about Yemen, about femicide, about matters unable to be summarised easily, poked fun at, shared. Friends and family started vanishing the moment she stopped surface acting, when instead she leaked confessions about big pharma, and Palestine, and asbestos conspiracies. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Online life is real life \u2013 and increasingly, the digital economy is not just symbolic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The writer and Guardian podcaster Leigh Alexander, reflecting on \u2013 or perhaps mourning for \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/how-facebook-changed-our-friendships\">once-upon-a-time friendships</a>,<em> </em>considers online interactions to consist mainly of an \u201ceconomy of \u2018likes\u2019\u201d.

HTML journals that, due to our capitalist tendencies, have evolved into work portfolios. But online life is real life \u2013 and, increasingly, the digital economy is not just symbolic. For social media managers, hashtags translate into weekly pay cheques. And social media managers \u2013 in some kind of inevitable conclusion \u2013 are overwhelmingly (between <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-social-media-became-a-pink-collar-job/\">70% and 80%) women</a>.</p> <p>As much as the postmodernist fabric of our digital world seems distressingly far from what we know and love \u2013 from board games with paper money, and feasts that are devoured without being photographed, and car lifts without synchronised PayPal accounts that track kilometres, and traffic, and time \u2013 the way emotional labour fastens itself to women bears an uncanny similarity to the past. Women, with full and open hearts, have long healed their nearest and dearest with love-reactions.

He was frustrated and condescending, forgetting for a moment that the ball was in my court.

There are now myriad instant and public ways for individuals to \u201crate\u201d those they buy services from. A song or podcast is only as good as its iTunes rating; a burger joint only as \u201cauthentic\u201d as Yelp allows; a hotel only worth staying at on TripAdvisor\u2019s say so; a book only a good read if Goodreads agrees.A smile is worth a pixellated star. Or five. If you\u2019re good. In China a \u201csocial credit\u201d system is rolling out before its full launch in 2020. It will afford everybody a personal scorecard, assessed via complex and intrusive surveillance methods. If citizens are \u201cgood\u201d they\u2019re rewarded, with access to discounts, loans and better jobs. If they\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d they\u2019re punished. When my boyfriend and I sat down to watch Nosedive, the first episode of Black Mirror\u2019s third season, I found its obviousness a little vexing. Lacie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is meant to be all of us: an anxious \u201clife performer\u201d who frolics about nervously in a world where people are rated. And their ratings loom above their heads like some kind of terrifying faux crown, following them into coffee shops, bus terminals, public bathrooms, their homes. This world, an eerie three-dimensional rendering of a formulaic Instagram post, is explicit. Everybody is working to raise ratings through cheap smiles and shallow gestures. There are no secrets. This was what I didn\u2019t like: how blatant the surface acting was. What\u2019s so terrifying, perhaps, about the way emotional labour is practised in our digitised world is that it is insidious and quiet. It dictates our interactions softly. We don\u2019t yet have the appropriate means or language to discuss how all of us stage kindness online. Or goodness. Or intelligence. Or whatever else it is we want to convey. How, when we draft a tweet, or order a pizza, or swipe right in a search for a new lover, we\u2019re signing on to 4G shiftwork: hoping for love heart-shaped tips, or reciprocated online attraction, or a hike in our Uber rating. Recently my grandmother complained to me about the number of Facebook friends she had lost; their profiles disappearing from her feed once she started to draft statuses about Yemen, about femicide, about matters unable to be summarised easily, poked fun at, shared. Friends and family started vanishing the moment she stopped surface acting, when instead she leaked confessions about big pharma, and Palestine, and asbestos conspiracies. The writer and Guardian podcaster Leigh Alexander, reflecting on \u2013 or perhaps mourning for \u2013 once-upon-a-time friendships, considers online interactions to consist mainly of an \u201ceconomy of \u2018likes\u2019\u201d. Facebook is work, and Mark Zuckerberg has each of us performing our duties behind simulated desks: masking true feelings so as not to disturb our hard-earned collection of accumulated reactions, likes, clicks and friend databases. At our fingertips a vibrant and bustling economy of people, of pages, of places flourishes, and it is up to us to maintain it appropriately. Sitting in my living room after midnight, the taxi driver long gone, I still feel stuck. Beyond a handful of cash and a wave, he drove into the evening like-less. I\u2019ve become hardened to a transactional system that relies on likes, on stars, on plugs \u2013 and I feel as though I have robbed him of worth. On Christmas Day my grandfather \u2013 a man delighted by the festivities \u2013 leaned back in his armchair and rested his hands on his stomach. His wife, his ex-wife, and his daughter buttered bread in the kitchen, and scrubbed gravy off dishes and sorted through duffle bags full of gifts. I want to veil each of their necks with five stars. In this day and age if you look up from your screen, you will likely find a woman someplace nearby, scouring bowls and platters. It is tempting to speak about social media \u2013 and the self-curation that marries itself to it \u2013 as if Instagram and Facebook and Twitter are nothing more than simulated scrapbooks. HTML journals that, due to our capitalist tendencies, have evolved into work portfolios. But online life is real life \u2013 and, increasingly, the digital economy is not just symbolic. For social media managers, hashtags translate into weekly pay cheques. And social media managers \u2013 in some kind of inevitable conclusion \u2013 are overwhelmingly (between 70% and 80%) women. As much as the postmodernist fabric of our digital world seems distressingly far from what we know and love \u2013 from board games with paper money, and feasts that are devoured without being photographed, and car lifts without synchronised PayPal accounts that track kilometres, and traffic, and time \u2013 the way emotional labour fastens itself to women bears an uncanny similarity to the past. Women, with full and open hearts, have long healed their nearest and dearest with love-reactions. Nostalgia for a \u201csimpler\u201d time comes undone when we realise that such a time was made easy by the invisible emotional labour of our mothers and grandmothers. A few days after Christmas I waited outside a friend\u2019s house for my Uber driver. He pulled over and, as he slowed down, I walked \u2013 slowly but assertively \u2013 in front of his car. As I hopped into the passenger seat and smiled, he locked eyes with me and mentioned that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t just walk in front of a car like that\u201d, that it was \u201cdangerous, Madison\u201d. He was frustrated and condescending, forgetting for a moment that the ball was in my court. Hearing him then attempt to win my five-star rating was distressing; he overcompensated with an abundance of questions, followed by a collection of cheap jokes, all made with trepidation. I wished, as he pulled up at my apartment complex and my phone buzzed, that I\u2019d called a cab instead. \u2022 This is an edited version of the article I\u2019ll Give You a Smile for Five Stars, which originally appeared in the literary magazine Kill Your Darlings",

      "bodyText": "Last September, Sylvia Wilson became the second person in the country to drive around Australia in an electric car. The entire 20,396 kilometre trip took the 70-year-old 110 days in her Tesla S75 and cost just $150.90. Her success served as an answer to critics who have long argued \u201crange anxiety\u201d \u2013 the worry about whether an electric car\u2019s battery will die out of reach of a charging station \u2013 is a factor stopping more people buying electric cars. \u201cThe reality is that if you can see the lights on or that the kettle works, then you can charge. Even in the remotest places, you can still charge the car. In a way there are more places to charge an EV [electric vehicle] than there are a fossil-fuel car,\u201d Wilson told Guardian Australia at the time. While Wilson showed what\u2019s possible with existing infrastructure, industry insiders and engineers have been left wondering why it\u2019s taken so long for Australia just to move past the bare minimum needed to support an expanding electric car sector. Behyad Jafari, chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, says the failure to so far provide this infrastructure \u2013 from charging stations and uniform standards for components, to the tools needed to maintain each vehicle \u2013 is a symptom of political paralysis that has taken hold in Canberra. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear here, these aren\u2019t electric vehicle problems, they\u2019re Australian policy problems,\u201d says Jafari. \u201cIn the absence of that, companies are left wondering, well what the hell do we do?\u201d According to modelling commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, most electric car owners will charge at home or at their place of work but roughly one in three will still be reliant on public charging stations. With just 783 charging stations around the country in 2018, compared with 6,400 petrol stations, building the infrastructure to support the widespread take-up of electric vehicles will cost $1.7bn. Tim Washington is a director of Jetcharge and a cofounder of Chargefox, one of the biggest companies in Australia which supplies and installs charging stations across the country. Washington says most of the infrastructure needed to support the mass uptake of electric cars is already in place, because most people living in a city only drive up to 30 kilometres a day. \u201cPublic charging stations are a visual signal to the public that you are now able to charge the car. People are very used to seeing petrol stations and they have confidence in buying a petrol car because they have a petrol station,\u201d says Washington. \u201cPeople immediately think service station-style charging stations. That\u2019s just not the case. A lot of the charging infrastructure is invisible infrastructure. It\u2019s not apparent to the public eye to where the vast majority of charging stations are. \u201cThey\u2019re in homes, in basements, in commercial building car parks, in public car parks \u2013 in all the places where you don\u2019t see a traditional fuel source \u2013 and that\u2019s all that required for a healthy uptake of electric vehicles.\u201d The problem for companies like his, Washington says, is that the infant nature of the industry and the way people will use the technology makes it a risky investment. \u201cOne of the troubles for public infrastructure providers is that you invest all this money to encourage people to come to electric, but once you invest this money, people will charge at home,\u201d Washington says. \u201cIt\u2019s classic market failure.\u201d To get around this, state and local governments have so far been eager to support the building of new charging stations, but often the support they can provide is limited by their resources and their authority. Instead, help must come from Canberra which for the last few years has been slow to respond to the growth of the new industry \u2013 despite some recognition of its potential. Indeed, one of the recommendations in the select committee report on electric vehicles released this week is that the federal government work with \u201coperators in the charging infrastructure industry to develop a comprehensive plan for the rollout of a national public charging network\u201d. Last October the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced $6m to support Chargefox in building a network of ultra-fast charging stations along the highways that link Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide, and four around Perth. These stations have the ability to take recharge times from eight hours down to 15 minutes in some cases. While it was a welcome announcement, the government has so far failed to address other infrastructure issues that aren\u2019t the most obvious \u2013 or headline grabbing. An early example involved the humble plug. With no clear standard in Australia, global manufacturers had no guide for how to build their cars for the local market. In some ways it risked repeating what happened at federation when each state mandated its own rail gauges, making it impossible to take a train across state lines in one continuous trip. \u201cIt had been an understood issue for quite a number of years before but then there hadn\u2019t been any action,\u201d says Jafari. Instead, industry players themselves had to organise to decide on a voluntary standard that was later communicated in a technical document released by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. While it was a good news story for the industry, it should never have been left to get that far. Now researchers such as Professor Iftekhar Ahmad from Edith Cowan University are looking ahead to stop future problems before they happen. \u201cElectric cars will increase what\u2019s called high peak-to-average demand. When the owners go home and plug in, we\u2019ll see high peak demand during those hours,\u201d says Ahmad. \u201cThe current distribution network is not designed for high peak. When you think about putting so much load on the network, the infrastructure lifetime can be shortened and also it can put too much stress on transformers.\u201d While several fixes have been proposed, Ahmad says the problem can be overcome with proper planning. \u201cIt has to be well planned,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not currently happening in a coordinated fashion and the perspective from the government [and] the utilities is that there\u2019s not enough cars in the market to think about it. \u201cIt will happen, there is no stopping it. If you go to Beijing or Europe, you will see them everywhere and if enough planning can be done, electric cars have a huge potential to complement our renewable energy system.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Carl Shoupe, a 71-year-old who lives in Benham, Kentucky, at the foot of the tallest mountain in the state, does not feel well served by America. When he came back from Vietnam, he went to work in the coalmines. At 22, he was nearly killed by a roof collapse. He spent a year on his back in the hospital. When he was mobile again, he got a job with the United Mine Workers Union. But after 12 years his injuries flared up and he had to quit. Then Vietnam memories started coming back, and he took to alcohol and pills. \u201cI was a wasted man for several years,\u201d he recalled. In September 2005, everything changed. He went to church and got sober. When his mind was clear, he didn\u2019t like what he saw. \u201cMan,\u201d he said, \u201cI seen all this destruction the coal companies were doing, tearing the mountains down.\u201d Since then, Shoupe has worked with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots environmental and social justice group that wants to do things like insulate old camp homes and use the energy savings to pay the costs. It is also looking to create jobs to replace those that left with the mining companies as coal use declined. Such ideas could now form the backbone of a national strategy that more and more Democrats are supporting and which will also aim to help slow the pace of climate change: a Green New Deal. The concept has the backing of the 2020 presidential contenders Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and the likely candidate Bernie Sanders. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey will soon roll out a brief outline. A Green New Deal will aim to spur jobs and tackle inequity. It will aim to help people of color and indigenous communities. And it will try to help places like Benham, Kentucky. But most importantly, people involved say, the document will push candidates for the White House to explain what they plan to do about climate change. \u201cWhere 2020 contenders stand on this legislation will make it clear who is using the Green New Deal as a buzzword and who is serious about transforming our economy in line with what science and justice demand,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group. The concept is already entering the mainstream. Earlier this week, Harris declared her support, telling an Iowa town hall: \u201cClimate change is an existential threat to us, and we have got to deal with the reality of it.\u201d The California senator also touted statistics projecting huge growth in wind and solar power jobs. Behind the scenes, environmental groups, unions and climate justice advocates have been laying out their thoughts on what a Green New Deal should include. A challenge on Capitol Hill For people like Shoupe, it\u2019s hard to get excited just yet. They need help now, while climate scientists stress that the world is already off the pace, having failed to begin phasing out coal and petroleum and working to limit greenhouse gas emissions from industry, agriculture and land use. Donald Trump is still president, still openly doubting climate change science.

A flip of the <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em> dynamic, the film is based on the real-life friendship between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a blue-collar Italian American, and Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), the cultured African American concert pianist whom Tony is hired to drive on a tour of the still segregated deep south.</p> <p>The period, 1962, is romanticised with a handsome palette that could have been lifted from an Edward Hopper painting.

A flip of the Driving Miss Daisy dynamic, the film is based on the real-life friendship between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a blue-collar Italian American, and Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), the cultured African American concert pianist whom Tony is hired to drive on a tour of the still segregated deep south. The period, 1962, is romanticised with a handsome palette that could have been lifted from an Edward Hopper painting.

They were seven points down against England before a number of spectators had found their seats and they didn\u2019t even bear a passing resemblance to the side who had prevented the most free-flowing team in the world, New Zealand, from scoring a try a few months before. In contrast, England have lost only one of their last 10 opening fixtures despite their squad being honed from a larger number of clubs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/scotland-italy-six-nations-match-report\">Blair Kinghorn hat-trick sparks Scotland\u2019s Six Nations victory over Italy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>2) Mitch match</strong></h2> \n<p>Eddie Jones\u2019s wish for John Mitchell to be installed as defence coach was not matched by the Twickenham bean-counters who had to fork out to release the New Zealander from his contract with the Bulls and who wondered why their head coach was keen on someone with whom he had never worked. Saturday showed why, as England won the battle of the gainline: Mako Vunipola and Mark Wilson led the tackle count, but the way Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola picked off the runners coming round the corner was key in making Ireland play behind the advantage line, slowing down their possession and forcing them to kick on the back foot. The looseness that afflicted England last year was nowhere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fdf7bea0304c8d7002363aabbacbbb3e6e89e6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fdf7bea0304c8d7002363aabbacbbb3e6e89e6d/0_135_2406_1443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mako Vunipola led the tackle count alongside Mark Wilson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mako Vunipola led the tackle count alongside Mark Wilson.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers - RFU/The RFU Collection via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3) Bold over</strong></h2> \n<p>Eddie Jones was brave in his selection, resisting the temptation to restore Mike Brown to full-back to deal with Ireland\u2019s box-kicks. It would have been a defensive move and England\u2019s approach from the start was to get on the front foot and dictate. Elliot Daly kept his place and was involved in England\u2019s opening two tries, providing the scoring pass for Jonny May before profiting from his own chip to the line that Jacob Stockdale scuffed. Ireland may have been the form side in the world, with 18 victories in their previous 19 Tests, but Jones was determined that England went quickly through the gears. England were regarded as the underdogs but they played as if they expected to win, sustaining their physical approach but always probing for space in what was a tactical triumph for the Australian.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"db9493ce-aeec-47a1-9abf-6fc75d53614e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aemgr-6em_I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4) Benchmark</strong></h2> \n<p>For once, a meeting of France and Wales was not less interesting than the reading material in a dentist\u2019s waiting room. France had a go from the start and kept going even when nursing a 16-point lead in the rain. Having finally got rid of the shackles that in the last few years made them little more than a side who ran in straight lines, they lustily breathed in freedom\u2019s oxygen, but by dropping Mathieu Bastareaud from the 23, not just the starting team, they had no plan B on the bench. A tight tournament demands different ways of playing: Wales had Dan Biggar to offer an alternative. France, for all their freshness on the night, merely had more of the same.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3398f03844447fc40df1bd794b5d3f6cce7b2238\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3398f03844447fc40df1bd794b5d3f6cce7b2238/0_128_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Biggar offered Wales an alternative.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Biggar offered Wales an alternative.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/03/eddie-jones-england-ireland-six-nations\">Eddie Jones gets a glimpse of England\u2019s nasty side in Dublin victory | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>5) Italian jab</strong></h2> \n<p>For all Gregor Townsend\u2019s frustration at the sloppy finish against Italy when, down to 14 men, Scotland conceded three late tries, he has cause to get stuck in to his players at the start of a week that concludes with the visit of the champions, Ireland, rather than the wooden-spoon holders. Scotland waited patiently for the opening against Italy rather than going gung-ho; opportunities against Ireland will not be as plentiful, but it will be a key day in the progress of a side who not that long ago were Italy\u2019s equals.

      "bodyText": "1) Slow coach Ireland have won every match in the final round of the Six Nations under Joe Schmidt, but they have won only one of their last four on the opening weekend \u2013 in France last year when Johnny Sexton\u2019s late, late drop goal took them past France. They were seven points down against England before a number of spectators had found their seats and they didn\u2019t even bear a passing resemblance to the side who had prevented the most free-flowing team in the world, New Zealand, from scoring a try a few months before. In contrast, England have lost only one of their last 10 opening fixtures despite their squad being honed from a larger number of clubs. 2) Mitch match Eddie Jones\u2019s wish for John Mitchell to be installed as defence coach was not matched by the Twickenham bean-counters who had to fork out to release the New Zealander from his contract with the Bulls and who wondered why their head coach was keen on someone with whom he had never worked. Saturday showed why, as England won the battle of the gainline: Mako Vunipola and Mark Wilson led the tackle count, but the way Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola picked off the runners coming round the corner was key in making Ireland play behind the advantage line, slowing down their possession and forcing them to kick on the back foot. The looseness that afflicted England last year was nowhere. 3) Bold over Eddie Jones was brave in his selection, resisting the temptation to restore Mike Brown to full-back to deal with Ireland\u2019s box-kicks. It would have been a defensive move and England\u2019s approach from the start was to get on the front foot and dictate. Elliot Daly kept his place and was involved in England\u2019s opening two tries, providing the scoring pass for Jonny May before profiting from his own chip to the line that Jacob Stockdale scuffed. Ireland may have been the form side in the world, with 18 victories in their previous 19 Tests, but Jones was determined that England went quickly through the gears. England were regarded as the underdogs but they played as if they expected to win, sustaining their physical approach but always probing for space in what was a tactical triumph for the Australian. 4) Benchmark For once, a meeting of France and Wales was not less interesting than the reading material in a dentist\u2019s waiting room. France had a go from the start and kept going even when nursing a 16-point lead in the rain. Having finally got rid of the shackles that in the last few years made them little more than a side who ran in straight lines, they lustily breathed in freedom\u2019s oxygen, but by dropping Mathieu Bastareaud from the 23, not just the starting team, they had no plan B on the bench. A tight tournament demands different ways of playing: Wales had Dan Biggar to offer an alternative. France, for all their freshness on the night, merely had more of the same. 5) Italian jab For all Gregor Townsend\u2019s frustration at the sloppy finish against Italy when, down to 14 men, Scotland conceded three late tries, he has cause to get stuck in to his players at the start of a week that concludes with the visit of the champions, Ireland, rather than the wooden-spoon holders. Scotland waited patiently for the opening against Italy rather than going gung-ho; opportunities against Ireland will not be as plentiful, but it will be a key day in the progress of a side who not that long ago were Italy\u2019s equals. There will be a measure of expectation after the manner of Ireland\u2019s defeat by England and the injuries they sustained, and it is a chance to show their title ambition, making the final day about what happens at Twickenham rather than in Cardiff. 6) Hayraud\u2019s side to pack a punch against England women The game that will decide the fate of the Women\u2019s Six Nations in Doncaster next Sunday is likely to be a battle of the forwards on the evidence of France\u2019s 52-3 win against Wales in Montpellier on Saturday. Annick Hayraud\u2019s side used their pack to bludgeon the Welsh with the hooker Caroline Thomas scoring a hat-trick of tries. England are likely to be without flanker Marlie Packer, who was injured in their equally one-sided 51-7 win over Ireland.",

      "bodyText": "Want to read Stuart James\u2019s match report? Course you do. Here it is: With that, I bid you farewell. Thanks a lot for reading, and for all your emails \u2013 enjoy the rest of your Sunday! Think that is about right, sadly. While you wait for the match report from this one, make sure you are with Jacob Steinberg all the way for Manchester City v Arsenal! Rashford speaks: \u201cWe had to improve and did that today. Very difficult today and to get the win is very good. Time and time again [Pogba] provides opportunities for the team. Getting the goal sets it in stone and we have to keep improving. We\u2019re just concentrating on ourselves, trying to keep winning matches and we\u2019ll see how it pans out.\u201d Kari Tulinius writes: \u201cThis was an odd match. United looked tired the whole time, but still managed to control the game. I suppose it\u2019s matches like this, when a tactical plan works perfectly even if the players aren\u2019t at the races, that Solskj\u00e6r makes his case for the full time job.\u201d Leicester probably deserved a draw on the balance of that, even if they didn\u2019t carve United open too often over the 90 minutes. Evans and Vardy had decent openings towards the end and De Gea saved brilliantly from that Ghezzal free-kick. Not sure where this leaves Puel, who seems to be in one week and out the next. Nine wins in 10 for Solskjaer! It certainly wasn\u2019t the dynamic performance the first 10 minutes suggested we\u2019d see, but they won\u2019t care \u2013 that early Rashford goal was enough. 90+4 min: Martial is booked for timewasting. We\u2019ve seen an awfully large number of cards in a not especially dirty game. Leicester then create surely their last half-chance, Maguire twisting to volley at the far post but unable to recreate his Anfield heroics, screwing a difficult opportunity across goal and wide. 90+2 min: Maguire has stayed up front now and Leicester are pumping balls into the box \u2013 to little effect so far. 90 min: Jones comes on for Lingard as Leicester prepare to take a corner. United will now just look to see this out. Ghezzal crosses but Iheanacho, trying to flick on, actually succeeds in clearing the ball for United, who then counter rapidly and see Martial force another block from Schmeichel. It\u2019s end-to-end stuff now! We have four added minutes. 88 min: Now some attacking clout from United, Lukaku driving in from the right and forcing a solid parry from Schmeichel. That would, needless to say, have wrapped things up. Then Leicester come forward and ... is that the chance for Vardy? Barnes tears past Bailly and centres, looking for the striker to steer home \u2013 but he puts it straight at De Gea! He\u2019s scored those before. 86 min: Matic makes a poor challenge on Barnes and, like Mendy earlier, should probably get a second yellow for that. Dean appears to miss it. 84 min: I wonder if Solskjaer would have liked a bit more attacking threat from United, across the piece. They certainly haven\u2019t created much at all since the goal. Leicester look for more thrust now, Iheanacho on for Mendy. He passes a helpful bit of paper on to Vardy. 82 min: Ghezzal is the next of our many bookings, stopping Martial carrying the ball upfield. 81 min: Looking again, that really was a first-rate save from De Gea \u2013 quite possibly a matchwinning one. Now Shaw makes another foul and this time is booked. It\u2019s a free-kick out on the right ... swung in by Ghezzal, headed back across by Maguire, and Evans gets a free volley at goal \u2013 but air kicks! United are living just a touch dangerously at this point. 78 min: Leicester make nothing of the corner. United then replace Rashford with Lukaku. 77 min: Shaw concedes a soft foul on Ghezzal and, not for the first time, Leicester have an inviting free-kick around the penalty area. Maddison is off the pitch and it\u2019s better for a left-footer anyway. Ghezzal steps up ... and it\u2019s Leicester\u2019s best shot of the match, arcing towards the top corner at speed before De Gea superbly tips it behind! 74 min: Okazaki comes on for Leicester, replacing the intermittently lively Gray. They need something different. Leicester have not been bad here, and have had some promising spells of pressure, but haven\u2019t exactly bashed the door down. 73 min: Mendy gets lucky again with an unnoticed tug on Herrera, not at all dissimilar to his earlier pull of Pogba\u2019s shirt. He shouldn\u2019t really be with us any longer. 70 min: Martial earns United a relatively rare, for them, corner. It\u2019s worked short and Herrera eventually chips into the box, but nothing really results. 69 min: Barnes curls well wide after a lengthy spell of Leicester possession and pressure. They just haven\u2019t turned their best work into real chances yet. 67 min: Now Sanchez takes his leave, after 67 minutes of not a lot, and Martial replaces him. That may help United exploit space in this last quarter. 65 min: It\u2019s been an almost-good game so far. Lots of little flickers but no consistent excitement since that early goal. 63 min: Leicester apply some more pressure, but Ndidi puts that to an end with a wild slash wide from 25+ yards. 62 min: Maddison goes off, and on comes Ghezzal. It\u2019s fair to say the home faithful don\u2019t like that a lot; it\u2019s fair, too, to suggest Maddison doesn\u2019t seem to either. 61 min: Now this could be a chance for Leicester. Matic checks Vardy 25 yards out, and it\u2019s a centrally-situated free-kick. Good position, and Maddison steps up ... it pings up off the wall and Vardy, reacting quickest, snaps an acrobatic volley towards goal. De Gea manages to save it at the second attempt, just grabbing it before it can spin over the line! 59 min: A slick United move involving Sanchez and Shaw ends with Rashford drilling wide. Off the ball, Mendy drags Pogba down as he looks to dart into the box. It\u2019s not spotted by the officials but Mendy, already booked, would surely be off if it was. 57 min: United seem, for now, to have got to grips with Leicester\u2019s earlier fire and brimstone. They are controlling the ball for the moment and there isn\u2019t a whole lot going on. 54 min: Pogba is hurt after a hefty Evans challenge. He\u2019s clasping his lower right leg and waving his arms about. Up he gets, eventually, hobbling a tad. 52 min: You\u2019d fancy United will get space on the counter in this half. I do wonder how much longer Sanchez will last; he\u2019s done very little out there today. 50 min: Barnes, lively since the break, stands a brilliant delivery up from that left byline and Lindelof has to defend well. It leads to Leicester\u2019s latest corner, which comes to nought. 47 min: And then, on the other side, Maddison makes ground into the box and drills into the side netting. Really quick start from Puel\u2019s team! 46 min: They certainly start well, Barnes flashing a cross-shot past goal from a very tight angle on the left. Can Leicester turn this around? \u201cI noticed a lot of birds on the pitch today, presumably pigeons pecking around for reseeded grass, or maybe looking for the leftover Walkers crisps of the groundsman\u2019s lunch break?\u201d observes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cStrange they\u2019d risk it given there are 23 men running around the field (11 of them foxes, supposedly, although Mendy has been playing like a scarecrow so far).\u201d Fair point, particularly on a weekend that has shown us no football pitch is safe from prowling cats. Woolie Madden writes in: \u201cIn a city with a large South Asian population, it\u2019s heartening to see Hamza Choudhury is part of Leicester\u2019s matchday squad. Considering how popular football is with young British Asians, clubs should be doing so much more both in terms of welcoming more Asian fans as spectators are their ground and also developing players into professionals. The other issue is a general lack of role models, as there are just so few British Asian players in general. Hopefully Choudhury makes a success of it at Leicester so that can change, at least.\u201d Hear, hear. The half finishes with flurries at both ends, but United end it with the lead. It owed to sloppy play by Ricardo and some sublime football from Pogba \u2013 the pass \u2013 and Rashford \u2013 the control and finish \u2013 to cap the away side\u2019s early dominance. They haven\u2019t quite built on it, and Leicester have come back into the game without creating a whole lot, so we still have a real game on our hands here. Back in a bit! 45+1 min: As we enter three minutes of added time, Leicester lose the ball in their own half and Rashford tries to punish them for a second time, slashing in a shot that Schmeichel saves low to his right. 45 min: Now Mendy is booked for a slightly naughty one on Herrera. It\u2019s got a bit scrappy, this. 43 min: Maddison\u2019s delivery from that free-kick is poor, but so is the defending and Barnes is allowed to size up a first-time effort from more than 25 yards. It\u2019s no danger to anyone, though. 42 min: Ricardo tears barnstormingly into the United half and Matic takes a yellow, throwing an arm across him. Leicester definitely don\u2019t look out of this. 40 min: Young makes a threatening burst towards the box but overcooks his final pass for Lingard in a great position. 38 min: And another left-sided corner for Leicester ... it swings in and this time the challenge is won by Evans ahead of Bailly. He heads wide and, having made contact, might have done better. 37 min: United seem fairly content to allow Leicester possession now, if anything. Probably the best ploy: Leicester have struggled under Puel when offered a lot of the ball. They do get a corner though, from which Maguire wins a header but is penalised for a foul on Matic. 34 min: Leicester press well and hound United out of possession in their own half. It\u2019s been sporadic from them though, pressing like that. I can\u2019t totally work out how they are approaching this. 32 min: Late challenge \u2013 very much a \u201cstriker\u2019s challenge\u201d \u2013 from Vardy out on the left touchline near halfway, scything Lindelof down. It\u2019s a clear booking, one he takes with little argument. 31 min: United put together their first move for a little while, Pogba dictating it, and it ends with a deflected Lingard shot looping through to Schmeichel. 28 min: Then Gray cuts in from the left and fires one towards goal. De Gea dives but Bailly gets there first, and bravely, taking quite a whack to the head in repelling the ball. He will continue but still looks dazed, and this is the kind of situation that needs taking care with. 26 min: Maddison gets a shot away 25 yards out but it\u2019s straight at De Gea. Leicester win possession back from the goal kick and Ricardo aims a cross just over Vardy\u2019s head. Bailly defends it just in case. Better from the home side. 25 min: A lull, at present. United aren\u2019t quite fizzing around Leicester as they were earlier on. But they do still have the lead. 22 min: Maguire tries to get Leicester going with an uncharacteristic burst down the left, cut off by Lingard. Leicester are showing a few signs of life, their full-backs both firing crosses into the box in the moments after. 20 min: Lingard is deservedly shown a yellow card by Mike Dean for ankle-tapping Maddison as he attempts to counter. 19 min: Abhijato Sensarma writes \u2013 \u201cIf this United side pulls off the miracle of having a top four finish, do you think it will be logical to proceed with Solskjaer for the next season at the very least? I mean he\u2019s not a superstar, but he\u2019s brought back the attacking flair in the team, and may be the man in the shadows whom Manchester United has searched for ever since Sir Alex\u2019s retirement.\u201d I think it would be logical. If it\u2019s working, why rip it up? 17 min: Rashford needs a bit of treatment but looks OK. Which is good for United as he has been a real livewire so far and took that goal superbly, forgetting about his earlier miss. 15 min: Maddison has a sight of goal after a fortunate ricochet, but Shaw is back superbly to send his shot spinning behind for a corner. Excellent defending. Vardy wins the header at the near post as the set piece comes in, but it\u2019s high and wide. 12 min: United come again and Maguire blocks Lingard\u2019s attempt to crown a tricky run with a shot on goal. They look full of confidence. This time he doesn\u2019t miss. Ricardo concedes possession to Pogba with an absolutely terrible attempt to play from the back, but there\u2019s still a lot to do. The weighting of Pogba\u2019s pass over the top for Rashford is absolutely sublime and now, clean through and with time to give Schmeichel the eyes, he makes no mistake. He drills into the corner emphatically and it had been coming. 7 min: Maguire gives away a silly free-kick in a good right-sided position, needlessly clattering into Rashford, who was going nowhere. Chilwell heads clear but United keep the pressure on and Lindelof, driving the ball back across, wins a corner. That\u2019s drilled in low and Schmeichel has to save sharply at his near post from Rashford. It\u2019s a brisk start from United. 4 min: Big chance for Rashford! Shaw sizes up an absolutely delicious cross to the far post and Rashford, running off Maguire and completely alone, somehow directs his header over. That should be 1-0 to United, no question. 3 min: Bailly, recalled to the side today, hoiks an *awful* attempt at a backpass out of play for a corner. Ndidi heads the delivery well wide; De Gea was stranded so, had it been on target, there\u2019d have been big trouble. 1 min: Sanchez, playing on the left of the attack, has an early go at Ricardo but there\u2019s nothing doing. United, kicking right to left and clothed traditionally, kick us off. The teams are emerging at the King Power. We\u2019ll kick off in a few minutes. On paper, these two XIs should give us a very decent game ... That start for Alexis Sanchez is his first in the league under Solskjaer. It means Romelu Lukaku drops to the bench. Can Solskjaer recapture Sanchez\u2019s old zip? My suspicion is nobody can: he is 30, has played at a ferocious tempo for years, often year-round too, and simply can\u2019t keep it going at that pace anymore. It is no slight on him. Harry Maguire is talking on Sky and is asked about United\u2019s summer interest in him. He flat-bats it adroitly and answers a different question. Decent finish by him at Anfield, by the way, wasn\u2019t it? Kyle Walker, for one, approved. Fancy a rollicking pre-match read? Here is Daniel Taylor\u2019s weekly column, this time about Leeds: \u201cCan United go fourth if they win today?\u201d asks Matthew Bullock. Afraid not, Matthew \u2013 they\u2019d be two points shy of incumbents Chelsea but would leapfrog fifth-placed Arsenal, at least until their game with Man City later. I\u2019m a big fan of Harvey Barnes, and it was great to see him score at Wolves a couple of weeks ago. His form on loan at West Brom meant it was something of a no-brainer to bring him back for the rest of the season but it does go to show that expensive, chancy signings from elsewhere aren\u2019t always as good an answer as developing your own. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Ricardo, Evans, Maguire, Chilwell, Ndidi, Mendy, Gray, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Fuchs, Morgan, Choudhury, Ghezzal, Okazaki, Iheanacho. Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Lindelof, Bailly, Shaw, Matic, Herrera, Pogba, Lingard, Rashford, Sanchez. Subs: Romero, Dalot, Jones, Fred, Mata, Martial, Lukaku. Alexis Sanchez starts for United! Leicester, meanwhile, field an attack full of young English talent. Manchester United\u2019s charge for the top four continues, then, and the fact that it sounds a remotely exciting prospect to their supporters says plenty about the situation Ole Gunnar Solskjaer inherited and the work he has done since. He oversaw his first minor wobble in midweek, really, with that draw against Burnley \u2013 but even then United came from two down at the death so there is enough happening to suggest the spirit of the old days is osmosising (is \u201cosmosising\u201d a word? from dugout through to pitch. How easy will Leicester make it for them today? It\u2019s exceptionally hard to tell because Leicester appear to fold limply one week and then pull out all the stops the next. Claude Puel remains under intense scrutiny but this is the kind of fixture they\u2019ve tended to pull out a result in \u2013 see Manchester City (h) on Boxing Day and Liverpool (a) a mere four days ago. Their inconsistency is typical of the Premier League\u2019s wider mid-table morass although Leicester do, at their best, have more about them than most of the division\u2019s ballast.

They were one of about 550 families placed in West Yorkshire and among 130 families sent to live in the Kirklees area of Huddersfield.</p> <p>Three months ago, everything changed again when the footage showing the family\u2019s eldest son, Jamal, being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/05/syrian-schoolboy-allegedly-suffered-years-of-abuse-in-huddersfield-school\">allegedly assaulted</a> was posted online.</p> <p>Since then, it has emerged Jamal and Farah, the only Syrian children in the school, became targets for bullies within a month of starting there.</p> <p>In the meantime, the far-right activist Tommy Robinson tried to take advantage of the incident and interviewed the 16-year-old suspect on YouTube. Tasmine Akunjee, the family\u2019s solicitor, confirmed they were planning to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/06/tommy-robinson-threatened-with-legal-action-over-bully-video\">legal action</a> against the English Defence League founder and have set up a <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/jamalrobinsondefamation/\">fundraising page</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian met the family three days after they moved away from Huddersfield, in their new lounge \u2013 a sparse room decorated only with gold Arabian tea sets from their home in Syria.</p> <p>For Farah, it has been devastating, and all of them are struggling to come to terms with the events of the past few months.</p> <p>Shortly after the footage went viral, more footage emerged showing a young girl being physically abused at the same school. The video shows the girl being pushed towards a grass verge and her headscarf being pulled. At the end of the clip, she falls to the ground. A girl was excluded from the school over that incident.</p> <p>Farah, a shy 14-year-old, speaks with a faint Yorkshire accent, confirming she was the girl in the video. She says she was bullied daily with her hijab regularly \u201cripped off\u201d her head.</p> <p>Her father looks at Farah, who is wearing a bright cerulean blue headscarf and talking about her lowest point when, after months of bullying, she tried to kill herself.</p> <p>\u201cNo one was listening to us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis had been happening every day. We kept being asked to make statements, they had meetings with my parents, but nothing. They would pull my scarf all the time, pull my hair, say things to me, and for Jamal it was the same, but nothing was done. I became very sad and upset and didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p> <p>Jamal, who remained in the background for most of our visit, eventually speaks and says he no longer wants to remember what happened in Huddersfield. He hopes he and his sister will be given places at a local grammar school and they can continue their education. A fundraising page, set up for the family after the video went viral, raised more than \u00a3170,000.</p> <p>\u201cI cried myself to sleep all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it any more. When it was happening, no one was listening to us. We asked everyone for help but no one was listening. I just want to go to school again, we all want to go to school, make new friends and forget about Huddersfield.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

They were one of about 550 families placed in West Yorkshire and among 130 families sent to live in the Kirklees area of Huddersfield. Three months ago, everything changed again when the footage showing the family\u2019s eldest son, Jamal, being allegedly assaulted was posted online. Since then, it has emerged Jamal and Farah, the only Syrian children in the school, became targets for bullies within a month of starting there. In the meantime, the far-right activist Tommy Robinson tried to take advantage of the incident and interviewed the 16-year-old suspect on YouTube. Tasmine Akunjee, the family\u2019s solicitor, confirmed they were planning to take legal action against the English Defence League founder and have set up a fundraising page. The Guardian met the family three days after they moved away from Huddersfield, in their new lounge \u2013 a sparse room decorated only with gold Arabian tea sets from their home in Syria. For Farah, it has been devastating, and all of them are struggling to come to terms with the events of the past few months. Shortly after the footage went viral, more footage emerged showing a young girl being physically abused at the same school. The video shows the girl being pushed towards a grass verge and her headscarf being pulled. At the end of the clip, she falls to the ground. A girl was excluded from the school over that incident. Farah, a shy 14-year-old, speaks with a faint Yorkshire accent, confirming she was the girl in the video. She says she was bullied daily with her hijab regularly \u201cripped off\u201d her head. Her father looks at Farah, who is wearing a bright cerulean blue headscarf and talking about her lowest point when, after months of bullying, she tried to kill herself. \u201cNo one was listening to us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis had been happening every day. We kept being asked to make statements, they had meetings with my parents, but nothing. They would pull my scarf all the time, pull my hair, say things to me, and for Jamal it was the same, but nothing was done. I became very sad and upset and didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Jamal, who remained in the background for most of our visit, eventually speaks and says he no longer wants to remember what happened in Huddersfield. He hopes he and his sister will be given places at a local grammar school and they can continue their education. A fundraising page, set up for the family after the video went viral, raised more than \u00a3170,000. \u201cI cried myself to sleep all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it any more. When it was happening, no one was listening to us. We asked everyone for help but no one was listening. I just want to go to school again, we all want to go to school, make new friends and forget about Huddersfield.\u201d In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "Yemen peace talks have been held onboard a UN-chartered boat anchored in the Red Sea in an attempt to find a neutral venue acceptable to both sides. Patrick Cammaert, a retired Dutch general and head of the UN mission in Yemen, chaired the meeting on the ship moored off the port city of Hodeidah. Houthi rebel military officials had refused to meet in government-held areas in southern Hodeidah, citing security fears. The dispute over the talks venue had prevented military leaders from the two sides meeting since 2 January. The first two meetings had been held in Houthi-controlled zones. The meetings of the regional redeployment committee (RCC) are seen as critical to building on the UN-brokered agreement reached in Stockholm in Decemberthat under which Houthi fighters would be redeployed out of Hodeida\u2019s city and port. The agreement envisaged a new security force taking over the city, a move critical to preventing famine and to opening humanitarian corridors. The UN mission, despite delays and setbacks, remains optimistic that progress can be made, partly because external forces, including the US and Saudi, recognise that a purely military solution in Yemen might come at an unacceptable price. On Saturday, the UN ship picked up the Yemen government delegation then anchored overnight in Hodeidah port before taking onboard the Houthi negotiators. The RCC is arguably the biggest prize to emerge from Stockholm, and if the dispute over its venue had continued the key institutional structure underpinning the ceasefire would have been in jeopardy. The Red Sea port is the entry point for the bulk of Yemen\u2019s imported goods and humanitarian aid, providing a lifeline to millions in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country. The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates are sceptical that the Houthis will abide by the Stockholm agreement, and cannot imagine Houthis voluntarily leaving a port that gives them access to revenue through imposing taxes, and control of food and commercial supplies. A former British diplomat, Martin Griffiths, is the UN envoy charged with brokering the peace talks.",

      "body": "<p>When Charlotte Schepke, director of the London gallery <a href=\"http://largeglass.co.uk/\">Large Glass</a>, told me she wanted to organise an exhibition inspired by my book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/28/myth-monsters-and-the-maze-how-writers-fell-in-love-with-the-labyrinth\">Red Thread</a>, it felt like the ultimate compliment. Not only because it is obviously flattering but because the book, which explores the idea of the labyrinth, is partly about translations between art forms \u2013 how a poem might prompt a sculpture, which then might slip into a story, and how this chain of influence never ends, as ideas pass from hand to hand.</p> <p>In the book I consider the idea of the labyrinth \u2013 the mythical, confounding prison made by Daedalus to house the Minotaur \u2013 as the original symbol of human inventiveness and imagination. I think of Daedalus as the first great artist and contriver of ingenious forms \u2013 a figure whose creations sometimes bypassed morality or overreached nature. I think of the labyrinth as a structure that, when viewed from above, with its coiled and snaking form, resembles the brain. It is fitting that one of the photographs the Irish artist <a href=\"http://www.kerlingallery.com/artists/dorothy-cross\">Dorothy Cross</a> is showing in the exhibition is an image of brain coral \u2013 which simultaneously resembles the interlocking passages of a maze and the grooves of a human brain. Another work by Cross contains two skulls, halved, their hollow insides gilded. The gold picks out tributaries and rivulets of bone, which make their own little confounding maze of lines.</p> <p>For the exhibition, titled <a href=\"http://largeglass.co.uk/Exhibitions/In-the-Labyrinth\">In the Labyrinth</a>, Schepke has invited seven artists to make new work or select recent work suggested by the theme. Only one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/feb/07/art-underground-mark-wallinger-pictures\">Mark Wallinger</a>, actually appears in Red Thread; I like the notion that the exhibition is an expansion rather than an adaptation, a new journey for the idea to travel on, prompted by fresh conversations and different eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e50cbec3407401829037935dbad95ee431c6c00a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e50cbec3407401829037935dbad95ee431c6c00a/95_123_3378_4538/744.jpg\" alt=\"December (Pylos) 2018, by Helen Mirra.\" width=\"744\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linen thread \u2026 December (Pylos) 2018, by Helen Mirra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy the artist and Large Glass, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wallinger will show two of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/07/tube-150-birthday-labyrinth-art-project\">his labyrinth plaques originally conceived for the London Underground</a>. Each of London\u2019s 270 tube stations has one of these plaques, and each labyrinth is slightly different. The designs recall, in their circular form, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/transport-london\">Frank Pick</a>\u2019s classic London Transport roundel and they are made by the same firm that produces the network\u2019s enamel signage.</p> <p>They act as a reminder of the vermicular tangle of tunnels that makes up the Underground, the disorienting nature of the city and the looping daily journeys of the city\u2019s inhabitants. Because the signs are unexplained, unlabelled \u2013 and perhaps because they do not look like \u201cart\u201d \u2013 they have a slightly esoteric air to them, as if they are conveying some secret message. I always snap Wallinger\u2019s tube labyrinths on my phone when I see them, though I\u2019m a long way from collecting a full set.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hmirra.net/\">Helen Mirra</a>, who is based in California, is an artist deeply interested in the possibilities of walking and weaving, both of which are activities closely related to the idea of the labyrinth \u2013 the labyrinth must, after all, be travelled on foot and navigated, if you are lucky, with the help of a thread. Her new work for the show is a woven cloth depicting a labyrinth pattern \u2013 her chosen form echoes that of a graffito, made in about 1200 BC, on the back of a clay tablet in Pylos, Greece.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/28/myth-monsters-and-the-maze-how-writers-fell-in-love-with-the-labyrinth\">Myths, monsters and the maze: how writers fell in love with the labyrinth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/14/greekmyths.greekmythsfeatures3\">Minos, Ariadne and Theseus</a> has antique origins, and fragments of it appear in Homer. But the first telling of the story that brings all its now recognisable elements together comes many centuries after the Pylos graffito, in a poem by the Roman poet Catullus from the first century BC. He tells how king Minos of Crete commissioned Daedalus to build a labyrinth to house the half-man, half-bull Minotaur; how Minos demanded that young men and women from Athens should be let loose in it to be killed by the creature; how one year Theseus was among those chosen to be the human tribute; how Ariadne, Minos\u2019s daughter, fell in love with the prince, and gave him a sword to kill the Minotaur and a thread to find his way out. And how, in the end, Theseus betrayed Ariadne, and abandoned her on the island of Naxos.</p> <p>In the poem, however, this tale is told as a story within a story: the narrative unfolds as a description of a series of scenes embroidered on a precious textile, a coverlet for a marriage bed. But reading it, you become immersed in the story, forgetting that it\u2019s made up of threads until the poet deftly reminds you. (And of course it\u2019s not, not really \u2013 it\u2019s made up of words, which are themselves mere inky flourishes on the page.) It\u2019s entirely appropriate that Mirra is, in some way, travelling that journey in reverse, returning text to textile.</p> <p>Threads are also lines, and we make lines, or loops, when we walk. Mirra\u2019s interest in walking puts me in mind of another great Californian walker, the writer and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebeccasolnit\">Rebecca Solnit</a>, who once wrote about how the labyrinth \u201cwinds up a path like thread on a spool\u201d. The labyrinth compresses a walk, it condenses a line. The walk one takes through a labyrinth is an unnecessarily long one, as the path veers away from its goal and doubles up and tangles itself up like a ball of wool.

      "bodyText": "When Charlotte Schepke, director of the London gallery Large Glass, told me she wanted to organise an exhibition inspired by my book Red Thread, it felt like the ultimate compliment. Not only because it is obviously flattering but because the book, which explores the idea of the labyrinth, is partly about translations between art forms \u2013 how a poem might prompt a sculpture, which then might slip into a story, and how this chain of influence never ends, as ideas pass from hand to hand. In the book I consider the idea of the labyrinth \u2013 the mythical, confounding prison made by Daedalus to house the Minotaur \u2013 as the original symbol of human inventiveness and imagination. I think of Daedalus as the first great artist and contriver of ingenious forms \u2013 a figure whose creations sometimes bypassed morality or overreached nature. I think of the labyrinth as a structure that, when viewed from above, with its coiled and snaking form, resembles the brain. It is fitting that one of the photographs the Irish artist Dorothy Cross is showing in the exhibition is an image of brain coral \u2013 which simultaneously resembles the interlocking passages of a maze and the grooves of a human brain. Another work by Cross contains two skulls, halved, their hollow insides gilded. The gold picks out tributaries and rivulets of bone, which make their own little confounding maze of lines. For the exhibition, titled In the Labyrinth, Schepke has invited seven artists to make new work or select recent work suggested by the theme. Only one, Mark Wallinger, actually appears in Red Thread; I like the notion that the exhibition is an expansion rather than an adaptation, a new journey for the idea to travel on, prompted by fresh conversations and different eyes. Wallinger will show two of his labyrinth plaques originally conceived for the London Underground. Each of London\u2019s 270 tube stations has one of these plaques, and each labyrinth is slightly different. The designs recall, in their circular form, Frank Pick\u2019s classic London Transport roundel and they are made by the same firm that produces the network\u2019s enamel signage. They act as a reminder of the vermicular tangle of tunnels that makes up the Underground, the disorienting nature of the city and the looping daily journeys of the city\u2019s inhabitants. Because the signs are unexplained, unlabelled \u2013 and perhaps because they do not look like \u201cart\u201d \u2013 they have a slightly esoteric air to them, as if they are conveying some secret message. I always snap Wallinger\u2019s tube labyrinths on my phone when I see them, though I\u2019m a long way from collecting a full set. Helen Mirra, who is based in California, is an artist deeply interested in the possibilities of walking and weaving, both of which are activities closely related to the idea of the labyrinth \u2013 the labyrinth must, after all, be travelled on foot and navigated, if you are lucky, with the help of a thread. Her new work for the show is a woven cloth depicting a labyrinth pattern \u2013 her chosen form echoes that of a graffito, made in about 1200 BC, on the back of a clay tablet in Pylos, Greece. The story of Minos, Ariadne and Theseus has antique origins, and fragments of it appear in Homer. But the first telling of the story that brings all its now recognisable elements together comes many centuries after the Pylos graffito, in a poem by the Roman poet Catullus from the first century BC. He tells how king Minos of Crete commissioned Daedalus to build a labyrinth to house the half-man, half-bull Minotaur; how Minos demanded that young men and women from Athens should be let loose in it to be killed by the creature; how one year Theseus was among those chosen to be the human tribute; how Ariadne, Minos\u2019s daughter, fell in love with the prince, and gave him a sword to kill the Minotaur and a thread to find his way out. And how, in the end, Theseus betrayed Ariadne, and abandoned her on the island of Naxos. In the poem, however, this tale is told as a story within a story: the narrative unfolds as a description of a series of scenes embroidered on a precious textile, a coverlet for a marriage bed. But reading it, you become immersed in the story, forgetting that it\u2019s made up of threads until the poet deftly reminds you. (And of course it\u2019s not, not really \u2013 it\u2019s made up of words, which are themselves mere inky flourishes on the page.) It\u2019s entirely appropriate that Mirra is, in some way, travelling that journey in reverse, returning text to textile. Threads are also lines, and we make lines, or loops, when we walk. Mirra\u2019s interest in walking puts me in mind of another great Californian walker, the writer and activist Rebecca Solnit, who once wrote about how the labyrinth \u201cwinds up a path like thread on a spool\u201d. The labyrinth compresses a walk, it condenses a line. The walk one takes through a labyrinth is an unnecessarily long one, as the path veers away from its goal and doubles up and tangles itself up like a ball of wool. Weaving is an act of compression in its own way, too, a looping path taken by threads that would make a long line (or an unnavigable tangle) if unravelled. A work in the show deeply involved in this idea of compression is Alice Channer\u2019s raffishly titled sculpture, Elon Musk. It consists of tightly pleated lam\u00e9 material packed into a flattish metal structure designed to be fitted low down on a wall, jutting out from it like a bracket. The sculpture is meant to recall bracket fungi, those mycological wonders that protrude shelf\u2013like from the trunks of trees. Indeed, the folds of fabric, prepared specially for Channer by a firm that pleats material for the fashion industry, resemble the gills of a mushroom (and it\u2019s a nice coincidence, an unlooked-for connection, that the natural dyes Mirra has used for her weaving come from fungi). At the centre of the intestinal, coiling mass of fabric sits an ammonite, another form, this time ancient and natural rather than new and hi-tech, that spirals and winds. The pleated, concentrated fabric has an association, for Channer, of the way a \u201ccomputer hard drive condenses and contains a huge amount of information\u201d. As for the work\u2019s title, she regards it as deliberately \u201coutrageous and mischievous\u201d to name her modest sculpture after a tech entrepreneur who is an \u201coverblown masculine ego in freefall\u201d. Musk, with his dreams of commercial space travel, is a damaged Daedalus for our times, perhaps; or maybe an Icarus, tumbling out of the sky having tried to fly too close to the sun. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what the other artists \u2013 Alison Turnbull, Carey Young and Tonico Lemos Auad \u2013 bring to the exhibition, what associations the idea of the labyrinth has prompted in them. Some of the connections made will be, I imagine, clear; some more intuitive and less immediately apparent. I shall enjoy the challenge of trying to map the journeys their minds have travelled.

      "body": "<p>David Wallace-Wells\u2019s apocalyptic depiction of a world made uninhabitable by climate chaos caused an outcry when it was published in New York magazine in 2017. Based on the worst-case scenarios foreseen by science, his article portrayed a world of drought, plague and famine, in which acidified oceans drown coastal homelands, dormant diseases are released from ancient ice, conflicts surge, economies collapse, human cognitive abilities decline and heat stress becomes more intolerable in New York City than in present-day Bahrain. Critics called this irresponsibly alarmist. Supporters said it was a long-overdue antidote to climate complacency. Whatever your view, it was among the best-read climate articles in US history. Now he is back with a book-length follow-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/02/the-devastation-of-human-life-is-in-view-what-a-burning-world-tells-us-about-climate-change-global-warming\">\u2018The devastation of human life is in view\u2019: what a burning world tells us about climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Jonathan Watts: You have written a hell of a book. Your now-famous opening lines \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s worse, much worse, than you think\u201d \u2013 are like a voice from a nightmare. Are you deliberately upsetting people about the climate?</strong></p> <p><strong>David Wallace-Wells:</strong> That is one of the intentions. My hope is first of all to tell the story as I see it. That has a couple of components. One is to show the crisis is happening much faster and is more all-encompassing than people think. And then also to think how those dramatic changes are going to cascade through the lives we live, the way we relate to one another, our politics, our culture, our psychology, all that stuff. I would like people to be scared of what is possible because I\u2019m scared. And because I am motivated by fear, I also hope they will be motivated.</p> <p><strong>The sense of speed comes across very strongly. It is as if people have got used to seeing the climate crisis as an old horror film with slow-lurching zombies</strong><strong> but, in your version, the</strong><strong> zombies are the much faster, scarier </strong><strong>ones you see in </strong><strong>modern horror films. You address the risks of heat death, hunger, drowning, wildfire, dying oceans, economic collapse and conflict, and suggest the climate problem driving them has super-accelerated beyond what many people think.</strong></p> <p>That is the thing that first opened my eyes to the change. When I learned the astonishing fact that more than half of the carbon we have emitted into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels was emitted in the past 25 years, that really shocked me. This means we have burned more fossil fuels since the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) than in all of the centuries before \u2013 so we have done more damage knowingly than we ever managed in ignorance. That is a horrifying fact. It also means we are engineering our own devastation practically in real time. How much will depend on how we act, how we behave, how we respond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47644f98c35aa7cf210cc3d22d4756ce53899d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47644f98c35aa7cf210cc3d22d4756ce53899d18/0_0_4000_2662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lignite-fired power station in Poland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lignite-fired power station in Poland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Florian Gaertner/Photothek via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The book is based on the piece you wrote for New York </strong><strong>magazine last year that focused on worst-case climate scenarios. Were you prepared for the storm that caused?</strong></p> <p>It had about 6m page views. Within a couple of days, it was the most-read article we had ever published. It was a true phenomenon. That was thrilling in a way because the conventional wisdom about climate writing \u2013 at least in American journalism \u2013 was that it was traffic Kryptonite, that nobody would read these stories. I felt that was in part because we had left a lot of storytelling tools on the table and weren\u2019t embracing a certain kind of writing that might reach people dramatically. I felt the article was a proof of concept for that.</p> <p><strong>In the book, you focus more on warming of around 2-4C</strong><strong>, which is more likely than the worst-case scenarios, though still bad enough. Was this different approach an attempt to tighten up because there was quite a lot of scientific push</strong><strong>back on some of the claims you made in the original article?</strong></p> <p>I had anticipated a pushback. I wrote in the original article about scientific reticence and the way many researchers were reluctant to talk about their own scary findings in public in the terms they might have included in their papers. But I do not feel the science of my story was irresponsible. We ended up publishing four corrections to the piece. What it motivated me to do \u2013 and not just me, but my fact checker and the editor \u2013 was to publish this fully annotated version of the piece within a couple of days, in which we footnoted every fact with a paper. I do believe that basically answered that first reflexive criticism of the piece as being scientifically irresponsible.</p> <p><strong>There were also questions about rhetoric. Scientists said your article </strong><strong>was \u201chyperbolic\u201d and \u201cexaggerated\u201d, and </strong><strong>your alarmism was as irresponsible as climate denial. In the book, you are unapologetic. </strong><strong>You write</strong><strong>: \u201cThe facts are hysterical\u201d and the only way to address them is with the language of theology and mythology. Is this Armaggeddonising a way to reach new audiences and break down barriers?</strong></p> <p>Yes, and to activate people who are only casually engaged. To me, that is the most important messaging mission. It is important to mobilise people who at the moment are concerned, but basically complacent, and turn them into people who are much more activated and essentially voting about climate as a first-order political priority rather than a third- or fourth-order priority \u2013 judging politicians on the basis of their climate policy.</p> <p><strong>Disruption is important. But to what extent? You talk of </strong><strong>last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">UN IPCC 1.5C report</a></strong><strong>. It is a science paper and it is sober. It spells out the huge \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 differences between 1.5C and 2C of warming,</strong><strong> and the actions we need to take right now if we are to avoid the extra half a degree, which will require a </strong><strong>45% reduction in emissions by 2030. You say the message of the report is: \u201cIt\u2019s OK now to freak out.\u201d But I guess most scientists would say: \u201cDon\u2019t freak out! Act! Focus! Do not succumb to paralysing fear.\u201d Is \u201cfreak out\u201d what you really mean?</strong></p> <p>The short answer is yes. We should not sit back and feel complacent that the world beyond us will figure this out without political pressure. We cannot continue on the path we are on and believe our future will be secure and stable. We need to dramatically change our climate policy globally. That was the very clear message of the UN report. You are right that, in a certain way, it was written soberly, but it is also the case that it was saying we need mobilisation on the scale that we saw in the second world war in Europe and the US \u2013 and that is not a keep-calm message. It is saying we have to light the fuse and get going.</p> <p>On the question of what kind of motivation is most effective, I don\u2019t believe fear and alarm are the only options; there is a place for hope and optimism. There are many shades in between. But fear is what animated me. We do not tell people only about the positive benefits of quitting smoking. We tell them about what will happen to them if they smoke. And to go back to the second world war analogy, we did not mobilise in that way because we were optimistic about the future. We mobilised in that way out of fear, because we thought nazism was an existential threat. And climate change is obviously an existential threat and it is naive to imagine we could respond to it without some people being scared. I think it is silly to throw that rhetorical tool away. My basic perspective is that any story that sticks is a good one. If you can get people engaged, it is good, however you do it.</p> <p>But I also come to this subject not as an advocate, not as an environmentalist. I have been drawn into that role to some extent as a result of this work. I come into it as a journalist and as a storyteller and, at some level, the imperative for me is to tell the story true, to tell it as I see it. As you say, and as I wrote in the book, it is simply the case that the facts are hysterical. To shy away from that, I think, is irresponsible \u2013 in part because it would encourage complacency but also from the basic truth-telling level. We know these things are true to the extent that scientists can know them. I don\u2019t think the public should be shielded from them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fdef6647deeb23fd9ad92ebd3fcb30b38424b8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fdef6647deeb23fd9ad92ebd3fcb30b38424b8d/0_0_4577_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Wallace-Wells: \u2018Air travel is the one thing that I really do feel guilty about.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Wallace-Wells: \u2018Air travel is the one thing that I really do feel guilty about.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What struck me in the book was that you shake the reader up and say, \u201cLook, wake up, get going!\u201d, and yet there isn\u2019t much there in terms of where to go next. You delved into solutions, but you didn\u2019t give them much chance of achieving anything. Do you believe there isn\u2019t much out there that could help us?</strong></p> <p>I think the book does a fair amount of hope-giving. The most important thing anybody can do is vote. If people are mobilised, we can relatively quickly usher in \u2013 perhaps not globally, but in many of the more important nations \u2013 a much stronger commitment to a more aggressive climate policy.</p> <p>My hope is that the US and China, with support from some other countries, start making dramatic investments in [negative-emissions] climate technology in the near future. I\u2019m sceptical of conventional decarbonisation. We will need these additional technologies. We need to invest in them quickly.</p> <p><strong>Putting hope in technology is the excuse </strong><strong>George HW Bush gave for not doing anything decisive in the late 1980s when he was president and it is the message of the Trump administration. You don\u2019t sound </strong><strong>as if you are aligned with them. What about a carbon tax?</strong></p> <p>We have to do everything we can. I would absolutely support a carbon tax and what we are talking about now in the US: a green new deal of massive investment in renewable energy. But when you look around the world, small taxes on carbon haven\u2019t had a meaningful impact. I think we have to learn from that and realise we need much more aggressive taxes or other solutions.</p> <p><strong>In the past year, we have seen more radical action such as student strikers led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> and protests by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/nov/22/we-cant-get-arrested-quick-enough-life-inside-extinction-rebellion-video\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>.

      "bodyText": "David Wallace-Wells\u2019s apocalyptic depiction of a world made uninhabitable by climate chaos caused an outcry when it was published in New York magazine in 2017. Based on the worst-case scenarios foreseen by science, his article portrayed a world of drought, plague and famine, in which acidified oceans drown coastal homelands, dormant diseases are released from ancient ice, conflicts surge, economies collapse, human cognitive abilities decline and heat stress becomes more intolerable in New York City than in present-day Bahrain. Critics called this irresponsibly alarmist. Supporters said it was a long-overdue antidote to climate complacency. Whatever your view, it was among the best-read climate articles in US history. Now he is back with a book-length follow-up. Jonathan Watts: You have written a hell of a book. Your now-famous opening lines \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s worse, much worse, than you think\u201d \u2013 are like a voice from a nightmare. Are you deliberately upsetting people about the climate? David Wallace-Wells: That is one of the intentions. My hope is first of all to tell the story as I see it. That has a couple of components. One is to show the crisis is happening much faster and is more all-encompassing than people think. And then also to think how those dramatic changes are going to cascade through the lives we live, the way we relate to one another, our politics, our culture, our psychology, all that stuff. I would like people to be scared of what is possible because I\u2019m scared. And because I am motivated by fear, I also hope they will be motivated. The sense of speed comes across very strongly. It is as if people have got used to seeing the climate crisis as an old horror film with slow-lurching zombies but, in your version, the zombies are the much faster, scarier ones you see in modern horror films. You address the risks of heat death, hunger, drowning, wildfire, dying oceans, economic collapse and conflict, and suggest the climate problem driving them has super-accelerated beyond what many people think. That is the thing that first opened my eyes to the change. When I learned the astonishing fact that more than half of the carbon we have emitted into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels was emitted in the past 25 years, that really shocked me. This means we have burned more fossil fuels since the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) than in all of the centuries before \u2013 so we have done more damage knowingly than we ever managed in ignorance. That is a horrifying fact. It also means we are engineering our own devastation practically in real time. How much will depend on how we act, how we behave, how we respond. The book is based on the piece you wrote for New York magazine last year that focused on worst-case climate scenarios. Were you prepared for the storm that caused? It had about 6m page views. Within a couple of days, it was the most-read article we had ever published. It was a true phenomenon. That was thrilling in a way because the conventional wisdom about climate writing \u2013 at least in American journalism \u2013 was that it was traffic Kryptonite, that nobody would read these stories. I felt that was in part because we had left a lot of storytelling tools on the table and weren\u2019t embracing a certain kind of writing that might reach people dramatically. I felt the article was a proof of concept for that. In the book, you focus more on warming of around 2-4C, which is more likely than the worst-case scenarios, though still bad enough. Was this different approach an attempt to tighten up because there was quite a lot of scientific pushback on some of the claims you made in the original article? I had anticipated a pushback. I wrote in the original article about scientific reticence and the way many researchers were reluctant to talk about their own scary findings in public in the terms they might have included in their papers. But I do not feel the science of my story was irresponsible. We ended up publishing four corrections to the piece. What it motivated me to do \u2013 and not just me, but my fact checker and the editor \u2013 was to publish this fully annotated version of the piece within a couple of days, in which we footnoted every fact with a paper. I do believe that basically answered that first reflexive criticism of the piece as being scientifically irresponsible. There were also questions about rhetoric. Scientists said your article was \u201chyperbolic\u201d and \u201cexaggerated\u201d, and your alarmism was as irresponsible as climate denial. In the book, you are unapologetic. You write: \u201cThe facts are hysterical\u201d and the only way to address them is with the language of theology and mythology. Is this Armaggeddonising a way to reach new audiences and break down barriers? Yes, and to activate people who are only casually engaged. To me, that is the most important messaging mission. It is important to mobilise people who at the moment are concerned, but basically complacent, and turn them into people who are much more activated and essentially voting about climate as a first-order political priority rather than a third- or fourth-order priority \u2013 judging politicians on the basis of their climate policy. Disruption is important. But to what extent? You talk of last year\u2019s UN IPCC 1.5C report. It is a science paper and it is sober. It spells out the huge \u2013 and horrifying \u2013 differences between 1.5C and 2C of warming, and the actions we need to take right now if we are to avoid the extra half a degree, which will require a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030. You say the message of the report is: \u201cIt\u2019s OK now to freak out.\u201d But I guess most scientists would say: \u201cDon\u2019t freak out! Act! Focus! Do not succumb to paralysing fear.\u201d Is \u201cfreak out\u201d what you really mean? The short answer is yes. We should not sit back and feel complacent that the world beyond us will figure this out without political pressure. We cannot continue on the path we are on and believe our future will be secure and stable. We need to dramatically change our climate policy globally. That was the very clear message of the UN report. You are right that, in a certain way, it was written soberly, but it is also the case that it was saying we need mobilisation on the scale that we saw in the second world war in Europe and the US \u2013 and that is not a keep-calm message. It is saying we have to light the fuse and get going. On the question of what kind of motivation is most effective, I don\u2019t believe fear and alarm are the only options; there is a place for hope and optimism. There are many shades in between. But fear is what animated me. We do not tell people only about the positive benefits of quitting smoking. We tell them about what will happen to them if they smoke. And to go back to the second world war analogy, we did not mobilise in that way because we were optimistic about the future. We mobilised in that way out of fear, because we thought nazism was an existential threat. And climate change is obviously an existential threat and it is naive to imagine we could respond to it without some people being scared. I think it is silly to throw that rhetorical tool away. My basic perspective is that any story that sticks is a good one. If you can get people engaged, it is good, however you do it. But I also come to this subject not as an advocate, not as an environmentalist. I have been drawn into that role to some extent as a result of this work. I come into it as a journalist and as a storyteller and, at some level, the imperative for me is to tell the story true, to tell it as I see it. As you say, and as I wrote in the book, it is simply the case that the facts are hysterical. To shy away from that, I think, is irresponsible \u2013 in part because it would encourage complacency but also from the basic truth-telling level. We know these things are true to the extent that scientists can know them. I don\u2019t think the public should be shielded from them. What struck me in the book was that you shake the reader up and say, \u201cLook, wake up, get going!\u201d, and yet there isn\u2019t much there in terms of where to go next. You delved into solutions, but you didn\u2019t give them much chance of achieving anything. Do you believe there isn\u2019t much out there that could help us? I think the book does a fair amount of hope-giving. The most important thing anybody can do is vote. If people are mobilised, we can relatively quickly usher in \u2013 perhaps not globally, but in many of the more important nations \u2013 a much stronger commitment to a more aggressive climate policy. My hope is that the US and China, with support from some other countries, start making dramatic investments in [negative-emissions] climate technology in the near future. I\u2019m sceptical of conventional decarbonisation. We will need these additional technologies. We need to invest in them quickly. Putting hope in technology is the excuse George HW Bush gave for not doing anything decisive in the late 1980s when he was president and it is the message of the Trump administration. You don\u2019t sound as if you are aligned with them. What about a carbon tax? We have to do everything we can. I would absolutely support a carbon tax and what we are talking about now in the US: a green new deal of massive investment in renewable energy. But when you look around the world, small taxes on carbon haven\u2019t had a meaningful impact. I think we have to learn from that and realise we need much more aggressive taxes or other solutions. In the past year, we have seen more radical action such as student strikers led by Greta Thunberg and protests by Extinction Rebellion. Do you think groups like this are useful? Absolutely. I\u2019m an enormous admirer of Thunberg and I am in awe of how much energy and attention Extinction Rebellion has generated in such a short time. I think their imperative to tell the truth is very important and powerful. Would you join? They are organising another major event soon in New York that I will be going to.

Years ago, I was accidentally given a vegan meal on an aircraft and it was terrible. But I\u2019ve found it a complete untruth that vegan food is tasteless. I\u2019ve discovered so many new flavoursome foods: vegan pies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/10/the-mysterious-momentum-of-boris-and-tofu-sausages\" title=\"\">tofu sausages</a> and some fantastic chocolate. Vegan cheese might not satisfy a cheese connoisseur, but it\u2019s fine for a decent cheese sandwich.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also learned that our food labelling is extremely poor. Some foods labelled \u201cvegetarian\u201d are actually vegan, and many vegan foods are not labelled at all. Without Google, I would\u2019ve been hopelessly lost \u2013 I\u2019d check a brand and find the answer on a website somewhere. Perhaps a third of biscuits are vegan, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. Original Hobnobs are vegan but some Digestives aren\u2019t. Manufacturers are missing a trick.</p> <p>So are snack food outlets. The likes of Pret, Costa and Eat all have vegan food, but try finding it when rushing through a crowded station cafe.</p> <p>One of the triumphs of Veganuary is that I repeatedly tried to buy a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll\" title=\"\">Greggs vegan sausage roll</a> and failed every time. While I was working in Bristol, I rang six branches of Greggs and all of them had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/07/greggs-vegan-sausage-roll-brexit-britain-culture-wars\" title=\"\">sold out</a>. There\u2019s a huge appetite for vegan food, and restaurants and pubs are getting the message. I was surprised by how many are suddenly offering vegan menus \u2013 in Veganuary, at least. Chasing the vegan pound is increasingly smart business.</p> <p>Which brings me to farmers. Will our changing diets put farmers out of business? The downside of my Veganuary was that I received a vicious backlash on social media from some meat producers. Several farmers made good critical points about me eating processed vegan food that has been flown around the world. I bought vegan food wrapped in plastic. Some vegan food is industrially farmed. Some vegan food contains palm oil. If we want to eat ethically, it takes a lot of research.</p> <p>Ethical, environmentally friendly eating is a far more complex issue than just becoming vegan. If Britain switched instantaneously to a plant-based diet and we ripped out all the pastures and flower-rich meadows and hedgerows, and planted maize and sprayed crops with chemicals, it would be an ecological disaster.</p> <p>But we\u2019ve got to help farmers move towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2019/jan/30/farmers-vegan-science-behind-changing-your-mind\" title=\"\">higher animal welfare</a> and environmental standards. Put simply: we have to create a distinction between good and bad farmers. During Veganuary, I was contacted by some farmers who are producing higher quality, less intensively reared, high-welfare meat to sell at a premium. I visited one organic farmer friend. He fears that meat-eaters will forsake his produce for industrially farmed meat from supermarkets, and that good farmers will go out of business. Labels on meat and dairy products showing the conditions in which the animals are reared \u2013 like those graphic warnings on cigarette packets \u2013 would help good farmers. And instead of bemoaning their lost heritage or berating me on Twitter, high-welfare, environmentally friendly farmers need to unite and develop a brand so consumers will choose their high-grade meat over factory-farmed rubbish.</p> <p>I am not suggesting that we all go vegan overnight. Lots of people on social media told me they would go vegan three or four days a week. That, for me, is what Veganuary was all about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/vegan-william-sitwell-waitrose-meat-plant\">Meat martyrs be warned: the vegans will inherit the Earth | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But because I haven\u2019t declared all livestock farmers are evil, and because I\u2019m not perfect, I also received vitriol from ultra-vegans.

You\u2019re never going to win an argument by insulting and belittling people.

I\u2019m not going to take Scratchy outside and shoot him. I\u2019m not about to burn my leather belts and shoes. To do so would be a waste of resources and just leads to the thing we\u2019re trying to avoid \u2013 more consumption.

But I\u2019ve found it a complete untruth that vegan food is tasteless. I\u2019ve discovered so many new flavoursome foods: vegan pies, tofu sausages and some fantastic chocolate. Vegan cheese might not satisfy a cheese connoisseur, but it\u2019s fine for a decent cheese sandwich. I\u2019ve also learned that our food labelling is extremely poor. Some foods labelled \u201cvegetarian\u201d are actually vegan, and many vegan foods are not labelled at all. Without Google, I would\u2019ve been hopelessly lost \u2013 I\u2019d check a brand and find the answer on a website somewhere. Perhaps a third of biscuits are vegan, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. Original Hobnobs are vegan but some Digestives aren\u2019t. Manufacturers are missing a trick. So are snack food outlets. The likes of Pret, Costa and Eat all have vegan food, but try finding it when rushing through a crowded station cafe. One of the triumphs of Veganuary is that I repeatedly tried to buy a Greggs vegan sausage roll and failed every time. While I was working in Bristol, I rang six branches of Greggs and all of them had sold out. There\u2019s a huge appetite for vegan food, and restaurants and pubs are getting the message. I was surprised by how many are suddenly offering vegan menus \u2013 in Veganuary, at least. Chasing the vegan pound is increasingly smart business. Which brings me to farmers. Will our changing diets put farmers out of business? The downside of my Veganuary was that I received a vicious backlash on social media from some meat producers. Several farmers made good critical points about me eating processed vegan food that has been flown around the world. I bought vegan food wrapped in plastic. Some vegan food is industrially farmed. Some vegan food contains palm oil. If we want to eat ethically, it takes a lot of research. Ethical, environmentally friendly eating is a far more complex issue than just becoming vegan. If Britain switched instantaneously to a plant-based diet and we ripped out all the pastures and flower-rich meadows and hedgerows, and planted maize and sprayed crops with chemicals, it would be an ecological disaster. But we\u2019ve got to help farmers move towards higher animal welfare and environmental standards. Put simply: we have to create a distinction between good and bad farmers. During Veganuary, I was contacted by some farmers who are producing higher quality, less intensively reared, high-welfare meat to sell at a premium. I visited one organic farmer friend. He fears that meat-eaters will forsake his produce for industrially farmed meat from supermarkets, and that good farmers will go out of business. Labels on meat and dairy products showing the conditions in which the animals are reared \u2013 like those graphic warnings on cigarette packets \u2013 would help good farmers. And instead of bemoaning their lost heritage or berating me on Twitter, high-welfare, environmentally friendly farmers need to unite and develop a brand so consumers will choose their high-grade meat over factory-farmed rubbish. I am not suggesting that we all go vegan overnight. Lots of people on social media told me they would go vegan three or four days a week. That, for me, is what Veganuary was all about. But because I haven\u2019t declared all livestock farmers are evil, and because I\u2019m not perfect, I also received vitriol from ultra-vegans. I was called a \u201ccow rapist\u201d. People told me I can\u2019t be vegan and have my dog, Scratchy. The intolerance of ultra-vegans is so off-putting. You\u2019re never going to win an argument by insulting and belittling people. A small minority make a lot of nasty noise. Three days into February, I haven\u2019t eaten anything non-vegan yet. I\u2019m staying vegan. But I\u2019m not listening to the ultras and I\u2019ll draw my own lines in the sand. I don\u2019t see a problem with eating locally produced honey, for instance. I\u2019m not going to take Scratchy outside and shoot him. I\u2019m not about to burn my leather belts and shoes. To do so would be a waste of resources and just leads to the thing we\u2019re trying to avoid \u2013 more consumption. But when my leather shoes wear out, I\u2019ll seek a \u201cvegan\u201d alternative. And I\u2019m definitely going to continue devouring tofu sausages, vegan pies and that amazing chocolate. \u2022 Chris Packham is a naturalist, nature photographer and author",

Dismissing this notion, or pretending that progress made with social inequality negates the point, is intellectually dishonest at best. Without question, racism is fully present in America. Yet it appears the impetus to publicly demand accountability for racism is largely commenced by blatant examples, rather than practices and policies that directly harm people of color. The recent conversations around Virginia governor Ralph Northam fully illustrate this point. A photo from a 1984 yearbook shows a man in blackface standing next to a person dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. It was made public on Friday. In response, the governor seemingly declared that he was in the photo, though he did not say which man was him. The following day, he said he was not in the photo, but mentioned that he once wore a dark shoe polish on his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.

This absolutely warrants the public outcry it is receiving, and demanding our leaders be held accountable for their actions is the mark of a healthy democracy.

      "body": "<p>If you want to make yourself depressed about the state of politics, go on Twitter and search for Jess Phillips. Last Monday, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley stood up in the House of Commons during the immigration bill debate. The House was largely empty \u2013 \u201cThe reason I got to speak for so long is that there weren\u2019t that many people down to speak,\u201d she says several days later \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jan/31/jess-phillips-on-skilled-workers-ive-met-high-earners-with-literally-no-discernible-skills\" title=\"\">and gave a speech that was witty</a>, commonsense to the point of being self-evident, and yet principled in a way that made you ache for a time when it was normal for MPs to give a straightforward defence of Labour values.</p> \n<p>She started by puncturing the absurd new Conservative \u201cskills\u201d yardstick, which characterises everyone earning less than 30 grand as \u201cunskilled labour\u201d; that would be news, she said dispassionately, to the nurses, care workers and teachers in her constituency, and across the country. To show how disconnected the Tories are, she went on to talk about class: \u201cI thought I had met posh people before I came here, but I had actually just met people who eat olives.\u201d Since her election in 2015, she said that she had encountered true wealth, people on salaries beyond imagination, \u201cwith literally no discernible skills, not even one\u201d. People she wouldn\u2019t trust to hold her pint because they wouldn\u2019t do it right.</p> \n<p>The politics of what she was saying was deeply important: one of the striking features of the past 10 years of political discourse is that it has become routine to elide wealth and worth, to classify people in poverty as on a spectrum between \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201cfeckless\u201d, and rich people as superior by definition. But what was immediately striking was how funny it was; I can\u2019t remember a time I have laughed out loud during a parliamentary debate. She takes this, talking to me down the line from her constituency office in Birmingham, without false modesty. \u201cThere are quite a lot of staid jokes that have been workshopped to death before PMQs and the autumn statement \u2013 every chancellor seems to want to quip as if the economy\u2019s top bantz. But it\u2019s not usually humour.\u201d</p> \n<p>The line about the olives is so good, it sounds as if it must have been scripted, but that is not her way: she had just three bullet points scribbled on the back of a piece of paper. What made her speech really powerful though, rather than merely droll, was the passion that informed it; the raw outrage at a bill that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/18/cabinet-stand-off-over-30000-threshold-for-skilled-migrants\" title=\"\">ends freedom of movement and restricts visas for EU citizens to those earning more than \u00a330,000</a>, excluding many key workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"054e6c87-eecb-46c6-a2ab-87f8bb38c257\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPjdnMF3C-s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the speech that the country had been waiting to hear, quickly reaching 2m hits and covered by everyone from the satirical website the Poke to Elle. \u201cThe reason it had all those views is because people, even if they don\u2019t agree with it, would think it\u2019s good that people are saying what they think. Rather than never saying migration is good, in case you get abuse. Any MP who deals with immigration a huge amount, which I do, is going to worry about giving powers to the executive to change immigration law without scrutiny.\u201d</p> \n<p>Phillips, 37, has always been deeply unpopular with the Corbyn wing of Labour, for reasons that are obvious without necessarily being clear. She has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/14/labour-mp-jess-phillips-knife-corbyn-vote-loser-general-election\" title=\"\">criticised him in public, in the strongest terms</a>: she was comfortable sitting on a sofa in a TV studio, saying she didn\u2019t think he should be leader. Her stance was that she was a pragmatist, and he simply wasn\u2019t a practical choice. It was irritating because it had that circular logic of the classic centrist position: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he a practical choice? Because people won\u2019t vote for him. Why won\u2019t they vote for him? Because he isn\u2019t practical.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet Phillips is not, politically, a \u201ccentrist\u201d \u2013 even if we could all somehow agree on what that meant. \u201cI do find it funny, actually, why I\u2019m not more of a Corbyn fan. I am a classic Corbyn fan, really. Not so much on the foreign policy, but I\u2019m leftwing, pro-immigration, pro-welfare spending, there\u2019s very little that we wouldn\u2019t agree on.\u201d She has friends across various cliques of the Labour party, on both sides \u2013 not the leader of the opposition\u2019s inner circle, but from the soft-left to the soft-right. But she would say herself, and others say it of her, that she is not really a member of any of these factions. She has never been behind any coup, never been at the vanguard of any serious movement against Corbyn. And yet she has become a lightning rod for criticism of this type of Labour MP, who will stop at nothing to undermine its member-mandated leader. She says other MPs invite her to speak with members at their constituency meetings because her presence is so toxic to Corbyn-loyalists, they won\u2019t turn up \u2013 and so there won\u2019t be any fighting. \u201cI\u2019m like one of those blue rings in a fish and chip shop that attracts the flies. I will keep away people who are going to be angry.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Phillips doesn\u2019t actually typify anyone but herself. \u201cHonestly, I think part of that is because I\u2019m a working-class woman. I\u2019m called a class traitor, but the people saying it are largely not working class. I was never a ringleader, but I was willing, when asked questions, to give my opinion. And when you say things quite bluntly, it\u2019s very easy for people to hang their hats on that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019m a working-class woman. I\u2019m called a class traitor \u2013 but the people saying it are largely not working class</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>On this issue of class, as she alluded to with the olives, parliament has been quite a challenge for her. She now sometimes calls herself working-class, which she never would have done before. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made it. Because I sometimes shopped in Waitrose, I thought I was actually quite posh. I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019m basically a scullery maid. Even the middle-class people who I meet in parliament, people who live in London \u2013 which I think is remarkable because how can anybody afford to live there \u2013 seem much, much more middle class than me.\u201d</p> \n<p>To go back to this knotty immigration debate: why was her speech taken as treachery, when it is nothing you wouldn\u2019t expect to hear from Corbyn himself? Why was the house so empty, for that matter, when the bill is so consequential? \u201cWe weren\u2019t whipped to be there, and a lot of MPs don\u2019t even leave their constituencies on a Monday if they\u2019re not whipped.\u201d Labour\u2019s position, originally, in a move that blankly horrified its left outriders, was to abstain on the bill. They had some technical reasoning \u2013 they would abstain on the second reading, put in amendments later \u2013 but it was stunningly reminiscent of the time Harriet Harman, as acting leader after Ed Miliband stepped down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/21/labour-disarray-welfare-48-mps-defy-whips\" title=\"\">abstained on the welfare bill</a>: it felt like a complete abnegation of responsibility, a failure of values.</p> \n<p>This time around, Diane Abbott, who has fought for the rights of immigrants all her life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/labour-in-embarrassing-u-turn-over-immigration-bill-vote\" title=\"\">stood up and gave Labour\u2019s intention to abstain</a>. \u201cAs I was walking in, somebody said, we\u2019re not voting against this, and I was like, what? But my attention to detail, as to what our whip is, is that I usually find out as the bell rings.\u201d Whether it was anger from Labour MPs, or a broader storm raging on social media, but something changed Labour\u2019s position, so that by the time Anna Soubry stood up, an hour into the debate, they were whipping against the bill.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea16e27c2d04b5fcc80aa1a6a41f31e0e16ce995\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea16e27c2d04b5fcc80aa1a6a41f31e0e16ce995/0_203_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Labour\u2019s Women In For Britain Campaign team (Phillips, fourth from left), June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Labour\u2019s Women In For Britain Campaign team (Phillips, fourth from right), June 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMorally, I would have really struggled to abstain,\u201d says Phillips. (In the background, I can hear the surgery happening in her constituency office and there is a surprising amount of shouting.) \u201cThis is not Jeremy Corbyn of old. And it is not Diane Abbott of old, yet presumably they were the two people who made this decision. Diane would never have voted for this bill. I felt really sad for her. I felt really sad that she had been put in that position. This is not to suggest she\u2019s being steamrollered by the leadership. But I think maybe they have lost their way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ever since Phillips said she had <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-mp-jess-phillips-told-diane-abbott-to-f-off-in-jeremy-corbyn-sexism-row-10505493.html\" title=\"\">told Abbott to fuck off</a> in 2015, and Abbott said it was a fiction, there has been no love lost between the two. But Phillips bears no obvious animus towards Corbyn. \u201cI can\u2019t even really answer how I feel about him now, because the worst of it is, I don\u2019t really feel anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>The atmosphere of uncharacteristic and uncomfortable compromise, of confusion as the party flips between principles and tactics, goes further than this one bill. \u201cBeing really honest was what sold Jeremy Corbyn to quite a lot of people. And there is a feeling of a slight dishonesty about what he might actually think. Because he can\u2019t have not wanted to vote against the immigration bill, let\u2019s be honest.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s sad \u2026 and a product of a hung parliament. Everybody becomes a bit of a freelancer. So you\u2019ve got 650 freelance MPs, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a team going over the wall together.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I can\u2019t even really answer how I feel about Corbyn now, because the worst of it is, I don\u2019t really feel anything</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>You have to take this with a pinch of salt, of course; Phillips has never had any observable loyalty to Corbyn\u2019s leadership. But senior sources in Labour and Momentum suggest that there is an active strategy of soft whipping, so that backbenchers can go their own way, and nothing that proceeds from it will ever be pinned on Corbyn. Which, of course, is more about Brexit than it is about a hung parliament. The policy to push for a general election or, if that fails, to campaign for a referendum with a remain option, looks as though it is unspooling, with the most vocal members of the Labour frontbench speaking out against a second vote. In its absence \u2013 and taking a general election as unlikely \u2013 some variant of either May\u2019s Brexit or a no-deal Brexit becomes inevitable. Given that those choices range from unpopular to catastrophic, nobody really wants their fingerprints on any of it.</p> \n<p>Phillips is in favour of a final say, though characteristically she is not actually part of the People\u2019s Vote team. \u201cI\u2019m no zealot. I didn\u2019t come to the People\u2019s Vote literally the day after the referendum. It\u2019s only been in the past six months, when we started to get into real deadlock in parliament. I realised that there was no path through. Once we had her deal, Theresa May really did unite the country against the deal. And I trust the people who live in my constituency more than the people I sit among, at the moment. They genuinely are more sensible and pragmatic. MPs like to project on to them, as if they\u2019re an angry mob. And they\u2019re really not. I\u2019m saying that in a leave seat. People aren\u2019t impassioned about it. They don\u2019t really talk to me about it, they just cover it like the weather and move on.\u201d She says that in the thousands of conversations she and her colleagues had in her constituency before the 2017 election, Brexit came up only 12 times unprompted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/01/jess-phillips-speech-labour-mp\">The secret to Jess Phillips\u2019s great political speech? Wit and authenticity | Anne Perkins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Phillips is not sanguine about what that vote would look like: she worries about \u201cdark forces stirring up dissent\u201d. She fantasises instead about a perfect election, which would happen in a fortnight, with Facebook shut down: \u201cIn fact, turn the internet off and just send everyone a list of facts that are true.\u201d</p> \n<p>And she can hardly be blind to the risks, that are so often mentioned, of the outrage of the far-right \u2013 Jo Cox was a friend of hers and Phillips is the target of a huge amount of abuse online. She flips between waving it off as nothing \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see the blanket aggression that people keep telling me exists\u201d \u2013 and voicing genuine anxiety: \u201cWhen my resilience is low, personal safety becomes ever present in my mind. But, notwithstanding that Jo was killed in her constituency, I feel differently when I\u2019m in Birmingham. People know me; I grew up here, I feel protected.\u201d</p> \n<p>I have heard it floated that the reason so many remain Labour MPs don\u2019t want a second referendum is due to the sheer nastiness of the first one. The murder of a colleague is no trivial thing. Phillips is impatient with arguments about national division. \u201cI think it\u2019s rubbish to say: \u2018This is difficult, we should only do easy things.\u2019\u201d She opposes Brexit because of the car industry, which has already taken an incredible hit, and because of its implications for immigration. But it would take more than this crisis to prise her away from her pragmatism. \u201cIf it was 28 March, and the option was a deal or no deal, then yes, I would vote for a deal. I would have to.\u201d It would be a sad place to land, however. \u201cI wish that there was both an impassioned and dispassionate approach, to look at the data, listen to the different opinions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wondering if this is a long-range leadership bid, I ask who she fancies as the next leader. She is resolute, and believably so, that she doesn\u2019t want the job; it looks too hard on the soul. And the candidacy is solidifying around Angela Rayner or Emily Thornberry \u2013 between the two, she would pick Rayner: \u201cShe let me sleep on her floor for the first three weeks I was in parliament, and that has to count for something.\u201d</p> \n<p>For all that Phillips is a hate figure for the left, she still seems to me to be on the left. And if there is one thing to be said for blunt people, it is that you don\u2019t have to ceaselessly interpret them. When the day comes, she will back a woman to be leader \u2013 and it won\u2019t be her. </p>",

      "bodyText": "If you want to make yourself depressed about the state of politics, go on Twitter and search for Jess Phillips. Last Monday, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley stood up in the House of Commons during the immigration bill debate. The House was largely empty \u2013 \u201cThe reason I got to speak for so long is that there weren\u2019t that many people down to speak,\u201d she says several days later \u2013 and gave a speech that was witty, commonsense to the point of being self-evident, and yet principled in a way that made you ache for a time when it was normal for MPs to give a straightforward defence of Labour values. She started by puncturing the absurd new Conservative \u201cskills\u201d yardstick, which characterises everyone earning less than 30 grand as \u201cunskilled labour\u201d; that would be news, she said dispassionately, to the nurses, care workers and teachers in her constituency, and across the country. To show how disconnected the Tories are, she went on to talk about class: \u201cI thought I had met posh people before I came here, but I had actually just met people who eat olives.\u201d Since her election in 2015, she said that she had encountered true wealth, people on salaries beyond imagination, \u201cwith literally no discernible skills, not even one\u201d. People she wouldn\u2019t trust to hold her pint because they wouldn\u2019t do it right. The politics of what she was saying was deeply important: one of the striking features of the past 10 years of political discourse is that it has become routine to elide wealth and worth, to classify people in poverty as on a spectrum between \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201cfeckless\u201d, and rich people as superior by definition. But what was immediately striking was how funny it was; I can\u2019t remember a time I have laughed out loud during a parliamentary debate. She takes this, talking to me down the line from her constituency office in Birmingham, without false modesty. \u201cThere are quite a lot of staid jokes that have been workshopped to death before PMQs and the autumn statement \u2013 every chancellor seems to want to quip as if the economy\u2019s top bantz. But it\u2019s not usually humour.\u201d The line about the olives is so good, it sounds as if it must have been scripted, but that is not her way: she had just three bullet points scribbled on the back of a piece of paper. What made her speech really powerful though, rather than merely droll, was the passion that informed it; the raw outrage at a bill that ends freedom of movement and restricts visas for EU citizens to those earning more than \u00a330,000, excluding many key workers. It was the speech that the country had been waiting to hear, quickly reaching 2m hits and covered by everyone from the satirical website the Poke to Elle. \u201cThe reason it had all those views is because people, even if they don\u2019t agree with it, would think it\u2019s good that people are saying what they think. Rather than never saying migration is good, in case you get abuse. Any MP who deals with immigration a huge amount, which I do, is going to worry about giving powers to the executive to change immigration law without scrutiny.\u201d Phillips, 37, has always been deeply unpopular with the Corbyn wing of Labour, for reasons that are obvious without necessarily being clear. She has criticised him in public, in the strongest terms: she was comfortable sitting on a sofa in a TV studio, saying she didn\u2019t think he should be leader. Her stance was that she was a pragmatist, and he simply wasn\u2019t a practical choice. It was irritating because it had that circular logic of the classic centrist position: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he a practical choice? Because people won\u2019t vote for him. Why won\u2019t they vote for him? Because he isn\u2019t practical.\u201d Yet Phillips is not, politically, a \u201ccentrist\u201d \u2013 even if we could all somehow agree on what that meant. \u201cI do find it funny, actually, why I\u2019m not more of a Corbyn fan. I am a classic Corbyn fan, really. Not so much on the foreign policy, but I\u2019m leftwing, pro-immigration, pro-welfare spending, there\u2019s very little that we wouldn\u2019t agree on.\u201d She has friends across various cliques of the Labour party, on both sides \u2013 not the leader of the opposition\u2019s inner circle, but from the soft-left to the soft-right. But she would say herself, and others say it of her, that she is not really a member of any of these factions. She has never been behind any coup, never been at the vanguard of any serious movement against Corbyn. And yet she has become a lightning rod for criticism of this type of Labour MP, who will stop at nothing to undermine its member-mandated leader. She says other MPs invite her to speak with members at their constituency meetings because her presence is so toxic to Corbyn-loyalists, they won\u2019t turn up \u2013 and so there won\u2019t be any fighting. \u201cI\u2019m like one of those blue rings in a fish and chip shop that attracts the flies. I will keep away people who are going to be angry.\u201d But Phillips doesn\u2019t actually typify anyone but herself. \u201cHonestly, I think part of that is because I\u2019m a working-class woman. I\u2019m called a class traitor, but the people saying it are largely not working class. I was never a ringleader, but I was willing, when asked questions, to give my opinion. And when you say things quite bluntly, it\u2019s very easy for people to hang their hats on that.\u201d On this issue of class, as she alluded to with the olives, parliament has been quite a challenge for her. She now sometimes calls herself working-class, which she never would have done before. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made it. Because I sometimes shopped in Waitrose, I thought I was actually quite posh. I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019m basically a scullery maid. Even the middle-class people who I meet in parliament, people who live in London \u2013 which I think is remarkable because how can anybody afford to live there \u2013 seem much, much more middle class than me.\u201d To go back to this knotty immigration debate: why was her speech taken as treachery, when it is nothing you wouldn\u2019t expect to hear from Corbyn himself? Why was the house so empty, for that matter, when the bill is so consequential? \u201cWe weren\u2019t whipped to be there, and a lot of MPs don\u2019t even leave their constituencies on a Monday if they\u2019re not whipped.\u201d Labour\u2019s position, originally, in a move that blankly horrified its left outriders, was to abstain on the bill. They had some technical reasoning \u2013 they would abstain on the second reading, put in amendments later \u2013 but it was stunningly reminiscent of the time Harriet Harman, as acting leader after Ed Miliband stepped down, abstained on the welfare bill: it felt like a complete abnegation of responsibility, a failure of values. This time around, Diane Abbott, who has fought for the rights of immigrants all her life, stood up and gave Labour\u2019s intention to abstain. \u201cAs I was walking in, somebody said, we\u2019re not voting against this, and I was like, what? But my attention to detail, as to what our whip is, is that I usually find out as the bell rings.\u201d Whether it was anger from Labour MPs, or a broader storm raging on social media, but something changed Labour\u2019s position, so that by the time Anna Soubry stood up, an hour into the debate, they were whipping against the bill. \u201cMorally, I would have really struggled to abstain,\u201d says Phillips. (In the background, I can hear the surgery happening in her constituency office and there is a surprising amount of shouting.) \u201cThis is not Jeremy Corbyn of old. And it is not Diane Abbott of old, yet presumably they were the two people who made this decision. Diane would never have voted for this bill. I felt really sad for her. I felt really sad that she had been put in that position. This is not to suggest she\u2019s being steamrollered by the leadership. But I think maybe they have lost their way.\u201d Ever since Phillips said she had told Abbott to fuck off in 2015, and Abbott said it was a fiction, there has been no love lost between the two. But Phillips bears no obvious animus towards Corbyn. \u201cI can\u2019t even really answer how I feel about him now, because the worst of it is, I don\u2019t really feel anything.\u201d The atmosphere of uncharacteristic and uncomfortable compromise, of confusion as the party flips between principles and tactics, goes further than this one bill. \u201cBeing really honest was what sold Jeremy Corbyn to quite a lot of people. And there is a feeling of a slight dishonesty about what he might actually think. Because he can\u2019t have not wanted to vote against the immigration bill, let\u2019s be honest. It\u2019s sad \u2026 and a product of a hung parliament. Everybody becomes a bit of a freelancer. So you\u2019ve got 650 freelance MPs, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a team going over the wall together.\u201d You have to take this with a pinch of salt, of course; Phillips has never had any observable loyalty to Corbyn\u2019s leadership. But senior sources in Labour and Momentum suggest that there is an active strategy of soft whipping, so that backbenchers can go their own way, and nothing that proceeds from it will ever be pinned on Corbyn. Which, of course, is more about Brexit than it is about a hung parliament. The policy to push for a general election or, if that fails, to campaign for a referendum with a remain option, looks as though it is unspooling, with the most vocal members of the Labour frontbench speaking out against a second vote. In its absence \u2013 and taking a general election as unlikely \u2013 some variant of either May\u2019s Brexit or a no-deal Brexit becomes inevitable. Given that those choices range from unpopular to catastrophic, nobody really wants their fingerprints on any of it. Phillips is in favour of a final say, though characteristically she is not actually part of the People\u2019s Vote team. \u201cI\u2019m no zealot. I didn\u2019t come to the People\u2019s Vote literally the day after the referendum. It\u2019s only been in the past six months, when we started to get into real deadlock in parliament. I realised that there was no path through. Once we had her deal, Theresa May really did unite the country against the deal. And I trust the people who live in my constituency more than the people I sit among, at the moment. They genuinely are more sensible and pragmatic. MPs like to project on to them, as if they\u2019re an angry mob. And they\u2019re really not. I\u2019m saying that in a leave seat. People aren\u2019t impassioned about it. They don\u2019t really talk to me about it, they just cover it like the weather and move on.\u201d She says that in the thousands of conversations she and her colleagues had in her constituency before the 2017 election, Brexit came up only 12 times unprompted. Phillips is not sanguine about what that vote would look like: she worries about \u201cdark forces stirring up dissent\u201d. She fantasises instead about a perfect election, which would happen in a fortnight, with Facebook shut down: \u201cIn fact, turn the internet off and just send everyone a list of facts that are true.\u201d And she can hardly be blind to the risks, that are so often mentioned, of the outrage of the far-right \u2013 Jo Cox was a friend of hers and Phillips is the target of a huge amount of abuse online. She flips between waving it off as nothing \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see the blanket aggression that people keep telling me exists\u201d \u2013 and voicing genuine anxiety: \u201cWhen my resilience is low, personal safety becomes ever present in my mind. But, notwithstanding that Jo was killed in her constituency, I feel differently when I\u2019m in Birmingham. People know me; I grew up here, I feel protected.\u201d I have heard it floated that the reason so many remain Labour MPs don\u2019t want a second referendum is due to the sheer nastiness of the first one. The murder of a colleague is no trivial thing. Phillips is impatient with arguments about national division. \u201cI think it\u2019s rubbish to say: \u2018This is difficult, we should only do easy things.\u2019\u201d She opposes Brexit because of the car industry, which has already taken an incredible hit, and because of its implications for immigration. But it would take more than this crisis to prise her away from her pragmatism. \u201cIf it was 28 March, and the option was a deal or no deal, then yes, I would vote for a deal. I would have to.\u201d It would be a sad place to land, however. \u201cI wish that there was both an impassioned and dispassionate approach, to look at the data, listen to the different opinions.\u201d Wondering if this is a long-range leadership bid, I ask who she fancies as the next leader. She is resolute, and believably so, that she doesn\u2019t want the job; it looks too hard on the soul. And the candidacy is solidifying around Angela Rayner or Emily Thornberry \u2013 between the two, she would pick Rayner: \u201cShe let me sleep on her floor for the first three weeks I was in parliament, and that has to count for something.\u201d For all that Phillips is a hate figure for the left, she still seems to me to be on the left. And if there is one thing to be said for blunt people, it is that you don\u2019t have to ceaselessly interpret them. When the day comes, she will back a woman to be leader \u2013 and it won\u2019t be her.",

JPI Media, owner of the i newspaper, the Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and about 200 more titles, was founded last November from the ashes of Johnston Press after it went into administration.

      "bodyText": "The question most asked by journalists just now, aside from the routine one about Brexit, is how their trade will be funded in future. Indeed, at local level, there is increasing concern about whether there will be any trade at all. Look at the state of the big three regional publishers. JPI Media, owner of the i newspaper, the Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and about 200 more titles, was founded last November from the ashes of Johnston Press after it went into administration. It began this year by announcing a series of cover price rises and followed up with a review aimed at relocating offices and merging newsrooms (a euphemism for reducing journalistic staff). Newsquest, publisher of 165 \u201cnews brands\u201d across Britain, including the Herald in Glasgow, the South Wales Argus and the Echo in Southampton, is owned by the US media giant Gannett. It is now the target of a hostile takeover bid by a company known for aggressive cutting of jobs, which is ultimately controlled by a New York hedge fund without a shred of interest in journalistic output. Reach, the largest of the trio with about 260 titles including the national Mirror brands and leading papers in Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, is trading profitably but regularly closes or merges titles. Three \u2013 in Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire \u2013 went last week. Drip by drip by drip, the print \u201cplatforms\u201d disappear and with them go journalists, thereby restricting the replacement online coverage, some of which, it should be said, remains of excellent quality. When the government\u2019s review into the sustainability of high-quality journalism was launched last year, it was claimed that newspapers produced more original journalism than broadcasters and websites combined. That review, led by Dame Frances Cairncross, is continuing to take evidence amid what is rightly described as a crisis. She will surely have noted the latest news that old media\u2019s digital competitors, based in the US but also attempting to serve British audiences, are finding it difficult to fund journalism.

The race, held every April, now attracts some of the biggest names in the sport. I wasn\u2019t about to attempt that, but joining one of Daniel\u2019s tours, which involves sight-seeing at your own running pace, seemed a good way to get my bearings quickly.</p> <p>It was also a good historical primer, with Daniel filling me in. He told me that Madeira was first discovered by Portuguese explorers in 1419, exactly 600 years ago; that it was colonised around five years later; and that, by the end of the 15th century, it had already become a major producer of sugar cane. This was thanks, in part, to its <em>levadas</em>, manmade channels built to carry water from the sponge-like laurel forests to the thirsty cane fields. Today, more than 2,000km of levadas permeate the island, providing both irrigation and an extensive network of footpaths. Daniel and I ran alongside a levada that wound through Funchal\u2019s suburbs. We followed it through quiet lanes and banana palms. And we followed its vertiginous course high above the Socorridos valley, ducking through tunnels and, briefly, hanging in mid-air, with only a railing between us and the sheer drop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca04a2f1e80956bea5b9bb1bcccb1cff097a33e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca04a2f1e80956bea5b9bb1bcccb1cff097a33e0/0_386_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ribeira Brava valley on Madeira\u2019s north coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ribeira Brava valley on Madeira\u2019s north coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madeira was certainly turning out to be more thrilling than most give it credit for. Especially, as I found the next day, if you go on a jeep jaunt with Ricardo Carvalho. The top of a large, ancient shield volcano, Madeira is a geological drunk: its land seems unable to stand, always rising or falling, seldom flat. Negotiating this by 4WD, with a guide adept at not crashing on precarious backroads, is ideal. Ricardo took me on a tour around the east of the island, zipping round hairpins while showing off the sites.</p> <p>We stopped to stretch our legs at the damp Ribeiro Frio, where a levada led via moss-draped forest to a misty lookout. Then we descended to Santana, where sunshine blazed over the town\u2019s traditional triangular houses. All around, steep terraces nurtured vegetables and ripening vines, while spring wildflowers exploded \u2013 jasmine, mimosa and red-hot poker, African daisy and Echium candicans, aka the Pride of Madeira.</p> <p>We drove through the town of Machico, where those first explorers landed 600 years ago, where the MIUT race ends and where Ricardo was born. \u201cI have pirate blood,\u201d he told me as we passed Machico\u2019s beach. \u201cPirates often landed here; in the years after raids, many births were registered as \u2018unknown father\u2019 \u2013 including one of my ancestors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ffcc1f450f28d1063c93692a74b4120111e4c263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffcc1f450f28d1063c93692a74b4120111e4c263/0_0_6326_3797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parque Natural do Ribeiro Frio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parque Natural do Ribeiro Frio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Sack/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a second job, Ricardo does historical research for the sleek <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/museu.baleia.madeira\" title=\"\">Museu da Baleia</a> in the fishing village of Cani\u00e7al. \u201cThis used to be a whaling base,\u201d Ricardo explained as we moved between displays on the island\u2019s whaling history. The old wooden boats, smaller than many of the whales they hunted, reinforced how dangerous a profession this was for both sailor and whale. Fortunately, whale-watching is less problematic. Trips run year-round on Madeira, with spring the best time to see fin whales and striped dolphins.</p> <p>However, I stuck to land. You can, of course, come here and just chill in the sun and explore at a gentle pace, but my plan was to fit lots of activity into a short amount of time. I walked the Vereda do Larano, a precipitous trail hewn from steep seacliffs, with dramatic views towards the island\u2019s wave-crashed far east, and hiked up from the natural sea pools of north-westerly Porto Moniz to Fanal, a plateau cloaked in Madeira\u2019s finest laurisilva, the primary laurel forest that was once abundant across southern Europe but is now incredibly rare. Here, I touched time-bent, bearded trees that felt magical and wise. Reliable but intriguing. Old, but far from dull.

We drove through the town of Machico, where those first explorers landed 600 years ago, where the MIUT race ends and where Ricardo was born. \u201cI have pirate blood,\u201d he told me as we passed Machico\u2019s beach. \u201cPirates often landed here; in the years after raids, many births were registered as \u2018unknown father\u2019 \u2013 including one of my ancestors.\u201d As a second job, Ricardo does historical research for the sleek Museu da Baleia in the fishing village of Cani\u00e7al. \u201cThis used to be a whaling base,\u201d Ricardo explained as we moved between displays on the island\u2019s whaling history. The old wooden boats, smaller than many of the whales they hunted, reinforced how dangerous a profession this was for both sailor and whale. Fortunately, whale-watching is less problematic. Trips run year-round on Madeira, with spring the best time to see fin whales and striped dolphins. However, I stuck to land. You can, of course, come here and just chill in the sun and explore at a gentle pace, but my plan was to fit lots of activity into a short amount of time. I walked the Vereda do Larano, a precipitous trail hewn from steep seacliffs, with dramatic views towards the island\u2019s wave-crashed far east, and hiked up from the natural sea pools of north-westerly Porto Moniz to Fanal, a plateau cloaked in Madeira\u2019s finest laurisilva, the primary laurel forest that was once abundant across southern Europe but is now incredibly rare. Here, I touched time-bent, bearded trees that felt magical and wise. Reliable but intriguing. Old, but far from dull. Much like Madeira itself. \u2022 Stay: The Allegro Madeira in Funchal is a bright, contemporary hotel in a revamped tower; doubles from \u20ac60 B&amp;B (adults only). Aqua Natura is a friendly base by Porto Moniz\u2019s natural sea pools; doubles from \u20ac80 B&amp;B \u2022 Do: Go Trail Madeira organises trail-running tours, guided runs and hiking trips. Mountain Expeditions offers 4WD adventures across the island. For more information see madeiraallyear.com",

Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general and the government\u2019s chief law officer, will be leading a fresh push to see if \u201cthere can be a hard time limit on any backstop or our own exit mechanism\u201d, Javid said. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, will lead efforts to assess whether alternative technological arrangements can be put in place to eliminate the Irish backstop, so customs checks can take place away from the physical border. Last week, MPs voted in favour of an amendment in the name of Sir Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, to examine the possibility of alternative arrangements, but it is unclear that the necessary technology exists.

Javid said he believed there was no mileage in May trying to compromise with Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn on a deal that would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after Brexit.

      "body": "<p>When the photographer Giles Duley was 18 years old, he was given two presents by his godfather: a camera and a copy of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/unreasonable-behaviour-335167.html\" title=\"\">Unreasonable Behaviour</a></em>, Don McCullin\u2019s autobiography about his life as a photojournalist in Vietnam, Northern Ireland, Biafra, Lebanon and London\u2019s East End. The book was illustrated with McCullin\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white photographs, images of war and human suffering that helped define the conflicts they described. It was a book that bowled Duley over. Today, the two men sit opposite each other in McCullin\u2019s quiet cottage on the Somerset levels \u2013 as far removed from the horrors of war as can be imagined. The excuse for their meeting and for our conversation is a major retrospective of McCullin\u2019s work at Tate Britain, opening next week. Not that any excuse is required because, as they reveal, they are friends already.</p> <p>At 83, McCullin\u2019s hale appearance and eloquence, after 60 years of taking pictures in war zones and elsewhere, cannot help but seem a death-defying fluke. He brushes aside any mention of the injuries he sustained falling off a roof in Cambodia (he broke several ribs and shattered his arm) and does not dwell on his hellish struggles in the city of Hue in Vietnam, which left him (as he reported in Jacqui and David Morris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/06/mccullin-review-documentary-don-mccullin\" title=\"\">2013 documentary </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/06/mccullin-review-documentary-don-mccullin\" title=\"\">McCullin</a></em>) like a \u201ctormented animal\u201d. His restraint may partly be that he is a stoic but it is also, presumably, because of Duley\u2019s presence. For Duley, as McCullin puts it, has \u201cpaid the price\u201d.</p> <p>On 7 February, 2011, while involved in a photographic project studying the impact of war on soldiers in Afghanistan, Duley was \u201cembedded\u201d with the 1st Squadron of the 75th Cavalry Regiment of the US army and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/photographer-giles-duley-afghanistan\" title=\"\">blown up by a landmine</a>. He became a triple amputee. Most soldiers with similar injuries do not survive. But one of the many astonishing things about Duley (who is at pains to point out that his subject is not war itself but its aftermath) was that his first thought when he realised he had retained his right arm was: \u201cI can still work as a photographer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f9ea12d6d49f0510096d28ec8a6358e3978d7b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f9ea12d6d49f0510096d28ec8a6358e3978d7b4/269_295_8633_5650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US marines, the Citadel, Hue, Vietnam, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US marines, the Citadel, Hue, Vietnam, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin/Courtesy of the Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first interviewed him in Charing Cross Hospital in October 2011. Not long afterwards and still in recovery, he visited McCullin and his wife, the travel journalist Catherine Fairweather, in Somerset. He was in a wheelchair then but today, now 47, walks on prosthetic legs and is working hard, his spirit modest, engaging and awe-inspiring. Duley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/01/legacy-of-war-giles-duley-photography\" title=\"\">Legacy of War</a> photographic project, launched in 2013, explores the long-term effects of global conflict and, in 2015, he was commissioned by UNHCR to document the refugee crisis, visiting 14 countries in the Middle East and Europe and publishing, in 2017, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/03/giles-duley-photographs-syrian-refugees-lesbos\" title=\"\">I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See</a></em>. He has inspired Angelina Jolie and PJ Harvey and countless others. He has raised money to help some of the people he has photographed and has a gorgeous Instagram feed, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/one_armed_chef/\" title=\"\">The One Armed Chef</a>, with pictures of the food he painstakingly prepares. He often cooks with refugees before photographing them. It is a convivial thing, he says.</p> <p>Our focus today is on the Tate\u2019s McCullin retrospective, which begins in 1959 with <em>The Guv\u2019nors</em>, the first McCullin photograph published in the <em>Observer</em> \u2013 of a north London gang (McCullin was born in rough Finsbury Park) theatrically posed, looking out from the timbers of a burned-out building, each occupying his own space, as if about to burst into song. It was the <em>Observer</em> that gave McCullin his start, though it was the <em>Sunday Times</em> that made his name. The show includes his most famous pictures \u2013 such as the albino boy in Biafra, clutching the corner of a corned beef tin. But it features less familiar photos too. In a BBC4 documentary to be aired on 4 February, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/29/don-mccullin-england-is-at-war-with-itself-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Looking for England</a></em>, McCullin says that whenever he is away, the longing for home exerts the strongest hold. His pictures of the Somerset levels are seen through a glass darkly: pewter, silver and black \u2013 anything but bucolic, potential battlefields. In McCullin\u2019s work, darkness is always visible.</p> <p>Listening to the two men talk, affinities and differences emerge. Both have courage, empathetic vision and resist being described as heroic. But while Duley stays positive, McCullin, who once described war as \u201cmadness\u2026 insanity\u2026 schizophrenia\u201d, is restlessly self-questioning \u2013 and although he is a gent with a wicked sense of humour, he can tilt into gloom, not about to let himself off any moral hook. Their conversation veers from growing up (both were dyslexic children) to dilemmas about what it means to photograph suffering, and each has a stab at addressing the toughest question of all: what can a photograph change? <strong>KK</strong></p> <p><strong>Kate Kellaway: My first question, in the spirit of setting off, is what do you both take when you go into the field? What are the practical things that you need?</strong><br><strong>Don McCullin </strong>The right attitude really. You have to know why you\u2019re going; are you committed to taking the risk? Particularly when one had a family, children, as I did. And then a lot of premeditation: \u201cWill I be able to do this? Will I be able to do that?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Giles Duley</strong> I always take Tabasco with me, because of the amount of terrible food I\u2019ve had. And I always have a doorstop. In a lot of the places I work now, kidnapping\u2019s become a big thing. So I always shove that in the door, then at least if somebody tries to kick it in, there\u2019s a wedge on it. It\u2019s funny how you have these little things from habit.</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> I used to take a crepe bandage in case I busted an ankle or something. And Ready Brek because I was always afraid of winding up with nothing to eat in the morning. There are all those niggling things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b4d4e81901912eee9185ed2413e7339c94e46d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b4d4e81901912eee9185ed2413e7339c94e46d/0_0_5206_3904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Approaching evening, looking from Don McCullin\u2019s house during winter 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Approaching evening, looking from Don McCullin\u2019s house during winter 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Giles, you have spoken before about how reading Don\u2019s memoir </strong><em><strong>Unreasonable Behaviour</strong></em><strong> as an 18 year old inspired you. Why was that?</strong><br><strong>GD</strong> It\u2019s interesting, because there was adventure and excitement, but what stayed with me were the photographs. There\u2019s an image of a child soldier pointing a gun at other child soldiers [in Congo, 1964]. They are about 12 years old, fully kitted up with M16s and helmets. Growing up, I had actually wanted to be in the army, thinking it was glamorous, thinking war was exciting. And seeing images like that brought home what war was: an ugly, brutal thing. Every photograph I\u2019d ever seen of war before that was about chaos, was about tanks, was about planes, explosions, people firing guns. But what stuck with me in Don\u2019s pictures was the contact with people\u2019s eyes. I think a lot of war photography, whether it\u2019s accidental or deliberate, does glamorise war, but Don\u2019s never has.</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> When you experience a calamitous day and see bullets flying over and shells coming and you survive that day, there\u2019s no doubt, the adrenaline\u2019s at full blast. But then this goes on for war after war until you come to the conclusion that you\u2019ve been kidding yourself, thinking that war is exciting, and you forget that people are suffering and dying around you.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> It\u2019s interesting, hearing you say that. Obviously I was inspired by you when I was young, but I think what I do now, almost [follows on from] what you learned, what you hated about war. I set out not to document the war element but the consequences of war and what happens to civilians. So maybe I start from the point of understanding that you had reached. I learned from that and carried on. In my work, it\u2019s always about that connection with the person\u2019s eyes, or somebody holding hands, those little moments of intimacy, little gestures. That\u2019s my continuation of Don\u2019s work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8031016478c176fd6b99e608a7fa39369dee170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8031016478c176fd6b99e608a7fa39369dee170/0_57_11699_11696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don McCullin photographed by Giles Duley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don McCullin photographed for the Observer by Giles Duley, assisted by Alexander Brattell, at McCullin\u2019s home in Somerset, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It seems like a simple question but is actually a very complicated one: what makes a good photograph?</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> A photograph should shout at you and tell you something\u2019s wrong, that you\u2019re not living in the right kind of world, something that words can\u2019t explain to you. When I walked into a schoolhouse in 1969 in Biafra and saw 600 dying children, some of them collapsing and dying in front of me, I just cannot tell you what it was like, knowing I had my own children living in Hampstead at the time. When a picture like that is so bad, it\u2019s easy to press the button, but it\u2019s not easy to live with it. Morally, I\u2019ve always had a terribly uncomfortable conscience about it. Trying to justify my work, in any statement, in any form or shape, is most difficult for me.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> For me \u2013 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for Don \u2013 when you actually take a photograph, it\u2019s not just etched on the camera, it\u2019s etched in your mind. I can remember every photograph I\u2019ve taken. And actually the photographs that really haunt me are the ones that nobody sees, the ones that for whatever reason don\u2019t make the edit, don\u2019t get published. Then you feel like you\u2019ve let those people down, because they\u2019ve entrusted you to take their photograph and it ends up in a folder somewhere.</p> <p><strong>But I think what I\u2019m getting at here is are good photos found? Or made? Does the eye find the image?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>It\u2019s about the emotional \u2013 we\u2019re not just photographers, we gather emotionally. A camera doesn\u2019t mean a toss to me. I just put it in front of me and transfer the image through that piece of glass and that film. But I\u2019m using my emotion more than I\u2019m using that piece of equipment. And at the same time there\u2019s a thousand thoughts going through my brain saying: \u201cIs it right do this?\u201d I\u2019ve seen men executed and I haven\u2019t photographed it and I thought my God, if my editor knew that I hadn\u2019t pressed this button he\u2019d give me the boot. But it\u2019s my moral duty not to take that picture because the man who\u2019s about to be killed hasn\u2019t given me his permission.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> Unlike Don, I\u2019ve always been on the edge of conflict, [concerned with] the consequences of it. But definitely, there are times when you choose not to take a photograph. There\u2019s always a moment when you connect with somebody\u2019s eye or something happens and when somebody doesn\u2019t want you to, it\u2019s quite clear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd7d317572073a8386748d5c251eb1b840c42829\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7d317572073a8386748d5c251eb1b840c42829/0_0_3408_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local Boys in Bradford, 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local Boys in Bradford, 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DMcC</strong> When a man is standing in front of you about to die, you can\u2019t help him. He\u2019s crying and he\u2019s looking at you. He\u2019s looking up to where he thinks God is and he\u2019s scrambling around like mad to this last chance to keep alive and you\u2019re standing there, you can\u2019t help him. You are ashamed of humanity.</p> <p><strong>So has doing the work changed your view of humanity over time?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>Absolutely. Absolutely. That\u2019s why I live here. There\u2019s hardly anyone around here. I don\u2019t have to communicate with people. I need to get away. I need to hide. I need a sanctuary, and this [his home in Somerset] is it.</p> <p><strong>You have said, Don, that you feel in some way that you\u2019ve failed to do what you would like to have done through photography, but you can\u2019t surely have thought that photography would put an end to war or human misery?</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> A lot of people wouldn\u2019t understand what one means by \u201cfail\u201d. All I\u2019m saying is that when one war\u2019s cleared up, the next war is waiting in the wings and they seem to have got worse over the years. When I first started, there weren\u2019t crazed 14-year-old boys in west Africa with machetes, lopping off the arms of people and babies and children. You thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse than that and then along came Isis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/03/isis-video-jordanian-hostage-burdning-death-muadh-al-kasabeh\" title=\"\">setting fire to that Jordanian pilot in that cage</a>. And if you think about the two most important pictures that came out of Vietnam, one was the girl running down the road, which was taken by Nick Ut (although everyone thinks I took that picture\u2026 I don\u2019t know why) in 1972. The other picture was Eddie Adams\u2019s 1968 picture of the police chief <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.collageplatform.com.prod/image_cache/910x600_fit/5491696ae253608b417b23c6/e300276ea0f0b284db9930170ae5f1f0.jpeg\" title=\"\">shooting the man in the head</a>. It took several years after them for the war to end. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. Do we change anything? The pictures didn\u2019t stop the war, did they?</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> People ask: can you change the world with your photograph and I would say, no, but maybe we can inspire the people who do. A couple of years ago, I got a letter from a man in Australia who had just got into medical school. He really struggled growing up, at home and at school, but he had a picture of mine on his wall, one I took in Afghanistan. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me want to be a doctor,\u201d he said. Every day, he would look at that photograph to remind himself. Honestly for me, if that\u2019s the only impact my work\u2019s had then it\u2019s great. And Don says his work hasn\u2019t changed anything, well it changed my life. It made me do what I do. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb13ae59ac738dc8e6fdaec53ac0a809d397e12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb13ae59ac738dc8e6fdaec53ac0a809d397e12/0_0_6211_5061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the pier at Eastbourne in the 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"815\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the pier at Eastbourne in the 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DMcC</strong> If I can just go back to Giles: if I had suffered what Giles has been through, I wouldn\u2019t feel the way I do. He is justified in pressing that button more than me because he\u2019s actually paid this appalling price. He knows the price of pain. If I\u2019d been through what he\u2019s been through then I wouldn\u2019t have this guilt about pressing the button [while knowing] I can walk away, get on an aeroplane and go back to safety.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> I always have that trump card! I was walking around Mosul in a hospital a couple of years ago and people had lost their legs. I was joking: \u201cWell it\u2019s only one leg, what are you fussing about?\u201d I\u2019m one of the few people who get away with that. But I remember before I got injured, photographing a boy in South Sudan who\u2019d been shot in the stomach and kidneys and I was just alone in a little mud hut with him, because the doctors had left. I pointed my camera and took a photograph and almost vomited afterwards because I felt so sick at what I\u2019d just done. You think you\u2019re there for the right reasons because it\u2019s important that the story is told. But pointing a camera at a dying person, if you did that in London in the street, people would think you\u2019re the most vile person in the world. So why is OK to do it because we\u2019re abroad? It\u2019s not a human thing to do.</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> I think really where we pay the price, or me personally, is at night time. When I go to bed, if I allow the trigger to switch on, it all relives itself with such clarity. A lot of people say: \u201cOh, the picture you did of the albino boy starving\u201d [must have been the worst moment], but it wasn\u2019t the worst experience I ever had. I never even took a picture of the worst experience I had. I found a man once in Salvador, when the rebels had captured this small town, who\u2019d lost the whole of the lower part of his face from his nostrils, all the jaw had gone, the whole lot. He\u2019d been hit in the face with a couple of bullets and ripped all the rest of his face. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7c2615d2872e4474ea3a6c11c0b7f9b04731cd4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c2615d2872e4474ea3a6c11c0b7f9b04731cd4b/95_80_6600_4332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early shift, West Hartlepool steelworks, County Durham, 1963.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early shift, West Hartlepool steelworks, County Durham, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giles, can I ask you an amazingly dangerous question? Well, it\u2019s more personal than dangerous. But I can\u2019t understand to this day why you got injured when you were in the hands of the American army \u2013 what do they call it? Embedded?<br><strong>GD</strong> Yes, embedded [attached to a military unit involved in armed conflict]. It\u2019s interesting. You\u2019re under fire and you have to go where you\u2019re told. In South Sudan, and Congo, I was used to always being on my own. When you\u2019re with a group of soldiers like that you actually lose some of your gut instincts and the way you normally work. I certainly wouldn\u2019t blame them, but it\u2019s interesting that the time I got injured was when I was not fully in control of what I was doing.</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> They were responsible for [your] injuries, in my opinion, not you.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> But then in a lot of places that you have been, say, Vietnam, you might have been with American troops but you wouldn\u2019t hold them responsible for your safety?</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> No. But in those days, you weren\u2019t embedded. You got the rank of major, jumped on a helicopter and went where you wanted. They didn\u2019t care if you got killed. I have to say, my son was in Afghanistan with the Marines, only for six months, but all the time he was there I was thinking of you and I thought, it\u2019s such a selfish thing for me to say, I didn\u2019t want him to come back horrendously injured the way you did. He came back and, he was fine, he\u2019s happy. I was making out it didn\u2019t worry me, but I was worried to death.</p> <p><strong>You were thinking like a father. </strong><strong>Giles has paid a huge price, but also, you have to</strong><strong> reflect on the part that luck plays...</strong><br><strong>GD</strong> Well of course. I see myself as the luckiest man in the world. Only 20 people in this country have even survived being blown up and losing three limbs. Eighteen months later I was back in Afghanistan working. I\u2019ve travelled to 14 countries in the last year on my own. I have everything I ever wanted in my life, plus a lot more experience, a lot more understanding of life and death, my empathy, my connection with people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13b909949159f79bf5de36527e24741800e8152f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13b909949159f79bf5de36527e24741800e8152f/0_0_4662_6800/686.jpg\" alt=\"Homeless Irishman, Spitalfields, London 1970.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homeless Irishman, Spitalfields, London 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It\u2019s clear from your autobiography, Don, that war photography is not a great career choice in terms of your private life?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>It can ruin you. That is what happened with my first marriage, although my children have come back to me in a very generous way and forgiven me. We\u2019re a very close family but photography \u2013 it\u2019s not all good.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> No. And even if you are forgetting the dangers, it is just the amount you\u2019re away. Something else might be planned and then you just go off\u2026 It is selfish. I mean there is no way around that.</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> It is a dangerous mistress, and it\u2019s one of those love affairs that never ends, you know. It just never ends. You\u2019re totally captive to photography once it gets a grip of you.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told you the story of when I flew back to Birmingham from Afghanistan, three days after I was injured. They wheeled me off the plane doped up on morphine and my sister said: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to say something.\u201d They took the oxygen mask off and she thought these were going to be my last words (they had said I wouldn\u2019t make it through the night). My poor sister bent over and was expecting me to say\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d or\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I whispered to her: \u201cI\u2019m still a photographer.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You both do wonderful work in black and white - it\u2019s almost a hallmark for you, Don. What does black and white have that colour lacks?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>I\u2019ve done a few colour pictures, but I think in a way it starts kind of glamming it up a bit. You see colour, you think of Hollywood. But black and white is not truthful, is it? I mean, we don\u2019t live in a black-and-white world. We use black and white as a weapon because it will shout and scream at you. You won\u2019t miss the black and white, but you could walk past a colour picture.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> For me, there is no truth in photography. It\u2019s all our interpretation. If you stick me in a room and I look in one direction and take a picture, it\u2019s different from what\u2019s behind me. So in a way, black and white is saying it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s saying, this is an artistic statement of it. When I see a lot of colour photographs of conflicts\u2026</p> <p><strong>DMcC</strong> \u2026 especially on digital\u2026</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> Yes. It\u2019s saying: \u201cThis is exactly the reality.\u201d But it\u2019s not. A photograph is still a fake thing. It\u2019s one second I\u2019ve taken out of the whole day; my version of reality. Black and white for me is honest, it\u2019s saying, this is obviously <em>not </em>reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fe497e5ce8052f03ec849223e65073bdfe40898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fe497e5ce8052f03ec849223e65073bdfe40898/0_0_2522_1637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Turk sprints from the exposed doorway of an old cinema in Limassol, Cyprus, 1964.

They hang around.</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> They should. That\u2019s what we try to bring. If I can haunt people with my pictures I have done my job.</p> <p><strong>Both of you had dyslexia as boys and I wonder whether your brilliance at photography was a way of finding a different, powerful way of communicating?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>I suffered for being dyslexic. The schoolmasters used to knock seven bells out of me because they thought I was skiving. I took some terrible hidings from sadistic, Victorian schoolmasters who were the last of that legacy. </p> <p><strong>GD</strong> When I was 13, I was held back a year at school. When you\u2019re that age, to be told you\u2019re stupid and have everyone make fun of you leaves a huge imprint. So when at 18 I discovered photography, found all these photographers\u2019 work, it was like discovering poetry or literature.</p> <p><strong>DMcC </strong>That\u2019s what makes us so different, Giles. You had this amazing kickstart into culture. At the age of 15, I was working on a steam train going up to the north of England, washing up in the dining car. I was living out a raw life. I was watching nude shows! I used to sleep in the sheds in the railway sidings outside of Liverpool \u2013 Edge Hill \u2013 and I met this boy there who took me to this shabby old theatre in Liverpool. The women were naked \u2013 only from the waist up in those days \u2013 and they were not allowed to move. It was all done in a tasteful tableau.</p> <p><strong>Looking to the future of photography now, we are a culture saturated in images: are mobile phones and Instagram a menace?</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> Not a menace at all. Take the white helmets who risked their lives in Syria: phones were the only means of us getting information out. Photojournalism has had its day, though. When did you last see a really serious great set of pictures? Newspapers, even great newspapers, they\u2019re almost running tabloid-type material of film stars and footballers and crap like that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2f487aca8fdf1b5ac10f7a3f54f4dff64fe1842\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2f487aca8fdf1b5ac10f7a3f54f4dff64fe1842/0_0_5616_4253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Page 11 of the Observer from 15 February 1959, featuring Don McCullin\u2019s first published photographs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Page 11 of the Observer from 15 February 1959, featuring Don McCullin\u2019s first published photographs, of gang members in Finsbury Park, London, including (main image) \u2018The Guvnors in their Sunday Suits\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McCullin/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>GD</strong> Photojournalism has died because the outlets are just not there, but photography has evolved into something else. Citizen journalism is great. It\u2019s great that anyone can take a picture. \u201cImage fatigue\u201d is a phrase that gets used a lot, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that people cannot still feel the impact of an image. You put me into a school, which I love, and I show one photograph and tell the story and you\u2019ll see these 15-year-old kids in tears. It\u2019s not that people have lost the ability to take imagery in, it\u2019s that they see so much and out of context. But if you [look at] it in the right space, let people have that time, then a black-and-white photograph, with those eyes, somebody looking at you, it has the same impact it has always had.</p> <p><strong>What about the work you do when you\u2019re not photographing terrible things abroad? I\u2019m thinking of your cooking Instagram pictures, Giles, and your pictures of the Somerset fields around here, Don.</strong><br><strong>GD</strong> I actually reached a point with the documentary, humanitarian work, I ended up photographing everything I hated in life. It sounds silly, but going back and starting to do some portraits again, I started enjoying photography in a different way.</p> <p><strong>DMcC </strong>I get a lot of letters \u2013 and you must get the same \u2013 saying: \u201cI want to be a war photographer\u201d. I say to people that\u2019s fine, but there are just as many wars going on in our cities. If you want to be a war photographer, go out and help yourself. My best story wasn\u2019t in a foreign war; my best story was the homeless story I did in the 1970s, in Aldgate, on the periphery of the great moneymaking part of this country, the City.</p> <p><strong>And that\u2019s going to be in the Tate exhibition, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>Yes. I\u2019m more proud of those pictures and I\u2019m more proud of the social pictures I did of poverty in the north of England than I am any of my war pictures. I\u2019m not proud of my war pictures at all.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the Tate show?</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> It\u2019s uncomfortable. We have to be careful what we do because if we do it too well we\u2019re turning our work into icons. The word \u201cart\u201d \u2013 I absolutely hate it being associated with photography. Most American photographers now want to be called artists. I could come under a lot of fire for [being in Tate Britain] really, but I\u2019m in an art gallery because I\u2019m not in a newspaper. I have 60,000 negatives in this house and I have a really good collection of about 400 pictures I\u2019m really proud of. </p> <p><strong>GD</strong> Yes, what\u2019s the point in taking a photograph if nobody sees it? You have to find it, whether it be in a gallery, whether it be in a newspaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b66bc00be34b696fba4fdb643d26eb7d0f979c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b66bc00be34b696fba4fdb643d26eb7d0f979c6d/0_0_8750_5253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from Giles Duley\u2019s book I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See: Photographs from the Refugee Crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from Giles Duley\u2019s book I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See: Photographs from the Refugee Crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I can\u2019t resist asking you, Don, about how the </strong><em><strong>Observer</strong></em><strong> became the paper to commission you?</strong><br><strong>DMcC </strong>Yes, I started my career with the <em>Observer</em>, although the word \u201ccareer\u201d disturbs me, it\u2019s a vocation. The paper published some pictures [of Finsbury Park gang the Guv\u2019nors] that I sent on spec and then later the picture editor, Bryn Campbell, said: \u201cWould you consider going to the civil war in Cyprus?\u201d I [felt like] I was actually able to levitate; I thought I was really lifting off! I went with the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s ecclesiastic correspondent, who was later killed in Swiss Cottage on a rainy night on his Vespa, to the city of Limassol. And that\u2019s where I had my baptism of fire \u2013 I was in the Turkish quarter and there were all these bullets. I was just running around like a mad hare, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing; I wasn\u2019t focusing. And then I calmed down. That was my first time in war.</p> <p><strong>Finally, I wonder what it would actually mean for you both, to give up photography?</strong><br><strong>DMcC</strong> It will be the day I die. That\u2019s when photography will be stolen away from me. I don\u2019t intend to die yet, by the way. My most exciting time in my life is coming up on Monday at my exhibition. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve had lots of exhibitions and all of a sudden I can\u2019t sleep at night thinking about this one.</p> <p><strong>GD</strong> I made that comment about the words I said when I was taken into hospital. If I hadn\u2019t been able to take a photograph again then I would rather have died in Afghanistan. Photography, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s my voice.

      "bodyText": "When the photographer Giles Duley was 18 years old, he was given two presents by his godfather: a camera and a copy of Unreasonable Behaviour, Don McCullin\u2019s autobiography about his life as a photojournalist in Vietnam, Northern Ireland, Biafra, Lebanon and London\u2019s East End. The book was illustrated with McCullin\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white photographs, images of war and human suffering that helped define the conflicts they described. It was a book that bowled Duley over. Today, the two men sit opposite each other in McCullin\u2019s quiet cottage on the Somerset levels \u2013 as far removed from the horrors of war as can be imagined. The excuse for their meeting and for our conversation is a major retrospective of McCullin\u2019s work at Tate Britain, opening next week. Not that any excuse is required because, as they reveal, they are friends already. At 83, McCullin\u2019s hale appearance and eloquence, after 60 years of taking pictures in war zones and elsewhere, cannot help but seem a death-defying fluke. He brushes aside any mention of the injuries he sustained falling off a roof in Cambodia (he broke several ribs and shattered his arm) and does not dwell on his hellish struggles in the city of Hue in Vietnam, which left him (as he reported in Jacqui and David Morris\u2019s 2013 documentary McCullin) like a \u201ctormented animal\u201d. His restraint may partly be that he is a stoic but it is also, presumably, because of Duley\u2019s presence. For Duley, as McCullin puts it, has \u201cpaid the price\u201d. On 7 February, 2011, while involved in a photographic project studying the impact of war on soldiers in Afghanistan, Duley was \u201cembedded\u201d with the 1st Squadron of the 75th Cavalry Regiment of the US army and blown up by a landmine. He became a triple amputee. Most soldiers with similar injuries do not survive. But one of the many astonishing things about Duley (who is at pains to point out that his subject is not war itself but its aftermath) was that his first thought when he realised he had retained his right arm was: \u201cI can still work as a photographer.\u201d I first interviewed him in Charing Cross Hospital in October 2011. Not long afterwards and still in recovery, he visited McCullin and his wife, the travel journalist Catherine Fairweather, in Somerset. He was in a wheelchair then but today, now 47, walks on prosthetic legs and is working hard, his spirit modest, engaging and awe-inspiring. Duley\u2019s Legacy of War photographic project, launched in 2013, explores the long-term effects of global conflict and, in 2015, he was commissioned by UNHCR to document the refugee crisis, visiting 14 countries in the Middle East and Europe and publishing, in 2017, I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See. He has inspired Angelina Jolie and PJ Harvey and countless others. He has raised money to help some of the people he has photographed and has a gorgeous Instagram feed, The One Armed Chef, with pictures of the food he painstakingly prepares. He often cooks with refugees before photographing them. It is a convivial thing, he says. Our focus today is on the Tate\u2019s McCullin retrospective, which begins in 1959 with The Guv\u2019nors, the first McCullin photograph published in the Observer \u2013 of a north London gang (McCullin was born in rough Finsbury Park) theatrically posed, looking out from the timbers of a burned-out building, each occupying his own space, as if about to burst into song. It was the Observer that gave McCullin his start, though it was the Sunday Times that made his name. The show includes his most famous pictures \u2013 such as the albino boy in Biafra, clutching the corner of a corned beef tin. But it features less familiar photos too. In a BBC4 documentary to be aired on 4 February, Looking for England, McCullin says that whenever he is away, the longing for home exerts the strongest hold. His pictures of the Somerset levels are seen through a glass darkly: pewter, silver and black \u2013 anything but bucolic, potential battlefields. In McCullin\u2019s work, darkness is always visible. Listening to the two men talk, affinities and differences emerge. Both have courage, empathetic vision and resist being described as heroic. But while Duley stays positive, McCullin, who once described war as \u201cmadness\u2026 insanity\u2026 schizophrenia\u201d, is restlessly self-questioning \u2013 and although he is a gent with a wicked sense of humour, he can tilt into gloom, not about to let himself off any moral hook. Their conversation veers from growing up (both were dyslexic children) to dilemmas about what it means to photograph suffering, and each has a stab at addressing the toughest question of all: what can a photograph change? KK Kate Kellaway: My first question, in the spirit of setting off, is what do you both take when you go into the field? What are the practical things that you need? Don McCullin The right attitude really. You have to know why you\u2019re going; are you committed to taking the risk? Particularly when one had a family, children, as I did. And then a lot of premeditation: \u201cWill I be able to do this? Will I be able to do that?\u201d Giles Duley I always take Tabasco with me, because of the amount of terrible food I\u2019ve had. And I always have a doorstop. In a lot of the places I work now, kidnapping\u2019s become a big thing. So I always shove that in the door, then at least if somebody tries to kick it in, there\u2019s a wedge on it. It\u2019s funny how you have these little things from habit. DMcC I used to take a crepe bandage in case I busted an ankle or something. And Ready Brek because I was always afraid of winding up with nothing to eat in the morning. There are all those niggling things. Giles, you have spoken before about how reading Don\u2019s memoir Unreasonable Behaviour as an 18 year old inspired you. Why was that? GD It\u2019s interesting, because there was adventure and excitement, but what stayed with me were the photographs. There\u2019s an image of a child soldier pointing a gun at other child soldiers [in Congo, 1964]. They are about 12 years old, fully kitted up with M16s and helmets. Growing up, I had actually wanted to be in the army, thinking it was glamorous, thinking war was exciting. And seeing images like that brought home what war was: an ugly, brutal thing. Every photograph I\u2019d ever seen of war before that was about chaos, was about tanks, was about planes, explosions, people firing guns. But what stuck with me in Don\u2019s pictures was the contact with people\u2019s eyes. I think a lot of war photography, whether it\u2019s accidental or deliberate, does glamorise war, but Don\u2019s never has. DMcC When you experience a calamitous day and see bullets flying over and shells coming and you survive that day, there\u2019s no doubt, the adrenaline\u2019s at full blast. But then this goes on for war after war until you come to the conclusion that you\u2019ve been kidding yourself, thinking that war is exciting, and you forget that people are suffering and dying around you. GD It\u2019s interesting, hearing you say that. Obviously I was inspired by you when I was young, but I think what I do now, almost [follows on from] what you learned, what you hated about war. I set out not to document the war element but the consequences of war and what happens to civilians. So maybe I start from the point of understanding that you had reached. I learned from that and carried on. In my work, it\u2019s always about that connection with the person\u2019s eyes, or somebody holding hands, those little moments of intimacy, little gestures. That\u2019s my continuation of Don\u2019s work. It seems like a simple question but is actually a very complicated one: what makes a good photograph? DMcC A photograph should shout at you and tell you something\u2019s wrong, that you\u2019re not living in the right kind of world, something that words can\u2019t explain to you. When I walked into a schoolhouse in 1969 in Biafra and saw 600 dying children, some of them collapsing and dying in front of me, I just cannot tell you what it was like, knowing I had my own children living in Hampstead at the time. When a picture like that is so bad, it\u2019s easy to press the button, but it\u2019s not easy to live with it. Morally, I\u2019ve always had a terribly uncomfortable conscience about it. Trying to justify my work, in any statement, in any form or shape, is most difficult for me. GD For me \u2013 and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for Don \u2013 when you actually take a photograph, it\u2019s not just etched on the camera, it\u2019s etched in your mind. I can remember every photograph I\u2019ve taken. And actually the photographs that really haunt me are the ones that nobody sees, the ones that for whatever reason don\u2019t make the edit, don\u2019t get published. Then you feel like you\u2019ve let those people down, because they\u2019ve entrusted you to take their photograph and it ends up in a folder somewhere. But I think what I\u2019m getting at here is are good photos found? Or made? Does the eye find the image? DMcC It\u2019s about the emotional \u2013 we\u2019re not just photographers, we gather emotionally. A camera doesn\u2019t mean a toss to me. I just put it in front of me and transfer the image through that piece of glass and that film. But I\u2019m using my emotion more than I\u2019m using that piece of equipment. And at the same time there\u2019s a thousand thoughts going through my brain saying: \u201cIs it right do this?\u201d I\u2019ve seen men executed and I haven\u2019t photographed it and I thought my God, if my editor knew that I hadn\u2019t pressed this button he\u2019d give me the boot. But it\u2019s my moral duty not to take that picture because the man who\u2019s about to be killed hasn\u2019t given me his permission. GD Unlike Don, I\u2019ve always been on the edge of conflict, [concerned with] the consequences of it. But definitely, there are times when you choose not to take a photograph. There\u2019s always a moment when you connect with somebody\u2019s eye or something happens and when somebody doesn\u2019t want you to, it\u2019s quite clear. DMcC When a man is standing in front of you about to die, you can\u2019t help him. He\u2019s crying and he\u2019s looking at you. He\u2019s looking up to where he thinks God is and he\u2019s scrambling around like mad to this last chance to keep alive and you\u2019re standing there, you can\u2019t help him. You are ashamed of humanity. So has doing the work changed your view of humanity over time? DMcC Absolutely. Absolutely. That\u2019s why I live here. There\u2019s hardly anyone around here. I don\u2019t have to communicate with people. I need to get away. I need to hide. I need a sanctuary, and this [his home in Somerset] is it. You have said, Don, that you feel in some way that you\u2019ve failed to do what you would like to have done through photography, but you can\u2019t surely have thought that photography would put an end to war or human misery? DMcC A lot of people wouldn\u2019t understand what one means by \u201cfail\u201d. All I\u2019m saying is that when one war\u2019s cleared up, the next war is waiting in the wings and they seem to have got worse over the years. When I first started, there weren\u2019t crazed 14-year-old boys in west Africa with machetes, lopping off the arms of people and babies and children. You thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse than that and then along came Isis, setting fire to that Jordanian pilot in that cage. And if you think about the two most important pictures that came out of Vietnam, one was the girl running down the road, which was taken by Nick Ut (although everyone thinks I took that picture\u2026 I don\u2019t know why) in 1972. The other picture was Eddie Adams\u2019s 1968 picture of the police chief shooting the man in the head. It took several years after them for the war to end. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. Do we change anything? The pictures didn\u2019t stop the war, did they? GD People ask: can you change the world with your photograph and I would say, no, but maybe we can inspire the people who do. A couple of years ago, I got a letter from a man in Australia who had just got into medical school. He really struggled growing up, at home and at school, but he had a picture of mine on his wall, one I took in Afghanistan. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me want to be a doctor,\u201d he said. Every day, he would look at that photograph to remind himself. Honestly for me, if that\u2019s the only impact my work\u2019s had then it\u2019s great. And Don says his work hasn\u2019t changed anything, well it changed my life. It made me do what I do. DMcC If I can just go back to Giles: if I had suffered what Giles has been through, I wouldn\u2019t feel the way I do. He is justified in pressing that button more than me because he\u2019s actually paid this appalling price. He knows the price of pain. If I\u2019d been through what he\u2019s been through then I wouldn\u2019t have this guilt about pressing the button [while knowing] I can walk away, get on an aeroplane and go back to safety. GD I always have that trump card! I was walking around Mosul in a hospital a couple of years ago and people had lost their legs. I was joking: \u201cWell it\u2019s only one leg, what are you fussing about?\u201d I\u2019m one of the few people who get away with that. But I remember before I got injured, photographing a boy in South Sudan who\u2019d been shot in the stomach and kidneys and I was just alone in a little mud hut with him, because the doctors had left. I pointed my camera and took a photograph and almost vomited afterwards because I felt so sick at what I\u2019d just done. You think you\u2019re there for the right reasons because it\u2019s important that the story is told. But pointing a camera at a dying person, if you did that in London in the street, people would think you\u2019re the most vile person in the world. So why is OK to do it because we\u2019re abroad? It\u2019s not a human thing to do. DMcC I think really where we pay the price, or me personally, is at night time. When I go to bed, if I allow the trigger to switch on, it all relives itself with such clarity. A lot of people say: \u201cOh, the picture you did of the albino boy starving\u201d [must have been the worst moment], but it wasn\u2019t the worst experience I ever had. I never even took a picture of the worst experience I had. I found a man once in Salvador, when the rebels had captured this small town, who\u2019d lost the whole of the lower part of his face from his nostrils, all the jaw had gone, the whole lot. He\u2019d been hit in the face with a couple of bullets and ripped all the rest of his face. Giles, can I ask you an amazingly dangerous question? Well, it\u2019s more personal than dangerous. But I can\u2019t understand to this day why you got injured when you were in the hands of the American army \u2013 what do they call it? Embedded? GD Yes, embedded [attached to a military unit involved in armed conflict]. It\u2019s interesting. You\u2019re under fire and you have to go where you\u2019re told. In South Sudan, and Congo, I was used to always being on my own. When you\u2019re with a group of soldiers like that you actually lose some of your gut instincts and the way you normally work. I certainly wouldn\u2019t blame them, but it\u2019s interesting that the time I got injured was when I was not fully in control of what I was doing. DMcC They were responsible for [your] injuries, in my opinion, not you. GD But then in a lot of places that you have been, say, Vietnam, you might have been with American troops but you wouldn\u2019t hold them responsible for your safety? DMcC No. But in those days, you weren\u2019t embedded. You got the rank of major, jumped on a helicopter and went where you wanted. They didn\u2019t care if you got killed. I have to say, my son was in Afghanistan with the Marines, only for six months, but all the time he was there I was thinking of you and I thought, it\u2019s such a selfish thing for me to say, I didn\u2019t want him to come back horrendously injured the way you did. He came back and, he was fine, he\u2019s happy. I was making out it didn\u2019t worry me, but I was worried to death. You were thinking like a father. Giles has paid a huge price, but also, you have to reflect on the part that luck plays... GD Well of course. I see myself as the luckiest man in the world. Only 20 people in this country have even survived being blown up and losing three limbs. Eighteen months later I was back in Afghanistan working. I\u2019ve travelled to 14 countries in the last year on my own. I have everything I ever wanted in my life, plus a lot more experience, a lot more understanding of life and death, my empathy, my connection with people. It\u2019s clear from your autobiography, Don, that war photography is not a great career choice in terms of your private life? DMcC It can ruin you. That is what happened with my first marriage, although my children have come back to me in a very generous way and forgiven me. We\u2019re a very close family but photography \u2013 it\u2019s not all good. GD No. And even if you are forgetting the dangers, it is just the amount you\u2019re away. Something else might be planned and then you just go off\u2026 It is selfish. I mean there is no way around that. DMcC It is a dangerous mistress, and it\u2019s one of those love affairs that never ends, you know. It just never ends. You\u2019re totally captive to photography once it gets a grip of you. GD I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told you the story of when I flew back to Birmingham from Afghanistan, three days after I was injured. They wheeled me off the plane doped up on morphine and my sister said: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to say something.\u201d They took the oxygen mask off and she thought these were going to be my last words (they had said I wouldn\u2019t make it through the night). My poor sister bent over and was expecting me to say\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d or\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I whispered to her: \u201cI\u2019m still a photographer.\u201d You both do wonderful work in black and white - it\u2019s almost a hallmark for you, Don. What does black and white have that colour lacks? DMcC I\u2019ve done a few colour pictures, but I think in a way it starts kind of glamming it up a bit. You see colour, you think of Hollywood. But black and white is not truthful, is it? I mean, we don\u2019t live in a black-and-white world. We use black and white as a weapon because it will shout and scream at you. You won\u2019t miss the black and white, but you could walk past a colour picture. GD For me, there is no truth in photography. It\u2019s all our interpretation. If you stick me in a room and I look in one direction and take a picture, it\u2019s different from what\u2019s behind me. So in a way, black and white is saying it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s saying, this is an artistic statement of it. When I see a lot of colour photographs of conflicts\u2026 DMcC \u2026 especially on digital\u2026 GD Yes. It\u2019s saying: \u201cThis is exactly the reality.\u201d But it\u2019s not. A photograph is still a fake thing. It\u2019s one second I\u2019ve taken out of the whole day; my version of reality. Black and white for me is honest, it\u2019s saying, this is obviously not reality. The pictures I find most powerful are a bit like hauntings. They hang around. DMcC They should. That\u2019s what we try to bring. If I can haunt people with my pictures I have done my job. Both of you had dyslexia as boys and I wonder whether your brilliance at photography was a way of finding a different, powerful way of communicating? DMcC I suffered for being dyslexic. The schoolmasters used to knock seven bells out of me because they thought I was skiving. I took some terrible hidings from sadistic, Victorian schoolmasters who were the last of that legacy. GD When I was 13, I was held back a year at school. When you\u2019re that age, to be told you\u2019re stupid and have everyone make fun of you leaves a huge imprint. So when at 18 I discovered photography, found all these photographers\u2019 work, it was like discovering poetry or literature. DMcC That\u2019s what makes us so different, Giles. You had this amazing kickstart into culture. At the age of 15, I was working on a steam train going up to the north of England, washing up in the dining car. I was living out a raw life. I was watching nude shows! I used to sleep in the sheds in the railway sidings outside of Liverpool \u2013 Edge Hill \u2013 and I met this boy there who took me to this shabby old theatre in Liverpool. The women were naked \u2013 only from the waist up in those days \u2013 and they were not allowed to move. It was all done in a tasteful tableau. Looking to the future of photography now, we are a culture saturated in images: are mobile phones and Instagram a menace? DMcC Not a menace at all. Take the white helmets who risked their lives in Syria: phones were the only means of us getting information out. Photojournalism has had its day, though. When did you last see a really serious great set of pictures? Newspapers, even great newspapers, they\u2019re almost running tabloid-type material of film stars and footballers and crap like that. GD Photojournalism has died because the outlets are just not there, but photography has evolved into something else. Citizen journalism is great. It\u2019s great that anyone can take a picture. \u201cImage fatigue\u201d is a phrase that gets used a lot, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true that people cannot still feel the impact of an image. You put me into a school, which I love, and I show one photograph and tell the story and you\u2019ll see these 15-year-old kids in tears. It\u2019s not that people have lost the ability to take imagery in, it\u2019s that they see so much and out of context. But if you [look at] it in the right space, let people have that time, then a black-and-white photograph, with those eyes, somebody looking at you, it has the same impact it has always had. What about the work you do when you\u2019re not photographing terrible things abroad? I\u2019m thinking of your cooking Instagram pictures, Giles, and your pictures of the Somerset fields around here, Don. GD I actually reached a point with the documentary, humanitarian work, I ended up photographing everything I hated in life. It sounds silly, but going back and starting to do some portraits again, I started enjoying photography in a different way. DMcC I get a lot of letters \u2013 and you must get the same \u2013 saying: \u201cI want to be a war photographer\u201d. I say to people that\u2019s fine, but there are just as many wars going on in our cities. If you want to be a war photographer, go out and help yourself. My best story wasn\u2019t in a foreign war; my best story was the homeless story I did in the 1970s, in Aldgate, on the periphery of the great moneymaking part of this country, the City. And that\u2019s going to be in the Tate exhibition, isn\u2019t it? DMcC Yes. I\u2019m more proud of those pictures and I\u2019m more proud of the social pictures I did of poverty in the north of England than I am any of my war pictures. I\u2019m not proud of my war pictures at all. How do you feel about the Tate show? DMcC It\u2019s uncomfortable. We have to be careful what we do because if we do it too well we\u2019re turning our work into icons. The word \u201cart\u201d \u2013 I absolutely hate it being associated with photography. Most American photographers now want to be called artists. I could come under a lot of fire for [being in Tate Britain] really, but I\u2019m in an art gallery because I\u2019m not in a newspaper. I have 60,000 negatives in this house and I have a really good collection of about 400 pictures I\u2019m really proud of. GD Yes, what\u2019s the point in taking a photograph if nobody sees it? You have to find it, whether it be in a gallery, whether it be in a newspaper. I can\u2019t resist asking you, Don, about how the Observer became the paper to commission you? DMcC Yes, I started my career with the Observer, although the word \u201ccareer\u201d disturbs me, it\u2019s a vocation. The paper published some pictures [of Finsbury Park gang the Guv\u2019nors] that I sent on spec and then later the picture editor, Bryn Campbell, said: \u201cWould you consider going to the civil war in Cyprus?\u201d I [felt like] I was actually able to levitate; I thought I was really lifting off! I went with the Observer\u2019s ecclesiastic correspondent, who was later killed in Swiss Cottage on a rainy night on his Vespa, to the city of Limassol. And that\u2019s where I had my baptism of fire \u2013 I was in the Turkish quarter and there were all these bullets. I was just running around like a mad hare, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing; I wasn\u2019t focusing. And then I calmed down. That was my first time in war. Finally, I wonder what it would actually mean for you both, to give up photography? DMcC It will be the day I die. That\u2019s when photography will be stolen away from me. I don\u2019t intend to die yet, by the way. My most exciting time in my life is coming up on Monday at my exhibition. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve had lots of exhibitions and all of a sudden I can\u2019t sleep at night thinking about this one. GD I made that comment about the words I said when I was taken into hospital. If I hadn\u2019t been able to take a photograph again then I would rather have died in Afghanistan. Photography, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s my voice. Simple as that. Don McCullin is at Tate Britain, London SW1 from 5 February until 6 May",

London is much more productive than the other big cities.</p> <p>Now here\u2019s something you might not know: a lot of it has to do with buses. Public transport really matters.</p> <p>Cities tend to be more productive than towns or villages because of agglomeration effects: the notion that bringing people together in one large urban centre leads to new and better ways of doing things. The bigger the city the bigger the agglomeration effect.</p> <p>This rule holds true in other countries. The second-biggest French city, Lyon, is more productive than Marseille, the third-biggest city, which in turn is more productive than the fourth biggest, Lille. In the US, Germany and the Netherlands the same applies.</p> <p>In Britain it is a different story, however. Here, big cities such as Birmingham are less productive than smaller cities such as Oxford and Cambridge. And that\u2019s because the problems people have in getting from their homes to the places where the jobs are shrinks the real size of UK cities. Research by the Open Data Institute in Leeds has shown that the effective size of Birmingham is about half that of the nominal population because of the problems caused by inadequate public transport.</p> <p>What the Leeds researchers did was to record 40m bus departures from all over the city to see how long the journeys took in peak and off-peak times. They assumed that to be part of the Birmingham agglomeration someone should have a travel to work time of 30 minutes or less. The half-hour limit did not include waiting at bus stops or walking at either end, which would take the total door-to-door journey time to 50 minutes.</p> <p>The research showed that in peak time, getting around Birmingham by bus is a painstaking process.

      "body": "<p>Ever dreamed of picking grapes from your own vine? Well, before you do, I\u2019ll let you in on a super-simple (but surprisingly little-known) trick that UK growers can use to dramatically boost the flavour of their home-grown grapes without any extra effort. Coincidentally, the same tip could improve the nutrient content of your harvests and simultaneously provide you with a crop that is literally unbuyable in the supermarkets. What on earth is it? Well, simply plant a wine grape variety instead of a table variety \u2013 and now is the perfect time to do it. Here\u2019s how it works\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wine grapes, one might assume, would be simply too unpalatably sour to make good eating. Wrong\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wine grapes, one might assume, would have to be simply too unpalatably sour or astringent to make good eating. Hence they are reserved for the wine press, rather than the fruit bowl. However, the reality is quite the opposite. In fact, wine grapes tend to have been bred for high levels of sugars, essential for the microbes that feast on them to convert into alcohol. Without this, the resultant tipple, apart from not being as fun to drink, simply doesn\u2019t have enough alcohol to suppress the effects of secondary fermentation by harmful bacteria, meaning the wine would simply go off in the bottle.</p> <p>Table grape varieties, on the other hand, have often been bred with the goal of achieving crunchy, hard flesh that resists damage during transport. Perhaps counterintuitively, therefore, wine grape varieties are usually much sweeter and more richly flavoured than table varieties.</p> <p>Wine grapes also tend to be bred for smaller individual berries (yes, grapes are technically a berry) with thicker skins, because it is in the skin that the chemicals key to vibrant colour and complex tannic flavour come from. As it is these same chemicals which may, research suggests, have health benefits, wine-making varieties perhaps offer not just enhanced flavour but potentially higher levels of some nutrients. If you can forgive the fact that most wine grapes haven\u2019t had their seeds bred out, then their benefits far outweigh those of table grapes for the home-grower, at least in my opinion.</p> <p>It\u2019s a huge shame that wine grapes are unbuyable in supermarkets. If you want them, you will have to grow your own. One of my favourites is the classic pinot noir, one of the primary varieties used to make champagne. With an exceptionally sweet, bramble-like flavour, these black fruits grow on vigorous vines that thrive on even the thinnest of chalky soils. How is a black grape variety used to make champagne? Wineries simply remove the skins before juicing. </p> <p>M\u00fcller-Thurgau is one of the most popular varieties grown in UK vineyards for its excellent adaptation to northern climates. It has a wonderfully juicy, succulent texture and superb sweetness.</p> <p>Finally, if it\u2019s ros\u00e9 varieties you\u2019re looking for, gew\u00fcrztraminer won\u2019t disappoint with its big bunches of aromatic, light pink fruit with a hint of spice and citrus. If you have the space, plant all three, trained tightly clipped along a wall, for maximum flavour in minimum space. Believe me, you\u2019ll thank me for it.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

Hence they are reserved for the wine press, rather than the fruit bowl. However, the reality is quite the opposite. In fact, wine grapes tend to have been bred for high levels of sugars, essential for the microbes that feast on them to convert into alcohol. Without this, the resultant tipple, apart from not being as fun to drink, simply doesn\u2019t have enough alcohol to suppress the effects of secondary fermentation by harmful bacteria, meaning the wine would simply go off in the bottle. Table grape varieties, on the other hand, have often been bred with the goal of achieving crunchy, hard flesh that resists damage during transport. Perhaps counterintuitively, therefore, wine grape varieties are usually much sweeter and more richly flavoured than table varieties. Wine grapes also tend to be bred for smaller individual berries (yes, grapes are technically a berry) with thicker skins, because it is in the skin that the chemicals key to vibrant colour and complex tannic flavour come from. As it is these same chemicals which may, research suggests, have health benefits, wine-making varieties perhaps offer not just enhanced flavour but potentially higher levels of some nutrients. If you can forgive the fact that most wine grapes haven\u2019t had their seeds bred out, then their benefits far outweigh those of table grapes for the home-grower, at least in my opinion. It\u2019s a huge shame that wine grapes are unbuyable in supermarkets. If you want them, you will have to grow your own. One of my favourites is the classic pinot noir, one of the primary varieties used to make champagne. With an exceptionally sweet, bramble-like flavour, these black fruits grow on vigorous vines that thrive on even the thinnest of chalky soils. How is a black grape variety used to make champagne? Wineries simply remove the skins before juicing. M\u00fcller-Thurgau is one of the most popular varieties grown in UK vineyards for its excellent adaptation to northern climates. It has a wonderfully juicy, succulent texture and superb sweetness. Finally, if it\u2019s ros\u00e9 varieties you\u2019re looking for, gew\u00fcrztraminer won\u2019t disappoint with its big bunches of aromatic, light pink fruit with a hint of spice and citrus. If you have the space, plant all three, trained tightly clipped along a wall, for maximum flavour in minimum space. Believe me, you\u2019ll thank me for it.

In 2004, <em>Observer</em> reporter Martin Bright (played here by Matt Smith) published a memo leaked by 28-year-old British GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley, suitably staid) revealing that the US\u2019s National Security Agency had asked the UK to collect intelligence about UN security council members that could be used to pressure them into mandating the Iraq war. Gun confessed to the leak and was charged. Here, she and her story are treated with sombre respect, but the film comes alive in the newsroom scenes, played with a tongue-in-cheek edge.</p> <p><em>Animals</em> (Sophie Hyde) and <em>Native Son</em> (Rashid Johnson) took their inspiration from novels rather than reportage. In the rambunctious, darkly hilarious <em>Animals</em>, writer Emma Jane Unsworth adapts her own bestselling novel, transplanting its setting from Manchester to Dublin and casting Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat as inseparable, permanently hungover best friends edging into their 30s. \u201cTragedy plus time equals comedy!\u201d opines Shawkat\u2019s Tyler; think the sharp, brittle millennial observations of novelist Sally Rooney meets the bawdy, female anarchy of V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1\u2019s <em>Daisies</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d09123eed0e308820fde70ea3ba57d379f1d05c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d09123eed0e308820fde70ea3ba57d379f1d05c/0_81_4815_2888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashton Sanders, KiKi Layne, Nick Robinson, Sanaa Lathan and director Rashid Johnson at the premiere of his film Native Son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(L-r) Ashton Sanders, KiKi Layne, Sanaa Lathan, Nick Robinson and director Rashid Johnson at the Sundance premiere of his film Native Son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Native Son</em>, starring <em>Moonlight\u2019</em>s Ashton Sanders, is a fascinating, jagged, feature debut from visual artist Johnson. It reimagines Richard Wright\u2019s Chicago-set 1940 novel about a young black man who lands a job as a driver for an affluent white family. While the setting is updated, the plot, to its credit, remains mostly unchanged, though Sanders\u2019s laconic, slinking presence suggests icy inner rage rather than the roiling fury that characterises protagonist Bigger Thomas on the page.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s festival saw the premieres of breakout hits such as <em>Eighth Grade</em>, <em>Sorry to Bother You</em> and <em>Leave No Trace</em>. My guess is that, of the films I saw, people will be enthusing about <em>Native Son</em> and <em>Honey Boy</em> in the months to come. My secret wish, however, is for the fabulous <em>The Souvenir </em>to become Joanna Hogg\u2019s crossover hit \u2013 though a mysterious surge of walkouts at my screening suggests there\u2019s work to do.</p> <h2>The best of Sundance 2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9672c1f5992c4827220bf14296f62fbfc82f0989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9672c1f5992c4827220bf14296f62fbfc82f0989/114_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Jupe in Honey Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noah Jupe in Honey Boy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natasha Braier/Courtesy of Sundance Institute | photo by Natasha Braier</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best film</strong> Alma Har\u2019el\u2019s <em>Honey Boy.</em></p> <p><strong>Worst film</strong> Justin Chon\u2019s <em>Ms Purple. </em>The storytelling is all over the place in the <em>Gook </em>director\u2019s latest.</p> <p><strong>Best performance</strong> Noah Jupe as a young Shia LaBeouf in <em>Honey Boy</em> had me bawling my eyes out.</p> <p><strong>Worst performance</strong> Pop star FKA twigs as a sex worker who happens to be Jupe/LaBeouf\u2019s neighbour, on the other hand, made me want to tear my eyes out.</p> <p><strong>Director to watch</strong> Joe Talbot (<em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em>).</p> <p><strong>Best comeback</strong> It\u2019s been six years since Joanna Hogg\u2019s last film, <em>Exhibition</em>, but with <em>The Souvenir</em> the director returns in style.</p> <p><strong>Best screenplay</strong> Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s <em>Animals</em> is even funnier than the novel it\u2019s based on.</p> <p><strong>Best short</strong> Garrett Bradley\u2019s beautiful, brain-exploding <em>America</em>, which played as part of the New Frontier shorts programme, is a radical overview of black cinema, a corrective to cultural amnesia and the most original film I saw all festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa909368dc31f7fafbec8594a3528e23c4c341a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa909368dc31f7fafbec8594a3528e23c4c341a7/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Thompson in Late Night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Thompson in Late Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Aragones/Courtesy of Sundance Institute | photo by Emily Aragones.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Record sale</strong> Mindy Kaling\u2019s <em>Late Night</em>, starring Emma Thompson, was talk of the town when it sold US rights to Amazon for \u00a310m ($13m) after its premiere \u2013 the biggest ever domestic sale at the festival.</p> <p><strong>Funniest faux pas</strong> Holliday Grainger\u2019s Laura spilling a glass of wine on a baby\u2019s head in <em>Animals</em>.</p> <p><strong>Best soundtrack</strong> <em>The Souvenir</em>, for its understated 80s soundtrack, and, begrudgingly, <em>Blinded by the Light</em>\u2019s jukebox of Bruce Springsteen hits.</p> <p><strong>Most awkward newsroom moment in </strong><em><strong>Official Secrets</strong></em><strong> </strong>When a subeditor runs Martin Bright\u2019s article through spellcheck, she corrects US spellings to UK English, accidentally discrediting the memo the paper ended up printing \u2013 enough to send a shiver down any writer\u2019s spine.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 4 February 2018 to clarify that Late Night was the festival\u2019s biggest domestic sale.</em></p>",

That film was Richard Kelly\u2019s Donnie Darko, beginning its journey to cult hit in the snowy peaks of Park City, Utah. Attending for the first time, lightheaded from the altitude, I daydreamed about finding this year\u2019s Donnie Darko, an oddity with star-making potential. Unlike Cannes (too focused on auteurs) or Toronto (too caught up with awards potential), Sundance still feels elastic enough to accommodate genuine curios. One such this year is The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Written and directed by native San Franciscan Joe Talbot, it opens with friends Jimmie (Jimmie Fails, co-writer) and Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), two eccentric African Americans skateboarding the steep, hilly streets of San Francisco while their rapidly gentrifying city floats by. What begins as a hangout movie evolves into a stirring dissection of the fictions people perpetuate to survive as the boys end up squatting in an 18th-century mansion in a now white neighbourhood that may or may not have been built by Jimmie\u2019s grandfather. The originality and scope of Talbot\u2019s vision feels exciting; if Sundance is about talent-tracking, he\u2019s surely one to watch. It was a sweet moment when Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham, Bride &amp; Prejudice) introduced the world premiere of her new film Blinded By the Light, a Mamma Mia-style musical featuring the music of Bruce Springsteen, by asking the audience to sing along to his 1980 hit Hungry Heart (they obliged). Based on journalist Sarfraz Manzoor\u2019s memoir, the film takes place in Luton circa 1987 against a backdrop of National Front marches and mass unemployment.

The film cycles through the Boss\u2019s hits, with Javed frequently quoting his lyrics in everyday conversation with no veneer of irony. It\u2019s a big-hearted crowdpleaser that rollicks along at an irrepressibly giddy pace, but it\u2019s earnest to a fault; those with a low tolerance for corniness will struggle, as I did, as the lyrics to Dancing in the Dark literally spin around Javed\u2019s head, in the style of Microsoft Word Art, during a thunderstorm. I was more taken with another British film, The Souvenir \u2013 an exquisitely judged excavation of and grainy homage to director Joanna Hogg\u2019s film-school days in 1980s London and the toxic relationship she was in at the time. Hogg casts Honor Swinton-Byrne (daughter of Tilda) as Julie, a riff on herself: shy, embarrassed about her upper-middle-class upbringing and utterly seduced by brooding, posh Anthony (a chilling and sultry Tom Burke). I was similarly impressed by Israeli-American director Alma Har\u2019el\u2019s tender feature-length fiction debut Honey Boy, in which Shia LaBeouf portrays a version of his own abusive father (with Lucas Hedges and Noah Jupe playing present-day and 12-year-old versions of himself respectively). The script, written by LaBeouf, is refreshingly direct, and at times, wrenchingly personal, anchored by vulnerable old-soul Jupe, who gives one of the most moving child performances I\u2019ve seen in years. Two documentaries also offered insights into the abuse of power: Ursula Macfarlane\u2019s anticipated Harvey Weinstein film Untouchable, and Leaving Neverland (Dan Reed), a four-hour Channel 4 production about two men who were allegedly sexually abused by the superstar Michael Jackson as children. Both films harness the shattering power of testimony, giving space to survivors of sexual assault. \u201cIt\u2019s the collateral damage \u2013 what it does to relationships,\u201d says Hope Exiner d\u2019Amore, who claims she was raped by Weinstein in the 1970s in Buffalo, New York. Macfarlane\u2019s film is a glossily comprehensive recap that grants voice to some of the women who suffered at the grasping hands of the tyrannical Hollywood mogul, though it doesn\u2019t elaborate much beyond the investigative reporting done by the New Yorker and the New York Times back in 2017. Details about Miramax, the production company Weinstein founded with his brother Bob, and its boom in the 1990s, contextualise some of the complicity from the coworkers who enabled him, but I suspect this is not the definitive telling of this story. Leaving Neverland, on the other hand, whose premiere had extra security in anticipation of protesters (in fact, there were just two), feels like incontrovertible evidence of Jackson\u2019s crimes. The film is built around the first-hand accounts of choreographer Wade Robson and former actor James Safechuck and their families. Part one tells of the grooming, seduction and abuse that began in the late 1980s when the boys were seven and 10 respectively, in shocking and graphic detail; part two focuses on the aftermath, including Jackson\u2019s civil case in 1993 and criminal trial in 2005 and the psychological reasons why they publicly defended their abuser. The running time may seem excessive, and it\u2019s a challenging watch, but the story and its context need space to breathe. The film is set to air as two episodes on Channel 4 and HBO in March. Political thrillers The Report (Scott Z Burns) and Official Secrets (Gavin Hood) set out to redress injustices carried out by institutions rather than individuals, both beginning against the backdrop of George W Bush\u2019s administration. The former is an enraging true story that zips along in spite of Burns\u2019s dense script, telling of the \u201ctorture report\u201d commissioned by the US Senate in 2009 to investigate the brutal \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d\u2019 used by the CIA on as many as 119 detainees suspected of terrorism. Adam Driver stars as staffer Dan Jones, who spent five thankless years compiling the report under the supervision of senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), only for its publication to be repeatedly thwarted.

In 2004, Observer reporter Martin Bright (played here by Matt Smith) published a memo leaked by 28-year-old British GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley, suitably staid) revealing that the US\u2019s National Security Agency had asked the UK to collect intelligence about UN security council members that could be used to pressure them into mandating the Iraq war. Gun confessed to the leak and was charged. Here, she and her story are treated with sombre respect, but the film comes alive in the newsroom scenes, played with a tongue-in-cheek edge. Animals (Sophie Hyde) and Native Son (Rashid Johnson) took their inspiration from novels rather than reportage. In the rambunctious, darkly hilarious Animals, writer Emma Jane Unsworth adapts her own bestselling novel, transplanting its setting from Manchester to Dublin and casting Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat as inseparable, permanently hungover best friends edging into their 30s. \u201cTragedy plus time equals comedy!\u201d opines Shawkat\u2019s Tyler; think the sharp, brittle millennial observations of novelist Sally Rooney meets the bawdy, female anarchy of V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1\u2019s Daisies. Native Son, starring Moonlight\u2019s Ashton Sanders, is a fascinating, jagged, feature debut from visual artist Johnson. It reimagines Richard Wright\u2019s Chicago-set 1940 novel about a young black man who lands a job as a driver for an affluent white family. While the setting is updated, the plot, to its credit, remains mostly unchanged, though Sanders\u2019s laconic, slinking presence suggests icy inner rage rather than the roiling fury that characterises protagonist Bigger Thomas on the page. Last year\u2019s festival saw the premieres of breakout hits such as Eighth Grade, Sorry to Bother You and Leave No Trace. My guess is that, of the films I saw, people will be enthusing about Native Son and Honey Boy in the months to come. My secret wish, however, is for the fabulous The Souvenir to become Joanna Hogg\u2019s crossover hit \u2013 though a mysterious surge of walkouts at my screening suggests there\u2019s work to do. The best of Sundance 2019 Best film Alma Har\u2019el\u2019s Honey Boy. Worst film Justin Chon\u2019s Ms Purple. The storytelling is all over the place in the Gook director\u2019s latest. Best performance Noah Jupe as a young Shia LaBeouf in Honey Boy had me bawling my eyes out. Worst performance Pop star FKA twigs as a sex worker who happens to be Jupe/LaBeouf\u2019s neighbour, on the other hand, made me want to tear my eyes out. Director to watch Joe Talbot (The Last Black Man in San Francisco). Best comeback It\u2019s been six years since Joanna Hogg\u2019s last film, Exhibition, but with The Souvenir the director returns in style. Best screenplay Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s Animals is even funnier than the novel it\u2019s based on. Best short Garrett Bradley\u2019s beautiful, brain-exploding America, which played as part of the New Frontier shorts programme, is a radical overview of black cinema, a corrective to cultural amnesia and the most original film I saw all festival. Record sale Mindy Kaling\u2019s Late Night, starring Emma Thompson, was talk of the town when it sold US rights to Amazon for \u00a310m ($13m) after its premiere \u2013 the biggest ever domestic sale at the festival. Funniest faux pas Holliday Grainger\u2019s Laura spilling a glass of wine on a baby\u2019s head in Animals. Best soundtrack The Souvenir, for its understated 80s soundtrack, and, begrudgingly, Blinded by the Light\u2019s jukebox of Bruce Springsteen hits. Most awkward newsroom moment in Official Secrets When a subeditor runs Martin Bright\u2019s article through spellcheck, she corrects US spellings to UK English, accidentally discrediting the memo the paper ended up printing \u2013 enough to send a shiver down any writer\u2019s spine. This article was amended on 4 February 2018 to clarify that Late Night was the festival\u2019s biggest domestic sale.",

He has credited his longevity in part to the work of a man he has described as his body engineer, Alex Guerrero, but the latter figure\u2019s growing influence and belief in alternative approaches to medicine and nutrition became a source of contention with New England\u2019s own training staff.</p> <p>By 2017, there were reports of a rift between Brady and Belichick, said to have grown also from the coach\u2019s insistence on developing a successor at quarterback. The Patriots had drafted Jimmy Garoppolo in the second round of the 2014 draft. Belichick said: \u201cI think you\u2019re better being early rather than late [in finding a replacement] at that position.\u201d</p> <p>Brady\u2019s response, however, was simply to raise his performance bar even higher at an age when one would expect some physical decline. This is the fourth time in five seasons he has taken the Patriots to the Super Bowl, after making two in the previous nine-year stretch. Garoppolo was traded to San Francisco in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cSome people are born with great height,\u201d said Brady last week when asked about what keeps him going. \u201cSome people are born with great size, great speed. Some people are born with other things I would say are more intangible.</p> <p>\u201cIt started when I was young and it\u2019s really a part of my whole family. It\u2019s definitely in my family\u2019s DNA to compete and to win. People think: \u2018You\u2019re 41. What are you doing?\u2019 And I\u2019ll still be shooting for the stars.

He has credited his longevity in part to the work of a man he has described as his body engineer, Alex Guerrero, but the latter figure\u2019s growing influence and belief in alternative approaches to medicine and nutrition became a source of contention with New England\u2019s own training staff. By 2017, there were reports of a rift between Brady and Belichick, said to have grown also from the coach\u2019s insistence on developing a successor at quarterback. The Patriots had drafted Jimmy Garoppolo in the second round of the 2014 draft. Belichick said: \u201cI think you\u2019re better being early rather than late [in finding a replacement] at that position.\u201d Brady\u2019s response, however, was simply to raise his performance bar even higher at an age when one would expect some physical decline. This is the fourth time in five seasons he has taken the Patriots to the Super Bowl, after making two in the previous nine-year stretch. Garoppolo was traded to San Francisco in 2017. \u201cSome people are born with great height,\u201d said Brady last week when asked about what keeps him going. \u201cSome people are born with great size, great speed. Some people are born with other things I would say are more intangible. \u201cIt started when I was young and it\u2019s really a part of my whole family. It\u2019s definitely in my family\u2019s DNA to compete and to win. People think: \u2018You\u2019re 41. What are you doing?\u2019 And I\u2019ll still be shooting for the stars. I\u2019m doing something I love to do.\u201d He has not always been able to channel such competitiveness in healthy ways. Brady has recalled breaking TV remotes and punching a hole in a wall when things did not go his way as a kid. Ask those at New England who have played with him and they will tell more recent tales of board games being flipped and table tennis paddles shattered in fits of frustration. Little wonder Brady is so reluctant to give up the gridiron: a space where a furious desire to win and a willingness to get physical are tremendous assets. He is still here and intends to be for a little while longer yet.",

In 2005 she and her sister, Becky, released their debut album (as Rachel Unthank and the Winterset), Cruel Sister; its follow-up, The Bairns, was nominated for the 2008 Mercury prize. In 2009 they became the Unthanks, and since then have released eight more albums, including Mount the Air, which won best album at the 2016 BBC Radio 2 folk awards. Their new triple album, Lines, released on Rabble Rouser on 22 February, is inspired by Emily Bront\u00eb, female war poets and fisheries worker Lillian Bilocca. 1. Podcast Midnight Lightning Laura Veirs is an American singer-songwriter who I like; she is also a mother, and on the podcast she interviews lots of women who are also mothers and musicians \u2013 the ones I\u2019ve listened to are Kristin Hersh, Rhiannon Giddens and Rosanne Cash. It explores the relationship between family life and having a career in music: issues like the practicality of who looks after the children. The theme of maternal guilt comes up a lot. I think that\u2019s something all parents have in common, whether they\u2019re musicians or not. For me it\u2019s like a mirror into my own life. 2. Fiction Winter by Ali Smith I never thought I\u2019d be in a book club. I thought it might be a bit combative, but some of my close friends started one and I\u2019ve found that I love it. I get introduced to new books, and I get to engage with my friends in a different way rather than just catching up about jobs and relationships and children. At the moment we\u2019re reading Winter, which I\u2019ve nearly finished. Ali Smith\u2019s writing is very compelling \u2013 it has a lot of forward momentum.

They\u2019ve got a new record out called The Imperial: each song is almost like a small novel, and the title track is crushing. Vlautin has real empathy for the characters he writes, and it\u2019s heartbreaking and sad but really warm and beautiful.

      "body": "<p>On 9 January 2018 the American actors Jessica Barth and Caitlin Dulany met at <a href=\"https://www.verlaine.la/\" title=\"\">Verlaine</a>, a hip coffee bar on Beverly Boulevard, in West Hollywood. They weren\u2019t alone. Nine other women had also arrived, all of whom had recently accused the film producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein</a> of sexual misconduct. The meeting had been arranged as part of an hour-long BBC <em>Panorama</em> documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09tnnzv\" title=\"\">Weinstein: The Inside Story</a></em>, on which I worked as a producer. At Verlaine, some of the women were not far away from where their alleged abuse had taken place.</p> <p>Until only a few months earlier, Barth and Dulany had felt alone and powerless, unaware that other women had suffered through similar incidents, and unable to find a platform through which they could safely speak out.</p> <p>But by the time the group met in Verlaine, more than 100 women had now come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct (Weinstein denies any non-consensual sex. His pre-trial begins on 7 March). In the three months since the initial allegations first appeared in the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">New York Times</a></em> and the <em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein/page/5\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a></em>, in October 2017, Barth, Dulany and the nine other women had slowly begun to share their own experiences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b74f1882a680a8ce57d0a5bc11cc452cf1460d65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b74f1882a680a8ce57d0a5bc11cc452cf1460d65/0_129_4064_5078/800.jpg\" alt=\"United we stand: Voices in Action.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">United we stand: Voices in Action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Jimmy Turrell/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They arrived at the bar one by one. Some appeared apprehensive. Beneath smiles and laughter there was a nervousness about the \u201csinister\u201d circumstances under which they were meeting. But they greeted each other warmly, as if they were old friends, empowered by the fact they no longer felt alone.</p> <p>Dulany recognised Barth and introduced herself, and soon the pair began sharing stories. Before long, the group stumbled upon a common frustration: what if they had been made aware there were other Weinstein accusers sooner? Might they have been able to stop him earlier?</p> <p>At the meeting, the two women agreed they wanted to help prevent others in the entertainment industry from slipping into a similar position: powerless to report an incident and unaware others might have experienced similar misconduct. Together, they decided to do something about it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We knew uniting victims had to be part of what we did next</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barth and Dulany have spent the past year establishing <a href=\"https://voicesinaction.org/\" title=\"\">Voices in Action</a>, an anonymous online reporting system, which launched in October 2018. The organisation\u2019s website, which has been backed by top lawyers and Hollywood actors, allows people to record incidents of sexual harassment and abuse. Crucially, victims will be alerted by the website\u2019s team of lawyers if others get in touch about the same alleged perpetrator.</p> <p>Since their first meeting, Dulany and Barth have been in contact with dozens of other Weinstein accusers on email threads and WhatsApp groups. Dulany, 51, alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel Du Cap in Cannes in 1996. She tells me that when she first started connecting with other women who had had similar experiences, it was a \u201cgame changer\u201d for her.</p> <p>\u201cAssault can be difficult to talk about, even with our closest family and friends,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I met everyone that day at the coffee shop it was still raw. I\u2019d been silent about it for so long, so I wasn\u2019t sure if I could talk to people about what happened. I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to leave my house.\u201d</p> <p>Barth agrees. \u201cI was definitely, like: \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was very nervous. It felt awkward to be coming together under such circumstances, but I\u2019m so glad I went, because what came out of it has been a true gift over what has been a monstrous time period.\u201d</p> <p>Dulany adds: \u201cI was taken aback to meet everyone. It was a shining light, and it became an important part of our healing. Suddenly having the support of others with similar experiences\u2026 It was transformative and that\u2019s why we knew uniting victims had to be part of what we did next.\u201d</p> <p>Barth, 38, is best known for her role in the <em>Ted</em> movie franchise. She alleges Weinstein sexually harassed her at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel in 2011, in exchange for a movie deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the statistics,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen don\u2019t report sexual crimes. They don\u2019t feel there is a place to go and don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be believed.\u201d She adds: \u201cThat\u2019s why we feel our platform is so necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Barth and Dulany happen to live \u201cabout four blocks from each other\u201d, and \u201ctalk every day, pretty much\u201d. They say they want to \u201cchange the culture\u201d that led to them feeling they couldn\u2019t speak about what had happened to them.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen and experienced why people in our industry are vulnerable, and we see the solution,\u201d Dulany says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard over the past year, speaking to experts, making sure we get this right. We don\u2019t want to see people going through what we did, but they still are and they still don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d</p> <p>Neither of Voices in Action\u2019s co-founders will have access to the website\u2019s submissions. The only person to see reports will be a \u201ctrauma-trained moderator\u201d, whose identity will be kept private. As soon as a report is lodged, the victim is given a time-stamped receipt that can be provided as a form of documentation in court or provided to the police. When there\u2019s a perpetrator match, victims are offered a free consultation with trusted lawyers, and given suggestions of investigative reporters they can get in touch with.</p> <p>Barth says that in 2015 she heard <em>Double Jeopardy</em> actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/ashley-judds-sexual-harassment-claim-against-harvey-weinstein-dismissed\" title=\"\">Ashley Judd</a> give a speech describing a \u201cvery similar\u201d incident to her own. \u201cShe didn\u2019t name him,\u201d Barth says, \u201cbut I knew right away it was Harvey. I wrote to her agent and didn\u2019t hear back, but just realising there was someone else out there made me feel less alone. It\u2019s safety in numbers,\u201d she adds. \u201cSexual offenders tend to be, as we\u2019re seeing, serial offenders, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to us to have a matching component.\u201d</p> <p>Judd was later one of the first women to name Weinstein, last October, along with fellow actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Rose McGowan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/the-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">Rosanna Arquette</a> and other celebrities whose names have now become synonymous with the #MeToo movement.</p> <p>Dulany, who is suing Weinstein as part of a class action lawsuit of 10 accusers, says the other Weinstein accusers have been \u201creally amazing\u201d in supporting their work, with some donating to their <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GoFundMe_UK_EN_Exact_Desktop&amp;utm_content=Gofundme&amp;utm_term=gofundme_e_c_ad&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyOLw4aaB4AIVm4KyCh3S1QEVEAAYASAAEgINGfD_BwE\" title=\"\">GoFundMe</a> campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWe have all been supporting each other through our different endeavours.\u201d she says. As a result, Voices in Action already has celebrity ambassadors, including Oscar-winning actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/peter-jackson-harvey-weinstein-ashley-judd-mira-sorvino\" title=\"\">Mira Sorvino</a>, who also accused Weinstein of harassment; actor and comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/terry-crews\" title=\"\">Terry Crews</a>; and actor <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0674782/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_1\" title=\"\">Harold Perrineau</a>.</p> <p>The pair believe part of the appeal of their new platform is that it is led by victims. Since the women hadn\u2019t been invited to participate in any of the early gatherings for <a href=\"https://www.timesupnow.com/\" title=\"\">Time\u2019s Up</a>, the industry support group formed by Hollywood actors in response to the Weinstein scandal, they felt they had to establish their own organisation.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of organisations in Hollywood are doing good things,\u201d Barth says, \u201cbut they\u2019re not necessarily survivor-run, and the people on their boards are in positions of power, which I think can deter victims from coming forward. At the moment we are self-funded, but we are reaching out to everyone at the top of our industry for support \u2013 those at Time\u2019s Up, the highest level agencies and studio executives. We feel like it\u2019s their responsibility to help support us financially, to keep our industry safe.\u201d</p> <p>Voices in Action is really the brainchild of Barth, who, when news of the allegations against Weinstein first broke, created the Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/whoisyourharvey?lang=en\" title=\"\">#WhoIsYourHarvey</a>, to encourage people to name their alleged abusers. But having consulted with experts and lawyers, the pair agreed that individuals won\u2019t initially be put in contact with each other for legal reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIf they talk to each other, then their stories may be influenced before they go to the police or a lawyer,\u201d says Dulany. Barth adds: \u201cConnecting victims straight away is not safe. They could be accused of collusion or making up a story. So it\u2019s smart and necessary to do this under confidentiality and privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Little, who serves as the pro bono counsel for Voices in Action, says the organisation is using systems to ensure transmitted data is kept secure. The users who opt into the matching system will also be required to verify their identity. Barth and Dulany hope their idea will eventually be rolled out to other industries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One common thing in sexual assault cases is that if people don\u2019t report right away, it affects their cases later</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe want to best serve every victim coming forward,\u201d Barth says, \u201cand if we opened it up right away to everybody, then we wouldn\u2019t have the resources to help them all. So we\u2019re starting here and hoping to build it into an app.\u201d Dulany adds: \u201cWe hope it will become a model for other industries. We would love that.\u201d</p> <p>Both women are keen to stress they are putting no pressure on victims to go public with their experiences if they\u2019re not ready, but documenting abuse when it happens can be important. \u201cOne of the most common things we see in sexual assault cases is that if people don\u2019t report right away, it affects their cases later,\u201d Dulany says.</p> <p>Barth continues: \u201cSo with our platform, you can report, it\u2019ll go into our system and you get an email receipt that is time-stamped, which we\u2019re finding can be a critical piece of evidence if you decide to press criminal charges. This allows victims to say: \u2018I did report it, here is my evidence, I just wasn\u2019t ready to come forward publicly then.\u2019 This is what a lot of survivors feel.\u201d</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/from-metoo-to-wetoo\" title=\"\">open letter</a>, the pair recently wrote: \u201cThink of how many victims could have been saved, how many serial predations could have been prevented and how many millions of dollars in legal fees could have been avoided if a matching site had previously existed.\u201d</p> <p>As Dulany tells me: \u201cThis last year has been such hard work, but it has been so worth it to be able to see this through to the end and to see it grow from here\u2026 It may sound cheesy, but we really feel like this is our purpose now. It\u2019s our calling.\u201d</p> <p><em>Visit the Voices in Action GoFundMe page at <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/from-metoo-to-wetoo\">gofundme.com/from-metoo-to-wetoo</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "On 9 January 2018 the American actors Jessica Barth and Caitlin Dulany met at Verlaine, a hip coffee bar on Beverly Boulevard, in West Hollywood. They weren\u2019t alone. Nine other women had also arrived, all of whom had recently accused the film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. The meeting had been arranged as part of an hour-long BBC Panorama documentary, Weinstein: The Inside Story, on which I worked as a producer. At Verlaine, some of the women were not far away from where their alleged abuse had taken place. Until only a few months earlier, Barth and Dulany had felt alone and powerless, unaware that other women had suffered through similar incidents, and unable to find a platform through which they could safely speak out. But by the time the group met in Verlaine, more than 100 women had now come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct (Weinstein denies any non-consensual sex. His pre-trial begins on 7 March). In the three months since the initial allegations first appeared in the New York Times and the New Yorker, in October 2017, Barth, Dulany and the nine other women had slowly begun to share their own experiences. They arrived at the bar one by one. Some appeared apprehensive. Beneath smiles and laughter there was a nervousness about the \u201csinister\u201d circumstances under which they were meeting. But they greeted each other warmly, as if they were old friends, empowered by the fact they no longer felt alone. Dulany recognised Barth and introduced herself, and soon the pair began sharing stories. Before long, the group stumbled upon a common frustration: what if they had been made aware there were other Weinstein accusers sooner? Might they have been able to stop him earlier? At the meeting, the two women agreed they wanted to help prevent others in the entertainment industry from slipping into a similar position: powerless to report an incident and unaware others might have experienced similar misconduct. Together, they decided to do something about it. Barth and Dulany have spent the past year establishing Voices in Action, an anonymous online reporting system, which launched in October 2018. The organisation\u2019s website, which has been backed by top lawyers and Hollywood actors, allows people to record incidents of sexual harassment and abuse. Crucially, victims will be alerted by the website\u2019s team of lawyers if others get in touch about the same alleged perpetrator. Since their first meeting, Dulany and Barth have been in contact with dozens of other Weinstein accusers on email threads and WhatsApp groups. Dulany, 51, alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel Du Cap in Cannes in 1996. She tells me that when she first started connecting with other women who had had similar experiences, it was a \u201cgame changer\u201d for her. \u201cAssault can be difficult to talk about, even with our closest family and friends,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I met everyone that day at the coffee shop it was still raw. I\u2019d been silent about it for so long, so I wasn\u2019t sure if I could talk to people about what happened. I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted to leave my house.\u201d Barth agrees. \u201cI was definitely, like: \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was very nervous. It felt awkward to be coming together under such circumstances, but I\u2019m so glad I went, because what came out of it has been a true gift over what has been a monstrous time period.\u201d Dulany adds: \u201cI was taken aback to meet everyone. It was a shining light, and it became an important part of our healing. Suddenly having the support of others with similar experiences\u2026 It was transformative and that\u2019s why we knew uniting victims had to be part of what we did next.\u201d Barth, 38, is best known for her role in the Ted movie franchise. She alleges Weinstein sexually harassed her at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel in 2011, in exchange for a movie deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the statistics,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen don\u2019t report sexual crimes. They don\u2019t feel there is a place to go and don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be believed.\u201d She adds: \u201cThat\u2019s why we feel our platform is so necessary.\u201d Barth and Dulany happen to live \u201cabout four blocks from each other\u201d, and \u201ctalk every day, pretty much\u201d. They say they want to \u201cchange the culture\u201d that led to them feeling they couldn\u2019t speak about what had happened to them. \u201cWe have seen and experienced why people in our industry are vulnerable, and we see the solution,\u201d Dulany says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working really hard over the past year, speaking to experts, making sure we get this right. We don\u2019t want to see people going through what we did, but they still are and they still don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d Neither of Voices in Action\u2019s co-founders will have access to the website\u2019s submissions. The only person to see reports will be a \u201ctrauma-trained moderator\u201d, whose identity will be kept private. As soon as a report is lodged, the victim is given a time-stamped receipt that can be provided as a form of documentation in court or provided to the police. When there\u2019s a perpetrator match, victims are offered a free consultation with trusted lawyers, and given suggestions of investigative reporters they can get in touch with. Barth says that in 2015 she heard Double Jeopardy actor Ashley Judd give a speech describing a \u201cvery similar\u201d incident to her own. \u201cShe didn\u2019t name him,\u201d Barth says, \u201cbut I knew right away it was Harvey. I wrote to her agent and didn\u2019t hear back, but just realising there was someone else out there made me feel less alone. It\u2019s safety in numbers,\u201d she adds. \u201cSexual offenders tend to be, as we\u2019re seeing, serial offenders, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to us to have a matching component.\u201d Judd was later one of the first women to name Weinstein, last October, along with fellow actors Rose McGowan, Rosanna Arquette and other celebrities whose names have now become synonymous with the #MeToo movement. Dulany, who is suing Weinstein as part of a class action lawsuit of 10 accusers, says the other Weinstein accusers have been \u201creally amazing\u201d in supporting their work, with some donating to their GoFundMe campaign. \u201cWe have all been supporting each other through our different endeavours.\u201d she says. As a result, Voices in Action already has celebrity ambassadors, including Oscar-winning actor Mira Sorvino, who also accused Weinstein of harassment; actor and comedian Terry Crews; and actor Harold Perrineau. The pair believe part of the appeal of their new platform is that it is led by victims. Since the women hadn\u2019t been invited to participate in any of the early gatherings for Time\u2019s Up, the industry support group formed by Hollywood actors in response to the Weinstein scandal, they felt they had to establish their own organisation. \u201cA lot of organisations in Hollywood are doing good things,\u201d Barth says, \u201cbut they\u2019re not necessarily survivor-run, and the people on their boards are in positions of power, which I think can deter victims from coming forward. At the moment we are self-funded, but we are reaching out to everyone at the top of our industry for support \u2013 those at Time\u2019s Up, the highest level agencies and studio executives. We feel like it\u2019s their responsibility to help support us financially, to keep our industry safe.\u201d Voices in Action is really the brainchild of Barth, who, when news of the allegations against Weinstein first broke, created the Twitter hashtag #WhoIsYourHarvey, to encourage people to name their alleged abusers. But having consulted with experts and lawyers, the pair agreed that individuals won\u2019t initially be put in contact with each other for legal reasons. \u201cIf they talk to each other, then their stories may be influenced before they go to the police or a lawyer,\u201d says Dulany. Barth adds: \u201cConnecting victims straight away is not safe. They could be accused of collusion or making up a story. So it\u2019s smart and necessary to do this under confidentiality and privilege.\u201d Alex Little, who serves as the pro bono counsel for Voices in Action, says the organisation is using systems to ensure transmitted data is kept secure. The users who opt into the matching system will also be required to verify their identity. Barth and Dulany hope their idea will eventually be rolled out to other industries. \u201cWe want to best serve every victim coming forward,\u201d Barth says, \u201cand if we opened it up right away to everybody, then we wouldn\u2019t have the resources to help them all. So we\u2019re starting here and hoping to build it into an app.\u201d Dulany adds: \u201cWe hope it will become a model for other industries. We would love that.\u201d Both women are keen to stress they are putting no pressure on victims to go public with their experiences if they\u2019re not ready, but documenting abuse when it happens can be important. \u201cOne of the most common things we see in sexual assault cases is that if people don\u2019t report right away, it affects their cases later,\u201d Dulany says. Barth continues: \u201cSo with our platform, you can report, it\u2019ll go into our system and you get an email receipt that is time-stamped, which we\u2019re finding can be a critical piece of evidence if you decide to press criminal charges. This allows victims to say: \u2018I did report it, here is my evidence, I just wasn\u2019t ready to come forward publicly then.\u2019 This is what a lot of survivors feel.\u201d In an open letter, the pair recently wrote: \u201cThink of how many victims could have been saved, how many serial predations could have been prevented and how many millions of dollars in legal fees could have been avoided if a matching site had previously existed.\u201d As Dulany tells me: \u201cThis last year has been such hard work, but it has been so worth it to be able to see this through to the end and to see it grow from here\u2026 It may sound cheesy, but we really feel like this is our purpose now. It\u2019s our calling.\u201d Visit the Voices in Action GoFundMe page at gofundme.com/from-metoo-to-wetoo",

To try to understand whether the history behind this contest had resonance here any more. Whether Test cricket meant that much to many people. And if not, then why not?</p> <p>West Indian Test cricket had a formative role in my childhood. I had grown up idolising a world-class team from the region, built on the successes of a previous generation that had pioneered the art of aggressive fast bowling and brutal craft with the bat to become perhaps the best group of 11 players in the history of the game.</p> <p>A signed bat from former captain Brian Lara took pride of place in my bedroom, next to a poster of the fast bowler Curtly Ambrose. My grandfather\u2019s oversized woollen West Indies playing jumper, which drooped off my body when I played in the summers, hung in a closet. My great-grandmother, who grew up poor on the sugar plantations of rural Guyana, had knitted it for him when he was a child, and it passed down through the generations after.</p> <p>I would sometimes spend weekends at my grandfather\u2019s home in north London watching the team play on TV.

The success of West Indies cricket was for him, like many others of his generation, both an escape and a source of pride. He named his only son after the Guyanese Test batsman Rohan Kanhai. He sat for days by the boundary rope when the West Indies toured England. In his later years he would travel to watch the team play, in India and then at home against England in 1997, when the West Indies won the series 3-1.</p> <p>For me, in the late 1990s, it was an education in heritage and identity. With mementos from his travels abroad in my bag, I would be cheered on by him from the sidelines when I played club and school cricket. He was proud, dreaming I\u2019d one day become a serious fast bowler. (His ambition for me far exceeded my talents.)</p> <p>OJ died in 2006 when I was 21, shortly after West Indian Test cricket fell from grace. My interest in the team went with him \u2013 and I was far from the only one to feel that way.</p> <p>During that first Test at the Kensington Oval \u2013 a ground which once drew thousands when England toured here \u2013 the crowds were dwindling. When I asked people around Barbados why they no longer showed up, the responses varied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a team any more.\u201d \u201cI prefer the shorter games.\u201d \u201cI divorced my husband and it just reminds me of him.\u201d</p> <p>But, in the members\u2019 area directly behind the wicket, the spirit of this unique sporting culture lived on among both the old-timers and optimistic youth. Here, almost hidden away, West Indian supporters gathered in small enclaves. Some chattered, dissecting the game ball by ball. Others watched on, listening to radio commentary through earphones, hypnotised by the play on field.</p> <p>Most of what kept OJ passionate about the team decades ago \u2013 deep pride and a belief in the renewal of youth \u2013 is still what drives people today, although there is no discussion of geopolitics and relations between England and its former colonies.</p> <p>Edwin Haynes, 62, had been a member since he was 14. A retired maths teacher at the Combermere School outside Bridgetown, he burst with pride when he explained that three of the West Indies\u2019 starting line-up, the 26-year-old batsmen Kraigg Braithwaite and Roston Chase and wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich, 27, were former students of his. \u201cThey all came up in a rich tradition of cricket at our school,\u201d he said as Braithwaite smashed a four on the first day of the first match. \u201cAnd you could tell they were special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d10100208f056e5eeb8d088003b166a0e3cdefc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d10100208f056e5eeb8d088003b166a0e3cdefc1/0_231_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The greatest fast bowling combination, from left, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner of the West Indies during the first Test against England in Trinidad in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hoped his 15-year-old son Christian, a fast bowler, might follow one day. \u201cI would like us to continue that tradition of beating England. And on our day we can beat anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Alleyne, a 57-year-old businessman, had been coming for 50 years. \u201cCricket has bonded us and kept us all together,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we grew up it was pretty much all we had, and it presented an opportunity to improve your life.\u201d He too hopes his 13-year-old son Miles will turn professional one day. \u201cIf he does then I can retire.\u201d</p> <p>And Rodney Carter, the former security guard who had leapt to his feet on the second day, told me it was his daughter Charlene, a former professional, who kept him going when his interest ebbed. \u201cI just loved watching her bat. She was exquisite,\u201d he said. \u201cI see every game here now. It connects me to something bigger.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the West Indies\u2019 dominance in these first two matches, there is a recognition, among the deeper cricket thinkers at least, that making comparisons to the previous generations of greats does little to help now.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we had the great players in the 70s, the Caribbean was a totally different place,\u201d said Reds Perreira the acclaimed Guyanese cricket commentator who has followed the team around the world for almost 50 years. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have the options they have now: track and field, volleyball, basketball, all with scholarships to the US. Whereas nine out of 10 boys wanted to play cricket then, that\u2019s probably come down to about five now.\u201d</p> <p>Perreira, too, sees significant hope in the new era of players. He points out that despite recent controversies with the region\u2019s cricket board, including pay disputes and accusations of endemic mismanagement, the West Indies now contracts 120 players around the region \u2013 the highest in its history \u2013 expanding the talent pool and paying fairer wages.</p> <p>\u201cI think these things go in phases just like in other sports. Look at the Brazilian football team that in peak times produced players so frequently, just like the West Indies did for cricket. These things have their highs and their lows.\u201dBy the fourth day of the first match, when a West Indies victory seemed certain and organisers dropped the price of tickets for locals, the stands began to swell. Children chanted Holder\u2019s name. A saxophonist played the region\u2019s anthem, Rally Round the West Indies. The rum flowed and people began a friendly taunting of the English players: \u201cCome on boys, give us a real Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Boycott\u2019s words would be re-read on radio call-ins with some callers demanding he apologise. Johnny Grave, chief executive of Cricket West Indies, would later label them disrespectful.</p> <p>OJ would have loved it. As I sat there in the Kensington Oval I thought of him each time an English wicket fell. I wondered where in the ground he would have sat. How he\u2019d have felt about the newly built stands that replaced the old tin-roofed stadium back in 2006. How he might have celebrated. With minutes to go in Barbados, before the West Indies beat England by 381 runs with a day to spare, the country\u2019s newly elected prime minister, Mia Mottley, appeared among the crowds \u2013 posing for selfies and signing autographs. \u201cThere is nothing like victory for the West Indies at Kensington,\u201d Mottley told me. \u201cI remember as a small child coming to this ground and seeing the West Indies at their height.</p> <p>\u201cI was here the morning, the first day of the Test match [in 1981] when Michael Holding got Geoff Boycott out on the fifth ball. And this is carrying me back to a previous time. We hope it\u2019s not a one-off, but will portend well for the future and inspire other young West Indian boys and girls that we can once again be world champions.\u201d</p>",

They are the individuals within our cultures that are the most sensitive to the difficulties \u2013 and stresses \u2013 that societies experience,\u201d <a href=\"https://pediatrics.ucsf.edu/faculty/tom-boyce\" title=\"\">Tom Boyce</a> tells me. Professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of California, he specialises in the treatment of three- to eight-year-olds. Major stressors in this age group include marital conflict, violence in the home, violence in the community, problems with parental mental health \u2013 a mum or dad who is depressed \u2013 maltreatment and disciplinary behaviours that become punitive.</p> <p>On top of all that, as <a href=\"https://www.buzzconsulting.co.uk/about\" title=\"\">Dominique Thompson</a>, a former student health GP who treated clients aged 11 and up, points out: \u201cSchool is a source of huge anxiety.\u201d SATS ensure that academic pressure is felt even in primary school. \u201cChildren are naturally very wary of letting people down,\u201d Thompson adds. Friendships, social media, and social situations are additional triggers, while teens especially struggle with identity. \u201cThe whole point of adolescence is to separate from their parents\u201d, she says. \u201cThey are creating their new image, who they want to be, what they want to be known for. That in itself is a stressful process.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The signs<br></strong>\u201cSome kids can say what is bothering them,\u201d says Boyce, whose new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1509805184/ref=asc_df_150980518458083586/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;creative=22110&amp;creativeASIN=1509805184&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310805565966&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15969295464606855861&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9046005&amp;hvtargid=pla-662336516767&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" title=\"\">The Orchid and the Dandelion</a>, explores why some children struggle to survive while others thrive easily. More often, he says, parental detective work is required. There may be nightmares, night-waking, bed-wetting. Children may seek to avoid activities they would normally take pleasure in. Some may display obsessive behaviours, overuse social media, or become withdrawn.</p> <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>For children who want to talk repeatedly about worries, set aside 15 minutes\u2019 daily \u201cworry time\u201d. Establish that worries may be thoroughly discussed in worry time but not outside of it; say, \u201clet\u2019s talk about that in worry time\u201d. Thompson recommends Headspace\u2019s kids app, which she uses with her nine-year-old. \u201cHe has two minutes\u2019 mindfulness before bed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Deciding when to push a child and when to accede to their refusals is difficult, and can only \u201cbe based on intuition of your own infinite knowledge of your child\u201d, Boyce says. Creativity helps. He mentions one mother of a young child who refused to get ready for school. She stuck fuzzy felt-type pieces for brushing teeth, putting on shoes, eating breakfast etc on a board and let her son choose which order to arrange these events in each day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85f9dc5030aa0cb1f4ad1de2d383fc5ba78bec3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85f9dc5030aa0cb1f4ad1de2d383fc5ba78bec3a/0_91_2362_2952/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Leon Edler\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sandwich generation, those aged 35-55, face the stress of caring for children and ageing parents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Leon Edler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boyce\u2019s key recommendations for children are: stick to routines and rituals. Engage in play. Show compassion, communicate that your love is unconditional. Honour the differences between children. All of this takes time but Boyce is fond of telling parents that there is no such thing as \u201cquality time\u201d. Just provide enough time of any kind together. Closeness and frank conversations can emerge out of this swathe of time, at unplanned moments such as during a journey to a football match or while doing another activity.</p> <p>For children who become avoidant, Thompson suggests this approach, influenced by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): \u201cDon\u2019t ridicule. Don\u2019t catastrophise. Say, \u2018What are you worried might happen? ... And what would happen then?... OK, we can deal with that. We\u2019ve got plasters, a first aid kit \u2026\u2019\u201d When stress and anxiety \u201cinterfere with normal life\u201d, she says, that\u2019s the time to see your GP.</p> <h2>16-25 years</h2> <p><strong>Triggers</strong><strong><br></strong>\u201cDevelopmental tasks from late teens into early adulthood are about moving away from your family,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.alexfowke.com/\" title=\"\">Alex Fowke, a clinical psychologist</a>. With independence comes the fear of rejection and humiliation. Relationships, or lack of them, cause immense stress, not least because these are busy years in terms of shaping identity. Greater fluidity around identity can bring its own challenges. Fowke mentions a former client who was fluid in gender and sexuality. \u201cAs much as they found themselves attracted to everyone, by fitting everywhere, you don\u2019t fit anywhere,\u201d he says. All this at a time when you might find yourself, as a student or in a first job, living away from home with strangers.</p> <p>Financial worries are common, although according to Thompson, who is a member of the <a href=\"https://www.studentminds.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Student Minds</a> clinical advisory group, students tend to cite these less often than relationship and academic pressures. At exam time and during university, the atmosphere can foster a tendency towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/17/my-brain-feels-like-its-been-punched-the-intolerable-rise-of-perfectionism\" title=\"\">perfectionism</a> \u2013 the setting of impossible targets, often accompanied by self-beration, prevarication, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/19/sharmadean-reid-imposter-syndrome\" title=\"\">impostor syndrome</a>.</p> <p>Social media exerts its own particular pressures and a habit of incessantly comparing with others \u2014 what Fowke describes as \u201ccompare and despair\u201d. In addition, family stressors \u2013 divorcing parents, for instance \u2013 are common. Thompson advises parents robustly to resist the temptation to look to their older children for support.</p> <p><strong>The signs<br></strong>At this age, stress can sometimes disguise itself in strong emotions. Thompson says that lots of young women present with tearfulness, and men with irritability and anger \u2013 punching walls or picking fights. Others may find that they are compulsively seeking reassurance. There can be a non-specific sense of dread in the back of the mind. Some may use alcohol or drugs or smart drugs to manage worries, especially those who are living away from home or in reach of a cheap student bar. \u201cFocusing and attention become difficult,\u201d Fowke adds, \u201cand can result in what might look like a memory problem.\u201d Many will choose to avoid any kind of social scenario. Some will lurk on social media in order to compare themselves with others.</p> <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>If identity or legacy issues are causing stress, Fowke recommends doing some work on your values: ask yourself what you would like people to say about you at your leaving party. Retirement is a very long way off, but according to Fowke, legacy worries commonly present at this age, perhaps because the choices young people are asked to make can feel like committing to an entire career. Thinking about the bigger picture helps to adjust expectations. \u201cSometimes our task as individuals is to reconcile the stuff we do for fun with the stuff that just needs to be done,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For those about to embark on university life, Student Minds has free, <a href=\"https://www.studentminds.org.uk/transitions.html\" title=\"\">downloadable resources</a>. Student unions are a good starting point, while universities offer counselling and courses to tackle perfectionism, exam pressure, prevarication, and other mental health challenges; ask if yours has signed up to a closed trial of <a href=\"https://fika.community/\" title=\"\">Fika</a>, an app designed to foster self-acceptance and coping skills. The website <a href=\"https://student.kooth.com/\" title=\"\">Kooth</a> offers free online counselling, and a place to monitor your emotional wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cMindfulness-based treatment helps to shift the focus away from catastrophic thought spirals,\u201d Fowke advises. Social anxiety can be confronted with gradual exposure \u2013 go for coffee and listen to the types of conversations other people have, Fowke says. \u201cSometimes [confronting anxiety] needs more formal training,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Depression-College-Pocket-Guide-Student/dp/1789560608\" title=\"\">adds Thompson</a>. In those cases, GPs can offer referrals for CBT. \u201cAnd a few people need medication, which is no problem because it works really well.\u201d</p> <h2>25-35 years</h2> <p><strong>Triggers</strong><strong><br></strong>This is a time of huge life transition. \u201cThere is this pressure to make lifelong decisions at a really young age,\u201d Fowke says. Social media permits endless comparisons, with others who have made the same or different decisions. \u201cWhen we do social comparisons,\u201d Fowke adds, \u201cwe typically come off worse.\u201d Many in this age group will focus on how to have the perfect marriage and children while still making an impact at work. They might compare their lives to those of their parents at the same age. There may be a pressure to start a family. \u201cOne of the stressors tends to be: \u2018I should have these things by now. I see my friends settling down. I\u2019m not even dating anyone.\u2019 There\u2019s sometimes an unrealistic expectation that everything is possible,\u201d Fowke says. For women in particular, children impact on career progression, which brings new worries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e1a13bb3cacda514888e74916b71d112bd3381a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1a13bb3cacda514888e74916b71d112bd3381a/23_10_2056_2570/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Leon Edler\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s OK to be rubbish at new things. <br>One of the great things about old age is that<br>you can fail</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Leon Edler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those entering employment for the first time face a major adjustment; perfectionists can suffer. \u201cThey find themselves in a situation where they are deskilled or incompetent, and it unsettles their sense of self,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://sallybrowntherapy.com/\" title=\"\">Sally Brown</a>, a coach and counsellor who says she sees many young, driven, outwardly successful people aged 18 to 30 who are struggling with debilitating levels of anxiety.</p> <p><strong>The signs<br></strong>\u201cAnxiety will leak out in whichever way that your individual vulnerability will allow it,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI saw somebody recently who became very anxious about whether she had hit someone while driving. That is a form of OCD.\u201d She also cites the compulsive overthinking of social situations. \u201cPost-event analysis: coming home, rerunning conversations, feeling judged.\u201d</p> <p>Some people find they lose the will to do tasks they were previously happy to do, from getting on the underground to speaking in meetings. They might become avoidant, while others exist in a \u201chypervigilant state, where you feel that something awful might happen. This sense of fear lurks around the edges. There can be a constant narrative of \u2018Am I having a breakdown, will I be able to cope, will I have another panic attack?\u2019\u201d Brown adds.</p> <p>Self-criticism is \u201cmassive in this age group. Many clients \u201chave installed an inner bully in their head, that berates them 24/7. We would not tolerate that kind of person in our life following us around saying that to us, but we do it to ourselves.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>Brown advocates self-compassion. \u201cIt is not about letting yourself off the hook, it\u2019s about self-acceptance.\u201d To those who self-berate, she suggests an experiment. \u201cFor one week, treat yourself with the same kindness and acceptance that you would treat a good friend whom you love. That in itself can be transformative.\u201d Sometimes it helps to label the self-berating voice. Brown talks about \u201cputting the troll back in the box\u201d.</p> <p>Listen carefully to your anxiety. Panic attacks are often \u201ca sign that the brain needs to have opportunities throughout the day to come down to a state of calm,\u201d Browns says. She recommends \u201ca personal daily prescription for mental wellbeing\u201d. Take five minutes with a cup of tea; resist scrolling through your phone. \u201cCheck in with yourself,\u201d she says. Ask yourself, \u201cHow do I feel, where\u2019s my thinking going?\u201d If your shoulders are up by your ears, let go of tension. Try 7/11 breathing \u2013 breathe in for a count of seven and out for 11: a longer out-breath regulates the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.</p> <p>Brown likes the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise as a way to ground yourself in the present: think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can smell and one you can taste. Try to resist the urge to check social media first thing in the morning. One early refusal can make a big difference to the day.</p> <p>Know your thinking patterns: catch yourself in the act of catastrophising or being a perfectionist, or inflexible, and name the behaviour to yourself. This helps to take anxiety out of the driving seat.</p> <h2>35-55 years</h2> <p><strong>Triggers</strong><strong><br></strong>\u201cThere\u2019s real mental and physical load at this age,\u201d says <a href=\"https://personalresilience.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Louise Tyler</a>, a counsellor based in Altrincham who works with many high-achieving professionals on building resilience. Financial concerns, ageing, a sense of mortality are all factors, along with what Tyler calls \u201can existential search for purpose. People start to become aware that life doesn\u2019t go on for ever.\u201d There are questions such as \u201cHave I put enough money aside? How will I face retirement?\u201d And all the while there\u2019s \u201ca need to feel constantly productive and efficient\u201d, she says. Commonly known as the sandwich generation, many in this age group will care for both teenage children and ageing parents. Relationship breakdown, divorce and loneliness can be further triggers, along with the emergence of health issues.</p> <p>For others, Fowke says, anxiety may be triggered by grief at not having had children. The perimenopause and menopause both cause stress, including both physical and emotional symptoms. For men, there is thought to be a similar life change called the andropause, associated with a gradual drop in testosterone. Men may develop depression, loss of sex drive and other symptoms.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_rauch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Jonathan Rauch</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-happiness-curve-9781472960948/\" title=\"\">The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better after 50</a>, points out, in this age group \u201cit\u2019s perfectly natural to go through an emotional reboot\u201d. (Consider this a rebranding of the midlife crisis.) </p> <p><strong>The signs</strong></p> <p>Waking at night, often with the mind whirring. \u201cIf you have cortisol racing through the body in the day, it will not switch off at night, Tyler warns. \u201cYour body will ping awake.\u201d Stress hormones can bring palpitations and nausea, a lack of energy and restlessness. Tyler finds some people develop irrational phobias that they\u2019ve not had before \u2013 becoming fearful, for instance, of driving on the motorway. Rauch cites \u201cunaccountable frustration and disappointment\u201d. Anger and arguments with partners can increase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Give yourself permission to switch off. Read, put on music. What you do doesn\u2019t matter: it\u2019s the stopping that counts</p> <footer> <cite>Louise Tyler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>Tyler says that women in the sandwich generation tend to \u201ctake on more of the emotional laundry\u201d and arrive at her door \u201cburnt out\u201d. She encourages these clients to give themselves permission to switch off and suggests including regular \u201cstop points\u201d \u2013 ideally three times a day. What you do in this time doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s the stopping that counts. Meditate, read the paper, put on music during the commute home. It\u2019s important to \u201cmake that switch from seeing downtime as selfish\u201d, she says. Exercise also helps by burning off adrenaline. Tyler thinks it may help to stop thinking of exercise as something you \u201cshould\u201d do, and to see it as \u201ca useful strategy\u201d you choose to deploy. Counselling works for some.</p> <p>Rauch, an author and journalist, found coaching beneficial when he experienced a slump in his forties. For those who are feeling discontented, he points in his book to research that shows that after the age of 50 stress levels begin to drop. It helps, he says, to know \u201cthat what you are going through is normal and healthy, and [is part of] a transition to positivity and contentment\u201d. Change is best made in small, manageable steps. \u201cThe urge to escape is misleading and won\u2019t help in most cases. Normalise. Understand. Reach out to others. Not doing that is the mistake that I made,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial isolation makes it worse. Stay focused in the present. Midlife is a time trap. You are disappointed about your life in the past and pessimistic about it in the future.\u201d But, he says, this is just the start of a period of shifting values.</p> <h2>55-70 years</h2> <p><strong>Triggers<br></strong>\u201cDeath, to be blunt,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/therapist/martin-pollecoff/\" title=\"\">Martin Pollecoff</a>, 69, a psychotherapist and chair of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy. Friendship groups at this age may be decimated by ill health and death. As in any time of transition, the strain on relationships is immense. \u201cIt\u2019s quite common that one partner is much better at amusing themselves,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.celiadodd.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Celia Dodd</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Not-Fade-Away-Thrive-Retirement-ebook/dp/B07HF2NMJD\" title=\"\">Not Fade Away: How to Thrive in Retirement</a>. \u201cIf one partner is retired and one isn\u2019t, the one who isn\u2019t is very likely to say, \u2018What have you been doing all day?\u2019\u201d This can exacerbate the sense of purposelessness. There may be conflict with grownup children, distance from grandchildren.</p> <p>For those who have associated stress with a busy working life, it can be hard to recognise listlessness as a sign of anxiety, while those who are new to retirement might be running on adrenaline, with nowhere to spend it, no sense of purpose.</p> <p>For some, Dodd observes \u201ca kind of competitive retirement\u201d in which there is \u201ca new pressure on people to have a great time.\u201d Regrets can loom large. And underlying all this is deep uncertainty about what lies ahead.</p> <p><strong>The signs<br></strong>Procrastination, along with enlarging health worries. Many people feel reluctant to leave the house. Some feel frustration at not achieving anything in the day, or ruminate on past disappointments. \u201cWine o\u2019clock starts earlier and earlier,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cAnd then just feeling uninterested in life, thinking, What\u2019s the point in anything?\u201d</p> <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>Acceptance. \u201cAccept the things you have done, the things you will never be able to do,\u201d Pollecoff advises. \u201cYou have to face up to the paths you didn\u2019t take,\u201d Dodd adds. \u201cThink about them. Then try to think of the good things that you did instead.\u201d</p> <p>Rauch, 58, is finding this age \u201ca great period for relaunch. Our values change. We put less emphasis on ambition and more on relationships, other people, which is very rewarding.\u201d Finding new routines helps. \u201cWork fills up this big space in our life, and it is a question of finding new things that have value,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThey are really to do with people. Connecting with other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8db19d68d614c7b486808e29e21c56ce0b4da27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8db19d68d614c7b486808e29e21c56ce0b4da27/0_0_2362_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Leon Edler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Between the ages of 55 and 70, try a new activity that challenges you.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Leon Edler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For those who find it hard to get out of the house, Dodd suggests making small changes. Listen to a different radio station. Go to a cafe for breakfast. Walk a different way to a familiar destination. Find a new activity that challenges you. \u201cComfort zone is a horrible phrase,\u201d Dodd says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to keep stretching and be prepared to be a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Then you get this fantastic sense of achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteering is one way to do this, although the challenge could also be planning a holiday, with a subsidiary goal of learning a language, say, or a physical challenge such as running a 5K. Try your hand at something new. And remember, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be crap at things,\u201d says Pollecoff. \u201cOne of the great things about old age is that you can fail and it\u2019s not going to destroy you.\u201d</p> <p>Use newly available time to prioritise health. \u201cBecome your own doctor,\u201d Pollecoff says. \u201cDiet. Exercise. Put health first.\u201d Finally, Dodd and Pollecoff both agree that \u201cfollowing your curiosity\u201d is key.</p> <h2>Over 70 years</h2> <p><strong>Triggers<br></strong>Each decade over 70 brings subtly different challenges, but throughout this period you may be facing the loss of a partner, or of friends, and a perceived loss of place in society. For some there is the prospect of a move into a care home, or the fear of it. For those with early stages of dementia with some insight into their condition, there may be the sense that \u201cthe locus of control is moving away from you\u201d, explains <a href=\"https://britishgeriatricssociety.wordpress.com/tag/duncan-forsyth/\" title=\"\">Duncan Forsyth</a>, a consultant geriatrician.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/doctors/roles-doctors/psychiatry/old-age-psychiatry/real-life-story-dr-alex-bailey\" title=\"\">Alex Bailey</a>, a doctor in the old age faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, fear of death is not a big problem. \u201cI\u2019m 40 and I\u2019m terrified of death,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t tend to see that in older people so much. People who have had a long life experience have generally come to terms with that.\u201d Or built resilience against it. Ill health, on the other hand, does lead to anxiety, especially if the illness is a threat to independence.</p> <p>There may be financial worries, particularly about the cost of care. \u201cYou may not be confident in the ability of your family to steer your life. How much do you trust your kids, for example?\u201d asks Bailey. \u201cThere can be a fear of being seen as a burden, as well as the fear of physical and mental incapacity, and of being left alone, while others may have the stress of contributing to the care of young grandchildren. Loneliness is rife. On top of that, \u201cThe messages that older people get from society are that life is less meaningful than it was.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The signs<br></strong>Somatising \u2013 expressing distress in physical symptoms \u2013 is common. Loss of weight and appetite are often interpreted as the result of an altered lifestyle: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t move around as much, so I don\u2019t need to eat as much.\u201d But they may be caused by stress or anxiety \u2013 a leg pain might be the result of anxiety around walking, for example. </p> <p><strong>What helps<br></strong>The key, Bailey says, is to keep your social network as active as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re social creatures. Keep at it.\u201d Communities are full of opportunities to socialise: seek them out. Even small daily moments of interaction help, such as chatting to postmen or shopkeepers.</p> <p>This is a great time to take up a new hobby or physical activity \u2013 especially one that involves meeting others.</p> <p>Try to focus on what is causing the stress and try to set the worry to one side. \u201cWhat is it that you are thinking about that stops you going to sleep. Why can\u2019t you switch your brain off? Have you always been a worrier, a person who cogitates too much in the dark hours when you should be putting into neutral?\u201d Forsyth asks. Try altering your breathing to slow the heart rate (by breathing out for one second more than you breathe in, for instance). \u201cAnxiety is a pathological state. It can be helped,\u201d Bailey says. If you have or fear early stage dementia, the <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-support/national-dementia-helpline/where-go-legal-advice\" title=\"\">National Dementia Helpline</a> offers free advice. CBT is another option.

      "bodyText": "0-16 years Triggers \u201cChildren are really the canaries in the mineshaft of human society. They are the individuals within our cultures that are the most sensitive to the difficulties \u2013 and stresses \u2013 that societies experience,\u201d Tom Boyce tells me. Professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the University of California, he specialises in the treatment of three- to eight-year-olds. Major stressors in this age group include marital conflict, violence in the home, violence in the community, problems with parental mental health \u2013 a mum or dad who is depressed \u2013 maltreatment and disciplinary behaviours that become punitive. On top of all that, as Dominique Thompson, a former student health GP who treated clients aged 11 and up, points out: \u201cSchool is a source of huge anxiety.\u201d SATS ensure that academic pressure is felt even in primary school. \u201cChildren are naturally very wary of letting people down,\u201d Thompson adds. Friendships, social media, and social situations are additional triggers, while teens especially struggle with identity. \u201cThe whole point of adolescence is to separate from their parents\u201d, she says. \u201cThey are creating their new image, who they want to be, what they want to be known for. That in itself is a stressful process.\u201d The signs \u201cSome kids can say what is bothering them,\u201d says Boyce, whose new book, The Orchid and the Dandelion, explores why some children struggle to survive while others thrive easily. More often, he says, parental detective work is required. There may be nightmares, night-waking, bed-wetting. Children may seek to avoid activities they would normally take pleasure in. Some may display obsessive behaviours, overuse social media, or become withdrawn. What helps For children who want to talk repeatedly about worries, set aside 15 minutes\u2019 daily \u201cworry time\u201d. Establish that worries may be thoroughly discussed in worry time but not outside of it; say, \u201clet\u2019s talk about that in worry time\u201d. Thompson recommends Headspace\u2019s kids app, which she uses with her nine-year-old. \u201cHe has two minutes\u2019 mindfulness before bed,\u201d she says. Deciding when to push a child and when to accede to their refusals is difficult, and can only \u201cbe based on intuition of your own infinite knowledge of your child\u201d, Boyce says. Creativity helps. He mentions one mother of a young child who refused to get ready for school. She stuck fuzzy felt-type pieces for brushing teeth, putting on shoes, eating breakfast etc on a board and let her son choose which order to arrange these events in each day. Boyce\u2019s key recommendations for children are: stick to routines and rituals. Engage in play. Show compassion, communicate that your love is unconditional. Honour the differences between children. All of this takes time but Boyce is fond of telling parents that there is no such thing as \u201cquality time\u201d. Just provide enough time of any kind together. Closeness and frank conversations can emerge out of this swathe of time, at unplanned moments such as during a journey to a football match or while doing another activity. For children who become avoidant, Thompson suggests this approach, influenced by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): \u201cDon\u2019t ridicule. Don\u2019t catastrophise. Say, \u2018What are you worried might happen? ... And what would happen then?... OK, we can deal with that. We\u2019ve got plasters, a first aid kit \u2026\u2019\u201d When stress and anxiety \u201cinterfere with normal life\u201d, she says, that\u2019s the time to see your GP. 16-25 years Triggers \u201cDevelopmental tasks from late teens into early adulthood are about moving away from your family,\u201d says Alex Fowke, a clinical psychologist. With independence comes the fear of rejection and humiliation. Relationships, or lack of them, cause immense stress, not least because these are busy years in terms of shaping identity. Greater fluidity around identity can bring its own challenges. Fowke mentions a former client who was fluid in gender and sexuality. \u201cAs much as they found themselves attracted to everyone, by fitting everywhere, you don\u2019t fit anywhere,\u201d he says. All this at a time when you might find yourself, as a student or in a first job, living away from home with strangers. Financial worries are common, although according to Thompson, who is a member of the Student Minds clinical advisory group, students tend to cite these less often than relationship and academic pressures. At exam time and during university, the atmosphere can foster a tendency towards perfectionism \u2013 the setting of impossible targets, often accompanied by self-beration, prevarication, and impostor syndrome. Social media exerts its own particular pressures and a habit of incessantly comparing with others \u2014 what Fowke describes as \u201ccompare and despair\u201d. In addition, family stressors \u2013 divorcing parents, for instance \u2013 are common. Thompson advises parents robustly to resist the temptation to look to their older children for support. The signs At this age, stress can sometimes disguise itself in strong emotions. Thompson says that lots of young women present with tearfulness, and men with irritability and anger \u2013 punching walls or picking fights. Others may find that they are compulsively seeking reassurance. There can be a non-specific sense of dread in the back of the mind. Some may use alcohol or drugs or smart drugs to manage worries, especially those who are living away from home or in reach of a cheap student bar. \u201cFocusing and attention become difficult,\u201d Fowke adds, \u201cand can result in what might look like a memory problem.\u201d Many will choose to avoid any kind of social scenario. Some will lurk on social media in order to compare themselves with others. What helps If identity or legacy issues are causing stress, Fowke recommends doing some work on your values: ask yourself what you would like people to say about you at your leaving party. Retirement is a very long way off, but according to Fowke, legacy worries commonly present at this age, perhaps because the choices young people are asked to make can feel like committing to an entire career. Thinking about the bigger picture helps to adjust expectations. \u201cSometimes our task as individuals is to reconcile the stuff we do for fun with the stuff that just needs to be done,\u201d he says. For those about to embark on university life, Student Minds has free, downloadable resources. Student unions are a good starting point, while universities offer counselling and courses to tackle perfectionism, exam pressure, prevarication, and other mental health challenges; ask if yours has signed up to a closed trial of Fika, an app designed to foster self-acceptance and coping skills. The website Kooth offers free online counselling, and a place to monitor your emotional wellbeing. \u201cMindfulness-based treatment helps to shift the focus away from catastrophic thought spirals,\u201d Fowke advises. Social anxiety can be confronted with gradual exposure \u2013 go for coffee and listen to the types of conversations other people have, Fowke says. \u201cSometimes [confronting anxiety] needs more formal training,\u201d adds Thompson. In those cases, GPs can offer referrals for CBT. \u201cAnd a few people need medication, which is no problem because it works really well.\u201d 25-35 years Triggers This is a time of huge life transition. \u201cThere is this pressure to make lifelong decisions at a really young age,\u201d Fowke says. Social media permits endless comparisons, with others who have made the same or different decisions. \u201cWhen we do social comparisons,\u201d Fowke adds, \u201cwe typically come off worse.\u201d Many in this age group will focus on how to have the perfect marriage and children while still making an impact at work. They might compare their lives to those of their parents at the same age. There may be a pressure to start a family. \u201cOne of the stressors tends to be: \u2018I should have these things by now. I see my friends settling down. I\u2019m not even dating anyone.\u2019 There\u2019s sometimes an unrealistic expectation that everything is possible,\u201d Fowke says. For women in particular, children impact on career progression, which brings new worries. Those entering employment for the first time face a major adjustment; perfectionists can suffer. \u201cThey find themselves in a situation where they are deskilled or incompetent, and it unsettles their sense of self,\u201d explains Sally Brown, a coach and counsellor who says she sees many young, driven, outwardly successful people aged 18 to 30 who are struggling with debilitating levels of anxiety. The signs \u201cAnxiety will leak out in whichever way that your individual vulnerability will allow it,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI saw somebody recently who became very anxious about whether she had hit someone while driving. That is a form of OCD.\u201d She also cites the compulsive overthinking of social situations. \u201cPost-event analysis: coming home, rerunning conversations, feeling judged.\u201d Some people find they lose the will to do tasks they were previously happy to do, from getting on the underground to speaking in meetings. They might become avoidant, while others exist in a \u201chypervigilant state, where you feel that something awful might happen. This sense of fear lurks around the edges. There can be a constant narrative of \u2018Am I having a breakdown, will I be able to cope, will I have another panic attack?\u2019\u201d Brown adds. Self-criticism is \u201cmassive in this age group. Many clients \u201chave installed an inner bully in their head, that berates them 24/7. We would not tolerate that kind of person in our life following us around saying that to us, but we do it to ourselves.\u201d What helps Brown advocates self-compassion. \u201cIt is not about letting yourself off the hook, it\u2019s about self-acceptance.\u201d To those who self-berate, she suggests an experiment. \u201cFor one week, treat yourself with the same kindness and acceptance that you would treat a good friend whom you love. That in itself can be transformative.\u201d Sometimes it helps to label the self-berating voice. Brown talks about \u201cputting the troll back in the box\u201d. Listen carefully to your anxiety. Panic attacks are often \u201ca sign that the brain needs to have opportunities throughout the day to come down to a state of calm,\u201d Browns says. She recommends \u201ca personal daily prescription for mental wellbeing\u201d. Take five minutes with a cup of tea; resist scrolling through your phone. \u201cCheck in with yourself,\u201d she says. Ask yourself, \u201cHow do I feel, where\u2019s my thinking going?\u201d If your shoulders are up by your ears, let go of tension. Try 7/11 breathing \u2013 breathe in for a count of seven and out for 11: a longer out-breath regulates the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. Brown likes the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise as a way to ground yourself in the present: think of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can smell and one you can taste. Try to resist the urge to check social media first thing in the morning. One early refusal can make a big difference to the day. Know your thinking patterns: catch yourself in the act of catastrophising or being a perfectionist, or inflexible, and name the behaviour to yourself. This helps to take anxiety out of the driving seat. 35-55 years Triggers \u201cThere\u2019s real mental and physical load at this age,\u201d says Louise Tyler, a counsellor based in Altrincham who works with many high-achieving professionals on building resilience. Financial concerns, ageing, a sense of mortality are all factors, along with what Tyler calls \u201can existential search for purpose. People start to become aware that life doesn\u2019t go on for ever.\u201d There are questions such as \u201cHave I put enough money aside? How will I face retirement?\u201d And all the while there\u2019s \u201ca need to feel constantly productive and efficient\u201d, she says. Commonly known as the sandwich generation, many in this age group will care for both teenage children and ageing parents. Relationship breakdown, divorce and loneliness can be further triggers, along with the emergence of health issues. For others, Fowke says, anxiety may be triggered by grief at not having had children. The perimenopause and menopause both cause stress, including both physical and emotional symptoms. For men, there is thought to be a similar life change called the andropause, associated with a gradual drop in testosterone. Men may develop depression, loss of sex drive and other symptoms. As Jonathan Rauch, author of The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better after 50, points out, in this age group \u201cit\u2019s perfectly natural to go through an emotional reboot\u201d. (Consider this a rebranding of the midlife crisis.) The signs Waking at night, often with the mind whirring. \u201cIf you have cortisol racing through the body in the day, it will not switch off at night, Tyler warns. \u201cYour body will ping awake.\u201d Stress hormones can bring palpitations and nausea, a lack of energy and restlessness. Tyler finds some people develop irrational phobias that they\u2019ve not had before \u2013 becoming fearful, for instance, of driving on the motorway. Rauch cites \u201cunaccountable frustration and disappointment\u201d. Anger and arguments with partners can increase. What helps Tyler says that women in the sandwich generation tend to \u201ctake on more of the emotional laundry\u201d and arrive at her door \u201cburnt out\u201d. She encourages these clients to give themselves permission to switch off and suggests including regular \u201cstop points\u201d \u2013 ideally three times a day. What you do in this time doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s the stopping that counts. Meditate, read the paper, put on music during the commute home. It\u2019s important to \u201cmake that switch from seeing downtime as selfish\u201d, she says. Exercise also helps by burning off adrenaline. Tyler thinks it may help to stop thinking of exercise as something you \u201cshould\u201d do, and to see it as \u201ca useful strategy\u201d you choose to deploy. Counselling works for some. Rauch, an author and journalist, found coaching beneficial when he experienced a slump in his forties. For those who are feeling discontented, he points in his book to research that shows that after the age of 50 stress levels begin to drop. It helps, he says, to know \u201cthat what you are going through is normal and healthy, and [is part of] a transition to positivity and contentment\u201d. Change is best made in small, manageable steps. \u201cThe urge to escape is misleading and won\u2019t help in most cases. Normalise. Understand. Reach out to others. Not doing that is the mistake that I made,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial isolation makes it worse. Stay focused in the present. Midlife is a time trap. You are disappointed about your life in the past and pessimistic about it in the future.\u201d But, he says, this is just the start of a period of shifting values. 55-70 years Triggers \u201cDeath, to be blunt,\u201d says Martin Pollecoff, 69, a psychotherapist and chair of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy. Friendship groups at this age may be decimated by ill health and death. As in any time of transition, the strain on relationships is immense. \u201cIt\u2019s quite common that one partner is much better at amusing themselves,\u201d says Celia Dodd, author of Not Fade Away: How to Thrive in Retirement. \u201cIf one partner is retired and one isn\u2019t, the one who isn\u2019t is very likely to say, \u2018What have you been doing all day?\u2019\u201d This can exacerbate the sense of purposelessness. There may be conflict with grownup children, distance from grandchildren. For those who have associated stress with a busy working life, it can be hard to recognise listlessness as a sign of anxiety, while those who are new to retirement might be running on adrenaline, with nowhere to spend it, no sense of purpose. For some, Dodd observes \u201ca kind of competitive retirement\u201d in which there is \u201ca new pressure on people to have a great time.\u201d Regrets can loom large. And underlying all this is deep uncertainty about what lies ahead. The signs Procrastination, along with enlarging health worries. Many people feel reluctant to leave the house. Some feel frustration at not achieving anything in the day, or ruminate on past disappointments. \u201cWine o\u2019clock starts earlier and earlier,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cAnd then just feeling uninterested in life, thinking, What\u2019s the point in anything?\u201d What helps Acceptance. \u201cAccept the things you have done, the things you will never be able to do,\u201d Pollecoff advises. \u201cYou have to face up to the paths you didn\u2019t take,\u201d Dodd adds. \u201cThink about them. Then try to think of the good things that you did instead.\u201d Rauch, 58, is finding this age \u201ca great period for relaunch. Our values change. We put less emphasis on ambition and more on relationships, other people, which is very rewarding.\u201d Finding new routines helps. \u201cWork fills up this big space in our life, and it is a question of finding new things that have value,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cThey are really to do with people. Connecting with other people.\u201d For those who find it hard to get out of the house, Dodd suggests making small changes. Listen to a different radio station. Go to a cafe for breakfast. Walk a different way to a familiar destination. Find a new activity that challenges you. \u201cComfort zone is a horrible phrase,\u201d Dodd says, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to keep stretching and be prepared to be a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Then you get this fantastic sense of achievement.\u201d Volunteering is one way to do this, although the challenge could also be planning a holiday, with a subsidiary goal of learning a language, say, or a physical challenge such as running a 5K. Try your hand at something new. And remember, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be crap at things,\u201d says Pollecoff. \u201cOne of the great things about old age is that you can fail and it\u2019s not going to destroy you.\u201d Use newly available time to prioritise health. \u201cBecome your own doctor,\u201d Pollecoff says. \u201cDiet. Exercise. Put health first.\u201d Finally, Dodd and Pollecoff both agree that \u201cfollowing your curiosity\u201d is key. Over 70 years Triggers Each decade over 70 brings subtly different challenges, but throughout this period you may be facing the loss of a partner, or of friends, and a perceived loss of place in society. For some there is the prospect of a move into a care home, or the fear of it. For those with early stages of dementia with some insight into their condition, there may be the sense that \u201cthe locus of control is moving away from you\u201d, explains Duncan Forsyth, a consultant geriatrician. According to Alex Bailey, a doctor in the old age faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, fear of death is not a big problem. \u201cI\u2019m 40 and I\u2019m terrified of death,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t tend to see that in older people so much. People who have had a long life experience have generally come to terms with that.\u201d Or built resilience against it. Ill health, on the other hand, does lead to anxiety, especially if the illness is a threat to independence. There may be financial worries, particularly about the cost of care. \u201cYou may not be confident in the ability of your family to steer your life. How much do you trust your kids, for example?\u201d asks Bailey. \u201cThere can be a fear of being seen as a burden, as well as the fear of physical and mental incapacity, and of being left alone, while others may have the stress of contributing to the care of young grandchildren. Loneliness is rife. On top of that, \u201cThe messages that older people get from society are that life is less meaningful than it was.\u201d The signs Somatising \u2013 expressing distress in physical symptoms \u2013 is common. Loss of weight and appetite are often interpreted as the result of an altered lifestyle: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t move around as much, so I don\u2019t need to eat as much.\u201d But they may be caused by stress or anxiety \u2013 a leg pain might be the result of anxiety around walking, for example. What helps The key, Bailey says, is to keep your social network as active as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re social creatures. Keep at it.\u201d Communities are full of opportunities to socialise: seek them out. Even small daily moments of interaction help, such as chatting to postmen or shopkeepers. This is a great time to take up a new hobby or physical activity \u2013 especially one that involves meeting others. Try to focus on what is causing the stress and try to set the worry to one side. \u201cWhat is it that you are thinking about that stops you going to sleep. Why can\u2019t you switch your brain off? Have you always been a worrier, a person who cogitates too much in the dark hours when you should be putting into neutral?\u201d Forsyth asks. Try altering your breathing to slow the heart rate (by breathing out for one second more than you breathe in, for instance). \u201cAnxiety is a pathological state. It can be helped,\u201d Bailey says. If you have or fear early stage dementia, the National Dementia Helpline offers free advice. CBT is another option. More sessions may be needed in this age group, Bailey says. And while friends and family members may judge your decisions, it is not for them to change or make them: \u201cIf you want to make a crazy decision, that\u2019s your right,\u201d Bailey advises. This applies to relatives who may be trying to influence your care provision to your choice of holiday. Psychotherapy can also be beneficial in this age group. Ask your GP if the NHS\u2019s Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) scheme is available to older people in your area.",

      "bodyText": "I have crossed borders with nothing but a rucksack on my back. Arrived in countries with a holdall and that\u2019s it. Last year, at midnight, I booked a plane ticket for 7am that morning from London to Glasgow, packed a bag barely heavier than the quotidian, and off I went. I have gone to Morocco and Egypt in similar circumstances. Travelling is wonderful, but the downsides \u2013 with air travel in particular \u2013 are easy to acknowledge: the dragging of heavy suitcases (often with a wonky wheel or broken handle); the queueing; the waiting around for luggage \u2013 and the potential for it to be lost; the paying extra for, seemingly, everything. The poor sods rifling through their carefully folded underwear to find something of sufficient weight to remove, rather than pay an extortionate \u00a340 surplus baggage fee. Smugness is not a quality to cultivate, but I can\u2019t tell you that it isn\u2019t immensely satisfying not to have to worry about all of the above when travelling light. It isn\u2019t always possible, of course \u2013 work trips, longer holidays \u2013 but when it is, it\u2019s perhaps the closest thing to feeling free. It\u2019s a twist on that hole-in-a-sack riddle: what can you pack that will make your bag light? Nothing. My favourite lyrical paean to the practice is Jeffrey Lewis and Diane Cluck\u2019s on their appropriately titled Travel Light: \u201cWhen I was an astronaut I didn\u2019t take my boots / When I was a record store I didn\u2019t have the blues / I travel light and that\u2019s the life for me.\u201d I have travelled in the opposite situation, too. When I moved back to the UK after living in another country, a huge Klimt print I had bought in Moscow six months earlier had its own plane seat. (I didn\u2019t buy it its own seat, but the stewards were keen on protecting it.) It hangs in my flat to this day, but it was incredibly stressful, moving with everything I owned. I often travel alone. It is good for the soul, and all I need then is: my passport; a good book or three (paperback, obviously); a playlist relevant to where one is going (surely I cannot be the only nerd who does this?); a language app (if relevant); a rolling countryside view from a train window, or a pointillist expanse from a plane window; and possibly, depending on mood, an incredibly interesting seat partner from whom one learns new things. Because how many pairs of jeans are you really going to wear? Why take weighty bottles of shampoo when every hotel, Airbnb, or couchsurfing host will have some? Not having much on the back means one\u2019s plans can always change on a whim, too. And, in my opinion, plans are made for changing.",

      "body": "<p>In an east London photographer\u2019s studio, one man is dancing and two men are not. Beres Hammond is playing over the speakers and the dancer \u2013 Lynval Golding, guitarist \u2013 freeze-frames for the camera shutter, but otherwise is in constant motion. Bassist Horace Panter, determinedly non-dancey, stands dead still, chin jutting, as though he\u2019s ready to punch you if you get too cheeky. And in between them is singer Terry Hall, who doesn\u2019t move much. Hall\u2019s face, though, is always changing, flicking between exasperation, resignation, wry amusement and a withering teenage side-eye. His left hand sticks out. It looks as though there\u2019s a gap for a cigarette in between your fingers, I say, and Hall says \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, and goes outside to smoke.</p> <p>These three men are the Specials, 2019. The Specials started in Coventry in the late 1970s, a mixed-race ensemble playing a thrilling mixture of ska, reggae and punk, with pointed, politically sharp lyrics. Originally, there were seven members \u2013 the three here today, plus band founder/songwriter/keyboardist Jerry Dammers (creator of the 2 Tone record label, to which the Specials were signed), as well as singer Neville Staple, guitarist Roddy Radiation and drummer John \u201cBrad\u201d Bradbury. Much of the Specials\u2019 impact back then was collective: a group of street-tough individuals, the band as gang. Their gigs were raucous, confrontational affairs, occasionally marred by far-right elements wanting to cause trouble with a group that had both black and white members.</p> <p>In 1981, after their scorching single Ghost Town went to No 1, Hall, Golding and Staple left to form the Fun Boy Three. The remaining Specials added more members and continued as the Special AKA, before splitting in 1984 (though Dammers was held in a record company contract until 1987). Since then, there have been various Specials reincarnations. People have been in and out (30 members since 1979: Wikipedia has resorted to a graph). Panter was an art teacher for special needs children for a while, Golding moved to Seattle. He and Hall didn\u2019t speak for more than a decade. Neither Dammers nor Hall rejoined for years. Hall was focused on his solo career. Dammers \u2013 who started the group and owned their name \u2013 tried to restart the Specials in the late 00s on the condition that they play new material. They got as far as two rehearsals before everyone fell out again.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8WNk8tDsg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hs8WNk8tDsg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8WNk8tDsg\">Watch the video for Vote for Me by the Specials.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The most common question from the <em>Observer</em> readers concerns whether Dammers will ever rejoin: when I ask it today, Hall, Golding and Panter give answers that are noticeably varied. Is the door open for him or not? Dammers himself, when I speak to him later, says that he was served with a legal letter and forced out of the band.</p> <p>\u201cThere was never a long-term plan,\u201d says Panter. \u201cBut once we got ourselves established, the obvious thing to do would be to make a new album. It was just getting the right consensus between the individuals.\u201d</p> <p>As you can imagine, embroiled as they were in legal battles, this consensus took time. From 2009 on, the Specials, sans Dammers, toured, and then toured, and then toured again. According to Panter, it wasn\u2019t until 2012-13 that there was a settled membership: but then, in 2013, Staple left, due to ill health, followed by Radiation in 2014. This left Hall, Golding and Panter, plus Brad, the drummer. But then Brad died, in 2015, and, once more, things were put on hold. Until last year. \u201cWe were in California playing with Neil Young and the Pretenders,\u201d says Hall, \u201cand I remember thinking: \u2018Well, they\u2019re writing new stuff, why don\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Now, much-loved reggae and jazz drummer Kenrick Rowe has joined them to play live; Steve Cradock (Ocean Colour Scene, Paul Weller) is on guitar; Nikolaj Torp Larson plays keyboards and, along with Hall, Golding and Panter, wrote and produced the new album, <em>Encore</em>. And it\u2019s the release of new material that changes everything. \u201cAll this,\u201d says Panter, gesturing around the studio. He means photoshoots and interviews. \u201cYou forget, that\u2019s what albums do.\u201d</p> <p><em>Encore</em> is strong, musically, with an unexpectedly broader palette that takes in disco, funk and oompah as well as reggae. For original fans, there are callbacks. The lead single, Vote for Me, opens up with ascending Ghost Town-style chords, and there\u2019s three covers: of the Equals\u2019 1970 track, Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys, of Blam Blam Fever (Gunfever) by the Valentines (1967) and of the Fun Boy Three\u2019s The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum. Prince Buster, a huge influence on the band (Gangsters, their first single, was a reworking of Buster\u2019s Al Capone), is referenced in 10 Commandments, featuring the words and vocals of activist Saffiyah Khan. It\u2019s a clap-back to Buster\u2019s 1966 track that, for the benefit of any Buster-fancying woman, listed his 10 jokily chauvinistic lady friend requirements. (Prince Buster also made Princess Buster\u2019s original 1967 answer track.)</p> <p>Lyrics take on the personal and the political, the US and the UK, though more ambiguously than the Specials\u2019 original precision attacks. On BLM (Black Lives Matter), Golding talks us through three racist experiences from his past. And then there\u2019s Vote for Me. Golding points out that the Specials\u2019 (as opposed to the Special AKA) last release was Ghost Town, so it seems right that the next release, 38 years later, is Vote for Me. Hall agrees: \u201cWith Ghost Town we didn\u2019t say, \u2018This is the right way, this is the wrong way\u2019, we just said, \u2018Things are pretty shit, really\u2019. And we\u2019re saying the same with Vote for Me. I find it difficult to vote on anything, really. Whereas before, we were staunch Labour. Now, I feel like I don\u2019t trust you, I don\u2019t like your face. On a personal thing with Corbyn, I definitely can\u2019t do it any more. But what are the alternatives?\u201d</p> <p>It must be strange to make a comeback now, to return in your middle age at a time when Britain itself appears to be determined to return to the more depressing parts of the early 80s.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Hall, \u201cif we\u2019d released a record at any point in the last eight years it would have been relevant. Because not a great deal has changed. There\u2019s different names for it, like Brexit, which sounds nuanced, but isn\u2019t far from the one called \u2018unemployment\u2019 and the one called \u2018racism\u2019. Look, we didn\u2019t plan it. We didn\u2019t say: \u2018Let\u2019s get a mix done quick, because Brexit\u2019s out at the end of January.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There are non-political songs on the album. The penultimate track, The Life and Times, addresses Hall\u2019s depression. Though his unsmiling demeanour has always been part of Hall\u2019s appeal \u2013 \u201cGod, people saying, \u2018Cheer up\u2019 and \u2018Why don\u2019t you smile?\u2019\u2026 I get fed up with saying, \u2018Fuck off\u2019\u201d \u2013 a resting bitch face is far removed from the actual terror of depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c1da9d25f1d88f3ae2eadead1487ddd4ff531c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c1da9d25f1d88f3ae2eadead1487ddd4ff531c0/0_72_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Specials on stage, June 1980 (l-r): Lynval Golding, Neville Staple, Roddy Radiation, Terry Hall, Jerry Dammers, John Bradbury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Specials on stage, June 1980 (l-r): Lynval Golding, Neville Staple, Roddy Radiation, Terry Hall, Jerry Dammers, John Bradbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Stevenson / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWith every record I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve made reference to it,\u201d says Hall, \u201cbut this is out-and-out. I was diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia about 11 years ago and that diagnosis made a big difference, because then I started taking medication. And the change in me, to be able to function\u2026 I couldn\u2019t have done this 12 years ago. People used to say to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you try yoga? Or St John\u2019s wort?\u2019 But there\u2019s a massive difference when you\u2019re in a deep depression and feeling shitty with the world, and the stage that I got to, where you want to give yourself a lobotomy, it\u2019s that bad.\u201d</p> <p>Medication \u2013 \u201clithium, hardcore drugs\u201d \u2013 has really helped. Hall knows that his episodes are cyclical and he can feel when a depression is coming on. \u201cAnd before, I used to have to give in to it and people would say, \u2018You\u2019ve been in bed for three weeks\u2019, and I thought it was 10 minutes. But now I can feel it coming and I can also feel the medication, it blocking it. It\u2019s brilliant. Recognising you\u2019re blocking it is amazing. It\u2019s really weird. It\u2019s like looking at a bruise develop on your leg.\u201d</p> <p>The album\u2019s final track, We Sell Hope, is uplifting musically and lyrically, a contrast to all the excoriation that comes before.</p> <p>\u201cWell, in the end,\u201d says Hall, \u201cif you\u2019re talking about each other, all you can offer is love. To respect people, and be kind to people, and hope that they give it back. They sometimes don\u2019t but they sometimes do. But there\u2019s that sense of hope. What else have we got?\u201d</p> <p>The photo session is done. The dancing and non-dancing are over. Hall has another cigarette and then we gather around a table to answer questions from <em>Observer</em> readers and famous admirers. There are more than usual. \u201cHmm,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI bet you say that every time.\u201d (There are; I don\u2019t.) \u201cFire away\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Encore by the Specials is out now on UMC</em></p> <h2>Questions from famous fans</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"626a9ed72d241742b1db2a14fd6d2d637ea71363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/626a9ed72d241742b1db2a14fd6d2d637ea71363/876_674_1680_2100/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gurinder Chadha\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Gurinder Chadha</h2> <p><strong>Film director</strong></p> <p><strong>What moment from your height of fame</strong><strong> are you most proud of, the moment that provides the legacy of the Specials in years to come?</strong><br><strong>Horace:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ2oXzrnti4\" title=\"\">Ghost Town</a> getting to No 1.<br><strong>Terry: </strong>Yes, I\u2019d go with that.

I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. We had so much fun doing this record. We\u2019d take it in turns to sleep on the couch.

Even through all the shitty times, five minutes before kick-off you think: \u201cThis is great.\u201d But in the last week or two do you know what\u2019s made me happiest? In our bathroom, on the floor there\u2019s mosaic tiles and one was lost. It\u2019s white so I tried putting Polyfilla in, but I couldn\u2019t get the grouting to look good. Then I thought: \u201cWell, why don\u2019t I look in the vac bag?\u201d So I got the bag out and put my hand in and I found the tile. Honestly, that made me really happy.

We\u2019d just signed our record deal with Chrysalis, we were unknown, and we still had all this equipment that we\u2019d begged, borrowed and stolen. We were on a bill with the Cure, the Pretenders, the Police and AC/DC. Nobody had heard of us, and we went on stage and just destroyed the place. There was a big fence, 12 foot in front of the stage and during the performance it got ripped down and everyone surged to the front of the stage. For me, that was the most amazing experience ever, that music could do that was incredible.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> Because of bands like UB40 and the Beat too, we were doing something that wasn\u2019t in London. It was a sense of pride in where we were and wanted to make some sort of change. Lyrically, I think what we were doing was all very similar. We were all in the Midlands, and the only band I remembered from the Midlands was Jigsaw, who blew it all sky high [chuckles].<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> Lieutenant Pigeon.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> Frank Ifield.

People see success as getting to No 1 and being platinum. I don\u2019t see that at all, I never have. I think the success is getting something inside, out, and getting someone to listen to it. That is success. For the first 20 years of my life, nobody would listen to me. Nobody. At school, jobcentres, they just didn\u2019t listen, they were never bothered.

There\u2019s a version of it on the deluxe edition of the album and it\u2019s fantastic, I love it.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I quite like stuff from the second album. International Jet Set and Stereotype. Just because I\u2019ve always had this thing about people seeing us as a ska band.

Because it felt so alien to the people on the show, the ones working there and the audience, and that was the first time I thought: \u201cSomething good\u2019s happening here.\u201d We took off the shackles when we did it, people were just roaming on and off stage. And it felt really like the right song at the right time. I remember doing photo sessions and people thinking we were like, a gay choir, because we all had short hair. Either ex-marines or a gay choir.<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> Remember when we did it in Chicago? When they got the audience to throw these fake dollar bills on the stage? Because\u2026 gangster, yes?<br><strong>Terry:</strong> Al Capone.</p> <p><strong>Miranda Sawyer: But can you think of a song that isn\u2019t yours </strong><strong>where you thought</strong><strong>: this changes everything?</strong><br><strong>Horace:</strong> I was delivering car spares to a store in Birmingham. This was about 1990. And this song came on the radio, and I was standing there with this box, and this bloke was going, \u201cCome on, give me the box,\u201d and I go, \u201cShh.\u201d And it was Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. It was the first time I heard it, and I thought, \u201cFlippin\u2019 heck. That\u2019s good.\u201d<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> \u201cGet up, stand up. Stand up for your rights\u201d by Bob Marley, because it was around the time when we started having our own identity. We started getting away from the colonial ways that were forced on to us. And that\u2019s when the Rasta theme started coming up, something we can call our own, you know? That really hit me.<br><strong>Miranda: </strong>How about you, Terry? Is there a song you can think of that changed things for you?<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I will come back to Shaddap You Face again\u2026 No, Anarchy in the UK. It was like everybody was waiting for something like that. It was a turning point.</p> <p><strong>If someone had told me 40 years ago that a bloke like [pro-Brexit \u2018yellow vest\u2019 protester] James Goddard and his mates would be close to the profile they have today, I would\u2019ve found it hard to believe. You played a leadership role then. What do you think needs to happen now? How do we reverse the division that people like Goddard </strong><strong>look</strong><strong> to exploit?</strong><br><strong>Steve E, Vancouver</strong><br><strong>Lynval:</strong> Back when we started, it was a small minority of skinheads that was pulling the wrong way. I remember one guy I met, a real National Front supporter, you know? And after I finished talking to him, we shook hands and we looked at each other, and he said he hadn\u2019t talked to a black guy before. He wouldn\u2019t do it. But once we talked and had a discussion\u2026<br><strong>Horace: </strong>Those people always were out there. They feel more of a licence to speak now, because we all have our platform, don\u2019t we? This division is a knock-on effect of Instagram and Twitter and whatever. Everyone has a voice now. But there\u2019s no filter on it. Back in our day, you would voice your discontent down the pub to your mates. Whereas now you can voice your discontent to millions of people from the privacy of your own downstairs toilet.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I think politicians love the division. It\u2019s a great thing for them. They thrive on it. I don\u2019t think they want everyone to be together. Brexit has conjured up so much stuff, and all these personalities are appearing, like Jacob Rees-Mogg. They like the division and I can see it getting a lot worse.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel mellowed with age or do you still get intensely wound up by current political events?</strong><br><strong>Stephen Bennett, Dublin</strong><br><strong>Lynval:</strong> I switch on CNN and wonder: \u201cWhat am I watching all this for?\u201d People calling the police because a little kid is selling water, just because the kid is black [#PermitPatty]\u2026 The one thing which I think is good with social media is, when we say: \u201cYou\u2019ll never understand what it\u2019s like to be black.\u201d I think the images that come in now, but you see it and maybe understand more. You know, you walk in a shop and you know that all eyes are on you. Because you appear like a guy who\u2019s going to come in and shoplift. Because you\u2019re black\u2026 No, I\u2019m not mellowed with age.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> I think age has filtered a few things. The only thing I watch on television is the news, really.<br>Terry: I\u2019ve definitely mellowed. But I\u2019m at that age. I\u2019m going to be 60 in a month, and there\u2019s loads of shit going on, but then I look up at night and see the moon, and I just think: \u201cWhoa.\u201d Do you know what I mean? You see a tree that\u2019s been there a few hundred years, and you think: \u201cFucking hell. This is brilliant.\u201d<br><strong>Miranda:</strong> Is that age?<br><strong>Terry:</strong> No, it\u2019s medication. When you have kids of your own and with their mates, that\u2019s where you can be political, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tended to do, especially with my older boys when they were teenagers. Watching them go through stuff, and hopefully guiding them. My house used to be a real open house, like a youth club. Their mates always used to come round because I was like a bit \u201cright on\u201d, and they could smoke weed or whatever. And that\u2019s where you try and influence so that there\u2019s not so much anger. It\u2019s not being mellow, you\u2019re doing something, but you\u2019re doing it at home, you know? Rather than just blasting it out all the time.<br><strong>Horace: </strong>Micro as opposed to macro.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntvEDbagAw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cntvEDbagAw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cntvEDbagAw\">Watch the Specials\u2019 video for A Message to You Rudy from 1979.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>What are your thoughts on Coventry becoming a UK city of culture in 2021? Have you been approached to do something?</strong><br><strong>Liam Nagle, Coventry</strong><br><strong>Horace:</strong> I\u2019m the only participating member of the Specials who still lives in Coventry and no, I haven\u2019t been approached to do something. I would like to see money put by to provide for music lessons for children in schools, a proper legacy. I\u2019m more interested in that than \u201cHere\u2019s a couple of boutique hotels\u201d, and who needs another wine bar for goodness sake?<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I get really bugged by this City of Culture thing. If you have to really search for the culture, you\u2019re making it up. The landmark for me in Coventry is the cathedral.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m a Cov kid, who grew up as all the industry </strong><strong>collapsed around us in the 80s and 90s, losing perhaps 100,000 jobs in that time from Jaguar, Triumph, Dunlop, Rover, Rolls-Royce, Morris, Alvis, Massey Ferguson. I wonder how you see the city today with so many of those jobs replaced by call centres? People who had repetitive production line jobs at least had the pride of being part of making something that was known, in some cases, worldwide. Now they just get shouted at by irate customers on the phone.</strong><br><strong>FlightGuileAndPies, online</strong><br><strong>Lynval:</strong> You used to have Courtaulds. They were everywhere. Massey Ferguson that does the tractors. And in Canley, Matrix Churchill, one of the last pieces of work they were doing was [making parts for arms] for the Iraq war. Obviously that war game didn\u2019t work out for them, because war brings employment for them! It\u2019s all gone now. Even the smell of the city is not there any more. You could smell the engineering. Back then, Coventry was thriving, an industrial city. Now it\u2019s a student city.<br><strong>Horace: </strong>Loads of barbers.<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> And chicken shop takeaways. It\u2019s all revolving around students. Working class, labour people \u2013 once the industry goes away, then all the traditional pubs, they die. The working men\u2019s clubs, they die. Like what my father used to go to, Rowley\u2019s Green Working Men\u2019s Club. They\u2019re not there any more.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> There\u2019s still manufacturing in Coventry.<br><strong>Lynval: </strong>You\u2019ve got Triumph motorbikes.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> London taxis are made in Coventry.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> All my family worked in factories. My mum worked for Chrysler, my dad worked for Rolls- Royce. Aunt. Everybody worked in the car factories, and there was a real sense of community. Everybody felt on an equal level, all getting cash every week. I didn\u2019t really notice the decline, really, until it had happened, but then it was massive. It\u2019s difficult with Coventry because I moved away for specific reasons. I couldn\u2019t fucking stand it.</p> <p><strong>What was it like touring with the Clash?</strong><br><strong>Peter Milne, Norwich</strong><br><strong>Lynval:</strong> It was absolutely an eye-opener. Joe Strummer was a wonderful, wonderful human being, and being in that group of people at that time, there was so much excitement. Because we did our little pub thing, but this was like the next level up. It was just a wonderful vibe. Like one big party.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> We learned how to present a show while on tour with the Clash. You would see how they go on stage and it was just like, Bang. We learned to give 100%. Not just shamble on stage and \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019d like to play a few songs.\u201d We were totally different after that tour. I always say that we started that tour as civilians but ended it as a group.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> And after the Clash thing, that\u2019s when we cut our hair, because we discovered what we should look like by doing that tour. And then you end up in Crawley with about 1,000 skinheads gobbing at you.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> That was scary.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> Yes, that was really scary. But it was great because Suicide were on that tour as well. And Sham did stuff. [Jimmy] Pursey was there. For me, it was like, \u201cHow do you react to an audience?\u201d The fans tell you the songs they like. They like Monkey Man, definitely. And A Message to You, around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa0c7ea13697c699eb47cb268a9a3e59d2e2a15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa0c7ea13697c699eb47cb268a9a3e59d2e2a15/0_0_2508_1851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saffiyah Khan, in a Specials T-shirt, staring down English Defence League protester Ian Crossland in Birmingham, April 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saffiyah Khan, in a Specials T-shirt, staring down English Defence League protester Ian Crossland in Birmingham, April 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I heard activist </strong><strong>Saffiyah Khan </strong><strong>has sung on the album</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>How did this come about?</strong><br><strong>Barry Mingard, Welwyn Garden City</strong><br><strong>Terry:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/09/birmingham-woman-standing-in-defiance-of-edl-protester-goes-viral\" title=\"\">We saw Saffiyah in that photo</a>. She had a Specials T-shirt on, and she was standing up to a member of the EDL, who was screaming at her, and she just smiled back. A fantastic reaction, because it made him look stupid. So we got in touch with her and said: \u201cCome to our gig in Birmingham.\u201d Then when it came to recording the album, we were thinking about people who might like to be on it, and she was definitely in my head as somebody who could have something to say. And at the same time I was listening to Prince Buster, Ten Commandments of Man, and I couldn\u2019t believe...<br><strong>Miranda:</strong> How rampantly sexist it is?<br><strong>Terry:</strong> It goes back to Dave Lee Travis, like hand-on-the-arse times. So then the idea came like: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to do an answer to that?\u201d But obviously from a woman. Saffiyah was the obvious choice, and we just said to her: \u201cHere\u2019s the Prince Buster song. Do you want to try to reply to it?\u201d And she got on with it.</p> <p><strong>Bloody hell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen such effortlessly cool looking gentlemen ever. Please give me a clothing tip.</strong><br><strong>Tenement Funster, online</strong><br><strong>Horace: </strong>Smart casual. And wear your T-shirt outside your jeans.<br><strong>Lynval: </strong>Horace is stepping up now, he\u2019s the man. Me, I love that sort of stuff from the 70s, like reggae style, you know? Gregory Isaacs.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> It\u2019s simple. Avoid horizontal stripes. Didn\u2019t work when you were 18 mate, and now you\u2019re middle aged.</p> <p><strong>Terry, as a lifelong Man United fan, what do you think </strong><strong>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r</strong><strong> has to do to get the manager\u2019s job full time?</strong><br><strong>Thehumblegent, online</strong><br><strong>Terry:</strong> No idea what he has to do. I mean, he just wins at the moment. He\u2019s such a lovable bloke and a real legend, but whether he\u2019ll keep the job, who knows?<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> He\u2019s a real Man U guy, he spent half his life there, it\u2019s in his blood, and it\u2019s got to be in your blood to be able to manage a club like that. I think they should hold on to him, and give him the job full time. It could be another Fergie in the making.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I think realistically, for me, Ferguson is managing the club again. He\u2019s using Solskj\u00e6r as his mouthpiece. Ferguson is smiling way too much.<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> It\u2019s brilliant. The next legend manager.</p> <p><strong>Now you\u2019re doing new material like Jerry wanted to do when you reformed, isn\u2019t it time to let him back into the fold?</strong><br><strong>Bloodydoorsoff, online</strong><br><strong>Horace: </strong>(Quietly but decisively) No. Next question.<br><strong>Lynval: </strong>I think having Nikolaj Torp Larsen, we\u2019re really fortunate to have a kid like that who\u2019s so talented. I was one of the last ones to work with Jerry, I enjoyed working with him. If you\u2019re going to make music, you want to make music with people that you respect as musicians. I do respect him a lot.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> The whole Jerry thing, it\u2019s like, from day one, I\u2019m not sure why he isn\u2019t in the band. I honestly don\u2019t know, because we all started rehearsing together [for the 2009 reunion] and he sort of dropped out. I don\u2019t know what happened there. I don\u2019t know why he isn\u2019t in the band, do you know what I mean? He just, dropped out. It\u2019s his stuff really, it\u2019s not our stuff. He chose not to be in the band, for whatever reasons.<br><strong>Miranda:</strong> What about if he said: \u201cOh, can I come back?\u201d<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I\u2019d just tell him to fuck off. [laughter] No, I wouldn\u2019t. No, I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d get management to tell him. He can come back, it\u2019s up to him what he\u2019s going to do.</p> <p><strong>Why aren\u2019t Neville, Roddy and Jerry back in the band?</strong><br><strong>Diesel Estate, online</strong><br><strong>Horace:</strong> They left.<br><strong>Lynval:</strong> They left. It\u2019s as simple as that. Roddy left the band, Neville left the band. Jerry didn\u2019t fully join the band back. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> Roddy and Neville feel comfortable where they\u2019re at. They play pubs and small clubs, and I think if you lack that much charisma then that\u2019s probably a wise thing. They enjoy small intimate venues with very few people there. That\u2019s where they feel most comfortable.</p> <p><strong>For Terry and Horace. What does painting do for you that making music doesn\u2019t?</strong><br><strong>Sam McNichols, London</strong><br><strong>Terry:</strong> When I was at my ill-est, it triggered something in my brain that wouldn\u2019t allow me to talk or walk for three weeks. Because I couldn\u2019t say anything, I had to write everything down. And a doctor said to me: \u201cPaint.\u201d And actually painting was something that was coming out of my head that I could show to people. For them, in Horace\u2019s case, to despise. [laughter from all]<br><strong>Miranda:</strong> It\u2019s a reaction.<br><strong>Terry:</strong> I\u2019ve got a fixation on the Jackson 5, so I painted the Jackson 5 for six months, and then it was pointed out to me that I\u2019d painted six. Six Jacksons, so I renamed the extra one Phil Jackson. It\u2019s all getting it out, and who cares whether it\u2019s right or wrong, I don\u2019t give a shit.<br><strong>Horace:</strong> Music for me is a collaborative process, I\u2019m a bass player. I have to work with a drummer, a singer, a keyboard player, I\u2019m a cog in a machine. The art is kind of my solo album. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In an east London photographer\u2019s studio, one man is dancing and two men are not. Beres Hammond is playing over the speakers and the dancer \u2013 Lynval Golding, guitarist \u2013 freeze-frames for the camera shutter, but otherwise is in constant motion. Bassist Horace Panter, determinedly non-dancey, stands dead still, chin jutting, as though he\u2019s ready to punch you if you get too cheeky. And in between them is singer Terry Hall, who doesn\u2019t move much. Hall\u2019s face, though, is always changing, flicking between exasperation, resignation, wry amusement and a withering teenage side-eye. His left hand sticks out. It looks as though there\u2019s a gap for a cigarette in between your fingers, I say, and Hall says \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, and goes outside to smoke. These three men are the Specials, 2019. The Specials started in Coventry in the late 1970s, a mixed-race ensemble playing a thrilling mixture of ska, reggae and punk, with pointed, politically sharp lyrics. Originally, there were seven members \u2013 the three here today, plus band founder/songwriter/keyboardist Jerry Dammers (creator of the 2 Tone record label, to which the Specials were signed), as well as singer Neville Staple, guitarist Roddy Radiation and drummer John \u201cBrad\u201d Bradbury. Much of the Specials\u2019 impact back then was collective: a group of street-tough individuals, the band as gang. Their gigs were raucous, confrontational affairs, occasionally marred by far-right elements wanting to cause trouble with a group that had both black and white members. In 1981, after their scorching single Ghost Town went to No 1, Hall, Golding and Staple left to form the Fun Boy Three. The remaining Specials added more members and continued as the Special AKA, before splitting in 1984 (though Dammers was held in a record company contract until 1987). Since then, there have been various Specials reincarnations. People have been in and out (30 members since 1979: Wikipedia has resorted to a graph). Panter was an art teacher for special needs children for a while, Golding moved to Seattle. He and Hall didn\u2019t speak for more than a decade. Neither Dammers nor Hall rejoined for years. Hall was focused on his solo career. Dammers \u2013 who started the group and owned their name \u2013 tried to restart the Specials in the late 00s on the condition that they play new material. They got as far as two rehearsals before everyone fell out again. The most common question from the Observer readers concerns whether Dammers will ever rejoin: when I ask it today, Hall, Golding and Panter give answers that are noticeably varied. Is the door open for him or not? Dammers himself, when I speak to him later, says that he was served with a legal letter and forced out of the band. \u201cThere was never a long-term plan,\u201d says Panter. \u201cBut once we got ourselves established, the obvious thing to do would be to make a new album. It was just getting the right consensus between the individuals.\u201d As you can imagine, embroiled as they were in legal battles, this consensus took time. From 2009 on, the Specials, sans Dammers, toured, and then toured, and then toured again. According to Panter, it wasn\u2019t until 2012-13 that there was a settled membership: but then, in 2013, Staple left, due to ill health, followed by Radiation in 2014. This left Hall, Golding and Panter, plus Brad, the drummer. But then Brad died, in 2015, and, once more, things were put on hold. Until last year. \u201cWe were in California playing with Neil Young and the Pretenders,\u201d says Hall, \u201cand I remember thinking: \u2018Well, they\u2019re writing new stuff, why don\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d Now, much-loved reggae and jazz drummer Kenrick Rowe has joined them to play live; Steve Cradock (Ocean Colour Scene, Paul Weller) is on guitar; Nikolaj Torp Larson plays keyboards and, along with Hall, Golding and Panter, wrote and produced the new album, Encore. And it\u2019s the release of new material that changes everything. \u201cAll this,\u201d says Panter, gesturing around the studio. He means photoshoots and interviews. \u201cYou forget, that\u2019s what albums do.\u201d Encore is strong, musically, with an unexpectedly broader palette that takes in disco, funk and oompah as well as reggae. For original fans, there are callbacks. The lead single, Vote for Me, opens up with ascending Ghost Town-style chords, and there\u2019s three covers: of the Equals\u2019 1970 track, Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys, of Blam Blam Fever (Gunfever) by the Valentines (1967) and of the Fun Boy Three\u2019s The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum. Prince Buster, a huge influence on the band (Gangsters, their first single, was a reworking of Buster\u2019s Al Capone), is referenced in 10 Commandments, featuring the words and vocals of activist Saffiyah Khan. It\u2019s a clap-back to Buster\u2019s 1966 track that, for the benefit of any Buster-fancying woman, listed his 10 jokily chauvinistic lady friend requirements. (Prince Buster also made Princess Buster\u2019s original 1967 answer track.) Lyrics take on the personal and the political, the US and the UK, though more ambiguously than the Specials\u2019 original precision attacks. On BLM (Black Lives Matter), Golding talks us through three racist experiences from his past. And then there\u2019s Vote for Me. Golding points out that the Specials\u2019 (as opposed to the Special AKA) last release was Ghost Town, so it seems right that the next release, 38 years later, is Vote for Me. Hall agrees: \u201cWith Ghost Town we didn\u2019t say, \u2018This is the right way, this is the wrong way\u2019, we just said, \u2018Things are pretty shit, really\u2019. And we\u2019re saying the same with Vote for Me. I find it difficult to vote on anything, really. Whereas before, we were staunch Labour. Now, I feel like I don\u2019t trust you, I don\u2019t like your face. On a personal thing with Corbyn, I definitely can\u2019t do it any more. But what are the alternatives?\u201d It must be strange to make a comeback now, to return in your middle age at a time when Britain itself appears to be determined to return to the more depressing parts of the early 80s. \u201cWell,\u201d says Hall, \u201cif we\u2019d released a record at any point in the last eight years it would have been relevant. Because not a great deal has changed. There\u2019s different names for it, like Brexit, which sounds nuanced, but isn\u2019t far from the one called \u2018unemployment\u2019 and the one called \u2018racism\u2019. Look, we didn\u2019t plan it. We didn\u2019t say: \u2018Let\u2019s get a mix done quick, because Brexit\u2019s out at the end of January.\u2019\u201d There are non-political songs on the album. The penultimate track, The Life and Times, addresses Hall\u2019s depression. Though his unsmiling demeanour has always been part of Hall\u2019s appeal \u2013 \u201cGod, people saying, \u2018Cheer up\u2019 and \u2018Why don\u2019t you smile?\u2019\u2026 I get fed up with saying, \u2018Fuck off\u2019\u201d \u2013 a resting bitch face is far removed from the actual terror of depression. \u201cWith every record I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve made reference to it,\u201d says Hall, \u201cbut this is out-and-out. I was diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia about 11 years ago and that diagnosis made a big difference, because then I started taking medication. And the change in me, to be able to function\u2026 I couldn\u2019t have done this 12 years ago. People used to say to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you try yoga? Or St John\u2019s wort?\u2019 But there\u2019s a massive difference when you\u2019re in a deep depression and feeling shitty with the world, and the stage that I got to, where you want to give yourself a lobotomy, it\u2019s that bad.\u201d Medication \u2013 \u201clithium, hardcore drugs\u201d \u2013 has really helped. Hall knows that his episodes are cyclical and he can feel when a depression is coming on. \u201cAnd before, I used to have to give in to it and people would say, \u2018You\u2019ve been in bed for three weeks\u2019, and I thought it was 10 minutes. But now I can feel it coming and I can also feel the medication, it blocking it. It\u2019s brilliant. Recognising you\u2019re blocking it is amazing. It\u2019s really weird. It\u2019s like looking at a bruise develop on your leg.\u201d The album\u2019s final track, We Sell Hope, is uplifting musically and lyrically, a contrast to all the excoriation that comes before. \u201cWell, in the end,\u201d says Hall, \u201cif you\u2019re talking about each other, all you can offer is love. To respect people, and be kind to people, and hope that they give it back. They sometimes don\u2019t but they sometimes do. But there\u2019s that sense of hope. What else have we got?\u201d The photo session is done. The dancing and non-dancing are over. Hall has another cigarette and then we gather around a table to answer questions from Observer readers and famous admirers. There are more than usual. \u201cHmm,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI bet you say that every time.\u201d (There are; I don\u2019t.) \u201cFire away\u2026\u201d Encore by the Specials is out now on UMC Questions from famous fans Gurinder Chadha Film director What moment from your height of fame are you most proud of, the moment that provides the legacy of the Specials in years to come? Horace: Ghost Town getting to No 1. Terry: Yes, I\u2019d go with that. It was an unbelievably brilliant finale to what we\u2019d done for a few years, and every band should fold after Ghost Town really, because what else are you going to do?! Richard Curtis Film director I remember going to see you in concert and you getting about 10 seconds into Ghost Town and stopping dead and pointing at some guy in the crowd, and saying: \u2018If we don\u2019t get those Nazis out of here we\u2019re not going on with this song.\u2019 And then waiting until they were removed. Am I imagining this? Did I dream it? Terry: It used to happen every night, didn\u2019t it? Horace: It wasn\u2019t that much of an occurrence but it did happen, I remember a couple or three times where we\u2019d stop a show because of the NF. Terry: They would be sieg heiling during the show. That doesn\u2019t really happen any more. The closest thing to that was in Nottingham [2014] where somebody threw a bottle at Brad and I couldn\u2019t do anything until he\u2019d been taken out. It\u2019s important to stop stuff [like that] if you see it. Joe Talbot Lead singer, Idles Is pop much worse now than the early 80s or am I blinded with nostalgia? Now it seems really dull when we glance at the mainstream\u2026 Terry: I\u2019m actually going to see Joe in a couple of weeks, his band. I don\u2019t know. We get asked that a lot. \u201cWhat are you listening to now?\u201d And what I\u2019m listening to now is a Grateful Dead album, because I never heard it first time round... Horace: I\u2019m sure there are some things that are great out there but I don\u2019t know where to look for them. I haven\u2019t got the time to spend a fruitless three hours ploughing through YouTube. Terry: The last thing that I saw that I really, really liked was the Fat White Family. They were funny and everything you wanted. Bit druggy, funny, they look really good. Lynval: There\u2019s one band that I like. Easy Life. They\u2019re a young band from Leicester, I saw them on Jools Holland, they\u2019re really, really good. If I could have a vote for a band to be with us on any bill, it would be that little band. The kid\u2019s got the right attitude. He\u2019s a star. Lauren Laverne 6 Music presenter When are you happiest? Horace: Most of the time. Lynval: With me, when we made the album, to get up and get on a train and go to work every day, come to the studio, that was really weird \u2013 but when we finished the record, I was completely lost. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. We had so much fun doing this record. We\u2019d take it in turns to sleep on the couch. Wake up, \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice, yes,\u201d and go back to sleep. Terry: Probably happiest when I\u2019m watching football. Even through all the shitty times, five minutes before kick-off you think: \u201cThis is great.\u201d But in the last week or two do you know what\u2019s made me happiest? In our bathroom, on the floor there\u2019s mosaic tiles and one was lost. It\u2019s white so I tried putting Polyfilla in, but I couldn\u2019t get the grouting to look good. Then I thought: \u201cWell, why don\u2019t I look in the vac bag?\u201d So I got the bag out and put my hand in and I found the tile. Honestly, that made me really happy. A great moment. Richard Russell XL Recordings boss For Terry. You\u2019re one of my favourite lyricists of all time. Who are yours? Terry: Joe Dolce [who wrote Shaddap You Face]! No, obviously people like Leonard Cohen, and bits of Jeff Buckley, and almost all Daniel Johnson and the Roches. Ady Suleiman Singer What are your best memories of 2 Tone? Horace: The Bilzen rock festival in Belgium in summer 1979. We\u2019d just signed our record deal with Chrysalis, we were unknown, and we still had all this equipment that we\u2019d begged, borrowed and stolen. We were on a bill with the Cure, the Pretenders, the Police and AC/DC. Nobody had heard of us, and we went on stage and just destroyed the place. There was a big fence, 12 foot in front of the stage and during the performance it got ripped down and everyone surged to the front of the stage. For me, that was the most amazing experience ever, that music could do that was incredible. Terry: Because of bands like UB40 and the Beat too, we were doing something that wasn\u2019t in London. It was a sense of pride in where we were and wanted to make some sort of change. Lyrically, I think what we were doing was all very similar. We were all in the Midlands, and the only band I remembered from the Midlands was Jigsaw, who blew it all sky high [chuckles]. Lynval: Lieutenant Pigeon. Terry: Frank Ifield. All of a sudden, something was happening. Kids were connecting with us and it just felt really important. Diane Morgan Actor You wrote a song about a Ghost Town, but have any of you actually seen a ghost? Lynval: I was born in Saint Catherine, Jamaica\u2026 Terry: And he\u2019s off\u2026 Lynval: This man was crippled and he sat in front of this house in the village, where I come from, this brownstone house, on a mat. He died and I went down to the river with my sink pan on my head to fetch the water. It was broad daylight. I\u2019ve got the water, I\u2019m walking, then suddenly there he was, sitting in front of his house on his little mat. My mind just went, \u201cWooah, wooah,\u201d and the sink pan of water has gone off my head. I just run. And often now, I don\u2019t believe that I saw him, but I saw him. I still can\u2019t grasp it. Terry: Weed\u2019s a funny thing, isn\u2019t it? I definitely haven\u2019t seen a ghost, no. Jason Williamson Singer, Sleaford Mods One thing I find with accomplishment is that it can feel so insignificant overall, but I know that\u2019s something to do with bouts of depression. Do you feel this sometimes about what you\u2019ve done and still do as musicians? Terry: It does matter, really, and even when it doesn\u2019t matter, it still matters. People see success as getting to No 1 and being platinum. I don\u2019t see that at all, I never have. I think the success is getting something inside, out, and getting someone to listen to it. That is success. For the first 20 years of my life, nobody would listen to me. Nobody. At school, jobcentres, they just didn\u2019t listen, they were never bothered. But then you say something and somebody says, \u201cI agree, I disagree\u201d, and so wow, somebody\u2019s listened. That\u2019s success. Questions from readers In my opinion you\u2019re the best band to grace this world. Which song do you still love banging out the most? Lee Griffiths, via email Lynval: I like Nite Klub. It\u2019s a bit of a naughty one: \u201cI won\u2019t dance in a club like this/ All the girls are slags/ And the beer tastes just like piss.\u201d It\u2019s what we guys, when we get together, we talk about. We don\u2019t shout it out loud to people. I quite enjoy that. Horace: Yes, I\u2019ll go Nite Klub too. There\u2019s a version of it on the deluxe edition of the album and it\u2019s fantastic, I love it. Terry: I quite like stuff from the second album. International Jet Set and Stereotype. Just because I\u2019ve always had this thing about people seeing us as a ska band. We don\u2019t play ska music, and if you look at International Jet Set, you couldn\u2019t be more removed from ska. On the second album, I couldn\u2019t pick one song, but I could say with that album: \u201cWow, something good is happening here.\u201d And then we split up! I remember hearing Gangsters for the first time in 1979 when I was in an amusement arcade on my school holidays. The energy of that song stopped me in my tracks and the Specials have been my band ever since. What\u2019s your music moment that\u2019s stayed with you? Angelina Jones, via email Terry: I\u2019d go with Gangsters. When we did it on Saturday Night Live in New York. Because it felt so alien to the people on the show, the ones working there and the audience, and that was the first time I thought: \u201cSomething good\u2019s happening here.\u201d We took off the shackles when we did it, people were just roaming on and off stage. And it felt really like the right song at the right time. I remember doing photo sessions and people thinking we were like, a gay choir, because we all had short hair. Either ex-marines or a gay choir. Lynval: Remember when we did it in Chicago? When they got the audience to throw these fake dollar bills on the stage? Because\u2026 gangster, yes? Terry: Al Capone. Miranda Sawyer: But can you think of a song that isn\u2019t yours where you thought: this changes everything? Horace: I was delivering car spares to a store in Birmingham. This was about 1990. And this song came on the radio, and I was standing there with this box, and this bloke was going, \u201cCome on, give me the box,\u201d and I go, \u201cShh.\u201d And it was Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. It was the first time I heard it, and I thought, \u201cFlippin\u2019 heck. That\u2019s good.\u201d Lynval: \u201cGet up, stand up. Stand up for your rights\u201d by Bob Marley, because it was around the time when we started having our own identity. We started getting away from the colonial ways that were forced on to us. And that\u2019s when the Rasta theme started coming up, something we can call our own, you know? That really hit me. Miranda: How about you, Terry? Is there a song you can think of that changed things for you? Terry: I will come back to Shaddap You Face again\u2026 No, Anarchy in the UK. It was like everybody was waiting for something like that. It was a turning point. If someone had told me 40 years ago that a bloke like [pro-Brexit \u2018yellow vest\u2019 protester] James Goddard and his mates would be close to the profile they have today, I would\u2019ve found it hard to believe. You played a leadership role then. What do you think needs to happen now? How do we reverse the division that people like Goddard look to exploit? Steve E, Vancouver Lynval: Back when we started, it was a small minority of skinheads that was pulling the wrong way. I remember one guy I met, a real National Front supporter, you know? And after I finished talking to him, we shook hands and we looked at each other, and he said he hadn\u2019t talked to a black guy before. He wouldn\u2019t do it. But once we talked and had a discussion\u2026 Horace: Those people always were out there. They feel more of a licence to speak now, because we all have our platform, don\u2019t we? This division is a knock-on effect of Instagram and Twitter and whatever. Everyone has a voice now. But there\u2019s no filter on it. Back in our day, you would voice your discontent down the pub to your mates. Whereas now you can voice your discontent to millions of people from the privacy of your own downstairs toilet. Terry: I think politicians love the division. It\u2019s a great thing for them. They thrive on it. I don\u2019t think they want everyone to be together. Brexit has conjured up so much stuff, and all these personalities are appearing, like Jacob Rees-Mogg. They like the division and I can see it getting a lot worse. Do you feel mellowed with age or do you still get intensely wound up by current political events? Stephen Bennett, Dublin Lynval: I switch on CNN and wonder: \u201cWhat am I watching all this for?\u201d People calling the police because a little kid is selling water, just because the kid is black [#PermitPatty]\u2026 The one thing which I think is good with social media is, when we say: \u201cYou\u2019ll never understand what it\u2019s like to be black.\u201d I think the images that come in now, but you see it and maybe understand more. You know, you walk in a shop and you know that all eyes are on you. Because you appear like a guy who\u2019s going to come in and shoplift. Because you\u2019re black\u2026 No, I\u2019m not mellowed with age. Horace: I think age has filtered a few things. The only thing I watch on television is the news, really. Terry: I\u2019ve definitely mellowed. But I\u2019m at that age. I\u2019m going to be 60 in a month, and there\u2019s loads of shit going on, but then I look up at night and see the moon, and I just think: \u201cWhoa.\u201d Do you know what I mean? You see a tree that\u2019s been there a few hundred years, and you think: \u201cFucking hell. This is brilliant.\u201d Miranda: Is that age? Terry: No, it\u2019s medication. When you have kids of your own and with their mates, that\u2019s where you can be political, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tended to do, especially with my older boys when they were teenagers. Watching them go through stuff, and hopefully guiding them. My house used to be a real open house, like a youth club. Their mates always used to come round because I was like a bit \u201cright on\u201d, and they could smoke weed or whatever. And that\u2019s where you try and influence so that there\u2019s not so much anger. It\u2019s not being mellow, you\u2019re doing something, but you\u2019re doing it at home, you know? Rather than just blasting it out all the time. Horace: Micro as opposed to macro. What are your thoughts on Coventry becoming a UK city of culture in 2021? Have you been approached to do something? Liam Nagle, Coventry Horace: I\u2019m the only participating member of the Specials who still lives in Coventry and no, I haven\u2019t been approached to do something. I would like to see money put by to provide for music lessons for children in schools, a proper legacy. I\u2019m more interested in that than \u201cHere\u2019s a couple of boutique hotels\u201d, and who needs another wine bar for goodness sake? Terry: I get really bugged by this City of Culture thing. If you have to really search for the culture, you\u2019re making it up. The landmark for me in Coventry is the cathedral. I\u2019m a Cov kid, who grew up as all the industry collapsed around us in the 80s and 90s, losing perhaps 100,000 jobs in that time from Jaguar, Triumph, Dunlop, Rover, Rolls-Royce, Morris, Alvis, Massey Ferguson. I wonder how you see the city today with so many of those jobs replaced by call centres? People who had repetitive production line jobs at least had the pride of being part of making something that was known, in some cases, worldwide. Now they just get shouted at by irate customers on the phone. FlightGuileAndPies, online Lynval: You used to have Courtaulds. They were everywhere. Massey Ferguson that does the tractors. And in Canley, Matrix Churchill, one of the last pieces of work they were doing was [making parts for arms] for the Iraq war. Obviously that war game didn\u2019t work out for them, because war brings employment for them! It\u2019s all gone now. Even the smell of the city is not there any more. You could smell the engineering. Back then, Coventry was thriving, an industrial city. Now it\u2019s a student city. Horace: Loads of barbers. Lynval: And chicken shop takeaways. It\u2019s all revolving around students. Working class, labour people \u2013 once the industry goes away, then all the traditional pubs, they die. The working men\u2019s clubs, they die. Like what my father used to go to, Rowley\u2019s Green Working Men\u2019s Club. They\u2019re not there any more. Horace: There\u2019s still manufacturing in Coventry. Lynval: You\u2019ve got Triumph motorbikes. Horace: London taxis are made in Coventry. Terry: All my family worked in factories. My mum worked for Chrysler, my dad worked for Rolls- Royce. Aunt. Everybody worked in the car factories, and there was a real sense of community. Everybody felt on an equal level, all getting cash every week. I didn\u2019t really notice the decline, really, until it had happened, but then it was massive. It\u2019s difficult with Coventry because I moved away for specific reasons. I couldn\u2019t fucking stand it. What was it like touring with the Clash? Peter Milne, Norwich Lynval: It was absolutely an eye-opener. Joe Strummer was a wonderful, wonderful human being, and being in that group of people at that time, there was so much excitement. Because we did our little pub thing, but this was like the next level up. It was just a wonderful vibe. Like one big party. Horace: We learned how to present a show while on tour with the Clash. You would see how they go on stage and it was just like, Bang. We learned to give 100%. Not just shamble on stage and \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019d like to play a few songs.\u201d We were totally different after that tour. I always say that we started that tour as civilians but ended it as a group. Terry: And after the Clash thing, that\u2019s when we cut our hair, because we discovered what we should look like by doing that tour. And then you end up in Crawley with about 1,000 skinheads gobbing at you. Horace: That was scary. Terry: Yes, that was really scary. But it was great because Suicide were on that tour as well. And Sham did stuff. [Jimmy] Pursey was there. For me, it was like, \u201cHow do you react to an audience?\u201d The fans tell you the songs they like. They like Monkey Man, definitely. And A Message to You, around the world. I heard activist Saffiyah Khan has sung on the album. How did this come about? Barry Mingard, Welwyn Garden City Terry: We saw Saffiyah in that photo. She had a Specials T-shirt on, and she was standing up to a member of the EDL, who was screaming at her, and she just smiled back. A fantastic reaction, because it made him look stupid. So we got in touch with her and said: \u201cCome to our gig in Birmingham.\u201d Then when it came to recording the album, we were thinking about people who might like to be on it, and she was definitely in my head as somebody who could have something to say. And at the same time I was listening to Prince Buster, Ten Commandments of Man, and I couldn\u2019t believe... Miranda: How rampantly sexist it is? Terry: It goes back to Dave Lee Travis, like hand-on-the-arse times. So then the idea came like: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to do an answer to that?\u201d But obviously from a woman. Saffiyah was the obvious choice, and we just said to her: \u201cHere\u2019s the Prince Buster song. Do you want to try to reply to it?\u201d And she got on with it. Bloody hell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen such effortlessly cool looking gentlemen ever. Please give me a clothing tip. Tenement Funster, online Horace: Smart casual. And wear your T-shirt outside your jeans. Lynval: Horace is stepping up now, he\u2019s the man. Me, I love that sort of stuff from the 70s, like reggae style, you know? Gregory Isaacs. Terry: It\u2019s simple. Avoid horizontal stripes. Didn\u2019t work when you were 18 mate, and now you\u2019re middle aged. Terry, as a lifelong Man United fan, what do you think Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has to do to get the manager\u2019s job full time? Thehumblegent, online Terry: No idea what he has to do. I mean, he just wins at the moment. He\u2019s such a lovable bloke and a real legend, but whether he\u2019ll keep the job, who knows? Lynval: He\u2019s a real Man U guy, he spent half his life there, it\u2019s in his blood, and it\u2019s got to be in your blood to be able to manage a club like that. I think they should hold on to him, and give him the job full time. It could be another Fergie in the making. Terry: I think realistically, for me, Ferguson is managing the club again. He\u2019s using Solskj\u00e6r as his mouthpiece. Ferguson is smiling way too much. Lynval: It\u2019s brilliant. The next legend manager. Now you\u2019re doing new material like Jerry wanted to do when you reformed, isn\u2019t it time to let him back into the fold? Bloodydoorsoff, online Horace: (Quietly but decisively) No. Next question. Lynval: I think having Nikolaj Torp Larsen, we\u2019re really fortunate to have a kid like that who\u2019s so talented. I was one of the last ones to work with Jerry, I enjoyed working with him. If you\u2019re going to make music, you want to make music with people that you respect as musicians. I do respect him a lot. Terry: The whole Jerry thing, it\u2019s like, from day one, I\u2019m not sure why he isn\u2019t in the band. I honestly don\u2019t know, because we all started rehearsing together [for the 2009 reunion] and he sort of dropped out. I don\u2019t know what happened there. I don\u2019t know why he isn\u2019t in the band, do you know what I mean? He just, dropped out. It\u2019s his stuff really, it\u2019s not our stuff. He chose not to be in the band, for whatever reasons. Miranda: What about if he said: \u201cOh, can I come back?\u201d Terry: I\u2019d just tell him to fuck off. [laughter] No, I wouldn\u2019t. No, I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d get management to tell him. He can come back, it\u2019s up to him what he\u2019s going to do. Why aren\u2019t Neville, Roddy and Jerry back in the band? Diesel Estate, online Horace: They left. Lynval: They left. It\u2019s as simple as that. Roddy left the band, Neville left the band. Jerry didn\u2019t fully join the band back. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Terry: Roddy and Neville feel comfortable where they\u2019re at. They play pubs and small clubs, and I think if you lack that much charisma then that\u2019s probably a wise thing. They enjoy small intimate venues with very few people there. That\u2019s where they feel most comfortable. For Terry and Horace. What does painting do for you that making music doesn\u2019t? Sam McNichols, London Terry: When I was at my ill-est, it triggered something in my brain that wouldn\u2019t allow me to talk or walk for three weeks. Because I couldn\u2019t say anything, I had to write everything down. And a doctor said to me: \u201cPaint.\u201d And actually painting was something that was coming out of my head that I could show to people. For them, in Horace\u2019s case, to despise. [laughter from all] Miranda: It\u2019s a reaction. Terry: I\u2019ve got a fixation on the Jackson 5, so I painted the Jackson 5 for six months, and then it was pointed out to me that I\u2019d painted six. Six Jacksons, so I renamed the extra one Phil Jackson. It\u2019s all getting it out, and who cares whether it\u2019s right or wrong, I don\u2019t give a shit. Horace: Music for me is a collaborative process, I\u2019m a bass player. I have to work with a drummer, a singer, a keyboard player, I\u2019m a cog in a machine. The art is kind of my solo album.",

      "body": "<p>Micro-homes\u201d ran a recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46938445\" title=\"\">BBC headline</a>, \u201ccould solve London\u2019s housing crisis.\u201d A neoliberal thinktank, it went on, is calling for the Greater London Authority to scrap its rules on minimum floor space, saying homes in the capital with less than 37sq m of floor space could be an \u201caffordable opportunity\u201d for young people. I calculated that figure \u2013 the size of approximately 30 bath towels, overlapping slightly \u2013 while reading the story on my phone while drinking tea while watching <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/19/grand-designs-tiny-folly-review\" title=\"\">Grand Designs</a> </em>on my laptop.</p> <p>It was an episode set in Amersham in 1999, when Kevin McCloud still wore a fleece but also hair. \u201cTo what extent is this project\u2026 mad?\u201d Kevin asks, within a minute of meeting a couple planning to design an \u201cinvisible\u201d house that will blend in with the earth banks of the surrounding reservoirs. This couple who, in that way that people do in ancient footage from 1990s Britain, look both extremely old and also extremely untouched by the grinding horror of post-millennial life.</p> <p>Upon seeing a picture of the site, a 100ft water tower built by German prisoners of war in 1916, the wife tells Kevin that she said no way. Said it was too tall, too close to the road, but that her husband had breezily replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to live here.\u201d He is an architect, of course, with an idea to build an open-plan extension to the water tower, which promises to be uncompromisingly modern. At the sound of the word \u201cuncompromising\u201d I growled gleefully to an empty room, \u201cOh yes?\u201d and put down my tea.</p> <p><em>Grand Designs</em> is 20 this year. The housing crisis is 11. Both are tender portrayals of British homemaking performed through the import of many tons of specific weatherproof glass, winters spent in a caravan and the cost-led dissection of what a home is for. In the offices of a neoliberal thinktank (in my head, an armoured vehicle wearing a beret) researchers lie on the carpet top-to-tail to decide how much space a human really needs in which to live. Well, a poor human anyway. Someone without a wealthy family that could offer the backing required for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/28/lloyds-unveils-100-mortgage-for-first-time-buyers\" title=\"\">Lloyds\u2019 new 100% \u201cLend a hand\u201d mortgage</a>, an offer last seen just before the crash, or someone so exhausted after years of being exploited as a renter (in London, mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/23/sadiq-khan-makes-rent-control-key-plank-of-mayor-re-election-bid\" title=\"\">Sadiq Khan</a> has proposed rent control, but whether he\u2019s able to sway a government full of private landlords is yet to be seen) they are willing to live in a generous closet. Someone desperate, let\u2019s say, and under 5ft 4in.</p> <p>Elsewhere, on a wintry day in November, a couple in complementary body warmers will gesture shyly at the sky as they prepare to build the home that will expose all their cracks. Rather than lying on a carpet, they will stand in a field with Kevin to consider the view of a mountain as dawn breaks, and the ethical implications of mud. They will design triple-height ceilings to honour the memory of a church that one half of the couple, let\u2019s guess the husband, visited as a child. They will return often to a single word, \u201clight\u201d or \u201cuncompromising\u201d or \u201cplayful\u201d, which will, four years later, realise itself as a children\u2019s swing-set in the kitchen, or a sunken hole near the wood-burner for storing magazines \u2013 a nod, Kevin might explain, sensitively, to the wife\u2019s previous career as a journalist.</p> <p><em>Grand Designs</em>\u2019 utter Britishness was clarified this week by the <em>New Yorker </em>explaining its appeal to Americans now watching on Netflix. \u201cThe show\u2019s central theme,\u201d the writer explained, \u201cis man\u2019s morbid need to erect a monument to himself\u201d \u2013 which, wow, is not wrong. Elsewhere on Netflix a documentary about the fiasco of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/fyre-festival-social-media-con-documentaries\" title=\"\">Fyre Festival</a> had a similar theme.

      "bodyText": "Micro-homes\u201d ran a recent BBC headline, \u201ccould solve London\u2019s housing crisis.\u201d A neoliberal thinktank, it went on, is calling for the Greater London Authority to scrap its rules on minimum floor space, saying homes in the capital with less than 37sq m of floor space could be an \u201caffordable opportunity\u201d for young people. I calculated that figure \u2013 the size of approximately 30 bath towels, overlapping slightly \u2013 while reading the story on my phone while drinking tea while watching Grand Designs on my laptop. It was an episode set in Amersham in 1999, when Kevin McCloud still wore a fleece but also hair. \u201cTo what extent is this project\u2026 mad?\u201d Kevin asks, within a minute of meeting a couple planning to design an \u201cinvisible\u201d house that will blend in with the earth banks of the surrounding reservoirs. This couple who, in that way that people do in ancient footage from 1990s Britain, look both extremely old and also extremely untouched by the grinding horror of post-millennial life. Upon seeing a picture of the site, a 100ft water tower built by German prisoners of war in 1916, the wife tells Kevin that she said no way. Said it was too tall, too close to the road, but that her husband had breezily replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to live here.\u201d He is an architect, of course, with an idea to build an open-plan extension to the water tower, which promises to be uncompromisingly modern. At the sound of the word \u201cuncompromising\u201d I growled gleefully to an empty room, \u201cOh yes?\u201d and put down my tea. Grand Designs is 20 this year. The housing crisis is 11. Both are tender portrayals of British homemaking performed through the import of many tons of specific weatherproof glass, winters spent in a caravan and the cost-led dissection of what a home is for. In the offices of a neoliberal thinktank (in my head, an armoured vehicle wearing a beret) researchers lie on the carpet top-to-tail to decide how much space a human really needs in which to live. Well, a poor human anyway. Someone without a wealthy family that could offer the backing required for Lloyds\u2019 new 100% \u201cLend a hand\u201d mortgage, an offer last seen just before the crash, or someone so exhausted after years of being exploited as a renter (in London, mayor Sadiq Khan has proposed rent control, but whether he\u2019s able to sway a government full of private landlords is yet to be seen) they are willing to live in a generous closet. Someone desperate, let\u2019s say, and under 5ft 4in. Elsewhere, on a wintry day in November, a couple in complementary body warmers will gesture shyly at the sky as they prepare to build the home that will expose all their cracks. Rather than lying on a carpet, they will stand in a field with Kevin to consider the view of a mountain as dawn breaks, and the ethical implications of mud. They will design triple-height ceilings to honour the memory of a church that one half of the couple, let\u2019s guess the husband, visited as a child. They will return often to a single word, \u201clight\u201d or \u201cuncompromising\u201d or \u201cplayful\u201d, which will, four years later, realise itself as a children\u2019s swing-set in the kitchen, or a sunken hole near the wood-burner for storing magazines \u2013 a nod, Kevin might explain, sensitively, to the wife\u2019s previous career as a journalist. Grand Designs\u2019 utter Britishness was clarified this week by the New Yorker explaining its appeal to Americans now watching on Netflix. \u201cThe show\u2019s central theme,\u201d the writer explained, \u201cis man\u2019s morbid need to erect a monument to himself\u201d \u2013 which, wow, is not wrong. Elsewhere on Netflix a documentary about the fiasco of Fyre Festival had a similar theme. It reminded me of a fiasco unravelling closer to home \u2013 people having sold tickets to an island dream, with those who believed their promises of models and music or, say, blue passports, arriving on a completely different island to find disaster relief tents and a single slice of processed cheese. Anyway, as I scrolled through yet more news about how homes continue to define and defeat us (foreign investors took advantage of the Brexit-induced decline in the value of sterling to buy up three times as many \u00a310m-plus luxury homes as before the referendum vote), the writer\u2019s explanation of Grand Designs made me feel a little wobbly. Both Grand Designs, with its great British dream of building one\u2019s own castle, and the shrinking of possibilities for people without the time or income to do so, coexist in our housing market. On one side, the psychedelic glamour of designing a different bathroom for every excretion and, on the other, living with black mould because if you tell your landlord he will put the rent up. The housing crisis, it\u2019s emerging, as we move into its second decade, numbing ourselves at night with Kevin McCloud\u2019s bitchy wisdom about dry-walling, is a mutable thing that expands in our hands like spray-foam insulation. One lesser discussed aspect is the distance it creates between those watching and those doing \u2013 those who are required to take what\u2019s given to them, and those wild-eyed couples building barns out of glass. One more thing\u2026 I saw Ronnie Spector perform last week, one of my absolute heroes. Her voice is unique - a cracked glass of milk - and it\u2019s joyous to see her so strong now, after a life under Phil Spector, who kept her prisoner during their marriage. Once he surprised her with adopted twins. \u2018The more kids I got, the further I was in that mansion.\u2019 Viktor &amp; Rolf debuted a collection of slogan gowns at Paris Couture Week.

David Gauke, the justice secretary, will announce this week that victims who can produce strong grounds for a challenge will be able to apply within 21 days for the decisions to be looked at again, without having to go through the lengthy and costly judicial review process. There was an uproar when the Parole Board approved Worboys\u2019s release in January last year after deciding that he no longer posed a threat to the public. The cab driver was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after being found guilty of 19 offences against 12 of his passengers, with one count of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges.

A judicial review led to a decision by the high court that the Parole Board should conduct a \u201cfresh determination\u201d into the case.

This monthly strategy is a strong opportunity to change the model of luxury companies like Moncler,\u201d says chief executive and chairman Remo Ruffini who joined the company in 2003. \u201cThese days the mood, the attitude and the energy are more important than the product for me, and perception is much more important than everything \u2026 If you are able to mix product and energy, I think that\u2019s a modern company today.\u201d</p> <p>Ruffini\u2019s strategy of raising the profile of the quilted jacket brand has proven successful so far.</p> <p>Last year, Moncler\u2019s online traffic rose more than 50% each month following the Genius launch, while in the first nine months of the year total sales were up 23%, reaching \u20ac872.7m (\u00a3674.2m).In turn, one of its largest retailers, Matchesfashion.com, says that it has \u201cseen strong client engagement with the designer collaborations, which has had a positive halo effect across the rest of the Moncler collection,\u201d according to head of womenswear buying Liane Wiggins.</p> <p>\u201cMoncler is ahead of the game with its motto of \u2018one house, different voices\u2019,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of one person dictating how things should be done \u2013 the modern world is different and there\u2019s a need to work with and support each other.\u201d</p> <p> Now the trend is trickling down to the high street, where prices are considerably more accessible than Moncler\u2019s \u00a3500-plus. Zara, for example, has no fewer than 100 new-season styles across its men\u2019s and womenswear collections from \u00a329.99. It informs customers that they are \u201cideal for a sporty look\u2026 [and] provide extra warmth, while lightweight pieces take up almost no space\u201d.

Last February, Moncler launched its Genius project, for which a group of the world\u2019s most influential designers \u2013 including Simone Rocha, Craig Green and Valentino\u2019s Pierpaolo Piccioli \u2013 created capsule collections blending their style with the technical expertise of the brand. Aimed at targeting a growing appetite for newness from global consumers who increasingly \u2013 and impatiently \u2013 absorb trends through social media, each collection became available in highly publicised monthly \u201cdrops\u201d, rather than being traditional seasonal offerings. Last week, the brand announced that, for its third season, returning designers would be joined by two of fashion\u2019s most talked-about creators: the Kanye West protege and Dior Menswear collaborator Matthew Williams of Alyx, and Richard Quinn, who last year was presented with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth award for design at his London Fashion Week show by the monarch herself. \u201cWhen talking to customers in a digital world, brands need something unique and strong, and you need to talk to them every day. This monthly strategy is a strong opportunity to change the model of luxury companies like Moncler,\u201d says chief executive and chairman Remo Ruffini who joined the company in 2003. \u201cThese days the mood, the attitude and the energy are more important than the product for me, and perception is much more important than everything \u2026 If you are able to mix product and energy, I think that\u2019s a modern company today.\u201d Ruffini\u2019s strategy of raising the profile of the quilted jacket brand has proven successful so far. Last year, Moncler\u2019s online traffic rose more than 50% each month following the Genius launch, while in the first nine months of the year total sales were up 23%, reaching \u20ac872.7m (\u00a3674.2m).In turn, one of its largest retailers, Matchesfashion.com, says that it has \u201cseen strong client engagement with the designer collaborations, which has had a positive halo effect across the rest of the Moncler collection,\u201d according to head of womenswear buying Liane Wiggins. \u201cMoncler is ahead of the game with its motto of \u2018one house, different voices\u2019,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of one person dictating how things should be done \u2013 the modern world is different and there\u2019s a need to work with and support each other.\u201d Now the trend is trickling down to the high street, where prices are considerably more accessible than Moncler\u2019s \u00a3500-plus. Zara, for example, has no fewer than 100 new-season styles across its men\u2019s and womenswear collections from \u00a329.99. It informs customers that they are \u201cideal for a sporty look\u2026 [and] provide extra warmth, while lightweight pieces take up almost no space\u201d. It also points out that that they are \u201cideal for travelling\u201d \u2013 whether on the slopes, or, as is now normal, on a mild daily commute.",

The <em>Sunday Times</em> correspondent Marie Colvin, killed while reporting from the besieged Syrian enclave of Baba Amr in February 2012, was not the victim of a tragic accident.</p> <p>\u201cShe was specifically targeted because of her profession, for the purpose of silencing those reporting on the growing opposition movement in the country,\u201d wrote Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US District Court in Washington DC.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/31/us-court-finds-assad-regime-liable-marie-colvin-death-homs-syria\" title=\"\">verdict</a> should be celebrated by all who care about freedom of speech. At a time when journalists are frequently vilified and threatened, it acknowledges the significant role we play in exposing war crimes and injustice. \u201cThe murder of journalists acting in their professional capacity could have a chilling effect on reporting such events worldwide,\u201d Jackson added.</p> <p>I will never forget my last conversation with Marie, who was speaking on Skype from Baba Amr in Homs. President Bashar al-Assad had said only terrorists remained there, but she told me about the injured children she had seen cowering under the terrifying, relentless bombardment by the Fourth Armoured Division of the Syrian army. Marie and I had reported from many war zones, but I had never heard her sound so desperate. She said: \u201cLindsey, this is the worst we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>A few hours later, Marie and a French photographer, R\u00e9mi Ochlik, were killed in an artillery barrage. The photographer Paul Conroy, a former British soldier who was badly injured in the attack, has described how the makeshift media centre where they were staying was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/01/paul-conroy-marie-colvin-syria-curiosity-overtook-sense-staying-alive\" title=\"\">\u201cbracketed\u201d</a> \u2013 a technique for centring on a target.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/10/marie-colvin-legacy-film-memoir\" title=\"\">feature film and documentary</a> that have been made about Marie and the biography I wrote are testament to her extraordinary life, but this judgment gives meaning to her death at the age of 56.</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t bring Marie back but it will hold someone accountable,\u201d said her sister, Cathleen Colvin, who brought the case. \u201cI hope it sends a message to the world about the targeting of journalists.\u201d</p> <p>This was a civil not a criminal case, as Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute enforced by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, and President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s protector, Russia, has vetoed any attempt to set up a special tribunal. US law allows prosecution if the accused state is deemed a sponsor of terrorism. The judge awarded punitive damages of more than $300m to Cathleen Colvin, not just because she and her children would be deprived of a beloved sister and aunt but because \u201ca targeted murder of an American citizen whose courageous work was not only important, but vital to our understanding of war zones and of wars generally, is outrageous\u201d.</p> <p>A parallel case has been launched in France on behalf of the family of R\u00e9mi Ochlik and also Edith Bouvier, a reporter for <em>Le Figaro</em> who was injured in the attack.</p> <p>The Colvin family is unlikely to see their money, although they may pursue frozen Syrian assets, but they hope that a precedent has been set for Syrian civilians. The lead counsel, Scott Gilmore of the Centre for Justice and Accountability, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really hoping this case will send a powerful signal that there will be justice for perpetrators of war crimes in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>Compelling testimony came from a defector codenamed Ulysses, who described how the Syrian military intercepted Colvin\u2019s broadcasts to CNN, the BBC and Channel 4 News, paid an informer to confirm where the journalists were staying and celebrated her death. Since the war in Syria began, other defectors have smuggled out millions of documents that implicate the regime in countless crimes against humanity. Cases are now under way in Germany and France on behalf of Syrian refugees who were tortured in Assad\u2019s prisons or whose relatives were \u201cdisappeared\u201d.</p> <p>These days the danger to journalists is not restricted to those reporting from war zones or rogue regimes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/19/journalists-death-toll-nearly-doubles-in-2018\" title=\"\">three journalists have been killed in the European Union in the past 18 months</a>. Investigating the nexus between organised crime and corrupt officials is especially perilous.

At a time when journalists are frequently vilified and threatened, it acknowledges the significant role we play in exposing war crimes and injustice. \u201cThe murder of journalists acting in their professional capacity could have a chilling effect on reporting such events worldwide,\u201d Jackson added. I will never forget my last conversation with Marie, who was speaking on Skype from Baba Amr in Homs. President Bashar al-Assad had said only terrorists remained there, but she told me about the injured children she had seen cowering under the terrifying, relentless bombardment by the Fourth Armoured Division of the Syrian army. Marie and I had reported from many war zones, but I had never heard her sound so desperate. She said: \u201cLindsey, this is the worst we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d A few hours later, Marie and a French photographer, R\u00e9mi Ochlik, were killed in an artillery barrage. The photographer Paul Conroy, a former British soldier who was badly injured in the attack, has described how the makeshift media centre where they were staying was \u201cbracketed\u201d \u2013 a technique for centring on a target. The feature film and documentary that have been made about Marie and the biography I wrote are testament to her extraordinary life, but this judgment gives meaning to her death at the age of 56. \u201cIt won\u2019t bring Marie back but it will hold someone accountable,\u201d said her sister, Cathleen Colvin, who brought the case. \u201cI hope it sends a message to the world about the targeting of journalists.\u201d This was a civil not a criminal case, as Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute enforced by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, and President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s protector, Russia, has vetoed any attempt to set up a special tribunal. US law allows prosecution if the accused state is deemed a sponsor of terrorism. The judge awarded punitive damages of more than $300m to Cathleen Colvin, not just because she and her children would be deprived of a beloved sister and aunt but because \u201ca targeted murder of an American citizen whose courageous work was not only important, but vital to our understanding of war zones and of wars generally, is outrageous\u201d. A parallel case has been launched in France on behalf of the family of R\u00e9mi Ochlik and also Edith Bouvier, a reporter for Le Figaro who was injured in the attack. The Colvin family is unlikely to see their money, although they may pursue frozen Syrian assets, but they hope that a precedent has been set for Syrian civilians. The lead counsel, Scott Gilmore of the Centre for Justice and Accountability, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really hoping this case will send a powerful signal that there will be justice for perpetrators of war crimes in Syria.\u201d Compelling testimony came from a defector codenamed Ulysses, who described how the Syrian military intercepted Colvin\u2019s broadcasts to CNN, the BBC and Channel 4 News, paid an informer to confirm where the journalists were staying and celebrated her death. Since the war in Syria began, other defectors have smuggled out millions of documents that implicate the regime in countless crimes against humanity. Cases are now under way in Germany and France on behalf of Syrian refugees who were tortured in Assad\u2019s prisons or whose relatives were \u201cdisappeared\u201d. These days the danger to journalists is not restricted to those reporting from war zones or rogue regimes \u2013 three journalists have been killed in the European Union in the past 18 months. Investigating the nexus between organised crime and corrupt officials is especially perilous. The commitment of Malta to establish who killed Daphne Caruana Galizia, blown up by a car bomb in October 2017, may be undermined by the Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat, who even last week was in court pursuing a libel case against her. Judge Jackson noted that the Syrian government regarded journalists as \u201cenemies of the state\u201d. Her court lies just 10 minutes drive from the White House, where the US president frequently calls journalists \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. I wonder if that will be on her mind as she deals with the next cases she has been assigned \u2013 charges against the men who allegedly used the dark arts of media manipulation to get President Trump elected: his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and adviser Roger Stone.

      "bodyText": "An onstage banner proclaims that \u201cMiss Cackle\u2019s Academy for Witches\u201d is seeking applications \u201cfrom diverse backgrounds\u201d and is \u201crated fantastic by Ofmag\u201d. First published in 1974, Jill Murphy\u2019s fantastical boarding-school stories have gone on to sell more than 5m copies (and counting \u2013 the latest appeared just last year). This new stage adaptation by Emma Reeves features incidents from various of the eight titles, plus elements of the most recent TV series (on which Reeves was lead writer). In spite of engaging performances from the spirited actor-musician cast, including Danielle Bird as the hopelessly clumsy new girl and \u201cworst\u201d witch Mildred, the first half is overlong and underwhelming (not helped by the use of mics and poor sound balance). The second half, though, is a blast, launched by the arrival of Miss Cackle\u2019s evil twin, Agatha, red spangles flashing, who, in a belting number, announces her intention to take over the school, \u201crule by power\u201d, \u201ctake back control\u201d and \u201cmake witching great again\u201d. The story has found its mojo. From now on, Theresa Heskins\u2019s direction conjures a potent mix of magic-seeming tricks, flying acrobatics and derring do, while Luke Potter\u2019s score rollocks the plot along. Everything centres around the glorious performance of one of British theatre\u2019s very best baddies: Polly Lister (left, centre), doubling as sweet Miss Cackle and dastardly Agatha, sometimes simultaneously. At the matinee I attended, primary schoolchildren almost levitated from their seats in sheer, exuberant joy as they unequivocally rejected her wicked plans with their loud \u201cNooooooooooooooo!\u201d \u2022 The Worst Witch is touring until 1 June",

A kind of certainty of purpose that\u2026 I had just listened to that recording of her over and over and over again. And I knew her or something and I don\u2019t know, it\u2026 it was quite profound really.\u201d Pike\u2019s voice is almost breaking as she speaks.</p> <p>Her co-star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jamie-dornan\" title=\"\">Jamie Dornan</a>, plays the war photographer Paul Conroy, who survived the attack that killed Colvin and who also ended up staying on set to advise the whole thing. \u201cPaul said afterwards: \u2018I got my mate back for a bit there.\u2019\u201d Pike pauses. \u201cGod, she impressed me,\u201d she continues, saying it\u2019s wonderful to play someone who has such purpose, and then adds that \u201cshe was so eloquent, as eloquence can hit you \u2013 when you really need to speak, I believe that the words come.\u201d And then she gently starts to cry. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional.\u201d</p> <p>It was clearly an incredibly intense film to make. Many of the extras and small parts were cast from Syrian refugees living in Jordan, where they filmed. Pike says that most film directors wouldn\u2019t even be involved with casting those people, they might just be shown some photographs, but as a documentarist, Heineman is incredibly thorough, \u201cand so he interviewed everybody himself. Hundreds and hundreds of people.\u201d I am concerned to know if it was made entirely clear to these extras that Pike was an actor pretending to be a journalist, and she admits that she does think that line got confused. There is one scene where she is interviewing women trapped in a place known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/20/hero-marie-colvin-lindsey-hilsum\" title=\"\">\u201cwidows\u2019 basement\u201d</a>, in Homs, and a mother tells her that her breast milk has dried up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0372a7fe7292a975bbfb669e3871348b793ebc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0372a7fe7292a975bbfb669e3871348b793ebc0/15_127_2764_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Dior show, Autumn Winter 2016, Paris Fashion Week, France - 04 Mar 2016Mandatory Credit: Photo by Swan Gallet/WWD/REX/Shutterstock (5609497h) Rosamund Pike and Robie Uniacke in the front row Christian Dior show, Autumn Winter 2016, Paris Fashion Week, France - 04 Mar 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The fact we keep any form of routine is quite remarkable, really\u2019: Rosamund Pike with her partner Robie Uniacke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swan Gallet/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI knew that she was going to tell me about only being able to feed this tiny newborn just sugar and water, because of the trauma, but what I didn\u2019t know is that she fled from her house as it had been car bombed. And she\u2019d run away with her three children and then turned around and realised that one of the children wasn\u2019t there. That was really harrowing and I didn\u2019t know that was going to come up. Because when she then said to me: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to be words in your paper, I want the world to know my story,\u2019 I felt, my God. She doesn\u2019t realise I\u2019m not a journalist.\u201d</p> <p>Pike also admits that, because they were filming in the relative safety of Jordan, these women \u201cperhaps didn\u2019t realise the basement would be created to feel almost exactly like the one they had been in. So I think the reliving of experience was more intense than they were anticipating.\u201d</p> <p>To me, this raises ethical questions. It also adds to the film\u2019s power. I ask Pike if it affects her differently now, seeing footage from Syria on the news. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t see it on the news, do you? I mean, you really don\u2019t see it. At all. And then the narrative is written by the winners, isn\u2019t it? And Marie was the one who went out on CNN and called it a lie. She went in because she found it so anger-making, she knew there was this lie, but she had to go in so she could be there and say, you know, there are no terrorist gangs, there are no military targets here in Homs, this is just a city of cold starving civilians under siege with no food in one of the coldest winters we\u2019ve ever seen, and the fact that Assad claims that they\u2019re bombing military targets is a complete and utter lie.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa64a7f40a407676cc938cc50b3e3c64da98bf65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa64a7f40a407676cc938cc50b3e3c64da98bf65/731_11_4367_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedy turn: Pike with David Tennant in What We Did on our Holidays.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedy turn: Pike with David Tennant in What We Did on our Holidays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pike was nominated for an Oscar for her lead performance of the psychopathic Amy in <em>Gone Girl</em>, a thriller with a rather comic edge based on the globally bestselling novel. It was filmed a decade after she began her career playing a Bond girl in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/15/artsfeatures.jamesbond\" title=\"\">Die Another Day</a></em>, which came not long after she finished her English degree at Oxford (after growing up an only child in London and then boarding school in Bristol). I wonder, then, if she has any qualms about going for mass market, commercial stuff, too?</p> <p>\u201cNo! None,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you work in the entertainment industry, you want to make a film that grown-ups want to go and watch in the cinema, and <em>Gone Girl</em> was the holy grail of that. You know, something that was critically acclaimed but that adults wanted to be there, part of the conversation, and queue up and see it the first night in the cinema. That is what you want, and it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s very rare.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, she plays down any interest in awards, because when she was nominated, \u201cI ended up at a dinner party, and there were voting members [of the Academy] who clearly, you know, had not seen <em>Gone Girl</em> and probably didn\u2019t know I was nominated for best actress but were talking about the Oscars nonetheless, and said: \u2018Oh, yeah, I heard that performance was really good.\u2019 And you think, that is how people are voting! They\u2019re voting on what they hear is really good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29b3c4994001fa7521490654cf7938d9f7797372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b3c4994001fa7521490654cf7938d9f7797372/0_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Go girl: Pike in Gone Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Go girl: Pike in Gone Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pike seemingly has no interest in rumours and hearsay, never reads her own reviews, and doesn\u2019t engage with social media whatsoever. She is intrigued when I admit to being addicted to it, and the interview tables are now turned on me. \u201cWhat do you get from it?\u201d she wants to know. Well, the endorphin rush of someone liking something I\u2019ve posted, I say. I post things that I think are funny and then other people find them funny, and then, er.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then you get this\u2026 rush?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d I admit. \u201cIt\u2019s really tragic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho do you think is authentic on social media?\u201d she asks. \u201cDo you think your humour is authentic? Do you think that actually makes you authentic?\u201d Oh God\u2026</p> <p>Personally, my favourite work of Pike\u2019s is comedy \u2013 I don\u2019t think the family film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/what-we-did-on-our-holiday-review-david-tennant-rosamund-pike\" title=\"\">What We Did On Our Holidays</a></em>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/david-tennant-organised-religion-gave-me-a-good-moral-compass\" title=\"\">David Tennant</a>, gets enough credit for how hysterically funny it is. She plays it very straight, and her po-facedness works brilliantly in a comic setting. She is similarly mesmerising in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/29/an-education-review\" title=\"\">An Education</a></em>, where she plays Helen, the glamorous but ignorant society girlfriend who takes Carey Mulligan\u2019s character under her wing and is baffled by her learning. All of which makes me keen to see a forthcoming series written by Nick Hornby, <em>State of the Union</em>, wherein Pike and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/04/chris-odowd-interview-i-was-the-funny-friend-of-the-girls-i-fancied-it-was-a-comfort\" title=\"\">Chris O\u2019Dowd</a> play a married couple who sit awkwardly in the pub before each marriage counselling session.</p> <p>In her own life, she was once engaged to the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/25/joe-wright-pride-prejudice-director-returns-london-stage\" title=\"\">Joe Wright</a>, after they fell in love while making <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/sep/16/2\" title=\"\">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> together, but he called it off upsettingly close to the big day. That\u2019s now in the past, as she has two children with the man she calls \u201cmy other half\u201d, an Eton-educated mathematician always referred to in the tabloids as \u201cformer heroin addict Robie Uniacke\u201d, though that is in the past, too. They live in a Georgian townhouse in Islington with their two young sons, Atom and Solo, who have apparently learned Chinese from their polymath father, and who came out to Jordan with their dad during the filming, young enough to simply enjoy scenes with things like exploding vehicles, although she had to let them believe the baddies wouldn\u2019t get her in the end.

The boys still talk about it. They call it the biggest bedroom. The sky. It\u2019s very easy, I think, when you have children, to start saying no to things. And yet you never regret saying yes. That\u2019s our motto in life at the moment \u2013 because you don\u2019t look back on your life and remember the things you said no to.\u201d</p> <p>Pike says her other half is a feminist, \u201cand it\u2019s a thing I prize highly and appreciate daily. Someone who\u2019s self-confident enough and secure enough to deal with this crazy\u2026 It is crazy, how our life is. Just the constant shifting. The fact we keep any form of routine is quite remarkable, really.\u201d</p> <p>She is clearly gripped by true stories of remarkable women.

You have a purpose and a simplicity.\u201d To me, this sounds like a perfect description of high-functioning ADHD, a condition I suspect is common among war reporters, so we talk about that for a bit, but Pike is adept at steering the conversation back to Colvin specifically, and suggests the spirit of the dead reporter entered her while filming the pivotal scene, a recreation of a live broadcast on CNN where she bravely tells the world that Assad is a liar. \u201cI had this fluency came out of me on that day, and it was definitely guided by Marie, I think. A kind of certainty of purpose that\u2026 I had just listened to that recording of her over and over and over again. And I knew her or something and I don\u2019t know, it\u2026 it was quite profound really.\u201d Pike\u2019s voice is almost breaking as she speaks. Her co-star, Jamie Dornan, plays the war photographer Paul Conroy, who survived the attack that killed Colvin and who also ended up staying on set to advise the whole thing. \u201cPaul said afterwards: \u2018I got my mate back for a bit there.\u2019\u201d Pike pauses. \u201cGod, she impressed me,\u201d she continues, saying it\u2019s wonderful to play someone who has such purpose, and then adds that \u201cshe was so eloquent, as eloquence can hit you \u2013 when you really need to speak, I believe that the words come.\u201d And then she gently starts to cry. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional.\u201d It was clearly an incredibly intense film to make. Many of the extras and small parts were cast from Syrian refugees living in Jordan, where they filmed. Pike says that most film directors wouldn\u2019t even be involved with casting those people, they might just be shown some photographs, but as a documentarist, Heineman is incredibly thorough, \u201cand so he interviewed everybody himself. Hundreds and hundreds of people.\u201d I am concerned to know if it was made entirely clear to these extras that Pike was an actor pretending to be a journalist, and she admits that she does think that line got confused. There is one scene where she is interviewing women trapped in a place known as the \u201cwidows\u2019 basement\u201d, in Homs, and a mother tells her that her breast milk has dried up. \u201cI knew that she was going to tell me about only being able to feed this tiny newborn just sugar and water, because of the trauma, but what I didn\u2019t know is that she fled from her house as it had been car bombed. And she\u2019d run away with her three children and then turned around and realised that one of the children wasn\u2019t there. That was really harrowing and I didn\u2019t know that was going to come up. Because when she then said to me: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to be words in your paper, I want the world to know my story,\u2019 I felt, my God. She doesn\u2019t realise I\u2019m not a journalist.\u201d Pike also admits that, because they were filming in the relative safety of Jordan, these women \u201cperhaps didn\u2019t realise the basement would be created to feel almost exactly like the one they had been in. So I think the reliving of experience was more intense than they were anticipating.\u201d To me, this raises ethical questions. It also adds to the film\u2019s power. I ask Pike if it affects her differently now, seeing footage from Syria on the news. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t see it on the news, do you? I mean, you really don\u2019t see it. At all. And then the narrative is written by the winners, isn\u2019t it? And Marie was the one who went out on CNN and called it a lie. She went in because she found it so anger-making, she knew there was this lie, but she had to go in so she could be there and say, you know, there are no terrorist gangs, there are no military targets here in Homs, this is just a city of cold starving civilians under siege with no food in one of the coldest winters we\u2019ve ever seen, and the fact that Assad claims that they\u2019re bombing military targets is a complete and utter lie.\u201d Pike was nominated for an Oscar for her lead performance of the psychopathic Amy in Gone Girl, a thriller with a rather comic edge based on the globally bestselling novel. It was filmed a decade after she began her career playing a Bond girl in Die Another Day, which came not long after she finished her English degree at Oxford (after growing up an only child in London and then boarding school in Bristol). I wonder, then, if she has any qualms about going for mass market, commercial stuff, too? \u201cNo! None,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you work in the entertainment industry, you want to make a film that grown-ups want to go and watch in the cinema, and Gone Girl was the holy grail of that. You know, something that was critically acclaimed but that adults wanted to be there, part of the conversation, and queue up and see it the first night in the cinema. That is what you want, and it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s very rare.\u201d At the same time, she plays down any interest in awards, because when she was nominated, \u201cI ended up at a dinner party, and there were voting members [of the Academy] who clearly, you know, had not seen Gone Girl and probably didn\u2019t know I was nominated for best actress but were talking about the Oscars nonetheless, and said: \u2018Oh, yeah, I heard that performance was really good.\u2019 And you think, that is how people are voting! They\u2019re voting on what they hear is really good.\u201d Pike seemingly has no interest in rumours and hearsay, never reads her own reviews, and doesn\u2019t engage with social media whatsoever. She is intrigued when I admit to being addicted to it, and the interview tables are now turned on me. \u201cWhat do you get from it?\u201d she wants to know. Well, the endorphin rush of someone liking something I\u2019ve posted, I say. I post things that I think are funny and then other people find them funny, and then, er. \u201cAnd then you get this\u2026 rush?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d I admit. \u201cIt\u2019s really tragic.\u201d \u201cWho do you think is authentic on social media?\u201d she asks. \u201cDo you think your humour is authentic? Do you think that actually makes you authentic?\u201d Oh God\u2026 Personally, my favourite work of Pike\u2019s is comedy \u2013 I don\u2019t think the family film What We Did On Our Holidays, with David Tennant, gets enough credit for how hysterically funny it is. She plays it very straight, and her po-facedness works brilliantly in a comic setting. She is similarly mesmerising in An Education, where she plays Helen, the glamorous but ignorant society girlfriend who takes Carey Mulligan\u2019s character under her wing and is baffled by her learning. All of which makes me keen to see a forthcoming series written by Nick Hornby, State of the Union, wherein Pike and Chris O\u2019Dowd play a married couple who sit awkwardly in the pub before each marriage counselling session. In her own life, she was once engaged to the director Joe Wright, after they fell in love while making Pride and Prejudice together, but he called it off upsettingly close to the big day. That\u2019s now in the past, as she has two children with the man she calls \u201cmy other half\u201d, an Eton-educated mathematician always referred to in the tabloids as \u201cformer heroin addict Robie Uniacke\u201d, though that is in the past, too. They live in a Georgian townhouse in Islington with their two young sons, Atom and Solo, who have apparently learned Chinese from their polymath father, and who came out to Jordan with their dad during the filming, young enough to simply enjoy scenes with things like exploding vehicles, although she had to let them believe the baddies wouldn\u2019t get her in the end. (Spoiler alert: they do.) At other times they would stay at the hotel, playing Lego, and then the whole family went to Wadi Rum in the desert, \u201cwhere we just put down these blankets against a sort of rocky outcrop and built a fire and slept in our clothes. The boys still talk about it. They call it the biggest bedroom. The sky. It\u2019s very easy, I think, when you have children, to start saying no to things. And yet you never regret saying yes. That\u2019s our motto in life at the moment \u2013 because you don\u2019t look back on your life and remember the things you said no to.\u201d Pike says her other half is a feminist, \u201cand it\u2019s a thing I prize highly and appreciate daily. Someone who\u2019s self-confident enough and secure enough to deal with this crazy\u2026 It is crazy, how our life is. Just the constant shifting. The fact we keep any form of routine is quite remarkable, really.\u201d She is clearly gripped by true stories of remarkable women. Which works in her relationship, as her partner \u201calways had a library of feminist literature and books on pioneering women. Before there was the sort of,\u201d she starts chuckling, \u201call those Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls books. One of my friend\u2019s daughters was given one and she said, \u2018Oh God, not another book about amazing women.\u2019\u201d She laughs, we say goodbye, and she heads off to think about playing another one. A Private War is in cinemas from 15 February. A special screening followed by a Q&amp;A with Rosamund Pike, Jamie Dornan, Paul Conroy and Matt Heineman will be broadcast live to cinemas on 4 February (aprivatewar.film).

      "body": "<p>The sun-drenched beaches of Exuma gleamed as brightly as the skin of the world-famous supermodels stretched out on yachts or dancing around flickering fires in the promotional video for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/28/bahamas-drama-luxury-fyre-festival-turns-into-chaos\" title=\"\">Fyre</a>, the glamorous music festival turned shambles turned scam that became the subject of the Netflix documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\" title=\"\">Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened</a></em>.</p> <p>The likes of Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski, all of whom have significant followings on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> and other social networks, were co-opted by the festival organiser Billy McFarland \u2013 now serving six years in prison for fraud \u2013 into posting plain orange squares to Instagram in a campaign to build anticipation for the festival, which it was promised would be held in the Bahamas in 2017.</p> <p>The models were just a handful of several hundred social media influencers \u2013 people with clout on apps like Instagram, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" title=\"\">Snapchat</a> \u2013 who helped promote the campaign into the news feeds of users, who paid thousands of dollars for tickets, turned up expecting gourmet food, luxury accommodation and A-list headliners but found emergency tents, cheese rolls and squalor instead.</p> <p>Tellingly, many of the influencers \u2013 whose posts were made in exchange for cash or tickets to the aborted event \u2013 failed to declare their connection with the organisers as required by the marketing rules governing social media. Few used the necessary \u201c#ad\u201d hashtag and those who did often tried to bury it beneath a mountain of other hashtags in the hope that it would slip through unnoticed.</p> <p>Not surprisingly the Fyre scandal has put \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d firmly in the spotlight. The economics behind influencer marketing and so-called \u201csponcon\u201d (sponsored content) are simple. A business \u2013 for example, a cosmetics manufacturer \u2013 approaches a social media influencer with a large following, either directly or through intermediaries set up to broker \u201cbrand deals\u201d. There\u2019s big money involved: Kendall Jenner\u2019s Fyre endorsement was reported to have netted her $250,000. But even smaller influencers can make a living from deals. Brands offer money or gifts in kind for the influencers to mention their products in posts or display them to followers. It\u2019s an unfiltered, largely unregulated space, and better yet, it\u2019s used by a young demographic with plenty of disposable income.</p> <p>Legally, influencers are meant to declare that this is a business transaction \u2013 either by including the hashtag #ad in a prominent position, or by using a tag specially created by Instagram which labels the post as paid partnership, and mentions the brand below the influencer\u2019s username. In practice, few do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5456822459298a2aa90ac5a12b1864c9569bd59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5456822459298a2aa90ac5a12b1864c9569bd59/0_0_2048_2047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The food on offer at Fyre festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The food on offer at Fyre festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And to date, social networks like Instagram haven\u2019t been too bothered. \u201cHaving posts with large text around it or different images that label it as branded makes for a very different user experience \u2013 and their cachet is based around user experience,\u201d says Mariann Hardey, a Durham University assistant professor in marketing, and sceptical as to the power of legislation. \u201cAny level of regulation and legislation has to respond to international law, which is very difficult to do.\u201d</p> <p>But things are changing, following the events of recent weeks. First the Netflix documentary about the Fyre festival associated the practice with charlatanism; then the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/celebrities-pledge-to-clean-up-their-act-on-social-media\" title=\"\">Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced</a> it had brought 16 celebrities, including Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and Alexa Chung, to heel for failing to disclose payments or gifts in exchange for mentioning products and companies on social media.</p> <p>But getting the agreement of 16 people to police themselves is a tiny advance. The influencer marketing industry is estimated to be worth $6.5bn this year, according to analysts <a href=\"https://neoreach.com/\" title=\"\">NeoReach</a>. People with just a few hundred followers can command (small) fees for mentioning products. There are hundreds of thousands of influencers worldwide. With this volume of content, as we\u2019ve seen in other areas of social media, self-regulation may prove futile.</p> <p>However, some follow the rules. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mat_buckets/\" title=\"\">Matthew Spade</a> has nearly 50,000 followers on Instagram who lap up his carefully curated images of men\u2019s fashion and lifestyle. He averages around two or three paid partnerships every month \u2013 and posts every day or two. When I speak to him on the day of the CMA\u2019s announcement, he is surprised. \u201cI thought we\u2019d all been doing this for ages,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere\u2019s the credit for the people who have been doing it right?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0fc0fb3ef4e134c8bc5d2f1811854f7f040ab55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0fc0fb3ef4e134c8bc5d2f1811854f7f040ab55/0_20_5400_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fyre festival\u2019s Billy McFarland leaves court last March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fyre festival\u2019s Billy McFarland leaves court last March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spade doesn\u2019t understand why influencers would try to hide any transactions in exchange for posts. \u201cPeople owe it to their audience to be as transparent as possible, and it makes for an easier relationship with your audience if everything is laid out on the table,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There\u2019s a transatlantic divide in attitudes to disclosure of payment or gifts, says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livvyallan\" title=\"\">Olivia Allan</a>, an influencer talent agent who formerly worked at <a href=\"https://www.socialcircle.media//\" title=\"\">Social Circle</a>, a company based in east London that brokers deals between brands and social media celebrities. \u201cThe current legislation in place in the UK is much stricter with influencer marketing than other forms of marketing because it\u2019s such a new thing,\u201d she explains. \u201cUK influencers are overly cautious now.\u201d However in the US attitudes are different. \u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I work really closely with US talent agents and say: \u2018Make sure you put #ad\u2019, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh no, we don\u2019t do that here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Allan is uncertain whether US influencers feel less of an obligation to be properly open about advertising because the size of the market in America makes it much harder to track down, or because audiences are more tolerant of being sold to by stealth. But it happens \u2013 and particularly among bigger influencers. \u201cYou see it with the Kardashians and flat tummy teas\u201d \u2013 a campaign where the reality TV stars and Instagram celebrities shilled the ability of a cup of tea to shed inches from your waistline. (Anyone who\u2019s walked down a British high street knows that can\u2019t be correct.)</p> <p>Even in the UK, there\u2019s a gulf in how seriously people take the rules depending on whether it\u2019s their sole income or not. \u201cNot to single out anyone by name, but if you go to the social media profiles of some of the world\u2019s largest footballers, you can see they don\u2019t put any paid partnership disclaimers or any #ad mentions,\u201d says <a href=\"http://benwjeffries.com/\" title=\"\">Ben Jeffries</a> of <a href=\"https://influencer.uk/\" title=\"\">Influencer</a>, an influencer marketing platform he set up with big YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaUVu8vYss8zCaC0WuA9jA\" title=\"\">Caspar Lee</a>. Any potential fine from the CMA or Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is likely to look like little more than a rounding-down error in a footballer\u2019s paycheck.</p> <p>Z-list reality TV celebs are another thorn in the side of influencer marketers. \u201cPeople off <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em> or the <em>Made in Chelsea</em> girls aren\u2019t as strict with it because it\u2019s not their livelihood,\u201d says Allan. \u201cIf something goes wrong and they need to delete the post and give the money back, they\u2019ve still got a stream of income. They are the problematic ones.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the honest \u2018grammers and the self-regulation initiatives, the platform remains a wild west. Allan recently spoke with the director of a small brand making boxes full of influencers\u2019 favourite products, which they could then sell to their fans. The brand and influencer would split the income from sales. Allan warned her that she could fall foul of ASA rules on influencer marketing. The director claimed she wouldn\u2019t be culpable as it was a collaboration. \u201cShe said: \u2018What can they do?\u2019\u201d Allan recalls. \u201cI was like: \u2018They\u2019ll send you a stern email. They can file a report and put your name on a website \u2013 but do people really check the ASA website before working with bloggers?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The director\u2019s response was blunt. \u201cShe was literally like: \u2018Unless they can put me in prison, I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an open secret that many companies try to dissuade influencers from mentioning that a post is an ad out of fear that fewer people will engage with it. <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/2018/11/14/influencer-marketing-partnerships/\" title=\"\">When surveyed last year</a>, a third of brands admitted they don\u2019t disclose paid partnerships with influencers.</p> <p>Influencers like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amelialiana/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Amelia Liana</a>, a lifestyle Instagrammer with more than 500,000 followers, have been asked to drop the #ad from their sponsored posts \u2013 but she always says no. \u201cNo one wins if the advert isn\u2019t declared properly,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile the brand and I can get into trouble, my audience are very switched on and would know instantly.

      "bodyText": "The sun-drenched beaches of Exuma gleamed as brightly as the skin of the world-famous supermodels stretched out on yachts or dancing around flickering fires in the promotional video for Fyre, the glamorous music festival turned shambles turned scam that became the subject of the Netflix documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened. The likes of Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski, all of whom have significant followings on Instagram and other social networks, were co-opted by the festival organiser Billy McFarland \u2013 now serving six years in prison for fraud \u2013 into posting plain orange squares to Instagram in a campaign to build anticipation for the festival, which it was promised would be held in the Bahamas in 2017. The models were just a handful of several hundred social media influencers \u2013 people with clout on apps like Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat \u2013 who helped promote the campaign into the news feeds of users, who paid thousands of dollars for tickets, turned up expecting gourmet food, luxury accommodation and A-list headliners but found emergency tents, cheese rolls and squalor instead. Tellingly, many of the influencers \u2013 whose posts were made in exchange for cash or tickets to the aborted event \u2013 failed to declare their connection with the organisers as required by the marketing rules governing social media. Few used the necessary \u201c#ad\u201d hashtag and those who did often tried to bury it beneath a mountain of other hashtags in the hope that it would slip through unnoticed. Not surprisingly the Fyre scandal has put \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d firmly in the spotlight. The economics behind influencer marketing and so-called \u201csponcon\u201d (sponsored content) are simple. A business \u2013 for example, a cosmetics manufacturer \u2013 approaches a social media influencer with a large following, either directly or through intermediaries set up to broker \u201cbrand deals\u201d. There\u2019s big money involved: Kendall Jenner\u2019s Fyre endorsement was reported to have netted her $250,000. But even smaller influencers can make a living from deals. Brands offer money or gifts in kind for the influencers to mention their products in posts or display them to followers. It\u2019s an unfiltered, largely unregulated space, and better yet, it\u2019s used by a young demographic with plenty of disposable income. Legally, influencers are meant to declare that this is a business transaction \u2013 either by including the hashtag #ad in a prominent position, or by using a tag specially created by Instagram which labels the post as paid partnership, and mentions the brand below the influencer\u2019s username. In practice, few do. And to date, social networks like Instagram haven\u2019t been too bothered. \u201cHaving posts with large text around it or different images that label it as branded makes for a very different user experience \u2013 and their cachet is based around user experience,\u201d says Mariann Hardey, a Durham University assistant professor in marketing, and sceptical as to the power of legislation. \u201cAny level of regulation and legislation has to respond to international law, which is very difficult to do.\u201d But things are changing, following the events of recent weeks. First the Netflix documentary about the Fyre festival associated the practice with charlatanism; then the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it had brought 16 celebrities, including Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and Alexa Chung, to heel for failing to disclose payments or gifts in exchange for mentioning products and companies on social media. But getting the agreement of 16 people to police themselves is a tiny advance. The influencer marketing industry is estimated to be worth $6.5bn this year, according to analysts NeoReach. People with just a few hundred followers can command (small) fees for mentioning products. There are hundreds of thousands of influencers worldwide. With this volume of content, as we\u2019ve seen in other areas of social media, self-regulation may prove futile. However, some follow the rules. Matthew Spade has nearly 50,000 followers on Instagram who lap up his carefully curated images of men\u2019s fashion and lifestyle. He averages around two or three paid partnerships every month \u2013 and posts every day or two. When I speak to him on the day of the CMA\u2019s announcement, he is surprised. \u201cI thought we\u2019d all been doing this for ages,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere\u2019s the credit for the people who have been doing it right?\u201d Spade doesn\u2019t understand why influencers would try to hide any transactions in exchange for posts. \u201cPeople owe it to their audience to be as transparent as possible, and it makes for an easier relationship with your audience if everything is laid out on the table,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a transatlantic divide in attitudes to disclosure of payment or gifts, says Olivia Allan, an influencer talent agent who formerly worked at Social Circle, a company based in east London that brokers deals between brands and social media celebrities. \u201cThe current legislation in place in the UK is much stricter with influencer marketing than other forms of marketing because it\u2019s such a new thing,\u201d she explains. \u201cUK influencers are overly cautious now.\u201d However in the US attitudes are different. \u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I work really closely with US talent agents and say: \u2018Make sure you put #ad\u2019, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh no, we don\u2019t do that here.\u2019\u201d Allan is uncertain whether US influencers feel less of an obligation to be properly open about advertising because the size of the market in America makes it much harder to track down, or because audiences are more tolerant of being sold to by stealth. But it happens \u2013 and particularly among bigger influencers. \u201cYou see it with the Kardashians and flat tummy teas\u201d \u2013 a campaign where the reality TV stars and Instagram celebrities shilled the ability of a cup of tea to shed inches from your waistline. (Anyone who\u2019s walked down a British high street knows that can\u2019t be correct.) Even in the UK, there\u2019s a gulf in how seriously people take the rules depending on whether it\u2019s their sole income or not. \u201cNot to single out anyone by name, but if you go to the social media profiles of some of the world\u2019s largest footballers, you can see they don\u2019t put any paid partnership disclaimers or any #ad mentions,\u201d says Ben Jeffries of Influencer, an influencer marketing platform he set up with big YouTuber Caspar Lee. Any potential fine from the CMA or Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is likely to look like little more than a rounding-down error in a footballer\u2019s paycheck. Z-list reality TV celebs are another thorn in the side of influencer marketers. \u201cPeople off Love Island or the Made in Chelsea girls aren\u2019t as strict with it because it\u2019s not their livelihood,\u201d says Allan. \u201cIf something goes wrong and they need to delete the post and give the money back, they\u2019ve still got a stream of income. They are the problematic ones.\u201d Despite the honest \u2018grammers and the self-regulation initiatives, the platform remains a wild west.

When surveyed last year, a third of brands admitted they don\u2019t disclose paid partnerships with influencers. Influencers like Amelia Liana, a lifestyle Instagrammer with more than 500,000 followers, have been asked to drop the #ad from their sponsored posts \u2013 but she always says no. \u201cNo one wins if the advert isn\u2019t declared properly,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile the brand and I can get into trouble, my audience are very switched on and would know instantly.

A separate survey of 4,000 consumers in the UK, France and Germany, commissioned by the marketing firm Bazaarvoice, last year found that nearly half are \u201cfatigued\u201d by the bombardment of ads on social networks. \u201cI guess some brands may think it looks a bit crass,\u201d says Spade.

While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit, Sir Oliver confessed that he was \u201cpast caring what deal we have\u201d and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next. He would do so, the former cabinet minister explained, because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad, \u201cmy party will not be forgiven for many years\u201d.</p> <p>Were I a Tory, I\u2019d pay attention to that warning. Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters. He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the 1980s. Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party.</p> <p>The poll tax will look like a mild kerfuffle if Britain exits the EU without an agreement or a transition period and the result is widespread and severe havoc to some of the most basic aspects of everyday life. More klaxons have sounded in the past few days, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/28/no-deal-brexit-price-rises-retailers-sainsburys-asda-ms-coop\" title=\"\">warnings from supermarkets</a> that some of their shelves will be empty. If we tumble over the cliff edge without a parachute, opinions differ about whether it would be merely calamitous or utterly catastrophic.</p> <p>No one can be entirely sure. One of the issues with a no-deal scenario is the difficulty of making accurate predictions about what will follow the stark termination of decades of trading and legal agreements, and the overnight shredding of many thousands of intricate and vital arrangements. Because there is no precedent for such an event happening to a country as advanced and complex as Britain, everyone is having to guess.

      "bodyText": "One of the better, because more honest, speeches delivered during parliament\u2019s most recent Brexit debate came from Oliver Letwin. While other Tories carried on fantasising and wrangling about what they would or would not permit, Sir Oliver confessed that he was \u201cpast caring what deal we have\u201d and would support whatever Mrs May comes up with next. He would do so, the former cabinet minister explained, because if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal and the consequences are bad, \u201cmy party will not be forgiven for many years\u201d. Were I a Tory, I\u2019d pay attention to that warning. Sir Oliver speaks with experience of what follows when politicians wilfully inflict abominations on their voters. He was one of the architects of the poll tax in the 1980s. Some readers may need reminding that this reckless experiment in changing local taxation without thinking through the consequences led to rioting in Trafalgar Square and the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher at the hands of her own party. The poll tax will look like a mild kerfuffle if Britain exits the EU without an agreement or a transition period and the result is widespread and severe havoc to some of the most basic aspects of everyday life. More klaxons have sounded in the past few days, including warnings from supermarkets that some of their shelves will be empty. If we tumble over the cliff edge without a parachute, opinions differ about whether it would be merely calamitous or utterly catastrophic. No one can be entirely sure. One of the issues with a no-deal scenario is the difficulty of making accurate predictions about what will follow the stark termination of decades of trading and legal agreements, and the overnight shredding of many thousands of intricate and vital arrangements. Because there is no precedent for such an event happening to a country as advanced and complex as Britain, everyone is having to guess. Some of the hazards of a no deal might transpire to be less terrible than forecast. Unforeseen perils, for which there has been no preparation at all, would likely materialise. Documents prepared for Operation Yellowhammer, the government\u2019s no-deal contingency planning, coyly refer to \u201cunanticipated impacts\u201d.

      "body": "<p>If, according to an ancient Chinese proverb, \u201ca crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind\u201d, then Huawei is barrelling in on a storm force 12. Where the hurricane takes it, though, may be out of the telecoms giant\u2019s control.</p> <p>A slew of bombshell allegations have raised troubling questions about the telecoms company\u2019s probity and revived long-held concerns about its relationship with China\u2019s intelligence services. The UK, in need of friends as Brexit looms, is struggling to negotiate the fallout. To ignore the mounting brouhaha risks alienating its closest ally, the United States, currently locked in a bitter trade war with China which has become synonymous with Huawei. But the UK needs Chinese technology to keep pace with the 21st century.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK, like much of the west, struggles to know whether to see China as threat or opportunity,\u201d said Robert Hannigan, former director of the British intelligence centre\u2019s GCHQ and now European chairman of the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balance. My view is that we want the benefits of Chinese technology and inward investment and we should find ways of managing the risks, pushing back where necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Last Monday <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-charged\" title=\"\">a 13-count indictment unsealed in a New York court,</a> charging Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with Iranian sanctions-busting \u2013 charges rejected by the company \u2013 made the balancing act that bit more difficult. A second indictment, unveiled the same day, alleged<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"> that the firm tried to steal technology from</a> mobile operator T-Mobile US. Huawei insists the matter has been settled.</p> <p>It was just another bad week for a company that is making a habit of garnering negative headlines. Not a week goes by without a UK politician taking aim. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Huawei in December. Last week Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee, claimed: \u201cDay by day we see more evidence that Chinese companies like Huawei are breaking all the rules and undermining British security.\u201d In December a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for China, a dramatic development that the company insisted had nothing to do with its operations, a rebuttal that did little to convince sceptics who view it as an appendage of China\u2019s Communist party (CCP).</p> <p>While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (\u201cwe\u2019re the John Lewis of China,\u201d one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party\u2019s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. \u201cThere are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it\u2019s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies\u2019 international aspirations.\u201d</p> <p>For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. \u201cImagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed.</p> <p>\u201cHuawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b865cacccbb6259b146e66c178ca26f37692ca69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b865cacccbb6259b146e66c178ca26f37692ca69/0_0_5000_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou faces a 13-count indictment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darryl Dyck/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government\u2019s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government\u2019s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president.</p> <p>In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company\u2019s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall.</p> <p>But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei\u2019s activities, UK operator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/05/bt-removing-huawei-equipment-from-parts-of-4g-network\" title=\"\">BT has announced that it will remove Huawei\u2019s technology</a> from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment \u2013 the technology that will connect \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2013 to Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don\u2019t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/17/oxford-places-ban-on-donations-and-research-grants-from-huawei-chinese-national-security\" title=\"\">Oxford University</a> and the Prince\u2019s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions.</p> <p>More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The <em>Observer </em>understands a report to be presented to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei\u2019s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company\u2019s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China.</p> <p>In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration\u2019s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. \u201cEach week there\u2019s a new hit,\u201d one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.\u201d</p> <p>As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng\u2019s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/china-sentences-canadian-man-death-drug-charges-robert-lloyd-schellenberg\" title=\"\">sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg</a>, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of \u201carbitrarily\u201d applying the death sentence.</p> <p>In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng\u2019s father, the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was \u201cnot related to Huawei in any way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,\u201d said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the <em>Observer.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90bda1ce6b44980b7ac7a4dc45fa3c1840123cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90bda1ce6b44980b7ac7a4dc45fa3c1840123cb3/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese president Xi Jinping and president Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese president Xi Jinping and president Donald Trump. The US and China are locked in a bitter trade war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (\u00a310bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei\u2019s activities has sucked in each of the UK\u2019s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u201d spying alliance \u2013 the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China.</p> <p>The dividends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003.</p> <p>More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some \u00a33bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London.</p> <p>Two of the City\u2019s most recognisable buildings, the 224m \u201cCheesegrater\u201d and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP.</p> <p>These projects pale into insignificance compared with the \u00a320bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Somerset that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China\u2019s General Nuclear Power Group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Huawei\u2019s cyber-security approach fell short but no hostile Chinese state activity was uncovered</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Hannigan, ex-GCHQ</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But some experts question where this relationship will end. \u201cMy fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the \u2018golden era\u2019 policy with China,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cThis policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK\u2019s energy strategy and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed.

Under article 7 of China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence law, companies like Huawei are legally obliged to help the Chinese intelligence agencies upon request.

      "bodyText": "If, according to an ancient Chinese proverb, \u201ca crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind\u201d, then Huawei is barrelling in on a storm force 12. Where the hurricane takes it, though, may be out of the telecoms giant\u2019s control. A slew of bombshell allegations have raised troubling questions about the telecoms company\u2019s probity and revived long-held concerns about its relationship with China\u2019s intelligence services. The UK, in need of friends as Brexit looms, is struggling to negotiate the fallout. To ignore the mounting brouhaha risks alienating its closest ally, the United States, currently locked in a bitter trade war with China which has become synonymous with Huawei. But the UK needs Chinese technology to keep pace with the 21st century. \u201cThe UK, like much of the west, struggles to know whether to see China as threat or opportunity,\u201d said Robert Hannigan, former director of the British intelligence centre\u2019s GCHQ and now European chairman of the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balance. My view is that we want the benefits of Chinese technology and inward investment and we should find ways of managing the risks, pushing back where necessary.\u201d Last Monday a 13-count indictment unsealed in a New York court, charging Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with Iranian sanctions-busting \u2013 charges rejected by the company \u2013 made the balancing act that bit more difficult. A second indictment, unveiled the same day, alleged that the firm tried to steal technology from mobile operator T-Mobile US. Huawei insists the matter has been settled. It was just another bad week for a company that is making a habit of garnering negative headlines. Not a week goes by without a UK politician taking aim. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Huawei in December. Last week Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee, claimed: \u201cDay by day we see more evidence that Chinese companies like Huawei are breaking all the rules and undermining British security.\u201d In December a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for China, a dramatic development that the company insisted had nothing to do with its operations, a rebuttal that did little to convince sceptics who view it as an appendage of China\u2019s Communist party (CCP). While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (\u201cwe\u2019re the John Lewis of China,\u201d one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party\u2019s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. \u201cThere are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it\u2019s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies\u2019 international aspirations.\u201d For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. \u201cImagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed. \u201cHuawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.\u201d In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government\u2019s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government\u2019s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president. In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company\u2019s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall. But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei\u2019s activities, UK operator BT has announced that it will remove Huawei\u2019s technology from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment \u2013 the technology that will connect \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2013 to Australia and New Zealand. Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don\u2019t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. Oxford University and the Prince\u2019s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions. More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The Observer understands a report to be presented to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei\u2019s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company\u2019s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China. In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration\u2019s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G. Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. \u201cEach week there\u2019s a new hit,\u201d one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.\u201d As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng\u2019s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of \u201carbitrarily\u201d applying the death sentence. In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng\u2019s father, the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was \u201cnot related to Huawei in any way\u201d. \u201cWe are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,\u201d said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the Observer. Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (\u00a310bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei\u2019s activities has sucked in each of the UK\u2019s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u201d spying alliance \u2013 the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China. The dividends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003. More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some \u00a33bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London. Two of the City\u2019s most recognisable buildings, the 224m \u201cCheesegrater\u201d and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP. These projects pale into insignificance compared with the \u00a320bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Somerset that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China\u2019s General Nuclear Power Group. But some experts question where this relationship will end. \u201cMy fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the \u2018golden era\u2019 policy with China,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cThis policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK\u2019s energy strategy and beyond.\u201d The UK\u2019s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed.

Staffed by 35 heavily vetted analysts, the centre flags security issues arising from Huawei\u2019s activities to government. A report issued by the centre\u2019s oversight board last July raised serious concerns about the poor quality of Huawei\u2019s security engineering. As a result, the board conceded that it could provide only \u201climited assurance\u201d that any risks to UK national security from Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s critical networks had been sufficiently mitigated. Another report from the board, to be published this spring, is expected to raise similar concerns, giving more ammunition to Huawei\u2019s critics, the Observer understands.

We will never harm any nation or any individual.\u201d The extraordinary level to which the UK has gone to accommodate a company regularly accused of spying for a foreign state says much about where the shifting balance of power now lies in the world. In the era of \u201ctechno-nationalism\u201d, countries that innovate dominate. Last year the broadband comparison website, Cable, published an annual league table revealing that the UK had the 35th fastest broadband in the world, a slip of four places since 2017, one that put it behind almost all other EU member states and Madagascar, one of the least developed nations in the world, according to the UN. Huawei knows it is one of the very few companies that can drag the UK up the table. \u201cHuawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology,\u201d Ren said. \u201cWith that capability, our 5G base stations don\u2019t even need fibre connections. Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense.\u201d For economic, read cheap. To switch to an alternative supplier, such as Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, would be hugely costly, Whitehall mandarins concede. Inevitably, the significantly higher prices would be passed on to consumers.

The lyrics are searingly honest and assured \u2013 whether he\u2019s talking angrily about so-called friends who didn\u2019t visit him in jail, expressing a sweet gratitude to his mother for dealing with him being \u201ca bad kid\u201d, or rolling his eyes about a schoolteacher who used to give him grief. Third Avenue finds an artist at ease with himself, and at ease with addressing his demons. The genre-melding production is perhaps more old school than his peers, and at times can feel a little clunky \u2013 but ultimately it adds to a sense that Fredo\u2019s not here to hop on a trend. This is an accomplished full-length that, while not a game-changer, certainly slots neatly into the burgeoning UK canon.",

      "bodyText": "The systems that enforce British consumers\u2019 rights need to be overhauled and a number of new bodies and measures put in place to ensure the public is properly protected at a time when funding has been cut, according to a significant new report. The government is being urged to take the pressure off local authorities, which are administering consumer complaints through trading standards offices, and instead bring in national bodies to deal with problems. The consumer group Which? has detailed how the current enforcement systems to protect consumer confidence are no longer fit for purpose, even though the UK has \u201cone of the strongest consumer rights frameworks in the world\u201d. And the existing infrastructure looks set to come under further strain as the deadline for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union comes ever closer, it says. In December, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) \u2013 the national competition watchdog \u2013 warned that it would not be able to undertake some of its key functions if Britain crashes out with no deal at the end of March. The Which? report details a series of measures the consumer organisation wants to see taken in order to ensure protection is maintained at a time of tightening budgets and political overhaul: \u2022 The creation of a national body called the Consumer and Competition Authority, under the CMA, which would spearhead the enforcement of consumer rights. \u2022 A transparent and independent consumer product safety body. \u2022 Funding to local authorities through these central bodies. \u2022 Powers for the enforcement bodies to impose fines. \u2022 The facility for the UK to be linked to EU networks and intelligence-sharing systems post-Brexit. \u201cThe enforcement system that makes sure that people can have confidence that businesses are complying, and that they can take some action, has been under strain for a number of years,\u201d says Sue Davies, strategic policy partner at Which?. \u201cWe are concerned that it is not fit to deal with the current way that people are buying, and the way that marketplaces work, but also with some of the potential challenges that might come in the future.\u201d Figures compiled from 2015 put the loss to the consumer through scams and via e-commerce problems at just under \u00a315bn while consumers spent 1.2bn hours trying to resolve the issues. However, problems are often addressed by local authorities via trading standards offices even if an issue is of national concern. At the same time, these services have had funding cut by more than 50% over the last seven years. Davies highlights how the trading standards arm of Peterborough city council has been dealing with the alert surrounding an estimated 5.3 million faulty dryers made by Whirlpool brands Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda, simply because Whirlpool\u2019s UK head office is located there.

Viola was in Italy back then working in a studio patronised by some of the pioneers of video art \u2013 including Nam June Paik and Bruce Nauman \u2013 but he was also encountering for the first time the work of Renaissance painters face-to-face in the city\u2019s churches, an experience that he later described as something like \u201ctotal immersion\u201d for him.</p> <p>Along the way the two experiences \u2013 fresco and video, altarpiece and flatscreen \u2013 seemed to have fused in his imagination. Viola saw the possibility of recreating those 500-year-old visions of eternal truths for a contemporary audience \u2013 not in marble or paint or charcoal, but on screen. Since then, not a man to duck a challenge, he has foregrounded an ongoing dialogue with Florentine masters. <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/bill-viola-michelangelo\" title=\"\">This exhibition</a> \u2013 12 of Viola\u2019s video installations, 15 works by Michelangelo \u2013 arises out of the American seeing the collection of the Italian\u2019s drawings at Windsor Castle in 2006.</p> <p>Viola\u2019s screens invariably involve a challenge to the viewer. You may flock to see images of annunciations and resurrections from five centuries ago, they declare, and find yourselves awed by those profound mysteries painted large on walls and ceilings, so why not in our present moment? That challenge seems somehow a distinctly American question. It begs for the kind of heightened emotions that might be expected when, for example, you ascend to the no-expense-spared heights of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and discover there is no small-scale irony to orient yourself by.</p> <p>The most spectacular, and representative, of Viola\u2019s films here, <em>Tristan\u2019s Ascension (The Sound of a Mountain Under a Waterfall), </em>gives you a sense of what you are in for. It starts, typically, with a man in a white gown on a marble slab under a shower, which becomes a cataract as he slowly ascends, counterintuitively and presumably triumphantly, through water and darkness. If you are not sufficiently awed by the vision, be prepared to be nudged into the appropriate mood by signs on the RA walls that attest to the artist\u2019s \u201cdeep preoccupations with the nature of the human soul\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1943bd1a09f16bc13a20a3505abd99266f873bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1943bd1a09f16bc13a20a3505abd99266f873bb/0_0_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Virgin and Child With the Infant St John the Baptist (the Taddei Tondo), c1504-5 by Michelangelo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Virgin and Child With the Infant St John the Baptist (the Taddei Tondo), c1504-5 by Michelangelo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Royal Academy of Arts, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those preoccupations get their most troubling examination in a room in which Viola\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/viola-nantes-triptych-t06854\" title=\"\">Nantes Triptych</a></em> faces off against the <em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/how-to-read-it-michelangelo-taddei-tondo\" title=\"\">Taddei Tondo</a></em>, that crowning glory of the Royal Academy\u2019s permanent collection. Michelangelo\u2019s circular marble depicts in relief the infant Christ shying away from the proffered hand of his playmate, John the Baptist, which holds a flapping songbird. Historians have suggested the bird to be a goldfinch \u2013 the same bird that was said to have removed a thorn from Christ\u2019s head on the road to Calvary \u2013 and that his gesture of fear, his instinct to lie across his mother\u2019s lap, contains in its outline a premonition of his death and the deposition from the cross.</p> <p>Viola takes this triangular drama of death in life and glosses it over three screens on the wall opposite.

      "bodyText": "Ever since Bill Viola first pitched up in Florence as a 23-year-old film technician in 1974, there has been a certain inevitability that 45 years on he would end up here, sharing a mostly hushed and dimly lit Royal Academy with Michelangelo. Viola was in Italy back then working in a studio patronised by some of the pioneers of video art \u2013 including Nam June Paik and Bruce Nauman \u2013 but he was also encountering for the first time the work of Renaissance painters face-to-face in the city\u2019s churches, an experience that he later described as something like \u201ctotal immersion\u201d for him. Along the way the two experiences \u2013 fresco and video, altarpiece and flatscreen \u2013 seemed to have fused in his imagination. Viola saw the possibility of recreating those 500-year-old visions of eternal truths for a contemporary audience \u2013 not in marble or paint or charcoal, but on screen. Since then, not a man to duck a challenge, he has foregrounded an ongoing dialogue with Florentine masters. This exhibition \u2013 12 of Viola\u2019s video installations, 15 works by Michelangelo \u2013 arises out of the American seeing the collection of the Italian\u2019s drawings at Windsor Castle in 2006. Viola\u2019s screens invariably involve a challenge to the viewer. You may flock to see images of annunciations and resurrections from five centuries ago, they declare, and find yourselves awed by those profound mysteries painted large on walls and ceilings, so why not in our present moment? That challenge seems somehow a distinctly American question. It begs for the kind of heightened emotions that might be expected when, for example, you ascend to the no-expense-spared heights of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and discover there is no small-scale irony to orient yourself by. The most spectacular, and representative, of Viola\u2019s films here, Tristan\u2019s Ascension (The Sound of a Mountain Under a Waterfall), gives you a sense of what you are in for. It starts, typically, with a man in a white gown on a marble slab under a shower, which becomes a cataract as he slowly ascends, counterintuitively and presumably triumphantly, through water and darkness. If you are not sufficiently awed by the vision, be prepared to be nudged into the appropriate mood by signs on the RA walls that attest to the artist\u2019s \u201cdeep preoccupations with the nature of the human soul\u201d. Those preoccupations get their most troubling examination in a room in which Viola\u2019s Nantes Triptych faces off against the Taddei Tondo, that crowning glory of the Royal Academy\u2019s permanent collection. Michelangelo\u2019s circular marble depicts in relief the infant Christ shying away from the proffered hand of his playmate, John the Baptist, which holds a flapping songbird. Historians have suggested the bird to be a goldfinch \u2013 the same bird that was said to have removed a thorn from Christ\u2019s head on the road to Calvary \u2013 and that his gesture of fear, his instinct to lie across his mother\u2019s lap, contains in its outline a premonition of his death and the deposition from the cross. Viola takes this triangular drama of death in life and glosses it over three screens on the wall opposite. On the left a woman kneels, cradled by her lavishly moustached husband, panting in the later stages of labour, her face in closeup seized by contractions, before eventually cradling a child. In the middle a man is captured in one of Viola\u2019s trademark flotation tanks, treading water, clothes hanging loose about him. And in the third we are focused on the sunken face of a woman (the artist\u2019s mother) struggling with her dying breaths on a hospital bed, the oxygen tube like an umbilical cord. The first and last of the films, privately poignant, are made voyeuristic by having them perform as symbols in this clunky narrative. The central panel is the most revealing of Viola\u2019s abiding difficulty, however. When faced with the challenge of depicting life \u2013 that invariably fascinating state between the birth and death \u2013 he finds himself never able to offer much more than images of suspended animation. In the Taddei Tondo, the fragment of believable experience involving the infants and the captive bird, Michelangelo captured in stone something both fleetingly human and irresistibly alive. If life only involves holding one\u2019s breath under water \u2013 as we are invited to imagine of the central figure in Viola\u2019s Triptych, or, for that matter, the eight fully-clothed \u201cDreamers\u201d submerged on film in another in another room \u2013 death quickly comes to seem quite a welcome release.

Racing, he suggests, will be held in breach of the licence conditions and suffer the consequences if it does not adapt to changing attitudes to animal welfare concerns in the wider population.</p> <p>Rust spoke about the idea at some length last month when the BHA published the findings of a review commissioned after seven horses died as a result of injuries sustained at last year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival. \u201cWe have a social licence for our sport,\u201d Rust said. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply rely on the fact that racing takes place around the world and we run a similar sport here. We have to consider the social licence here at home in Great Britain. The younger generation and others are looking to us. Our sport is certainly not any form of busted flush in that regard [welfare], we have a decent record, but we must go further and faster and drive standards ever higher, such that the balance of the British public accepts British racing and retains our social licence to continue.\u201d</p> <p>It is an interesting idea and there is doubtless some truth in it, though it could be argued that in an increasingly urbanised society, the \u201cbalance of the British public\u201d is unlikely to give horse racing a second thought from one year (or Grand National) to the next. In recent years, meanwhile, the most flagrant breach of the social licence was committed by racing\u2019s partners in the betting industry, when they turned high-street betting shops into FOBT \u2013 or fixed odds betting terminals \u2013 casinos, offering roulette at \u00a3100 a spin. Rust, as it happens, was a senior executive at Coral and Ladbrokes at the height of the FOBT boom, at a time when racing seemed more interested in media rights payments from expanding betting-shop chains than the social ills that followed.</p> <p>The problem, of course, with the idea of a social licence is that its terms are not written down and open to interpretation as a result. At present, the BHA seems to be living in fear of breaching its conditions, leading in turn to an unnecessarily defensive approach to issues on which the sport has very little to be ashamed about. Last week\u2019s figures for fatal injuries on the track are a case in point. At first sight, it is true: a rise from 167 fatalities in 2017 to 202 in 2018 is a sudden, unexplained spike. But the five-year rolling average of 0.2% remains as low as at any point in the sport\u2019s long history. Put another way, since 2014 there has been one fatal injury to a horse for every 500 starts.</p> <p>The current five-year average is also down by almost a third from the rate of 0.27% at the turn of the century. This is not down to luck or variance, but instead the result of deliberate efforts by the regulator to reduce risks wherever possible, and no reason at all for racing to be on the defensive.</p> <p>Racing\u2019s most committed (and vocal) opponents may suggest that the racecourse is little more than a killing field, where a fatal injury is a matter of when rather than if, but the truth is that fatalities were extremely rare 20 years ago and even more unusual now. For other large, domesticated mammals such as beef cattle, the premature death rate is, and always will be, 100%.</p> <p>Thoroughbreds are born and bred to race and, without the racecourse and its very small but inescapable risk of injury, this extraordinary breed, with speed and strength that have been honed over centuries by generations of breeders, would soon be extinct. Having taken it upon ourselves to breed, train and race them, we clearly have a duty too to ensure that the number of horses suffering a fatal or long-term injury is kept to an absolute minimum. Some degree of risk, though, will always be inherent to the process of galloping a half-ton horse around a track and, frequently, over obstacles at speed, and we are at, or very close to, a point where further change \u2013 a cut in field sizes, say \u2013 would start to interfere with the essential fabric of the sport.</p> <p>Rust, like many racing professionals and fans, was taken aback by the hostility of several contributors to a parliamentary debate on racehorse protection in Westminster Hall last October. One \u2013 somewhat rhetorical \u2013 question in particular attracted much attention, when Luke Pollard MP, the Labour member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, asked: \u201cWhen will we get to 0.1%, by what date? What steps will be taken to get there? What happens if we do not get there? When will the target be zero?\u201d</p> <p>At the time, it struck me as astonishing that anyone with such an inadequate grasp of the concept of risk could possibly play a role in steering the country\u2019s future. In recent weeks, admittedly, it has seemed increasingly plausible, but that is no reason for racing, if or when it defends its record on welfare, to surrender to ignorance.</p>",

But the five-year rolling average of 0.2% remains as low as at any point in the sport\u2019s long history. Put another way, since 2014 there has been one fatal injury to a horse for every 500 starts. The current five-year average is also down by almost a third from the rate of 0.27% at the turn of the century. This is not down to luck or variance, but instead the result of deliberate efforts by the regulator to reduce risks wherever possible, and no reason at all for racing to be on the defensive. Racing\u2019s most committed (and vocal) opponents may suggest that the racecourse is little more than a killing field, where a fatal injury is a matter of when rather than if, but the truth is that fatalities were extremely rare 20 years ago and even more unusual now. For other large, domesticated mammals such as beef cattle, the premature death rate is, and always will be, 100%. Thoroughbreds are born and bred to race and, without the racecourse and its very small but inescapable risk of injury, this extraordinary breed, with speed and strength that have been honed over centuries by generations of breeders, would soon be extinct. Having taken it upon ourselves to breed, train and race them, we clearly have a duty too to ensure that the number of horses suffering a fatal or long-term injury is kept to an absolute minimum. Some degree of risk, though, will always be inherent to the process of galloping a half-ton horse around a track and, frequently, over obstacles at speed, and we are at, or very close to, a point where further change \u2013 a cut in field sizes, say \u2013 would start to interfere with the essential fabric of the sport. Rust, like many racing professionals and fans, was taken aback by the hostility of several contributors to a parliamentary debate on racehorse protection in Westminster Hall last October. One \u2013 somewhat rhetorical \u2013 question in particular attracted much attention, when Luke Pollard MP, the Labour member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, asked: \u201cWhen will we get to 0.1%, by what date? What steps will be taken to get there? What happens if we do not get there? When will the target be zero?\u201d At the time, it struck me as astonishing that anyone with such an inadequate grasp of the concept of risk could possibly play a role in steering the country\u2019s future. In recent weeks, admittedly, it has seemed increasingly plausible, but that is no reason for racing, if or when it defends its record on welfare, to surrender to ignorance.",

Their outstanding recent record against the league\u2019s mid-table filler suggests this is a distant prospect. The draw with Leicester was the first time Liverpool have dropped points against a team outside the top six since April.</p> <p>These are interesting times, though. The shift in early January into late midwinter has become a kind of division bell for the title race in recent seasons. It has been five years now since the last real umbrella-gnawing, down-to-the-wire finish. Since then, the decisive kick away from the pack has tended to arrive a little earlier, as fixtures pile up, injuries begin to bite or heal, and the midwinter-slog works its way into the bones.</p> <p>This time last year Manchester United lost to Tottenham and Newcastle as January melted into February, while ahead of them City won five out of six and turned what was already a title procession into a hand-waving title trot-past in full ceremonial gold-leaf carriage.</p> <p>The year before Tottenham dropped seven points while Chelsea just kept on storming on through as January melted into February. The season before that it was around the same time that Leicester began to find an unanswerable rhythm. With this in mind we are now entering what could be a key 10 days. Starting with Arsenal at homeon Sunday, Manchester City have three tough-to-middling league games in a week, with Everton away on Wednesday, and Chelsea\u2019s mannered and fretful Sarriball all-sorts at home next Sunday.</p> <p>Over the same period Liverpool play twice: West Ham away on Monday night, and then Bournemouth at home on Saturday. After which they have a two-week break in the league before trips to Old Trafford and Goodison at the start of March. Drop points now and those two fixtures start to look ominous, both of them against opponents who will be focused with a murderous eye on ripping a hole in that red-shirted pre-title triumphalism.</p> <p>Perhaps with this in mind Pep Guardiola, so used to storming away as a title frontrunner, has even made his first few rather gauche attempts at a little cross-Lancashire mental disintegration. \u201cAll the teams who want to win the title have to feel the pressure, but you have to handle it,\u201d Guardiola hammed in his Tuesday press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they will think. I\u2019m not in the locker room.\u201d</p> <p>While it seems unlikely J\u00fcrgen Klopp will find himself reduced to a state of quivering, tear-snorting Kevin Keegan-style meltdown at the force of these gentle little snipes, the timing of it is at least spot-on. For the teams at the top, this is the winter red zone. Best of all, this is a title two-hander that will come down to more than simply injury lists, luck and the form of key players. At stake for Guardiola and Klopp is something more, a systems-clash, a battle between pragmatism and perfectionism.</p> <p>If Liverpool have an advantage this season it is that Klopp has been able to change his team\u2019s rhythms, to play another way, to find other gears below the most extreme expression of his own gegenpressing, high-velocity attacking style.</p> <p>Through the first half of the season Liverpool found a low\u2011corrosion way to win. The formula was clear. With the defence strengthened Liverpool knew they would rarely concede. At the other end the movement and craft of Mohamed Salah is usually too much for most defences.</p> <p>From week to week, and the odd blip aside \u2013 we remember Klopp sprinting across the pitch at home to Everton like a man being chased by rabid huskies \u2013 they won with strength in reserve.</p> <p>What is fascinating is the way the past few weeks, as muscles have tightened, have seen a return to the Liverpool of last season, or at least to a less controlled style. Every goal since Boxing Day has come from the front three. Clean sheets and controlled 1-0s have been replaced by a slightly wilder approach to winning. This is a team fighting not just its rivals at the top of the league but a weight of history, a shared emotional longing.</p> <p>The battle for Liverpool from here might be to drop the throttle a little, to get back as far as possible to the calm, methodical pragmatism of the first half of the season even through the chills of a title-chasing February.</p> <p>Whereas for City and Guardiola it is the refusal to change, the insistence on simply playing the same way, running though the same distinct registers that has made their title chase so engrossing. Guardiola teams don\u2019t drop the throttle, don\u2019t win in other ways. They improve by becoming more themselves, become more efficient and nuanced. Even in defeat, as at Newcastle, it is that same recognisable Pep-ball.</p> <p>Hence this strange current run, whereby either the system clicks, the parts fall into place and City swipe opponents aside; or those rhythms can be disrupted, leaving the parts of the machine still running through the same patterns like a broken circuit board.</p> <p>There are some who might say Pep hasn\u2019t managed 99 Premier League games as City manager, but has instead managed the same game 99 times. This is both incorrect and beside the point. City have more ways of playing than simply classic short passing Pep\u2011ball, as did Barcelona and Bayern Munich before them. But there is something to be said for winning if not ugly, then without being forced to reach the higher registers, as Liverpool have done this season.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s ability to make his own very distinct kind of systems\u2011football work even in the mud and blood of a race to the line in Europe\u2019s noisiest league will be key to what happens from here.</p>",

This time last year Manchester United lost to Tottenham and Newcastle as January melted into February, while ahead of them City won five out of six and turned what was already a title procession into a hand-waving title trot-past in full ceremonial gold-leaf carriage. The year before Tottenham dropped seven points while Chelsea just kept on storming on through as January melted into February. The season before that it was around the same time that Leicester began to find an unanswerable rhythm. With this in mind we are now entering what could be a key 10 days. Starting with Arsenal at homeon Sunday, Manchester City have three tough-to-middling league games in a week, with Everton away on Wednesday, and Chelsea\u2019s mannered and fretful Sarriball all-sorts at home next Sunday. Over the same period Liverpool play twice: West Ham away on Monday night, and then Bournemouth at home on Saturday. After which they have a two-week break in the league before trips to Old Trafford and Goodison at the start of March. Drop points now and those two fixtures start to look ominous, both of them against opponents who will be focused with a murderous eye on ripping a hole in that red-shirted pre-title triumphalism. Perhaps with this in mind Pep Guardiola, so used to storming away as a title frontrunner, has even made his first few rather gauche attempts at a little cross-Lancashire mental disintegration. \u201cAll the teams who want to win the title have to feel the pressure, but you have to handle it,\u201d Guardiola hammed in his Tuesday press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they will think. I\u2019m not in the locker room.\u201d While it seems unlikely J\u00fcrgen Klopp will find himself reduced to a state of quivering, tear-snorting Kevin Keegan-style meltdown at the force of these gentle little snipes, the timing of it is at least spot-on. For the teams at the top, this is the winter red zone. Best of all, this is a title two-hander that will come down to more than simply injury lists, luck and the form of key players. At stake for Guardiola and Klopp is something more, a systems-clash, a battle between pragmatism and perfectionism. If Liverpool have an advantage this season it is that Klopp has been able to change his team\u2019s rhythms, to play another way, to find other gears below the most extreme expression of his own gegenpressing, high-velocity attacking style. Through the first half of the season Liverpool found a low\u2011corrosion way to win. The formula was clear. With the defence strengthened Liverpool knew they would rarely concede. At the other end the movement and craft of Mohamed Salah is usually too much for most defences. From week to week, and the odd blip aside \u2013 we remember Klopp sprinting across the pitch at home to Everton like a man being chased by rabid huskies \u2013 they won with strength in reserve. What is fascinating is the way the past few weeks, as muscles have tightened, have seen a return to the Liverpool of last season, or at least to a less controlled style. Every goal since Boxing Day has come from the front three. Clean sheets and controlled 1-0s have been replaced by a slightly wilder approach to winning. This is a team fighting not just its rivals at the top of the league but a weight of history, a shared emotional longing. The battle for Liverpool from here might be to drop the throttle a little, to get back as far as possible to the calm, methodical pragmatism of the first half of the season even through the chills of a title-chasing February. Whereas for City and Guardiola it is the refusal to change, the insistence on simply playing the same way, running though the same distinct registers that has made their title chase so engrossing. Guardiola teams don\u2019t drop the throttle, don\u2019t win in other ways. They improve by becoming more themselves, become more efficient and nuanced. Even in defeat, as at Newcastle, it is that same recognisable Pep-ball. Hence this strange current run, whereby either the system clicks, the parts fall into place and City swipe opponents aside; or those rhythms can be disrupted, leaving the parts of the machine still running through the same patterns like a broken circuit board. There are some who might say Pep hasn\u2019t managed 99 Premier League games as City manager, but has instead managed the same game 99 times. This is both incorrect and beside the point. City have more ways of playing than simply classic short passing Pep\u2011ball, as did Barcelona and Bayern Munich before them. But there is something to be said for winning if not ugly, then without being forced to reach the higher registers, as Liverpool have done this season. Guardiola\u2019s ability to make his own very distinct kind of systems\u2011football work even in the mud and blood of a race to the line in Europe\u2019s noisiest league will be key to what happens from here.",

Some have also pared down from their lives meat, sugar, gluten, carbs in an unceasing search for something else to give up. When I remarked that I\u2019d found Dry January boring, a friend whose late partner was an alcoholic tersely remarked that everyone is different. Yes, there\u2019s a limit to the excitement one can endure when living with an addict. Drinking is bad for some people. Some can\u2019t open a bottle without finishing it and then going out for another. The drunkest I\u2019ve ever been was an evening with a pair of literary lions who dined on two jugs of vodka and orange juice and a packet of Ryvita.

Conflicting messages on whether a glass of red wine is good or bad for you leave us feeling that not drinking at all is the route to eternal life. This purge mentality is not new \u2013 it has its roots in fasting and hair shirts. Banishing harm or pleasure from our lives is a form of self-control when everything else is chaotic and not susceptible to individual influence. Moderation has been rebranded as middle of the road, a cop-out. Dry January is a panacea for the worried well, a form of hypochondria. Dry January told me what I already knew.</p> <p><em>Linda Grant is a novelist. Her most recent book is</em> The Dark Circle</p>",

I have friends who, having started Dry January, have just kept on going and, years later, are still teetotal. Some have also pared down from their lives meat, sugar, gluten, carbs in an unceasing search for something else to give up. When I remarked that I\u2019d found Dry January boring, a friend whose late partner was an alcoholic tersely remarked that everyone is different. Yes, there\u2019s a limit to the excitement one can endure when living with an addict. Drinking is bad for some people. Some can\u2019t open a bottle without finishing it and then going out for another. The drunkest I\u2019ve ever been was an evening with a pair of literary lions who dined on two jugs of vodka and orange juice and a packet of Ryvita. I\u2019ve a can of beer in my fridge dating back to the summer of 2015. The movement for moderation in all things has given way to exclusion zones, to the virtuous circle of cutting out, amputating, becoming free from. Conflicting messages on whether a glass of red wine is good or bad for you leave us feeling that not drinking at all is the route to eternal life. This purge mentality is not new \u2013 it has its roots in fasting and hair shirts. Banishing harm or pleasure from our lives is a form of self-control when everything else is chaotic and not susceptible to individual influence. Moderation has been rebranded as middle of the road, a cop-out. Dry January is a panacea for the worried well, a form of hypochondria. Dry January told me what I already knew.

Aside from the one-sided nature of the contest it has provided ideal conditions for fringe players to prove their worth and older heads to regain form.</p> <p>Today it was the turn of Mitchell Starc and Usman Khawaja to celebrate, the former with a five-for, the latter with an unbeaten ton. Both were under pressure coming into this match and both will feel a lot better about their Ashes prospects after it. </p> <p>Starc\u2019s 5-54 helped mop up Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings in quick-time this morning. The cheap dismissals of Marcus Harris, Joe Burns and Marnus Labuschagne then threatened to take the gloss from Australia\u2019s day when they began their second dig but a composed 59 from Travis Head and an increasingly fluent 101 from Khawaja restored Australia\u2019s dominance.</p> <p>The declaration came immediately after Khawaja\u2019s ton - Australia\u2019s fourth individual century of the match - but Sri Lanka navigated a tricky half-hour to stumps. To see if the tourists can negotiate the next two days and secure an unlikely result, join me, Adam and Geoff back here tomorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d32f0831d1fae4b47c802cb88d81dcfb98753c62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d32f0831d1fae4b47c802cb88d81dcfb98753c62/0_0_4120_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usman Khwaja\u2019s century was the highlight of the third day of the second Test between Australia and Sri Lanka in Canberra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usman Khwaja\u2019s century was the highlight of the third day of the second Test between Australia and Sri Lanka in Canberra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T07:02:11.284Z\">at 7.02am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c568edce4b072f2ace1bef7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T06:49:38.705Z\">6.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bad light stops play</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With about ten minutes remaining Sri Lanka have been offered, and gleefully accepted, the light.

Rain is more likely tomorrow, where thundery showers could well disrupt play from lunch onwards. If Sri Lanka hold out until Tuesday they may also benefit from some interruptions to play then as well.

After debuting for the West Indies in ODIs in 1991 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/18/cricket.cricketworldcup20077\">he later went on to represent Canada</a>, becoming just the second man (after Kepler Wessels) to play for two countries in World Cups. </p> <p>Cummins only played five Tests for the Windies. He was scheduled to debut in 1992 on his home island of Barbados but selectors instead opted for Antiguan Kenny Benjamin. So outraged were Bajan fans many boycotted the match, with one banner reading \u201cNo Cummins, no goings\u201d, which is patently brilliant.</p> <p>But perhaps the greatest footnote in his distinguished career was in 1994 when he was playing county cricket for Durham and he had the honour of bowling Brian Lara around his legs when the Warwickshire batsman was on just 12. Unfortunately for Cummins the delivery was called a no-ball and Lara went on to make an unbeaten 501.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXr9SSlb47U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MXr9SSlb47U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u201cNever mind lads, he\u2019s looking shaky, we\u2019ll get him soon.\u201d</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Oh, he also had a mega celebration:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwqDQDoSXo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TwqDQDoSXo0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c566962e4b0d86c56437df3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-03T04:17:03.124Z\">4.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TEA!

A single gives Head one ball to negotiate for the break and he leaves it nicely. <strong>That\u2019s tea on day three! <br></strong></p> <p>So after Australia finished the Sri Lankan innings in eight balls after the resumption, they lost three wickets in 100 minutes at the crease.

From what I know about concussion and how it\u2019s viewed these days, if you show symptoms like that it\u2019s seven days really.

There hasn\u2019t been a statement from the man himself, but Cricket Australia comms staff have made it known that\u2019s the case. It will be interesting to see how that news is received. Chappell was obviously one of Australia\u2019s greatest batsmen \u2013 the rare feat of averaging over 50, plus the iconically stylish way he went about it. <br></p> <p>But he\u2019s also the architect of some very controversial renovations to junior and state cricket which have been broadly criticised by others as having damaged the sport at the professional level, and he\u2019s been part of a selection panel that has invited anger and ridicule for its opacity and erraticism in decision-making. That scrutiny won\u2019t get any less in the lead-up to an away Ashes.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5550dae4b072f2ace1b76c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-02T22:39:23.876Z\">10.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things. But principally Sri Lanka\u2019s resistance against Australia in the second Test of the 2019 series at Canberra. The visiting side will resume on morning three with their score at 123 for 3, which is 411 runs adrift of Australia\u2019s declaration score yesterday of 534 for 5.</p> <p>The pitch looked very good for batting yesterday, so there will be some hope that Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera in the first instance can see of the early attack and settle in.</p> <p>The good news for Sri Lanka is that opening batsman Dimuth Karunaratne has been cleared of any medical damage and will be available to bat when required. He went down yesterday after a bouncer from Pat Cummins hit him in the shoulder and neck. Cummins was bowling very fast yesterday and the scene was nasty. Karunaratne lay flat on his back for about 10 minutes, telling medical staff that his fingers were tingling and he wasn\u2019t confident to move. He had to be stabilised and taken off on a stretcher, and it really rattled everyone at the ground. But he\u2019s been cleared at hospital overnight of any serious damage.</p> <p>His retirement yesterday really hurt Sri Lanka though. At the time he\u2019d helped assemble their fourth-best opening stand against Australia, and was about to pass the total for their best opening stand in Australia. He\u2019d put on 82 with Lahiru Thirimanne. But as soon as Karunaratne left the field, Thirimanne was caught at slip from Lyon, before Starc got Chandimal in a top-edge tangle while hooking, and Cummins bowled a beauty to knock the outside of Kusal Mendis\u2019 off stump.</p> <p>So three down before the close, but at least Karunaratne can try to continue his good progress from yesterday, when he made 46 and looked in complete control. We shall see. Play is 51 minutes away.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the stumps report from day three. Australia\u2019s summer-ending series with Sri Lanka just keeps getting better and better. Aside from the one-sided nature of the contest it has provided ideal conditions for fringe players to prove their worth and older heads to regain form. Today it was the turn of Mitchell Starc and Usman Khawaja to celebrate, the former with a five-for, the latter with an unbeaten ton. Both were under pressure coming into this match and both will feel a lot better about their Ashes prospects after it. Starc\u2019s 5-54 helped mop up Sri Lanka\u2019s first innings in quick-time this morning. The cheap dismissals of Marcus Harris, Joe Burns and Marnus Labuschagne then threatened to take the gloss from Australia\u2019s day when they began their second dig but a composed 59 from Travis Head and an increasingly fluent 101 from Khawaja restored Australia\u2019s dominance. The declaration came immediately after Khawaja\u2019s ton - Australia\u2019s fourth individual century of the match - but Sri Lanka navigated a tricky half-hour to stumps. To see if the tourists can negotiate the next two days and secure an unlikely result, join me, Adam and Geoff back here tomorrow. With about ten minutes remaining Sri Lanka have been offered, and gleefully accepted, the light. It\u2019s gloomy at Manuka Oval but not yet raining. 6th over: Sri Lanka 17-0 (Karunaratna 8, Thrimanna 8) Speaking of the Baphomet, on he comes, drawing Thrimanna forward with his teasing offies but like his two countrymen before him he\u2019s unable to find the breakthrough. 5th over: Sri Lanka 16-0 (Karunaratna 8, Thrimanna 7) Nathan Lyon whirls his arms over in front of an advertising board telling us \u201cthe future of beer is here\u201d. There\u2019s some irony of course in that Lyon was the future of Michael Beer for Australian cricket. Beer was cap number 418 when Australia were still searching for a long-term replacement for Shane Warne. He lasted two Tests before cap number 421 came along. 85 Tests later Australia has a new GOAT. 4th over: Sri Lanka 15-0 (Karunaratna 8, Thrimanna 6) Richardson is finding some nice shape back into the left-handers but both openers are watching the ball well. Karunaratna gets off the market with a top-edged pull over the keeper from a very handy bouncer. He doubles his score two balls later with a very streaky lash to a wider delivery that flies down to third man. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 7-0 (Karunaratna 0, Thrimanna 6) First edge of the innings flies high and wide of third slip off the shoulder of Thrimanna\u2019s bat. Starc is bowling well so far, on a probing line and length. The clouds continue to roll in around Manuka Oval. We may not make it to 6pm. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 1-0 (Karunaratna 0, Thrimanna 1) Jhye Richardson shares the new ball from the Church End, approaching from over the wicket to the left-handers. A bellicose rendition of \u201cAussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!\u201d accompanies the West Australian as he targets Thrimanna but the combination of chest-high bumpers and length in-swingers cannot force a breakthrough. 1st over: Sri Lanka 0-0 (Karunaratna 0, Thrimanna 0) No early wicket but Starc is fast and on the money straight up with a hint of away swing to the left-handed Karunaratna. This is going to be a horrible spell for Sri Lanka. 37 minutes of play to go. Mitchell Starc has the new ball. Can Sri Lanka survive? Australia\u2019s lead when they declared was 515, a very modish number. One of the few bright spots of a difficult summer. What\u2019s impressed me has been his concentration and ability to adapt to the match situation. Clearly a leader of the future. 47th over: Australia 196-3 (Khawaja 101, Head 59) Following Khawaja\u2019s ton Tim Paine gave this partnership until the end of the over before calling them in. Now a nasty 35-minute spell for Sri Lanka to navigate with the floodlights taking effect and the storm clouds gathering. Eighth ton in 41 Tests for Khawaja and he celebrates with a huge leap, a primal scream, and a massive sigh of relief. Before the declaration (or century), a quick chance to share this all-time masterpiece of performance art. 46th over: Australia 193-3 (Khawaja 99, Head 58) A single from Head brings Khawaja on strike and a delicate nudge off his pads brings... three! The declaration will have to wait. The declaration is imminent. Australia\u2019s players are waiting in the player\u2019s race in their whites. Presumably a Khawaja ton is all we\u2019re waiting for. 45th over: Australia 189-3 (Khawaja 96, Head 57) Australia in white ball mode now, improvising and looking for runs to every delivery. Head guides a four just wide of the fly slip, a shot Khawaja improves upon later in the over to extend the lead beyond 500. 44th over: Australia 180-3 (Khawaja 92, Head 52) A single and two dots precede - you guessed it - a misfield, gifting Khawaja two runs. That misfield begets another misfield, this time worth four runs; Kusal Mendis misreading the bounce at gully. 43rd over: Australia 173-3 (Khawaja 86, Head 51) Those thunderstorms I mentioned at Tea are just starting to draw closer. I wonder if that\u2019s going to influence Tim Paine\u2019s decision making? Alison Mitchell on TV says a lightning strike has been recorded just 8km away. Khawaja senses the hurry-up, slapping another cover drive for four then pulling Rajitha hard for one. Both batsmen are clearly looking to push things along but a lack of timing and some well-placed sweepers limit the damage for Sri Lanka. 42nd over: Australia 167-3 (Khawaja 81, Head 50) Khawaja\u2019s purring now, reverse sweeping for two, sweeping for four, then rotating the strike with a single. Head takes advantage of his time on strike, pushing the ball to long-off to bring up his fifth 50 in eight Tests. One of the more curious images of the summer. I wonder if there\u2019s an explanation out there? 41st over: Australia 158-3 (Khawaja 73, Head 49) There have been some fine attacking strokes this session but none finer that this pull shot from Head that whistles off the bat in front of square leg. The pull shot has been conspicuous by its absence this summer. I wonder if anybody better connected than me can say whether this is by design or simply the collection of individual techniques involved across the two series? The alarming number of times batsmen have been hit on helmets ducking into short balls suggests it might be a shot worth revisiting. 40th over: Australia 151-3 (Khawaja 71, Head 44) Head\u2019s had enough of all this faffing around, stepping out of his ground and lofting Perera over mid-off for four. There was a brief shot on TV of Tim Paine in his playing whites outside the viewing room. Could a declaration be nearby? 22 overs or 80 minutes left in the day. 39th over: Australia 147-3 (Khawaja 71, Head 40) After a torrent of runs in the overs immediately after Tea there\u2019s been something of a drought in recent times. Khawaja struggles to get Rajitha away this time and Sri Lanka can enjoy the small victory of a maiden over. The lead is 466. 38th over: Australia 147-3 (Khawaja 71, Head 40) Just one from the latest Perera over. \u201cCan I tempt you with a portmanteau cricketer, all three of whom have been playing Test cricket in the last twenty four hours?\u201d. You sure can Ian Forth! \u201cAlazarri Joseph plus Rory Burns = Joe Burns\u201d. 37th over: Australia 146-3 (Khawaja 70, Head 40) Less drossful from Rajitha, just two runs coming from the second over of his spell. Apropos of nothing, here\u2019s Queen performing at Live Aid. 36th over: Australia 144-3 (Khawaja 69, Head 39) Dilruwan Perera\u2019s back. Chandimal presumably now just mixing up his attack to annoy the scorers. \u201cBOWLER\u2019S NAME!?\u201d possibly ricocheting around Manuka Oval like a Sunday league fourth grade special. The shorthand for this entry while the information was relayed to the scorer\u2019s hut would be *rare maiden*. For the first time since Tea Australia allowed an over to pass without a run being scored. 35th over: Australia 144-3 (Khawaja 69, Head 39) Rajitha has another go but it\u2019s pretty sketchy cricket, featuring as it does a wide, a no-ball, and an overthrow. Nevertheless, Head finds the boundary and the century partnership is raised. Australia\u2019s lead is now 463. My day is always brightened by an Ian Forth email, and today is no exception. \u201cOther portmanteau cricketers include Rob Bailey and Peter George (George Bailey) and perhaps best of all, Greg Ritchie plus John Benaud = Richie Benaud (all but one letter, anyway). If I get time I\u2019ll have a look at the West Indian possibilities which seems like fertile ground. Also Chris Jordan and Robin Peterson gives you Jordan Peterson which is enough to get all true Guardianistas firing off sociological theories about masculinity in contemporary cricket left, right and centre\u201d. 34th over: Australia 131-3 (Khawaja 63, Head 34) The first jaffa in a while almost earns Dananjaya a wicket but after finding the edge of Head\u2019s bat the ball deviated so far it was near impossible for Dickwella to respond in time standing up to the stumps Technically it\u2019s a drop, but there wasn\u2019t much the keeper could have done about it. 33rd over: Australia 129-3 (Khawaja 62, Head 33) After a succession of cover drives Khawaja pulls a beautifully timed on-drive out of his locker, sending Fernando\u2019s delivery back down the ground with interest. 62 runs from ten overs since Tea. I hope the declaration comes soon. Not that it matters all that much, but the operator of the Manuka Oval Twitter feed has done a splendid job this Test. 32nd over: Australia 125-3 (Khawaja 58, Head 33) Ugh, junk from Dananjaya, dropping short twice to Head, the first time receiving the treatment, the second escaping with a single. Yet another misfield keeps the Jack Fingleton Scoreboard ticking over. 31st over: Australia 118-3 (Khawaja 57, Head 27) Aside from Kusal Mendis\u2019 superb slip catching Sri Lanka\u2019s fielding has been appalling. The latest example is a missed run-out following an unnecessary second run that saw Head stranded miles from his ground at the non-striker\u2019s end but nobody guarding the stumps to accept the throw from cover. Schoolboy stuff. Khawaja makes the profligate tourists pay with yet another cover-driven boundary, this time going squarer than previously. He\u2019s up there. I\u2019d take a Starc yorker, an Adelaide Oval sunset, or that retro ODI kit ahead of it though. 30th over: Australia 110-3 (Khawaja 50, Head 27) Usman Khawaja passes 50 for the 22nd time in 41 Tests. On seven previous occasions he has converted that start into a ton. Today would be an opportune time to make that eight following a below-par summer. 29th over: Australia 106-3 (Khawaja 49, Head 24) Spin from both ends last just one over with Fernando\u2019s left-arm pace replacing Perera. More runs from Australia and another cover driven boundary for Khawaja follow, although this one was uppish and only just wide of the diving cover fielder. 28th over: Australia 98-3 (Khawaja 43, Head 22) Spin from both ends now with Dananjaya coming on but this partnership is well set now and happy to milk singles all over Manuka Oval. Hi fans of wordplay! It\u2019s belatedly come to my attention that Anderson Cummins (see Tea interval) is of course an amalgamation of James Anderson and Pat Cummins. Are there any other cricketers whose entire name can be made out of the names of two other players? Answers on a postcard. Or Twitter and email, if you prefer - details at the top of the page. 27th over: Australia 94-3 (Khawaja 41, Head 20) Perera drops short and Khwaja\u2019s on it in a flash, cutting hard behind point for his third boundary since Tea. Following Starc\u2019s five-for earlier, another of Australia\u2019s senior figures is playing himself back into form. 26th over: Australia 87-3 (Khawaja 36, Head 18) Head reaches 500 runs for the Test summer with a powerful cut to the offside sweeper. That same fielder can\u2019t intercept another Khawaja cover driven boundary, a shot squirted through the infield following some butterfingered fielding by Thirimanne. 25th over: Australia 81-3 (Khawaja 32, Head 17) Much tighter from Dilruwan Perera in an over that includes a delivery squirting off the outside edge of Khawaja\u2019s bat while the left-hander was on the move down the pitch. The lead is now 400. 24th over: Australia 78-3 (Khawaja 30, Head 16) Chamika may regret his decision to leave the pavilion following his opening over after Tea. A no-ball and a Khawaja single precede a rock star cover drive from Head so photogenic it deserves its own Instagram account. Its status as an influencer was seen almost immediately by Khawaja emulating the shot for the second boundary of the over. You know I want your Tweets and emails. Send them to the following addresses please. @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. This could include some Numberwang DECLARATION SPECULATION. The lead is 386 with seven sessions remaining. If you like your evening sessions long and sweaty, you\u2019re in luck! 39 overs are still to be bowled today which means we\u2019re looking at another 150-minute session. Temperatures are in the mid-30s in the nation\u2019s capital and a few ominous storm clouds are beginning to loiter. Speaking of the weather, the forecast is for scattered thunderstorms this evening, but the likelihood of those rolling in is slim until after stumps have been called. Rain is more likely tomorrow, where thundery showers could well disrupt play from lunch onwards. If Sri Lanka hold out until Tuesday they may also benefit from some interruptions to play then as well. However, there is no persistent rain rain forecast during the Test, only showers. Thank you very much Adam, my favourite cricketing AC since Anderson Cummins, a player with an unexpected number of career quirks to enjoy. The obvious place to start is with his dual-international status. After debuting for the West Indies in ODIs in 1991 he later went on to represent Canada, becoming just the second man (after Kepler Wessels) to play for two countries in World Cups. Cummins only played five Tests for the Windies. He was scheduled to debut in 1992 on his home island of Barbados but selectors instead opted for Antiguan Kenny Benjamin. So outraged were Bajan fans many boycotted the match, with one banner reading \u201cNo Cummins, no goings\u201d, which is patently brilliant. But perhaps the greatest footnote in his distinguished career was in 1994 when he was playing county cricket for Durham and he had the honour of bowling Brian Lara around his legs when the Warwickshire batsman was on just 12. Unfortunately for Cummins the delivery was called a no-ball and Lara went on to make an unbeaten 501. Oh, he also had a mega celebration: 23rd over: Australia 67-3 (Khawaja 25, Head 11) Dhananjaya replaces Perera for a one-over spell, the two catchers at short cover not a factor when the spinner drops short with a long hop, hammered away through midwicket for four runs by Khawaja. A single gives Head one ball to negotiate for the break and he leaves it nicely. That\u2019s tea on day three! So after Australia finished the Sri Lankan innings in eight balls after the resumption, they lost three wickets in 100 minutes at the crease. Harris won\u2019t want to be seeing his dismissal again, nor Labuschagne, but Burns got an excellent delivery from Fernando, who has been the most impressive visiting seamer. Thanks for your contributions on the replacement walk-out song for the Australian team, I\u2019m going to send a couple to CA now. To see you through to the close, I welcome back JP Howcroft. Talk to you again tomorrow. Bye! 22nd over: Australia 62-3 (Khawaja 20, Head 11) Head tries to smash Karunaratne over extra cover into the apartment I\u2019m staying at just beyond the grandstand in that direction, but instead he plays and misses the moving ball. After that near miss, he keeps bat and pad close together in defence, mindful surely that they have a cup of tea waiting in a few minutes from now. 21st over: Australia 62-3 (Khawaja 20, Head 11) Perera has been swung around to the nortern or Manuka Pool End for a dart before the break, replacing Rajitha who did well picking up a couple of wickets. He picks up his earlier contest with Khawaja, both the spinner and No3 doing their jobs, a maiden the result. 20th over: Australia 62-3 (Khawaja 20, Head 11) Karunaratne is on for a twist. Despite struggling pretty badly in the first dig, he did get the new ball to move around early on - picking up Labuschagne with a good one - so I\u2019m a bit surprised they have delayed his introduction. Anyway, Khawaja gets a single away first ball to midwicket, moving into the 20s with the stroke, Head then playing out the rest conservatively. They should get three more overs in before the tea interval. 19th over: Australia 61-3 (Khawaja 19, Head 11) Rajitha does go again and nearly picks up Head! That\u2019s the second inside edge of the Australian second dig to miss the woodwork by a matter of millimetres, this time passing just by the leg stump before spitting out to fine leg for a couple. But he can\u2019t keep the pressure on, overstepping before giving Head three balls on a trot that he can leave alone. 18th over: Australia 58-3 (Khawaja 19, Head 9) Perera\u2019s turn to get the treatment, Head getting off the mark by creaming a cut. Confidence up, he then jumps down at the spinner and smashes him down the ground. He\u2019s in fantastic nick. 17th over: Australia 49-3 (Khawaja 19, Head 0) The old captaincy nightmare, giving a bowler one extra over following a wicket, then going around. It\u2019s what Rajitha does here, Khawaja pulling him for four with ease then tucking another to the rope, the bowler overstepping too. Nicely bowled but time for a breather. \u201cI only remember Marsh brothers,\u201d the best bit of this exchange. He\u2019s a gem, Dickwella. 16th over: Australia 40-3 (Khawaja 11, Head 0) Khawaja grabs a couple to midwicket against the turn then another down the ground to keep the strike. Horses is nominated, noted but rejected. Aim high. \u201cThe Slab is Hunters and Collectors finest,\u201d argues Graham Crouch. \u201c\u2018I was looking to see some dreams dripping from your fingers...\u2019\u201d And the Big V blue singlet! I made one of those for a Bay 13 excursion to an early-2000s ODI. On the back it read: DEANO: ONE-DAY KING. He sure is. 15th over: Australia 37-3 (Khawaja 8, Head 0) Head gets out of the way of a bumper first up to complete the Rajitha over. Labuschagne has been so assertive in defence until now, prodding forward to edge a little outswinger from Rajitha, into the book for a second time. After doing the hard work, that\u2019ll hurt. Fair play to the Sri Lankan openers for sticking to their task and doing enough to create these chances. After chasing leather the first time around, this is no easy job backing up without even 24 hours to rest. 14th over: Australia 37-2 (Khawaja 8, Labuschagne 4) Labuschagne takes one around the corner off the second ball of Perera\u2019s new over, Khawaja jumping forward then using the depth of the crease to defend the rest. 13th over: Australia 36-2 (Khawaja 8, Labuschagne 3) A lot to like about the way Labuschagne has started, unlucky not to beat midwicket with a firm clip, then defending with purpose. He is off the mark from the final Fernando delivery, this time beating midwicket with the same shot from earlier in the over, galloping back for three. \u201cMy suggestion is \u2018Frontier Psychiatrist\u2019 by The Avalanches,\u201d writes Simon Pertie. Very clever after the year that has been, and a real earworm too. Let\u2019s pop it on. 12th over: Australia 33-2 (Khawaja 8, Labuschagne 0) Khawaja is on the advance to the spin of Perera, going over the bowler\u2019s head for a couple. He uses his feet again later in the over, albeit to defend. It should be a good little contest between these two, the No3 surely busting out the reverse sweep soon as well. 11th over: Australia 31-2 (Khawaja 6, Labuschagne 0) Fernando isn\u2019t giving Labuschagne an easy option to get off the mark, the Queenslander looking organised in defence throughout this maiden, leaving as required too. I love the huge, red spot in the middle of his blade, as though he has sandpapered (nurse!) every other cherry aside from those that hit the meat. A real power move. \u201cIt has a good long instrumental intro and a repeating fade out chorus at the end so it\u2019s actually a pretty practical option,\u201d says Michael Cooney in his email about My Island Home. I\u2019ll take the Christine Anu version. Better still, how about her other big single? This featured on Hit Machine 10, my first CD. 10th over: Australia 31-2 (Khawaja 6, Labuschagne 0) Spin to win, or something like that. Dilruwan Perera is on for a quick set before they break for drinks, Khawaja patting back an accurate maiden from the offie. 9th over: Australia 31-2 (Khawaja 6, Labuschagne 0) Fernando bumps Khawaja again to begin, two men set out after his miscue in the previous set. Off strike to midwicket, Labuschagne deals with the rest easily enough. There was a long chat between the Sri Lankans, Khawaja and an umpire before the over for reasons that are not yet obvious but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find out at drinks, coming up shortly. Thick and fast come the nominations for Australia\u2019s new walk-out song. Mick Jumpertz wants Wedding Cake Island by Midnight Oil. Get in. My dear old pal Michael Cooney goes with Warumpi Band - My Island Home. Nice. Sure enough, Farnsy gets a mention from Irish gun umpire Laura Caughney. I\u2019m only sympathetic on the basis that we went to the same high school in Dandenong. But it is Jane who wins my attention and the youtube embed with this absolute STONKER, Down Again by Superjesus. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling confident,\u201d she adds, explaining her decision. No explanation required, it\u2019s on my all-time Aussie list. 8th over: Australia 30-2 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 0) So close to three! After collecting his first boundary with a clip through midwicket, next ball Khawaja has a pop at the Rajitha short ball but it comes off the top edge, hanging in the air for a long time before landing about ten metres short of the man running in from fine leg. Had the No3 fallen like that it would have made for a headline or two. 7th over: Australia 25-2 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 0) Two Queenslanders yet to score, both having failed in the first dig. The younger of the two, who got a good\u2019un on Friday, leaves the one Fernando ball left in the set. Fernando has Burns! A very tidy piece of bowling across the right-hander to find the edge, another catch for Mendis at second slip snaffled; his sixth of the series. \u201cThat\u2019s the Chaminda Vaas of old!,\u201d says Mike Hussey of the left-armer on telly, \u201crunning his fingers down the seam to create that lovely off-cutter.\u201d 6th over: Australia 19-1 (Burns 3, Khawaja 0) Rajitha is a bit all over the place early on, spraying one so wide of Khawaja that it is signalled as one by the ump. Khawaja cops a whack on the shoulder from a short ball but either side of that is patient outside the off-stump. Gav Joshi is an obsessive watcher of batting, so if you are trying to work out what\u2019s going on with Khawaja this summer, this is worth a click. 5th over: Australia 17-1 (Burns 2, Khawaja 0) Whoa, it should be 16-2! Burns has somehow survived by no more than half a centimetre with an inside edge moving from his blade to his back pad, trickling back towards off-stump only to just miss. A single to long leg gives Khawaja one ball to look at and he defends it competently. That\u2019s a better over from Fernando. \u201cRufus - Treat You Better\u201d writes Doug Thompson. I must admit, that\u2019s not in my immediate hitting zone but I\u2019ll pop it on at tea. Keep them coming. 4th over: Australia 16-1 (Burns 1, Khawaja 0) It\u2019s a slightly different story for Khawaja with so much experience at this level, but he\u2019s the other Australian well out of form and in need of a couple of hours in the middle, perhaps with a bit of red ink to go with it. He\u2019s defending and leaving the last couple of balls of successful Rajitha over. \u201cThe Saints,\u201d nominates Diego del Mercato. \u201cI\u2019m Stranded.\u201d Now we\u2019re cooking. With this occasionally thrown in to mix things up. Oh, hold on! Against the flow of play, Harris has given Mendis a low chance at second slip and he makes no mistake. It\u2019s another unattractive dismissal, on the drive against Rajitha without a lot of footwork. With life moving pretty fast at the top, has Australia\u2019s most consistent player from the India series gone and batted himself out of an Ashes berth against Sri Lanka? 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Harris 10, Burns 1) Easy pickings for Harris, tickling the tired Fernando to the fine leg rope for Australia\u2019s first boundary. The Sri Lankan band are still giving it big below the media centre here but that\u2019s all that is going on here right now. 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Harris 5, Burns 1) There is nothing going on here, Rajitha\u2019s medium pace clipped into the deep by Harris for three first up. Burns is in no rush, ignoring the majority of the over. No swing, no chance. Glenn Hoen has a nomination for Powderfinger - My Happiness. If we\u2019re going to go down that path (and I wouldn\u2019t), let\u2019s go with this. On the proviso that the memorable film clip is also popped on the big screen each time it is used. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Harris 2, Burns 1) With 62 overs up their sleeve today, the working assumption is that Australia will declare at some stage in the final session and have another pop at the sore and sorry visitors. That should give Burns enough time to notch twin tons. It could be a more important innings for Harris, yet to nail down his spot with Warner back for the Ashes. Obviously, this is junk time. But still, he needs to stick the landing on this summer. Both men are off the mark, the left-hander tucking Fernando around the corner, the right-hander doing the same down to long leg. Harris keeps the strike with one to midwicket. Great Southern Land is playing, which means the Australian openers are on their way. I issued my usual whinge around the press box that we should change the song next summer. An open-minded CA operative suggested that I give her something better to put to their event team. You beauty. What should I pitch? Send me your best. It\u2019ll have to be an Australian song; no other rules. Go! Starc\u2019s fifth wicket. Comprehensive. Interesting innings for the left-armer, looking fast but very ropey in his first spell, given a long breather, getting a bit of tap when he came straight back late yesterday. But he got in the book before the close with an accurate bouncer and never let up today. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s back in business, but this can only help his confidence at the end of a middling summer. Nine out, all out! It has taken Starc two balls to knock over the No11, with an accurate full ball from round the wicket, angled in at the off-stump and too good. It is a five-wicket bag for him too, finishing with 13.3-2-54-5. Sri Lanka\u2019s final three wickets all fell with the score on 215, not adding to their lunch score. As expected, Australia will bat again, building on their first innings lead of 319. Starc picks up a wicket with his first ball after the break. It\u2019s poor batting from Perera, edging an attempted cut from a delivery that wasn\u2019t much more than a loosener, short and wide outside the off-stump from round the wicket. With the other Perera injured, Australia need just one wicket to finish this off. 68th over: Sri Lanka 215-7 (D Perera 10, Rajitha 0) Forget what I said below, it is Rajitha walking out at No10, not Fernando. He elects to throw his hands at full, wide leg break, his blade beaten. To end the over, he\u2019s beaten again by a proper beauty. \u201cGood skills, Marn!\u201d roars Tim Paine. He\u2019s not wrong, that was an excellent wicket maiden. \u201cWe were at day 2 of this Test yesterday, and were able to walk over to Manuka, eat a quick lunch and back and only missed a couple of overs,\u201d reports Penelope Cottier. \u201cJust wondering at which other grounds this is possible, either in Australia or overseas? Manuka is a great little oval.\u201d Great observation. I did likewise on the opening day, nipping out for a coffee at the tea break. It\u2019s such a shame that the schedule means there won\u2019t be another Test here for, in realty, four or five years. Oh well. You can write to me too, by the way. G\u2019day. With the Bradmaneque follow-on mark of 334 still 119 runs away, Tim Paine will have the option at some stage this session to pop Sri Lanka in again. Of course, it is very unlikely they would pull that trigger, so strap in with me for some of that old, fashioned, average-inflating declaration batting! Huzzah! Some brilliant work from SEN statistician Andrew Samson, who told me at lunch that the last time a man who had retired hurt replaced somebody retiring hurt - as Karunaratne did this morning - was at Kingston in 1991. On that occasion, the do-si-do was between Desmond Haynes and Gus Logie, against Australia. There is nothing that man can\u2019t get to the bottom of. Speaking of injuries, some encouraging news from the visiting squad Kusal Perera doing well and resting. He is now going through the usual concussion test process, but there is no realistic way that he will take any further part in this game. That means that Australia require only two wickets to wrap up this first innings. It\u2019s a lovely afternoon in Canberra, not a cloud in the sky looking out from the new media centre over to Parliament House and the Black Mountain tower behind it. Over the loudspeaker they are currently playing Shooting Stars, which for me, will now forever be linked to a brilliant Ethan Meldrum meme from 2017 when Kohli was out in consecutive Tests against Australia shouldering arms. Enjoy. Okay, we\u2019re a few minutes from play resuming so the umpires are now out on the field with the players following, Sri Lanka to resume at 215-7 with Perera (10) the not out batsman with Dickwella falling on on the stoke of lunch. He is to be joined by Vishwa Fernando. Labuschagne has give balls remaining in his over. PLAY! 67.1 overs (Dilruwan 10) The break will be called with the wicket, and Labuschagne will bowl the other five balls after a feed. What a session for Australia! Most importantly, Mitchell Starc has got himself going a bit. Somewhat fortunate with his top edge wicket of Chandimal last night. Extremely fortunate with his hit-wicket dismissal of Dhananjaya this morning. But looked a bit more threatening thereafter, got the conventional wicket of Dimuth Karunaratne, who had batted well, and should have had a fourth from a good ball had a slip catch not been shelled. A disastrous session for Sri Lanka, on the other hand, with four wickets going down plus the concussion injury to Kusal Janith Perera. A really unfortunate one from a heavy blow to the helmet. He\u2019ll play no further part in the game, surely. So two more wickets will wrap up this innings, which shouldn\u2019t take long, and then Australia will have to decide whether to enforce the follow-on and push for a win today, or have another frolic with the bat to enjoy the nice sunshine and entertain the crowd. Plenty of time for a win tomorrow, but likewise there\u2019s no time like the present. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 I may or may not see you tomorrow, depending how things go today. Up next it\u2019s Adam Collins. Has Marnus got himself into the game? Dickwella sweeps and is given out immediately by Umpire Gough. He reviews it just as quickly. Thinks he got some glove on the sweep. And looking at the replay, he might be right. This is another strange one. There\u2019s the tiniest little flicker on the Snicko graph just as the ball passes glove. But the umpire has obviously deemed it insufficient to overturn the on-field call, because it\u2019s been upheld. HawkEye shows the ball would have bounced quite high but it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call clipping the bails. 67th over: Sri Lanka 215-6 (Dickwella 25, Dilruwan 10) A maiden for Lyon, featuring one big appeal against Dilruwan that is not upheld. 66th over: Sri Lanka 215-6 (Dickwella 25, Dilruwan 10) Time for a bit of Marnus Labuschagne. Of course, you can only call him Labuschagne if he comes from the Labuschagne region of France. Anywhere else it\u2019s just Sparkling Marnus. He bowls a leg break, and Dickwella sweeps it to fine leg. Labuschagne appeals vociferously for leg-before. Might need to do a refresher on the rules of this sport. Tim Paine tries to explain that if the bat hits it, you can\u2019t be lbw. 65th over: Sri Lanka 210-6 (Dickwella 22, Dilruwan 8) Straight to him off Starc, and Usman Khawaja is having a shocker. Watched three of his teammates rack up hundreds after he played a poor shot for a third-ball duck. Now an edge comes straight at him, head high, and he palms it down into the ground. First ball of the over, and it would have given Starc four wickets and a great chance at five, which would have been a tonic for the bowler given his recent struggles. Dickwella enjoys his reprieve, cutting a wider ball to third man for four. Ah, second chances. To be fair Australia owe their opponents a few. 64th over: Sri Lanka 206-6 (Dickwella 18, Dilruwan 8) Dickwella has suddenly switched into Hungry Mode. Better against Lyon than pace. He reaches well outside off stump to drag a slog-sweep for four. Then cuts a brace. Sweeps another. Smacks another through covers. Serving up more doubles than Mooseheads on a Saturday night. Then taps a single to keep the strike. I\u2019ll have 11 runs, thanks. 63rd over: Sri Lanka 195-6 (Dickwella 7, Dilruwan 8) Alright folks, Dickwella has reconsidered his strategy of getting off strike the first ball of a Starc over with a single. Instead he\u2019s going to get off strike first ball with a three. Drives down the ground. Dilruwan takes his place down the wrong end of the shooting gallery for the next five balls. The last of them is wild and he\u2019s able to clip it fine for four. 62nd over: Sri Lanka 188-6 (Dickwella 4, Dilruwan 4) Against Lyon things don\u2019t look quite so tough for this pair. Dickwella cuts a single. Dilruwan has a good look, then ends the over by galloping down to clatter the ball into the LED advertising screens behind midwicket. 61st over: Sri Lanka 183-6 (Dickwella 3, Dilruwan 0) If you\u2019re wondering, the follow-on is one Bradman. As in, 334 runs. Sri Lanka are currently somewhat short of that. Starc bowls medium short, at the body, to Dilruwan, who had his bowling hand tenderised by Cummins at the Gabba. Keen to avoid a repeat of that experience, he nearly skews a leading edge up for a catch. Maybe Dickwella shouldn\u2019t take singles from the first ball of Starc overs? 60th over: Sri Lanka 182-6 (Dickwella 2, Dilruwan 0) The spare Perera, Dilruwan, comes to the middle. The other one, Kusal, will stay at the ground to be monitored and will not go to hospital. That\u2019s according to the update we\u2019ve just received from the camp. Lyon has his second wicket as the over comes to an end. Karunaratnes come, Karunaratnes go. Sri Lanka spending them like they\u2019re going out of style. As for Mitchell Starc, you can\u2019t keep him out of the game. Who has ever said anything different? He\u2019s at leg slip to take a simple catch from a classic off-spinner\u2019s dismissal: turning in towards a right-hander, taking the inside edge onto the pad and into the air. 59th over: Sri Lanka 181-5 (Dickwella 1, C Karunaratne) It was one injured batsman replacing another, now it\u2019s one Karunaratne replacing another. Chamika K is the first of the bowlers to join Niroshan Dickwella, the wicketkeeper. He must have some ability to come in ahead of Dilruwan Perera, who can bat pretty well. So Sri Lanka are five down, but effectively six with the injury to Kusal Perera. My word it\u2019s done damage! That\u2019s a bit more conventional for Starc, who bowls fast outside off stump and draws a big drive from Karunaratne. The thick edge flies straight to gully, and Starc has two in the over! How the worm can turn. That is extraordinary. By definition. The batsman gets a short ball, tries a hook, and in his lavish follow-through ends up holding the bat in one hand as it twirls behind him. That lack of control of the blade sees it clip the top of his bails, and one of them agonisingly tips off. He\u2019s out, clear as day, though they check the video replays to be sure. Mitchell Starc has in some fashion picked up a second wicket. Bowling to that plan, no doubt. Sloppy batting, and it\u2019s done Sri Lanka real damage. 58th over: Sri Lanka 180-3 (Dhananjaya 26, D Karunaratne 60) Alarms as DDS lunges forward to Lyon and gets an inside edge into pad. It pops up on the off side but there\u2019s no one there, and short leg can\u2019t get across in time. The batsman finds a single, giving Karunaratne one ball to face, which that man plonks dead straight down the ground for four. 57th over: Sri Lanka 175-3 (Dhananjaya 25, D Karunaratne 55) Wide and carved away! Starc comes on for his first over at last, and probably wishes he hadn\u2019t. The first ball is buffet stuff, and Karunaratne carves the square drive for an admirable fifty. To come back from hospital and play on in impressive. If he hadn\u2019t been injured yesterday, the way he and the opening partnership were going, who knows what dreams may have come. Starc tries to find his yorker length, but Karunaratne blunts it with a straight drive for three, then Dhananjaya de Silva whips another through midwicket for two. Starc loses his line and DDS profits by a leg glanced single. Ten from the over. 56th over: Sri Lanka 165-3 (Dhananjaya 22, D Karunaratne 48) Just a brace from Lyon\u2019s over, with de Silva driving through the covers, and that will raise the drinks break. Not that we need one, with the three breaks we had when Perera was hit. But it\u2019s cricket. Reminds me of Cassiopeia, which is a constellation and a jellyfish and a Joanna Newsom song. All of them rather fey and floaty and beautiful. 55th over: Sri Lanka 163-3 (Dhananjaya 20, D Karunaratne 48) Header question resolved: Karunaratne will be listed second, but with an initial so that you don\u2019t confuse him with the bowling Karunaratne who will come later. This is my arbitrary decision, sorry if you don\u2019t like it. Dimuth Karunaratne looks pretty good initially, driving two from Richardson. 54th over: Sri Lanka 158-3 (Dhananjaya 18, Karunaratne 46) Kusal Perera is not ok after all. He takes a long delay before the over from Lyon starts, talking to the physio. Stands at the non-striker\u2019s end for three balls, then he calls it off. Bent double out at point with the physio. He\u2019s obviously dizzy. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly concussion,\u201d says Chris Rogers on ABC Grandstand. He would know, having suffered a couple of bad ones in his late Test career, and those blows probably played some part in his decision to retire. \u201cFor me that means he\u2019s ruled out of the game. From what I know about concussion and how it\u2019s viewed these days, if you show symptoms like that it\u2019s seven days really. There\u2019s going to be a lot of concern about him now to show symptoms like that in the ten minutes after you\u2019re hit, that\u2019s worrying.\u201d Just to increase the strangeness, Karunaratne will resume his innings in Perera\u2019s place. So one guy who got hit in the head replaces another guy who got hit in the head. Do I list him ahead of de Silva at the top of the post because he batted first, or behind de Silva because he\u2019s come back in afterwards? The big questions. 53rd over: Sri Lanka 157-3 (K Perera 29, Dhananjaya 17) That\u2019s almost identical to the Karunaratne one, except Richardson is the bowler and Perera has the protective neck gear. He\u2019s ok, still standing and being assessed by medical staff. Flat track, flat bouncer, and he took his eyes off the ball while jerking his head away. Hit in the side of the grille or the neck as he turned, and the neck guard flew off as it\u2019s designed to do. Second time today that Perera has been hit, though the first wasn\u2019t flush. The batsman will continue. Richardson makes sure he\u2019s ok, then follows up immediately with a bouncer. It may seem harsh but that\u2019s how the game gets played. You can\u2019t be out there if you can\u2019t handle everything that can happen under the Laws. Perera doesn\u2019t seem to worried, smoking a short ball a couple of deliveries later with a pull shot, though it\u2019s saved by another top dive in the deep and only nets him two. 52nd over: Sri Lanka 155-3 (K Perera 27, Dhananjaya 17) Lyon comes on for the first over of spin. Still no Starc. He bowls too far to leg and Perera is able to sweep him powerfully and fine for four, then push a single to point. 51st over: Sri Lanka 150-3 (K Perera 22, Dhananjaya 17) Cummins pitches up to de Silva for the first four balls of the over, doing the mature and responsible thing. Then lets loose from the last two with a couple of short balls. Still bowling fast. No score. 50th over: Sri Lanka 150-3 (K Perera 22, Dhananjaya 17) De Silva looks good, pulling Richardson for a single fine. Perera does not, with another streaky drive. Surely this can\u2019t go on for long. He goes in the air again, splitting cover and mid off, though some brilliant chasing work from Travis Head keeps the ball from the boundary rope. Three runs. De Silva glances a single, then Perera goes hard again and flashes the ball to third man for four. Can\u2019t last. It nearly ends from the last ball of the over as it beats his edge. 49th over: Sri Lanka 141-3 (K Perera 15, Dhananjaya 15) Oof, that\u2019s some bouncer. Cummins has Perera whipping his head way from the line of the ball as it sizzles over his stumps. The speedo clocked that as 143.6, and we know the speedo measures short balls as slower than full ones. That\u2019s serious, serious heat. Like, Australian average temperatures in January in the last ten years heat. Cummins\u2019 speed chart is trending upwards, his fuller balls getting over 145 kph. An inside edge into pad provides the only run from the over. 48th over: Sri Lanka 140-3 (K Perera 15, Dhananjaya 14) Well if the last over brought some yelps of excitement, this one brings howls. De Silva again, flicking into the leg side, but he gets a fair bit more on this shot and gets it over the top of midwicket. It flies away for four. Perera wants to match that, for risk and reward, so he lashes Richardson airily through cover to end the over for four more. Easily catchable but the angle was wrong. Perera is a lefty, de Silva bats with the right, so they\u2019re moving the field around. 47th over: Sri Lanka 131-3 (K Perera 11, Dhananjaya 9) Cummins to de Silva, into the pads and de Silva flicks away, airborne, through square leg. A few shouts of excitement but it travels safely. 46th over: Sri Lanka 130-3 (K Perera 11, Dhananjaya 8) De Silva is looking pretty good. Very solid defensive stuff against Richardson, well forward and getting the middle of the bat. There\u2019s nothing lateral off this wicket so far, that\u2019s for sure. De Silva rides a short ball and knocks away a single, calm and steady. 45th over: Sri Lanka 129-3 (K Perera 11, Dhananjaya 7) Hmmmm, interesting. Mitchell Starc will not open the bowling for the day. He got four overs yesterday and got dragged after constantly bowling on the batsman\u2019s hip. Then he got one later spell after a very long delay and got a wicket thanks to Chandimal\u2019s horrible shot. Bowled eight overs of the 45 so far. And the men trusted to start today are Cummins and Richardson. Our man de Silva is keen to take on Our Pat though, hooking him right out of the middle to the square leg boundary, then top-edging another attempt for a single. 44th over: Sri Lanka 124-3 (K Perera 11, Dhananjaya 2) Jumping Jhye Richardson gets us going from the Manuka Church end. And let me tell you, it is an utterly stonking day in Canberra. Yesterday started cloudy and graduated from cool to sweaty, as most people do between about 20 and 40 years of age. Today is glorious: clear blue above, slight breeze, feels like mid-20s in the temperature range. English willage green weather, with an Antipodean edge on the UV index. Richardson swings the ball into de Silva\u2019s pads, and the batsman glances a single. Kusal Janith Perera, as Sri Lankan supporters often call him, wants to get going. Smashes a drive straight to mid-off, then tries to pull and gets in a tangle. Gets hit, but there are no dramas like yesterday, as the impact was glancing enough for him to carry on. Wow, say the name Greg Chappell and... The star for Australia on day two, meanwhile, was Kurtis Patterson. That\u2019s right, Test cricket has a new KP. This one isn\u2019t quite like the old one. He\u2019s quiet and modest and more modestly talented and left-handed. But he is very tall, and he does give the pull shot a mighty whack. He made 114 not out, batting through to the declaration, after Joe Burns and Travis Head had already made hundreds. West Indies thrashed England overnight Australian time, bowling them out for 132 to go with a measly 187 in the first innings (not to mention 77 in the first Test). That left West Indies with only 17 runs to score for a ten-wicket victory, and a 2-0 lead in the three-match series. It\u2019s been a truly remarkable one for many reasons. Here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s report to give you some of those. In other major news, Greg Chappell will end his term as an Australian selector after the Ashes mid-year. There hasn\u2019t been a statement from the man himself, but Cricket Australia comms staff have made it known that\u2019s the case. It will be interesting to see how that news is received. Chappell was obviously one of Australia\u2019s greatest batsmen \u2013 the rare feat of averaging over 50, plus the iconically stylish way he went about it. But he\u2019s also the architect of some very controversial renovations to junior and state cricket which have been broadly criticised by others as having damaged the sport at the professional level, and he\u2019s been part of a selection panel that has invited anger and ridicule for its opacity and erraticism in decision-making. That scrutiny won\u2019t get any less in the lead-up to an away Ashes. The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things. But principally Sri Lanka\u2019s resistance against Australia in the second Test of the 2019 series at Canberra. The visiting side will resume on morning three with their score at 123 for 3, which is 411 runs adrift of Australia\u2019s declaration score yesterday of 534 for 5. The pitch looked very good for batting yesterday, so there will be some hope that Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera in the first instance can see of the early attack and settle in. The good news for Sri Lanka is that opening batsman Dimuth Karunaratne has been cleared of any medical damage and will be available to bat when required. He went down yesterday after a bouncer from Pat Cummins hit him in the shoulder and neck. Cummins was bowling very fast yesterday and the scene was nasty. Karunaratne lay flat on his back for about 10 minutes, telling medical staff that his fingers were tingling and he wasn\u2019t confident to move. He had to be stabilised and taken off on a stretcher, and it really rattled everyone at the ground. But he\u2019s been cleared at hospital overnight of any serious damage. His retirement yesterday really hurt Sri Lanka though. At the time he\u2019d helped assemble their fourth-best opening stand against Australia, and was about to pass the total for their best opening stand in Australia. He\u2019d put on 82 with Lahiru Thirimanne. But as soon as Karunaratne left the field, Thirimanne was caught at slip from Lyon, before Starc got Chandimal in a top-edge tangle while hooking, and Cummins bowled a beauty to knock the outside of Kusal Mendis\u2019 off stump. So three down before the close, but at least Karunaratne can try to continue his good progress from yesterday, when he made 46 and looked in complete control. We shall see. Play is 51 minutes away.",

She is mostly absent even from footnotes by 1936, but still shadows the poet. In July 1936 Eliot writes to Dorothy Pound, wife of Ezra: \u201cI am rather shaky at the moment,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI ran into my late wife in Wigmore Street an hour ago and had to take to my heels: only people who have been \u2018wanted\u2019 know the sort of life I lead...\u201d</p> <p>This volume closes with the decision, which Eliot had long avoided, to have Vivienne committed to an asylum.

In years that we view as a preface to the great rupture in modern history, hardly a hint registers in Eliot\u2019s correspondence. There is an abrupt note to Vanessa Bell to offer condolences for the death of her son Julian, killed by a bomb blast in the Spanish civil war. This precedes anguished exchanges with Bell\u2019s sister, Virginia Woolf, about how he can politely reject a posthumous collection of Julian\u2019s essays.

Two words that conjure up rustling skirts, rattling teacups, and an \u201cOh, Mr Pumperton, how <em>could</em> you?\u201d conversation taking place outdoors, possibly in a rose garden. (We\u2019re talking audio, so you can\u2019t tell.) But not all history takes place before 1900. There\u2019s an awful lot of history out there \u2013 more made every minute! \u2013 and our most recent provides plenty of real life drama to plunder. I bet you anything that David Hare, right this moment, is frantically writing and rewriting a play called <em>The Last Days of Brexit</em>\u2026</p> <p>Which brings me to two new drama podcasts from the BBC. The first, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtttx/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">Fall of the Shah</a></strong>, written by Steve Waters, begins in 1977, with the then US president Jimmy Carter aboard his presidential plane, off to visit Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran. Nathan Osgood plays the part of Carter, Bijan Daneshmand the Shah. The press blurb says the series stars Diana Rigg, but she\u2019s merely the narrator. There aren\u2019t too many juicy parts for women in the political arena of the 1970s; Carter\u2019s wife, Rosalynn, appears to be there simply to distract her husband from tricky conversations: \u201cJimmy, look, is that Mount Ararat?\u201d Anyhoo.</p> <p>We hear things mostly from Carter\u2019s point of view, though this is set to change as the nine-part serial progresses. Even in the first episode there are inserts indicating that Iran isn\u2019t as welcoming as Carter finds it. A man is taken into custody for shouting \u201cDeath to the Shah\u201d. Carter\u2019s aides give us quick, damning potted histories while still on the plane. And, \u201cHow hard it is to make out a country through a mass of flowers and smiles\u2026 Only a cynic could take such unforced love of the Shah as something compelled,\u201d says Rigg, who has been given a God-like overview.</p> <p>Among the flowers and smiles, and charmed by the Shah, naive Carter goes off-piste with his after-dinner speech. Essentially, he plays things too cosy. (Interesting parallels could be drawn with the contemporary president.)</p> <p>Those who remember what happened next know that Carter\u2019s warm words come back to haunt him. For the Shah is deposed, the Ayatollah Khomeini rises to power and Carter\u2019s friendship with the Shah triggers the Iran hostage crisis. Spoiler!</p> <p>Anyway, <em>Fall of the Shah</em> is exactly the type of drama at which the BBC excels. There is doomy, this-is-serious music. There are terrible accents. There is extemporising dialogue that nobody would ever say, eg \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta worry about a guy who thumbs through arms catalogues to relax.\u201d As drama, it\u2019s pretty bad. But as an easy way to recall and reassess history, it\u2019s good, and could be useful to school history students.

      "bodyText": "Fall of the Shah | BBC World Service How to Burn a Million Quid | BBC Radio 4 Historical drama. Two words that conjure up rustling skirts, rattling teacups, and an \u201cOh, Mr Pumperton, how could you?\u201d conversation taking place outdoors, possibly in a rose garden. (We\u2019re talking audio, so you can\u2019t tell.) But not all history takes place before 1900. There\u2019s an awful lot of history out there \u2013 more made every minute! \u2013 and our most recent provides plenty of real life drama to plunder. I bet you anything that David Hare, right this moment, is frantically writing and rewriting a play called The Last Days of Brexit\u2026 Which brings me to two new drama podcasts from the BBC. The first, Fall of the Shah, written by Steve Waters, begins in 1977, with the then US president Jimmy Carter aboard his presidential plane, off to visit Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran. Nathan Osgood plays the part of Carter, Bijan Daneshmand the Shah. The press blurb says the series stars Diana Rigg, but she\u2019s merely the narrator. There aren\u2019t too many juicy parts for women in the political arena of the 1970s; Carter\u2019s wife, Rosalynn, appears to be there simply to distract her husband from tricky conversations: \u201cJimmy, look, is that Mount Ararat?\u201d Anyhoo. We hear things mostly from Carter\u2019s point of view, though this is set to change as the nine-part serial progresses. Even in the first episode there are inserts indicating that Iran isn\u2019t as welcoming as Carter finds it. A man is taken into custody for shouting \u201cDeath to the Shah\u201d. Carter\u2019s aides give us quick, damning potted histories while still on the plane. And, \u201cHow hard it is to make out a country through a mass of flowers and smiles\u2026 Only a cynic could take such unforced love of the Shah as something compelled,\u201d says Rigg, who has been given a God-like overview. Among the flowers and smiles, and charmed by the Shah, naive Carter goes off-piste with his after-dinner speech. Essentially, he plays things too cosy. (Interesting parallels could be drawn with the contemporary president.) Those who remember what happened next know that Carter\u2019s warm words come back to haunt him. For the Shah is deposed, the Ayatollah Khomeini rises to power and Carter\u2019s friendship with the Shah triggers the Iran hostage crisis. Spoiler! Anyway, Fall of the Shah is exactly the type of drama at which the BBC excels. There is doomy, this-is-serious music. There are terrible accents. There is extemporising dialogue that nobody would ever say, eg \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta worry about a guy who thumbs through arms catalogues to relax.\u201d As drama, it\u2019s pretty bad. But as an easy way to recall and reassess history, it\u2019s good, and could be useful to school history students. I found it bizarrely relaxing, but then I listened to it while suffering the trauma of paying my tax return. So what of historical drama number two, How to Burn a Million Quid? This concerns history that I really do remember, namely genius pop meisters Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty\u2019s decision to burn \u00a31m in 1994. Or, at least, as near as \u00a31m as dammit (I know of a journalist who was part of the ceremonial nailing of the money to a wooden board, and who kept quite a lot of his allocation in his pocket). This is a funny drama series, perhaps a little overlong and detailed \u2013 do we really need to know about Drummond\u2019s failed pop band Brilliant? \u2013 but with an upbeat bravura that keeps you listening. It\u2019s quite nuts: dead people speak, music thrums throughout. And as you might have guessed, it\u2019s not merely about the million quid, but a history of the KLF/the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu/K Foundation, including all the wonderful chaos caused by this wonderfully chaotic band. As you listen, you remember, and you wonder: \u201cHow did this all happen?\u201d It seems even more outrageous today than back then, when the money burning was rejected by almost everyone as a terrible waste, and definitely not art \u2013 but the K Foundation did it anyway. \u201cThe worst decision of our lives,\u201d they think later.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago I found myself teaching a university class on evil. It was for third-year criminology students to help them contextualise theory and research within controversial current topics. It was a huge success. The debates were heated and interesting. I could see people\u2019s views change within the course of a single lecture.</p> <p>Over the past 13 years, as a student, lecturer and researcher, I\u2019ve enjoyed discussing the science of evil with anyone willing to listen. What I relish most is destroying the lazy clich\u00e9s of good and evil, and replacing them with nuance and scientific insight. We need a more informed way of discussing behaviour that at first we cannot, or should not, begin to understand.</p> <p>Without understanding, we risk dehumanising others, writing off human beings simply because we don\u2019t comprehend them. We must try to understand that which we have labelled evil. We tend to think evil is something that other people are. We think of ourselves as \u201cgood people\u201d, and even when we do morally reprehensible things, we understand the context of our decisions. With others, however, it is far easier to write them off. If their actions deviate substantially from what we consider acceptable, we may label them evil.</p> <p>We need to be careful with this. Calling someone evil is often akin to saying they cannot change, and perhaps aren\u2019t even a human at all. However, when you actually go monster-hunting, and you look deeply at the people behind horrific behaviour, you may be surprised.</p> <p>As a child I used to love the Scooby-Doo cartoons. Arriving in their \u201cMystery Machine\u201d, the gang would have to find a monster who was terrorising a neighbourhood. They would run around looking for clues and at the end unmask the villain. It was always a normal person in a costume. There were no monsters. Like the Scooby crew, we may find ourselves hunting for an easy fix, one word for people who do bad things. But if we take a good look, the word evil is insufficient \u2013 there are no simple explanations for why humans do bad things: instead there are many, and they are all marvellously nuanced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s easy to label people as evil, but everyone is capable of great harm</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although there may be differences between those who do \u201cbad\u201d things and those who don\u2019t, these are not fundamental. Acknowledging the similarities between all of us can be far more useful than aggressively highlighting the differences. Research from neuroscience and behavioural economics, psychology and criminology, history and politics all point to the same finding: everyone is capable of great harm. However, given its universal nature, maybe our capacity for deviance and harm can somehow be good for us.</p> <p>Evil is typically referred to when there is deviance from social norms: formal deviance is the violation of laws, like theft, murder, and assault, while informal deviance involves violations of social norms, like lying. Evil behaviour is typically thought to embrace one or both forms. However, deviance can also describe a behaviour that simply diverges from the norm.</p> <p>Perhaps this is where we can find the good side of our bad side. Deviating from the norm can make us villains, but it can also make us heroes. A child deviates from social pressures when they stand up for another child being bullied in school. A soldier deviates when they choose not to follow orders to kill an innocent civilian. An employee in a big tech company deviates when they blow the whistle. In authoritarian regimes, resistance or protest is deviant. In this sense, creativity is also a deviation. Here, too, things are complex. Thinking creatively has given us modern medicine, technology and modern political structures, but it has also given us cyanide, nuclear weapons and bots that threaten democracy. Great benefit and great harm can come from the same human tendency.</p> <p>In a research paper, <em><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614520714\" title=\"\">Evil Genius</a></em>, published in 2014, the behavioural scientists Francesca Gino and Scott Wiltermuth wanted to examine whether people who behave unethically in one task are more creative than others on a subsequent task, even after controlling for differences in baseline creative skills. The unethical behaviour they chose was dishonesty.</p> <p>Over five experiments researchers gave participants tasks in which they could cheat. In the first study, they were given matrixes and had to find two numbers that added up to 10. Participants were asked to self-report how well they did at the end of the study: 59% cheated by saying that they solved more matrixes than they actually had. In another experiment, using maths and logic questions, participants were told to press a space bar to stop the answer from popping up before they solved the question: 96% cheated by not pressing the space bar. </p> <p>After each task, the researchers measured participants\u2019 performance on the <a href=\"https://www.remote-associates-test.com/\" title=\"\">Remote Associates Test</a>. This shows participants three words at a time that appear to be unrelated, and the person has to think of a fourth word that is associated with all of them. For example you might get \u201cFox, Man, Peep\u201d, or \u201cDust, Cereal, Fish\u201d. In order to find the linking words (\u201cHole\u201d for the first, \u201cBowl\u201d for the second) you need to be creative. The more you get right, the more creative you are thought to be because you have come up with uncommon associations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Find logic games and cheat, play Scrabble with a dictionary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For every one of the five studies, they found the same thing \u2013 participants who cheated in the first task did better on the creativity task. Why? Like other forms of unethical behaviour, lying means breaking rules. It involves being deviant, going against the social principle that people should tell the truth. Similarly, being creative involves \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d, deviating from expectations. They involve similar thought patterns, so stimulating one stimulates the other.</p> <p>Can we learn from this? Perhaps. To be more creative, we could try lying in a controlled environment. Find online logic games and cheat at them, play Scrabble with a dictionary, or write a story about something that is untrue? Such tasks can get our brains thinking flexibly, beyond our normal comfort zone. This is not a call to become a pathological liar, but a controlled liar.</p> <p>Breaking the rules to encourage creativity is echoed by the slogan \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, often associated with an entrepreneurial climate notorious for creativity and progress \u2013 Silicon Valley. New generation workspaces often intentionally create physical and social structures that are abnormal. This controlled \u201cdeviance\u201d can stimulate new connections, brave new ideas.</p> <p>Of course, this can go too far. Some tech companies have certainly deviated from, or broken the rules, in ways that have negative impacts beyond Silicon Valley. It makes the other famous slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d seem almost sarcastic. Perhaps rapid creativity cannot exist without occasional wrongdoing, or perhaps we need to make sure that when ideas are turned into action, we re-engage our less deviant thinking.</p> <p>In addition to benefits for creativity, deviance can be a good thing in other ways. Even Philip Zimbardo, the author of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/30/sundance-2015-review-the-stanford-prison-experiment\" title=\"\">Stanford prison</a> experiment, who showed how easily we can be led to behave badly, believes that the future of deviance research may lie more in understanding extreme pro-social behaviour, such as heroism. Like evil, we often view heroism as only a possibility for outliers \u2013 for people who are abnormal. But Zimbardo asks: \u201cWhat if the capability to act heroically is also fundamentally ordinary and available to all of us?\u201d Some say we should never meet our heroes, lest they disappoint us when we find out how normal they are. But this should be liberating, not disappointing. We are all capable of behaving like outliers. It\u2019s time for us to demystify deviance, and realise its potential for good as well as harm.</p> <h2>How to be more creative</h2> <p>\u2022 Free yourself from the concept of evil. All people, including you, are capable of great harm. Deviate from what the rest of the world is saying, and avoid dehumanising others.</p> <p>\u2022 Realise that to be creative is to be deviant. Unfettered thinking is important, but reapply your morality when you turn your ideas into action.</p> <p>\u2022 Harness your inner hero. Internalising the realisation that you too can be a hero makes it more likely that you will use your deviant power to help others.</p> <p><em>Making Evil by Julia Shaw (Canongate, \u00a314.99) is available for \u00a313.19 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/making-evil.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p>",

This shows participants three words at a time that appear to be unrelated, and the person has to think of a fourth word that is associated with all of them. For example you might get \u201cFox, Man, Peep\u201d, or \u201cDust, Cereal, Fish\u201d. In order to find the linking words (\u201cHole\u201d for the first, \u201cBowl\u201d for the second) you need to be creative. The more you get right, the more creative you are thought to be because you have come up with uncommon associations. For every one of the five studies, they found the same thing \u2013 participants who cheated in the first task did better on the creativity task. Why? Like other forms of unethical behaviour, lying means breaking rules. It involves being deviant, going against the social principle that people should tell the truth. Similarly, being creative involves \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d, deviating from expectations. They involve similar thought patterns, so stimulating one stimulates the other. Can we learn from this? Perhaps. To be more creative, we could try lying in a controlled environment. Find online logic games and cheat at them, play Scrabble with a dictionary, or write a story about something that is untrue? Such tasks can get our brains thinking flexibly, beyond our normal comfort zone. This is not a call to become a pathological liar, but a controlled liar. Breaking the rules to encourage creativity is echoed by the slogan \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, often associated with an entrepreneurial climate notorious for creativity and progress \u2013 Silicon Valley. New generation workspaces often intentionally create physical and social structures that are abnormal. This controlled \u201cdeviance\u201d can stimulate new connections, brave new ideas. Of course, this can go too far. Some tech companies have certainly deviated from, or broken the rules, in ways that have negative impacts beyond Silicon Valley. It makes the other famous slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d seem almost sarcastic. Perhaps rapid creativity cannot exist without occasional wrongdoing, or perhaps we need to make sure that when ideas are turned into action, we re-engage our less deviant thinking. In addition to benefits for creativity, deviance can be a good thing in other ways. Even Philip Zimbardo, the author of the Stanford prison experiment, who showed how easily we can be led to behave badly, believes that the future of deviance research may lie more in understanding extreme pro-social behaviour, such as heroism. Like evil, we often view heroism as only a possibility for outliers \u2013 for people who are abnormal. But Zimbardo asks: \u201cWhat if the capability to act heroically is also fundamentally ordinary and available to all of us?\u201d Some say we should never meet our heroes, lest they disappoint us when we find out how normal they are. But this should be liberating, not disappointing. We are all capable of behaving like outliers. It\u2019s time for us to demystify deviance, and realise its potential for good as well as harm. How to be more creative \u2022 Free yourself from the concept of evil. All people, including you, are capable of great harm. Deviate from what the rest of the world is saying, and avoid dehumanising others. \u2022 Realise that to be creative is to be deviant. Unfettered thinking is important, but reapply your morality when you turn your ideas into action. \u2022 Harness your inner hero. Internalising the realisation that you too can be a hero makes it more likely that you will use your deviant power to help others.

      "body": "<p>Aoife Abbey\u2019s book, <em>Seven Signs of Life</em>, chronicles the emotional highs and lows of her life as an intensive care doctor. The daughter of a nurse, she grew up in Dublin and graduated from medical school at the University of Warwick in 2011. Now 35, she was until recently the anonymous author of a blog, <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/connecting-doctors/b/the-secret-doctor\" title=\"\">The Secret Doctor</a>, for the British Medical Association, which was read fortnightly by more than half a million people. She is now working in a hospital in Coventry.</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be a doctor?</strong><br>Yes, although I find it hard to say exactly why. I suppose the most obvious link to my childhood is that my older brother, Aaron [who died last October], was often unwell when we were growing up so I spent a lot of time in hospitals. Being exposed at such a young age to the lives and work of doctors must have had a big influence on me.</p> <p><strong>What inspired you to start writing</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I\u2019d been qualified just over a year when I had an encounter with a patient, a young girl who was the same age as me, who had a brain tumour. She asked me if it was going to shorten her life and I felt I had to give her an honest answer, which was yes. I was deeply affected by that conversation and couldn\u2019t stop ruminating on it, so I decided to write it all down. I sent what I wrote into the BMA magazine and they published it. Not long after, they asked me if I wanted to take over as The Secret Doctor.</p> <p><strong>What did you get out of writing</strong><strong>?</strong><br>There were lots of situations \u2013 relationships, human encounters \u2013 that I was experiencing in my work that required much more from me than purely medical expertise. Writing about them helped me to figure out what they meant and made me feel. Doctors don\u2019t really discuss these things among themselves or with the public in an open way.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to tell the stories in the book through </strong><strong>seven emotions: distraction, fear, grief, joy, hope, anger and disgust?</strong><br>Because juggling these kinds of feelings is an everyday part of being a doctor. As far as the stories I had to tell were concerned, what they had in common was that they all made me feel something very strongly and I realised that the only way I could organise them in a book was according to how they made me feel.</p> <p><strong>You certainly don\u2019t portray yourself as a saint. You are often angry, crabby, annoyed, indecisive. Was this deliberate?</strong><br>Absolutely. I wanted to be honest. In a way the book is in direct contrast to some wonderful memoirs by older and wiser doctors like Henry Marsh [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/30/do-no-harm-stories-brain-surgery-review-henry-marsh\" title=\"\"><em>Do No Harm</em></a>] and Paul Kalanithi [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/15/when-breath-becomes-air-review-memoir-paul-kalanithi-cancer-diagnosis\" title=\"\"><em>When Breath Becomes Air</em></a>], who are looking back. I was trying to chronicle the real experiences of a doctor at the beginning of her working life. If I don\u2019t look back on it in 10 years\u2019 time and say, actually, I would behave differently now, I know better now, then I probably haven\u2019t done it right. I felt like it was important to get the stories down while they were fresh. I wrote a lot of them the very same day.</p> <p><strong>Your chapter headings convey more negative than positive emotions. Joy and hope are present but they are outweighed by grief, anger, disgust, fear. Does that balance reflect your feelings about the work</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Being a doctor is not like in the movies. The situations you find yourself in are very complex and give rise to multiple emotions. In the course of an afternoon I might feel raw fear at having to intubate an obese patient who\u2019s had a myocardial infarction [heart attack]; or have to overcome disgust at caring for a convicted rapist; or I could feel exhilarated and sad at the same time when a patient with dementia who\u2019s normally silent confesses to being lonely. So, yes, I have a job where I encounter difficult situations, but the emotions it stirs up are neither positive nor negative, they are just part of being alive, I think. I try to appreciate every situation I find myself in as an opportunity to learn more about what it means to be human.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about being an intensive care</strong><strong> doctor?</strong><br>You can always make a difference to somebody. It might just be something small, like listening to them. It might be taking into consideration the kind of death that they want, if you can\u2019t save their life.</p> <p><strong>You quote widely from literature, from WB Yeats and TS Eliot to Raymond Carver. Is reading poetry and fiction a source of solace for you?</strong><br>Oh yes, absolutely. I have always loved reading, whether it is classics or contemporary novels by Eimear McBride, Sally Rooney, Julian Barnes, Max Porter. When I\u2019m writing I so often think of the way my favourite writers express themselves. There are a lot of beautiful writers out there who can help you explain how you feel.</p> <p><strong>How else do you wind down</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I take a lot of baths.</p> <p><strong>Can you see yourself in the job in 10 years\u2019 time?</strong><br>Yes. I see this as my career for the long term. Burnout is a massive fear, though. There is a growing need for doctors to appreciate that wellness is a construct they have to embrace. We need to find ways to do our job as well as we are able while also being kind to ourselves.</p> <p><strong>How hard have the austerity years hit you and your colleagues in the NHS?</strong><br>There are a lot of issues today, all of them related to funding.

That can be quite hard. I guess part of me thinks that if I didn\u2019t have to move so much then it would be easier to have relationships that you can keep going.

      "body": "<p>A unicorn, as every schoolchild knows, is a legendary creature \u2013 a horse with a single pointed, spiralling horn projecting from its forehead. As far as we know, nobody has ever seen one. Why, then, is the tech commentariat apparently obsessed with the creatures? The answer is that the term was commandeered in 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.techworld.com/startups/what-is-tech-unicorn-3638723/\" title=\"\">Aileen Lee</a>, a venture capitalist, to describe privately held tech startups that have achieved a valuation of $1bn or more.</p> <p>These strange creatures have been proliferating like rabbits. At the last count, there are <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies\" title=\"\">more than 300</a> of them worldwide with a cumulative value of around $1,050bn (\u00a3803bn). The majority are based in a few countries. China, with more than 130, has the largest unicorn population, followed by the US (85), India (20) and the UK (seven) and a longish tail of other countries.</p> <p>Some unicorns have astonishing valuations, which are based on the price that new investors are willing to pay for a share. Uber, for example, currently has a valuation in the region of $80bn (\u00a361bn) and there is feverish speculation that when it eventually goes for an initial public offering (IPO) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/16/uber-targets-120bn-valuation-2019-flotation-report\" title=\"\">it could be valued at $120bn</a> (\u00a391bn). This for a company that has never made anywhere near a profit and currently loses money at an eye-watering rate. If this reminds you of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, then join the club.</p> <p>There is, however, one significant difference. The dotcom boom was based on clueless and irrational exuberance about the commercial potential of the internet, so when it became clear that startups such as Boo.com and Pets.com were never likely to make a profit, the bubble burst as investors tried to get out. But investors in Uber probably don\u2019t care if it never makes a profit, so long as it gets to an IPO that enables them to cash out with a big payoff. If Uber did go public at a valuation of $120bn, for example, the Saudi royal family alone would have a $16bn (\u00a312bn) payday from their investment.</p> <p>So what\u2019s going on? Some answers are provided in <a href=\"https://kenney.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/332/2018/11/Unicorns-Chesire-cats-and-new-dilemmas-of-entrepreneurial-finance-1.pdf\" title=\"\">Unicorns, Cheshire Cats and the New Dilemmas of Entrepreneurial Finance</a>, a fascinating paper by two academics, Martin Kenney and John Zysman. If you\u2019re puzzled by the reference to Cheshire cats, stay tuned.</p> <p>Kenney and Zysman recount what happened after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. When the dust had settled, it became clear that advances in digital infrastructure had made it much easier to start tech companies. No need to buy servers (just rent time on Amazon Web Services), for example, or to write whole new software systems from scratch (just leverage free open source code). All you needed at the beginning was a small group of geeks; and there was no need for the kind of initial massive initial funding that the fatuous dotcoms absorbed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You need money, tons of it, which you have to spend like water to undercut incumbent firms that you plan to eliminate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So there was a kind of \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of new startups, many of them, such as Uber and Airbnb, based on the insight that markets where digital platforms operate are winners-take-all (WTA) ones. And when you\u2019re the winner who takes all, then you\u2019re a monopoly, with all the commercial benefits that might accrue.</p> <p>The corollary, though, is that you have to grow so fast that you get to be the winner. And for that you need money, tons of it, which you have to spend like water to undercut incumbent firms that you plan to disrupt and eliminate. In that quest, you need to be both ruthless and profligate, because those incumbents are normal firms that have to make profits \u2013 a tiresome obligation that does not trouble you. So the deal you offer to investors is this: you give us shedloads of money and stick with us until we get to be the winner that takes all. And then you can cash out.</p> <p>And that, in a nutshell, is what is happening. In the process, incumbents are wiped out, because they cannot match your predatory pricing. In some cases that may be a good thing because incumbents can sometimes be lazy or corrupt. But in other cases the collateral damage \u2013 in terms of jobs, social dislocation and tax revenues \u2013 may be terrible.</p> <p>Kenney and Zysman are too judicious to claim that the unicorn investment racket is definitely a bubble. My guess is that it is, which means that it\u2019s worth thinking about what happens after the bust. What will be its legacy?</p> <p>And here\u2019s where the Cheshire Cat comes in. When the dotcom bubble burst, one of the things it left behind was the colossal fibre-optic communications infrastructure that had been built at the height of the frenzy. This was what enabled the ensuing rollout of wired and wireless broadband and the exploitation of smartphone technology. So something good emerged from the madness.</p> <p>But when the unicorn bubble bursts? Since it hasn\u2019t built much, all that will be left is... the grin. Just like in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading</h2> <p><strong>The old firm<br></strong>The economist John Kay has posted <a href=\"https://www.johnkay.com/2019/01/21/the-concept-of-the-corporation-2/\" title=\"\">a really thoughtful essay</a> on the concept of the corporation.</p> <p><strong>See no evil?<br></strong>YouTube already knows how to stop serving toxic videos, <a href=\"https://hmmdaily.com/2018/12/12/youtube-already-knows-how-to-stop-serving-toxic-videos/\" title=\"\">reports the blog Hmm Daily</a>.

      "bodyText": "A unicorn, as every schoolchild knows, is a legendary creature \u2013 a horse with a single pointed, spiralling horn projecting from its forehead. As far as we know, nobody has ever seen one. Why, then, is the tech commentariat apparently obsessed with the creatures? The answer is that the term was commandeered in 2013 by Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist, to describe privately held tech startups that have achieved a valuation of $1bn or more. These strange creatures have been proliferating like rabbits. At the last count, there are more than 300 of them worldwide with a cumulative value of around $1,050bn (\u00a3803bn). The majority are based in a few countries. China, with more than 130, has the largest unicorn population, followed by the US (85), India (20) and the UK (seven) and a longish tail of other countries. Some unicorns have astonishing valuations, which are based on the price that new investors are willing to pay for a share. Uber, for example, currently has a valuation in the region of $80bn (\u00a361bn) and there is feverish speculation that when it eventually goes for an initial public offering (IPO) it could be valued at $120bn (\u00a391bn). This for a company that has never made anywhere near a profit and currently loses money at an eye-watering rate. If this reminds you of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, then join the club. There is, however, one significant difference. The dotcom boom was based on clueless and irrational exuberance about the commercial potential of the internet, so when it became clear that startups such as Boo.com and Pets.com were never likely to make a profit, the bubble burst as investors tried to get out. But investors in Uber probably don\u2019t care if it never makes a profit, so long as it gets to an IPO that enables them to cash out with a big payoff. If Uber did go public at a valuation of $120bn, for example, the Saudi royal family alone would have a $16bn (\u00a312bn) payday from their investment. So what\u2019s going on? Some answers are provided in Unicorns, Cheshire Cats and the New Dilemmas of Entrepreneurial Finance, a fascinating paper by two academics, Martin Kenney and John Zysman. If you\u2019re puzzled by the reference to Cheshire cats, stay tuned. Kenney and Zysman recount what happened after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. When the dust had settled, it became clear that advances in digital infrastructure had made it much easier to start tech companies. No need to buy servers (just rent time on Amazon Web Services), for example, or to write whole new software systems from scratch (just leverage free open source code). All you needed at the beginning was a small group of geeks; and there was no need for the kind of initial massive initial funding that the fatuous dotcoms absorbed. So there was a kind of \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d of new startups, many of them, such as Uber and Airbnb, based on the insight that markets where digital platforms operate are winners-take-all (WTA) ones. And when you\u2019re the winner who takes all, then you\u2019re a monopoly, with all the commercial benefits that might accrue. The corollary, though, is that you have to grow so fast that you get to be the winner. And for that you need money, tons of it, which you have to spend like water to undercut incumbent firms that you plan to disrupt and eliminate. In that quest, you need to be both ruthless and profligate, because those incumbents are normal firms that have to make profits \u2013 a tiresome obligation that does not trouble you. So the deal you offer to investors is this: you give us shedloads of money and stick with us until we get to be the winner that takes all. And then you can cash out. And that, in a nutshell, is what is happening. In the process, incumbents are wiped out, because they cannot match your predatory pricing. In some cases that may be a good thing because incumbents can sometimes be lazy or corrupt. But in other cases the collateral damage \u2013 in terms of jobs, social dislocation and tax revenues \u2013 may be terrible. Kenney and Zysman are too judicious to claim that the unicorn investment racket is definitely a bubble. My guess is that it is, which means that it\u2019s worth thinking about what happens after the bust. What will be its legacy? And here\u2019s where the Cheshire Cat comes in. When the dotcom bubble burst, one of the things it left behind was the colossal fibre-optic communications infrastructure that had been built at the height of the frenzy. This was what enabled the ensuing rollout of wired and wireless broadband and the exploitation of smartphone technology. So something good emerged from the madness. But when the unicorn bubble bursts? Since it hasn\u2019t built much, all that will be left is... the grin. Just like in Alice in Wonderland. What I\u2019m reading The old firm The economist John Kay has posted a really thoughtful essay on the concept of the corporation. See no evil? YouTube already knows how to stop serving toxic videos, reports the blog Hmm Daily. So why doesn\u2019t it do it? Who are you looking at? The end of trust? That\u2019s the theme of an absorbing new special issue of McSweeney\u2019s magazine, produced in collaboration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It features more than 30 writers and artists exploring surveillance in the digital age.",

I watch groups of young men on the piste ski past me and can\u2019t help feeling middle-aged. The last time I was here was on a stag-do in nearby Soldeu with a bunch of mates. Fast forward 13 years, and I\u2019m back with the groom and our three teenage sons. Times have changed. No more beery nights with the lads, the plan is a different sort of male-bonding experience; fathers and sons on the piste. We\u2019re staying for five nights in El Tarter, opting for half-board at Neilson\u2019s Hotel Del Clos, 350m from the chair lifts to the pistes. El Tarter is very much a family resort and Hotel Del Clos has a friendly, relaxed atmosphere, cr\u00e8che, games room and good-sized bedrooms, and for the ski-weary, an impressive range of spa treatments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"221561be402bfca2744c24e54bbf163306c8f830\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/221561be402bfca2744c24e54bbf163306c8f830/317_296_4664_2798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spinners\u2019 greatest hits: pizza making in Trattoria Pasta Che Vuoi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spinners\u2019 greatest hits \u2026 pizza-making in Trattoria Pasta Che Vuoi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nat Montane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only 1.5km from Soldeu, the resort is part of the huge <a href=\"https://www.grandvalira.com/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_YPnqcyB4AIVRrTtCh2sWAwFEAAYASAAEgL2b_D_BwE\" title=\"\">Grandvalira</a> area formed in 2003, giving skiers access to 128 pistes stretching 210km.

That\u2019s in addition to the six other Academy Award nominations it received.</p> <p>It was good news for Bob Iger, the Walt Disney Company\u2019s chief executive, ahead of what could be a challenging year for the media group as it prepares to face up to Netflix with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/24/netflix-market-leader-apple-disney-launch-streaming-services-roma\" title=\"\">launch of a new streaming service</a>.</p> <p>The immediate concerns this week, however, will be the announcement of first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors have already been warned of a difficult three months. Last November, Walt Disney\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said that pre-tax profits this year could be down by as much as $600m compared with last year, when the company had a run of successful films such as <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> and <em>Coco</em>.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600m versus 2018,\u201d McCarthy said.</p> <p>Investors will no doubt be interested in any details that may emerge from Tuesday\u2019s live audio webcast about the upcoming streaming service, called Disney+.</p> <p>Aiming to challenge Netflix head on, the new venture will be the third in the Disney stable after ESPN+ and Hulu, and will feature original movies and films from Disney brands such as Marvel and Pixar.</p> <p>Iger has said that one of the target markets will be superfans of franchises such as <em>Star Wars</em>. There will be five key franchises at the heart of the service: Marvel, Pixar, Disney, National Geographic and <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5101ecab77985fa5017d15201a090a40863a594d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5101ecab77985fa5017d15201a090a40863a594d/1868_458_524_655/400.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The move is being seen as a significant bet on streaming by Disney, which is trying to face down the challenge that Netflix has thrown up to traditional media companies in the past few years. </p> <p>Netflix added <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/17/netflix-adds-subscribers-stock-falls-fourth-quarter-earnings\" title=\"\">8.8 million paid subscribers</a> in the last quarter, up 34% compared with a year earlier, as it launched hits including the movies <em>Bird Box</em> and <em>Roma</em> and the series <em>You</em>, <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> and <em>Sex Education</em>. The company said <em>Bird Box</em>, starring Sandra Bullock, had been viewed by 80 million subscribers in four weeks since it was released over the Christmas holidays.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s subscriber base now stands at 139 million. While the streaming service\u2019s growth has slowed in the US, it remains strong in emerging international markets such as India and Mexico.</p> <p>However, a decision to increase subscription prices has caused market analysts to debate how fast and how far Netflix can use subscription pricing to offset the billions it is pouring into content acquisition. Disney is not alone in attempting to tackle the giant that Netflix has become. AT&amp;T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal are also expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/01/is-this-the-end-of-netflixs-golden-age\" title=\"\">new entrants in pay-streaming</a>.</p> <p>On a conference call last month, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said that he was not concerned about the new competition as US consumers spend a total of about one billion hours a day watching video.</p> <p>\u201cThey have great content,\u201d Hastings said of Disney, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for their launch, and maybe they grow over a couple years to 50 million hours a day, but that\u2019s out of the billion.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "There were celebrations in the House of Mouse when the Oscar nominations were announced, and for good reason \u2013 Black Panther had become the first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture. That\u2019s in addition to the six other Academy Award nominations it received. It was good news for Bob Iger, the Walt Disney Company\u2019s chief executive, ahead of what could be a challenging year for the media group as it prepares to face up to Netflix with the launch of a new streaming service. The immediate concerns this week, however, will be the announcement of first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors have already been warned of a difficult three months. Last November, Walt Disney\u2019s chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said that pre-tax profits this year could be down by as much as $600m compared with last year, when the company had a run of successful films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. \u201cGiven the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600m versus 2018,\u201d McCarthy said. Investors will no doubt be interested in any details that may emerge from Tuesday\u2019s live audio webcast about the upcoming streaming service, called Disney+. Aiming to challenge Netflix head on, the new venture will be the third in the Disney stable after ESPN+ and Hulu, and will feature original movies and films from Disney brands such as Marvel and Pixar. Iger has said that one of the target markets will be superfans of franchises such as Star Wars. There will be five key franchises at the heart of the service: Marvel, Pixar, Disney, National Geographic and Star Wars. The move is being seen as a significant bet on streaming by Disney, which is trying to face down the challenge that Netflix has thrown up to traditional media companies in the past few years. Netflix added 8.8 million paid subscribers in the last quarter, up 34% compared with a year earlier, as it launched hits including the movies Bird Box and Roma and the series You, The Haunting of Hill House and Sex Education. The company said Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock, had been viewed by 80 million subscribers in four weeks since it was released over the Christmas holidays. Netflix\u2019s subscriber base now stands at 139 million. While the streaming service\u2019s growth has slowed in the US, it remains strong in emerging international markets such as India and Mexico. However, a decision to increase subscription prices has caused market analysts to debate how fast and how far Netflix can use subscription pricing to offset the billions it is pouring into content acquisition. Disney is not alone in attempting to tackle the giant that Netflix has become. AT&amp;T\u2019s WarnerMedia and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal are also expected to launch new entrants in pay-streaming. On a conference call last month, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said that he was not concerned about the new competition as US consumers spend a total of about one billion hours a day watching video. \u201cThey have great content,\u201d Hastings said of Disney, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for their launch, and maybe they grow over a couple years to 50 million hours a day, but that\u2019s out of the billion.\u201d",

But it was not a spontaneous act of recklessness by a dim-witted thrill-seeker; it was a premeditated act of recklessness by a fairly intelligent and thoughtful thrill-seeker who spent years preparing, understood the risks, including to his own life, and believed his purpose on Earth was to bring Christ to the island he considered \u201cSatan\u2019s last stronghold\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/john-allen-chau-man-killed-by-tribe-north-sentinel-island-declare-jesus\">Man killed on remote Indian island tried to 'declare Jesus' to tribe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Chau was born in Alabama but grew up in Vancouver, Washington, near the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. He was raised by a Chinese father, a psychiatrist, and an American mother, an attorney, with two siblings. As a child he was consumed by two passions that became increasingly intertwined: outdoor adventure and Jesus Christ.</p> <p>\u201c[W]hen I was a little kid,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theoutbound.com/theoutbound/explorer-spotlight-john-allen-chau\">recalled in 2015</a>, \u201cmy family went camping\u201d; during \u201cthat time of my life, I had a habit of eating wild things not meant for humans to eat, like bright red or stark white berries\u201d. Consequently he \u201cdestroyed several sleeping bags that night. My family stopped going on camping trips after that.\u201d</p> <p>He loved survival stories, like Hatchet, Gary Paulsen\u2019s gritty young adult novel about a boy forced to live off the land after crash-landing in the Alaskan wilderness. He came to count as heroes the naturalist John Muir, the explorer-missionary David Livingstone, and Bruce Olson, famous in the missionary community for converting the Bari people of South America.</p> <p>Chau was raised in a Christian home and his family appear to have been members of the Assemblies of God, an international Pentecostal church whose members sometimes speak in tongues. He attended Vancouver Christian high school, a close-knit school with just 90 students across seven grades.</p> <p>A natural overachiever, he thrived. He threw himself into clubs, charities and other extracurriculars. In the Royal Rangers, a Pentecostal scouting organization, he achieved a gold medal of achievement, a rank equivalent to Eagle scout; one of the medal\u2019s requirements is reading or listening to the entire Bible.</p> <p>He loved hiking<strong>,</strong> camping and travel, and he meticulously documented his exploration on social media. On Facebook, he was fond of quoting Jim Elliot, one of <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/november-web-only/john-allen-chau-jim-elliot-missionary-martyr-dilemma.html\">five missionaries killed</a> by a tribe in Ecuador in 1956.</p> <p>A mission trip to Mexico during high school was particularly formative. When he returned, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE1S47JjkGw\">gave a short homily</a> on his experiences. \u201cWe can\u2019t be lukewarm,\u201d he argued, shifting nervously but speaking with conviction. \u201cWe need to know how to defend our faith.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we go out in our world, there are people that\u2019ll just come and oppose us, and they\u2019ll have questions, and they\u2019ll have arguments \u2026 We can\u2019t just, like, go out there unprepared. We need to know what we believe and why we believe it.\u201d</p> <p>It seems inevitable that Chau\u2019s personality \u2013 God-fearing, outdoors-loving, and obsessed with pushing himself to extremes \u2013 would be attracted to being a missionary. He first read about the Sentinelese during high school, according to the New York Times, on a missionary database called the Joshua Project.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/20694/IN\">Joshua Project entry</a> for the Sentinelese describes them as \u201cextremely isolated\u201d and notes that the Indian government bans access to North Sentinel. The website suggests praying for the Indian government to allow Christians \u201cto earn the trust of the Sentinelese people\u201d and \u201clive among them\u201d.</p> <p>In addition to \u201cbasic medical care\u201d, the Sentinelese \u201cneed to know that the Creator God exists, and that He loves them and paid the price for their sins\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3c3132048eb3c9c60c367c499a79c50acc6b746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c3132048eb3c9c60c367c499a79c50acc6b746/0_0_5004_3243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oklahoma, Tulsa, Oral Roberts University, Prayer Hands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Chau and his father attended Oral Roberts University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Education Images/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like his son, Dr Patrick Chau is a graduate of Oral Roberts, an evangelical university in Oklahoma. I had thought he might want to defend evangelical doctrines against the unsympathetic media coverage sparked by his son\u2019s death. In an email, however, he called religion \u201cthe opium of the mass[es]\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have [anything] positive to say about religion,\u201d he told me, \u201cl wish not to see or hear\u201d it. He said his son\u2019s zeal was a longstanding point of contention and that they\u2019d agreed not to talk about John\u2019s missionary work.</p> <p>\u201cJohn is gone because the Western ideology overpowered my [Confucian] influence,\u201d he said. He blamed evangelicals\u2019 \u201cextreme Christianity\u201d for pushing his child to a \u201cnot unexpected end\u201d, and he referred with particular bitterness to the Great Commission, Jesus\u2019s injunction that Christians spread the gospel to all peoples.</p> <p>Like Patrick Chau, Justin Graves, a pastor and a friend of John\u2019s from linguistics school, has blamed evangelical culture for enabling Chau\u2019s death. \u201cJohn Chau was a good man,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHe was a loving, passionate individual I was blessed to befriend, and the loss of his light on this earth was devastating. But it cannot be left as a mere tragedy. His death brings to light a multitude of issues with Evangelical views\u201d and \u201chell-based ethics\u201d.</p> <p>John Middleton Ramsey, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a fellow evangelical, defended his actions. \u201cHis motivation was love for the [Sentinelese] people,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you believe in heaven and hell then what he did was the most loving thing anyone could do.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cA lot of people have said these people obviously want to be left alone, so we should respect their wishes. Well my ancestors were also savages that wanted to be left alone. I\u2019m sure glad missionaries like [Saints] Kilian and Boniface stepped up and were willing to give their lives, and that I don\u2019t live in a society like that any more.\u201d</p> <p>The United States sends the most Christian missionaries abroad of any country, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/20/in-200-year-tradition-mo_n_1288899.html\">according to Reuters</a> \u2013 almost 130,000 in 2010. Although many denominations send missionaries, the most visible are Mormons \u2013 70,000 per year, <a href=\"https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program\">according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> \u2013 and evangelical Protestants.</p> <p>A large and sophisticated apparatus exists to assist Americans interested in proselytizing. The universe includes organizations like <a href=\"https://www.worldventure.com/\">WorldVenture</a>, which provides support services, training, and life insurance for missionaries, and <a href=\"https://www.wycliffe.org/\">Wycliffe</a>, which is working to translate the Bible into every language. Databases such as <a href=\"https://peoplegroups.org/\">People Groups</a> and the <a href=\"https://joshuaproject.net/\">Joshua Project</a> gather information on what evangelicals call \u201cunreached people groups\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can\u2019t just, like, go out there unprepared.

The conservative university forbids smoking, drinking, swearing, and any kind of sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage. </p> <p>Chau traveled frequently. He spent one summer during college at a Christian soccer academy in South Africa. After graduating in 2014, he went on a trip to Kurdistan to do outreach to refugees<strong>,</strong> as well as a trip to Israel <a href=\"https://www.covenantjourney.org/details/john-allen-chau\">sponsored</a> by Covenant Journey, an organization founded by the rightwing Christian activist Mat Staver.</p> <p>John Middleton Ramsey met Chau in Israel. He was relaxed and \u201ceasy to connect with\u201d, Ramsey recalled, and \u201cpreferred one-on-one conversation as opposed to larger groups\u201d. He was \u201cgood-looking and received a fair share of female attention, but very humble\u201d.</p> <p>Chau avoided romantic entanglement, believing it irresponsible given the risks of his mission to North Sentinel, and forwent full-time employment in order to focus on preparing. He did a National Outdoor Leadership School course, trained as an emergency medical technician, and stayed in shape. He spent three summers at Whiskeytown national recreation area in California, working as a ranger and emergency nurse and living alone in a small cabin.</p> <p>He was a good photographer and never failed to document his love of nature on Instagram. \u201cMet new friends, watched spectacular sunrises and sunsets, and marveled at the the beautiful creation around us that we are all called to care for,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcjNPvrh44G/\">he wrote after one excursion</a>. His adventures began to earn him social media followers. A beef jerky company asked to sponsor him as an influencer.</p> <p>These outdoor expeditions sometimes got dangerous. Once <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BUbBruHB3nq/\">he almost died</a> \u2013 thanks to \u201ca gnarly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/johnachau/p/BZT5apDBRVt/\">bite from a rattlesnake</a> and a subsequent platelet count of 10\u201d. On another occasion, he and two friends got lost during a 14-day trek.

He made contacts in the local Christian community but did not visit North Sentinel.</p> <p>In 2017 he was accepted to a boot camp run by <a href=\"http://allnations.us/about-us/vision-mission/\">All Nations</a>, a Kansas City organization that works to see Jesus \u201cworshipped by every tongue, tribe and nation\u201d. <a href=\"http://allnations.us/train-and-go/senders-u/\">All Nations urges Christians</a> to inculcate a \u201cwartime mentality\u201d and \u201cmake strategic decisions in the battle we\u2019re waging against a real enemy\u201d.</p> <p>One of the bootcamp\u2019s exercises, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/asia/john-chau-andaman-missionary.html\">reported</a>, involved navigating a mock village peopled by missionaries pretending to be hostile natives, with fake spears. All Nations\u2019 leader, Mary Ho, told the Times that Chau was one of the best trainees the program ever had.</p> <p>That year he also attended a program at the Canada Institute of Linguistics, a missionary language school. There he befriended another student, Ben S, who was struck by his \u201cquiet determination\u201d and \u201cconfidence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWas it his faith?\u201d <a href=\"https://allnationsbibletranslation.org/blog/unreached-people-groups/why-my-friend-died\">Ben wondered in a post</a> remembering his friend. \u201cWas it his years of mountaineering and extensive emergency medical training? Probably all of this factored in\u201d \u2013 Chau \u201cwas just the kind of person who inspires your confidence and trust\u201d.</p> <p>One night in the computer lab, Chau told Ben of \u201chis burden\u201d to save the Sentinelese.</p> <p>\u201cI was impressed immediately that this was something no one but God alone could relieve him of,\u201d Ben writes. \u201cHe had already heard all the arguments of why this was a fool\u2019s errand and would jeopardize any mission associated with it, let alone the [lives] of the individuals involved.\u201d This \u201cwas a sacred trust for him that no amount of reasoning would wrest from his grasp\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In October, Chau traveled on a tourist visa to Port Blair, the Andaman islands\u2019 regional capital, and took up residence in what he described as a \u201csafe house\u201d.</p> <p>There he assembled an \u201cinitial contact response kit\u201d \u2013 including picture cards for communication, bandages and dental forceps for removing arrows \u2013 and gifts for the Sentinelese: tweezers, scissors, cord, safety pins, fish hooks. </p> <p>He carefully documented his activities in a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/502-chau-journal-entries/7de864403d564f03e200/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">handwritten diary</a>. The resulting, 13-page testament \u2013 written with the earnestness and self-consciousness of someone who had digested many missionary and anthropologist accounts of indigenous contact and knew he might be writing for posterity \u2013 recounts his final days in fascinating and tragic detail.</p> <p>Hoping it would lessen the risk of accidentally infecting the Sentinelese, he entered a self-imposed quarantine. For 11 days he went without direct sunlight. He prayed, exercised, and read The Lives of the Three Mrs Judsons, a 19th-century missionary account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8c3913671470c90586b3c14c5616ad01ff04fba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c3913671470c90586b3c14c5616ad01ff04fba/0_28_3536_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Allen Chau, originally from Washington State.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Chau: \u2018You guys might think I\u2019m crazy in all this but I think it\u2019s worth it to declare Jesus to these people.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the night of 14 November, he and some fishermen \u2013 Christians who had agreed to help \u2013 set out in darkness for North Sentinel, carefully avoiding coastguard vessels. Their journey was illuminated by glowing plankton, Chau wrote, and around them fish jumped \u201clike darting mermaids\u201d. They reached North Sentinel late at night and anchored nearby.</p> <p>The next morning, 15 November, he made his first approach. The fishermen refused to go any closer to the island, so he stripped to his underwear \u2013 he thought it would make the Sentinelese more at ease, <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-man-killed-in-andamans-wanted-to-blend-with-tribals-stay-on-their-island/story-WbgPKkz2kmNZzQt17uyj8O.html\">the fishermen later said</a> \u2013 and paddled a kayak toward the shore.</p> <p>He saw a hut and some dugout canoes. As he paddled up to the beach, several Sentinelese, faces painted yellow and speaking a language of \u201chigh-pitched sounds\u201d, came rushing out.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is John,\u201d he shouted from his kayak<strong>.</strong> \u201cI love you, and Jesus loves you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Wondering if it\u2019ll be the last sunset I see before being in the place where the sun never sets</p> <footer> <cite>John Chau, in his diary</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the islanders began stringing their bows, he panicked. He threw toward them some fish he had brought as a gift, then, according to his diary, \u201cturned and paddled like I never have in my life\u201d.</p> <p>Later that day he made another attempt, this time landing on the island.</p> <p>He laid out more gifts, then approached the hut he was chased from earlier, staying out of arrow range. About half a dozen Sentinelese emerged and began to \u201cwhoop and shout\u201d. He walked closer to try to hear what they were saying. He tried to \u201cparrot their words back to them\u201d, and the Sentinelese burst out laughing. They were probably \u201csaying bad words or insulting me\u201d, he concluded. He sang worship songs and preached from Genesis. For a while the Sentinelese seemed to tolerate his presence.</p> <p>Then a boy shot an arrow at him. The arrow struck the waterproof Bible he was holding. He pulled it out, gave it back to the boy, and hastily retreated. The Sentinelese had taken his kayak, so he was forced to swim almost a mile to the fishing boat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2018m scared,\u201d he wrote that night in his diary. \u201cWatching the sunset and it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d He was \u201ccrying a bit\u201d and \u201cwondering if it\u2019ll be the last sunset I see before being in the place where the sun never sets\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys might think I\u2019m crazy in all this,\u201d he wrote to his family, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s worth it to declare Jesus to these people.\u201d</p> <p>Is this \u201cSatan\u2019s last stronghold\u201d, he asked God \u2013 a place \u201cwhere none have heard or even had a chance to hear your name?\u201d</p> <p>He decided he would make his next attempt without the fishing vessel floating nearby. Appearing alone might make the Sentinelese more comfortable, he thought. And if the approach went \u201cbadly\u201d, this would spare the fishermen from having to \u201cbear witness to my death\u201d.</p> <p>His diary makes it clear that he didn\u2019t want to die, but accepted the possibility. \u201cI think I could be more useful alive,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut to you, God, I give all the glory of whatever happens.\u201d He asked God to forgive \u201cany of the people on this island who try to kill me\u201d \u2013 especially \u201cif they succeed\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly after dawn on 16 November, the last day he was seen alive, John Chau asked the fishermen to drop him off alone.

      "bodyText": "One day, as a small child, John Allen Chau was rooting through his father\u2019s study when he found something curious and alluring: an illustrated edition of Robinson Crusoe, the classic story of a sailor shipwrecked on a deserted island. \u201cAfter struggling my way to read it with early elementary school English,\u201d he later told a website for outdoors enthusiasts, \u201cI started reading easier kid-friendly books,\u201d like The Sign of the Beaver, \u201cwhich inspired my brother and I to paint our faces with wild blackberry juice and tramp through our backyard with bows and spears we created from sticks\u201d. In November, on an obscure island in the Indian Ocean, Chau \u2013 a 26-year-old American adventure blogger, beef-jerky marketer, and evangelical missionary \u2013 was killed by the isolated tribe he was attempting to convert to Christianity. When Chau\u2019s death became international news, many Christians were keen to disavow his actions; Chau\u2019s father believes the American missionary community is culpable in his son\u2019s death. John was an \u201cinnocent child\u201d, his father told me, who died from an \u201cextreme\u201d vision of Christianity taken to its logical conclusion. All Nations, the evangelical organization that trained Chau, described him as a martyr. The \u201cprivilege of sharing the gospel has often involved great cost\u201d, Dr Mary Ho, the organization\u2019s leader, said in a statement. \u201cWe pray that John\u2019s sacrificial efforts will bear eternal fruit in due season.\u201d Ho also told news organizations that Chau had received 13 immunizations, though Survival International, an indigenous rights group, disputes that these would have prevented infection of the isolated Sentinelese people. The Sentinelese, hunter-gatherers who inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Andaman island chain, are considered one of the Earth\u2019s last uncontacted peoples; their entire tribe is believed to number several dozen people. \u201cJohn Allen Chau is not a martyr,\u201d responded one Twitter user, capturing the prevailing sentiment on social media. \u201cJust a dumb American who thought the tribals needed \u2018Jesus\u2019 when the tribals already lived in harmony with God and nature for years without outside interference.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d another commented, \u201cbut what a deluded idiot.\u201d In a brief message posted on Chau\u2019s Instagram account, his family pleaded for a more sympathetic understanding of the person they called \u201ca beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend\u201d, who \u201cloved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people\u201d. After talking with people who knew him, and delving into the blogposts, diary writings, photos, and social media he left behind, a complicated picture emerges. Chau\u2019s decision to contact the Sentinelese, who have made it clear over the years that they prefer to be left alone, was indefensibly reckless. But it was not a spontaneous act of recklessness by a dim-witted thrill-seeker; it was a premeditated act of recklessness by a fairly intelligent and thoughtful thrill-seeker who spent years preparing, understood the risks, including to his own life, and believed his purpose on Earth was to bring Christ to the island he considered \u201cSatan\u2019s last stronghold\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Chau was born in Alabama but grew up in Vancouver, Washington, near the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. He was raised by a Chinese father, a psychiatrist, and an American mother, an attorney, with two siblings. As a child he was consumed by two passions that became increasingly intertwined: outdoor adventure and Jesus Christ. \u201c[W]hen I was a little kid,\u201d he recalled in 2015, \u201cmy family went camping\u201d; during \u201cthat time of my life, I had a habit of eating wild things not meant for humans to eat, like bright red or stark white berries\u201d. Consequently he \u201cdestroyed several sleeping bags that night. My family stopped going on camping trips after that.\u201d He loved survival stories, like Hatchet, Gary Paulsen\u2019s gritty young adult novel about a boy forced to live off the land after crash-landing in the Alaskan wilderness. He came to count as heroes the naturalist John Muir, the explorer-missionary David Livingstone, and Bruce Olson, famous in the missionary community for converting the Bari people of South America. Chau was raised in a Christian home and his family appear to have been members of the Assemblies of God, an international Pentecostal church whose members sometimes speak in tongues. He attended Vancouver Christian high school, a close-knit school with just 90 students across seven grades. A natural overachiever, he thrived. He threw himself into clubs, charities and other extracurriculars. In the Royal Rangers, a Pentecostal scouting organization, he achieved a gold medal of achievement, a rank equivalent to Eagle scout; one of the medal\u2019s requirements is reading or listening to the entire Bible. He loved hiking, camping and travel, and he meticulously documented his exploration on social media. On Facebook, he was fond of quoting Jim Elliot, one of five missionaries killed by a tribe in Ecuador in 1956. A mission trip to Mexico during high school was particularly formative. When he returned, he gave a short homily on his experiences. \u201cWe can\u2019t be lukewarm,\u201d he argued, shifting nervously but speaking with conviction. \u201cWe need to know how to defend our faith.\u201d \u201cWhen we go out in our world, there are people that\u2019ll just come and oppose us, and they\u2019ll have questions, and they\u2019ll have arguments \u2026 We can\u2019t just, like, go out there unprepared. We need to know what we believe and why we believe it.\u201d It seems inevitable that Chau\u2019s personality \u2013 God-fearing, outdoors-loving, and obsessed with pushing himself to extremes \u2013 would be attracted to being a missionary. He first read about the Sentinelese during high school, according to the New York Times, on a missionary database called the Joshua Project. The Joshua Project entry for the Sentinelese describes them as \u201cextremely isolated\u201d and notes that the Indian government bans access to North Sentinel. The website suggests praying for the Indian government to allow Christians \u201cto earn the trust of the Sentinelese people\u201d and \u201clive among them\u201d. In addition to \u201cbasic medical care\u201d, the Sentinelese \u201cneed to know that the Creator God exists, and that He loves them and paid the price for their sins\u201d. Like his son, Dr Patrick Chau is a graduate of Oral Roberts, an evangelical university in Oklahoma. I had thought he might want to defend evangelical doctrines against the unsympathetic media coverage sparked by his son\u2019s death. In an email, however, he called religion \u201cthe opium of the mass[es]\u201d. \u201cIf you have [anything] positive to say about religion,\u201d he told me, \u201cl wish not to see or hear\u201d it. He said his son\u2019s zeal was a longstanding point of contention and that they\u2019d agreed not to talk about John\u2019s missionary work. \u201cJohn is gone because the Western ideology overpowered my [Confucian] influence,\u201d he said. He blamed evangelicals\u2019 \u201cextreme Christianity\u201d for pushing his child to a \u201cnot unexpected end\u201d, and he referred with particular bitterness to the Great Commission, Jesus\u2019s injunction that Christians spread the gospel to all peoples. Like Patrick Chau, Justin Graves, a pastor and a friend of John\u2019s from linguistics school, has blamed evangelical culture for enabling Chau\u2019s death. \u201cJohn Chau was a good man,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHe was a loving, passionate individual I was blessed to befriend, and the loss of his light on this earth was devastating. But it cannot be left as a mere tragedy. His death brings to light a multitude of issues with Evangelical views\u201d and \u201chell-based ethics\u201d. John Middleton Ramsey, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a fellow evangelical, defended his actions. \u201cHis motivation was love for the [Sentinelese] people,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you believe in heaven and hell then what he did was the most loving thing anyone could do.\u201d He added: \u201cA lot of people have said these people obviously want to be left alone, so we should respect their wishes. Well my ancestors were also savages that wanted to be left alone. I\u2019m sure glad missionaries like [Saints] Kilian and Boniface stepped up and were willing to give their lives, and that I don\u2019t live in a society like that any more.\u201d The United States sends the most Christian missionaries abroad of any country, according to Reuters \u2013 almost 130,000 in 2010. Although many denominations send missionaries, the most visible are Mormons \u2013 70,000 per year, according to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2013 and evangelical Protestants. A large and sophisticated apparatus exists to assist Americans interested in proselytizing. The universe includes organizations like WorldVenture, which provides support services, training, and life insurance for missionaries, and Wycliffe, which is working to translate the Bible into every language. Databases such as People Groups and the Joshua Project gather information on what evangelicals call \u201cunreached people groups\u201d. At Oral Roberts, Chau was more completely immersed in evangelical culture than ever before. The conservative university forbids smoking, drinking, swearing, and any kind of sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage. Chau traveled frequently. He spent one summer during college at a Christian soccer academy in South Africa. After graduating in 2014, he went on a trip to Kurdistan to do outreach to refugees, as well as a trip to Israel sponsored by Covenant Journey, an organization founded by the rightwing Christian activist Mat Staver. John Middleton Ramsey met Chau in Israel. He was relaxed and \u201ceasy to connect with\u201d, Ramsey recalled, and \u201cpreferred one-on-one conversation as opposed to larger groups\u201d. He was \u201cgood-looking and received a fair share of female attention, but very humble\u201d. Chau avoided romantic entanglement, believing it irresponsible given the risks of his mission to North Sentinel, and forwent full-time employment in order to focus on preparing. He did a National Outdoor Leadership School course, trained as an emergency medical technician, and stayed in shape. He spent three summers at Whiskeytown national recreation area in California, working as a ranger and emergency nurse and living alone in a small cabin. He was a good photographer and never failed to document his love of nature on Instagram. \u201cMet new friends, watched spectacular sunrises and sunsets, and marveled at the the beautiful creation around us that we are all called to care for,\u201d he wrote after one excursion. His adventures began to earn him social media followers. A beef jerky company asked to sponsor him as an influencer. These outdoor expeditions sometimes got dangerous. Once he almost died \u2013 thanks to \u201ca gnarly bite from a rattlesnake and a subsequent platelet count of 10\u201d. On another occasion, he and two friends got lost during a 14-day trek. To get back on course, they were forced to climb down a frozen waterfall. In 2015 and 2016 he took four trips to the Andaman islands. He made contacts in the local Christian community but did not visit North Sentinel. In 2017 he was accepted to a boot camp run by All Nations, a Kansas City organization that works to see Jesus \u201cworshipped by every tongue, tribe and nation\u201d. All Nations urges Christians to inculcate a \u201cwartime mentality\u201d and \u201cmake strategic decisions in the battle we\u2019re waging against a real enemy\u201d. One of the bootcamp\u2019s exercises, the New York Times reported, involved navigating a mock village peopled by missionaries pretending to be hostile natives, with fake spears. All Nations\u2019 leader, Mary Ho, told the Times that Chau was one of the best trainees the program ever had. That year he also attended a program at the Canada Institute of Linguistics, a missionary language school. There he befriended another student, Ben S, who was struck by his \u201cquiet determination\u201d and \u201cconfidence\u201d. \u201cWas it his faith?\u201d Ben wondered in a post remembering his friend. \u201cWas it his years of mountaineering and extensive emergency medical training? Probably all of this factored in\u201d \u2013 Chau \u201cwas just the kind of person who inspires your confidence and trust\u201d. One night in the computer lab, Chau told Ben of \u201chis burden\u201d to save the Sentinelese. \u201cI was impressed immediately that this was something no one but God alone could relieve him of,\u201d Ben writes. \u201cHe had already heard all the arguments of why this was a fool\u2019s errand and would jeopardize any mission associated with it, let alone the [lives] of the individuals involved.\u201d This \u201cwas a sacred trust for him that no amount of reasoning would wrest from his grasp\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In October, Chau traveled on a tourist visa to Port Blair, the Andaman islands\u2019 regional capital, and took up residence in what he described as a \u201csafe house\u201d. There he assembled an \u201cinitial contact response kit\u201d \u2013 including picture cards for communication, bandages and dental forceps for removing arrows \u2013 and gifts for the Sentinelese: tweezers, scissors, cord, safety pins, fish hooks. He carefully documented his activities in a handwritten diary. The resulting, 13-page testament \u2013 written with the earnestness and self-consciousness of someone who had digested many missionary and anthropologist accounts of indigenous contact and knew he might be writing for posterity \u2013 recounts his final days in fascinating and tragic detail. Hoping it would lessen the risk of accidentally infecting the Sentinelese, he entered a self-imposed quarantine. For 11 days he went without direct sunlight. He prayed, exercised, and read The Lives of the Three Mrs Judsons, a 19th-century missionary account. On the night of 14 November, he and some fishermen \u2013 Christians who had agreed to help \u2013 set out in darkness for North Sentinel, carefully avoiding coastguard vessels. Their journey was illuminated by glowing plankton, Chau wrote, and around them fish jumped \u201clike darting mermaids\u201d. They reached North Sentinel late at night and anchored nearby. The next morning, 15 November, he made his first approach. The fishermen refused to go any closer to the island, so he stripped to his underwear \u2013 he thought it would make the Sentinelese more at ease, the fishermen later said \u2013 and paddled a kayak toward the shore. He saw a hut and some dugout canoes. As he paddled up to the beach, several Sentinelese, faces painted yellow and speaking a language of \u201chigh-pitched sounds\u201d, came rushing out. \u201cMy name is John,\u201d he shouted from his kayak. \u201cI love you, and Jesus loves you.\u201d When the islanders began stringing their bows, he panicked. He threw toward them some fish he had brought as a gift, then, according to his diary, \u201cturned and paddled like I never have in my life\u201d. Later that day he made another attempt, this time landing on the island. He laid out more gifts, then approached the hut he was chased from earlier, staying out of arrow range. About half a dozen Sentinelese emerged and began to \u201cwhoop and shout\u201d. He walked closer to try to hear what they were saying. He tried to \u201cparrot their words back to them\u201d, and the Sentinelese burst out laughing. They were probably \u201csaying bad words or insulting me\u201d, he concluded. He sang worship songs and preached from Genesis. For a while the Sentinelese seemed to tolerate his presence. Then a boy shot an arrow at him. The arrow struck the waterproof Bible he was holding. He pulled it out, gave it back to the boy, and hastily retreated. The Sentinelese had taken his kayak, so he was forced to swim almost a mile to the fishing boat. \u201cI\u2018m scared,\u201d he wrote that night in his diary. \u201cWatching the sunset and it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d He was \u201ccrying a bit\u201d and \u201cwondering if it\u2019ll be the last sunset I see before being in the place where the sun never sets\u201d. \u201cYou guys might think I\u2019m crazy in all this,\u201d he wrote to his family, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s worth it to declare Jesus to these people.\u201d Is this \u201cSatan\u2019s last stronghold\u201d, he asked God \u2013 a place \u201cwhere none have heard or even had a chance to hear your name?\u201d He decided he would make his next attempt without the fishing vessel floating nearby. Appearing alone might make the Sentinelese more comfortable, he thought. And if the approach went \u201cbadly\u201d, this would spare the fishermen from having to \u201cbear witness to my death\u201d. His diary makes it clear that he didn\u2019t want to die, but accepted the possibility. \u201cI think I could be more useful alive,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut to you, God, I give all the glory of whatever happens.\u201d He asked God to forgive \u201cany of the people on this island who try to kill me\u201d \u2013 especially \u201cif they succeed\u201d. Shortly after dawn on 16 November, the last day he was seen alive, John Chau asked the fishermen to drop him off alone. He knew the risks; but the people of North Sentinel were damned, and he was determined to save them. He struck out once more for the shore.",

      "bodyText": "Helicopters clattered overhead as teams of men and sniffer dogs picked their way across the few areas of red mud solid enough to walk on. Other recovery teams gathered around a digger as its shovel scooped up the sludge and drained it, again and again. Theirs was a grim and increasingly hopeless task: looking for broken bodies in an apocalyptic wasteland of liquid mining waste. And they were facing the realization that many of the victims of Brazil\u2019s most recent environmental disaster may never be found. There was no time to run when an avalanche of liquid mining waste swept through the C\u00f3rrego de Feij\u00e3o open-cast iron ore mine on 25 January, destroying offices, workshops and a canteen where hundreds were eating lunch. The wave tore through the lush green countryside of Minas Gerais state, eventually plastering some 252 hectares (623 acres) in sticky red-brown mud. Since then, 121 bodies have been recovered, but 226 are still missing, and at Brazil\u2019s \u201cGround Zero\u201d, the question hung in the fetid air: can all those missing bodies ever be found? \u201cNegative,\u201d said firefighter Fausto Diniz, his neoprene workwear smeared ochre after a recent day crawling on all fours across the mud. \u201cBut we will do everything possible to find the most we can.\u201d The local morgue has asked relatives of some of the missing to provide DNA samples and dental records to help identify the dead. But many relatives are slowly coming to realize that they will not even have a body to mourn. The destructive power of 11.7m cubic metres of muddy waste meant that rescuers were finding pieces rather than whole corpses. \u201cToday we found an organ you couldn\u2019t identify, an arm and a forearm,\u201d Diniz said. Video of the disaster caught on a CCTV camera shows a tsunami of mud outrunning vehicles and engulfing a goods train. Locals compared it to an earthquake. Braulio Alcici, 76, sat outside a farmhouse where his son Sergio, 43, used to produce lactose-free cheese on their 100 hectare farm. Now its banana, papaya and mango trees were under up to 25 metres of mud and the fishing lake was a swamp full of mining equipment catapulted down the hillside. \u201cThis was a dream, everything was green, water all around,\u201d Alcici said. \u201cIt became a cemetery.\u201d The area has a sweet, acrid smell. \u201cThat smell wasn\u2019t here before,\u201d said Sergio Alcici. Volunteer rescue worker Denis Valerio, who also worked on the Mariana disaster, said it was \u201ca mixture of minerals, chemicals used in processing, and the biological matter \u2013 fish, animals, human bodies\u201d. A group of volunteer psychologists is working with not-for-profit group NaA\u00e7\u00e3o (In Action) to provide help and support; they said the lack of bodies made it harder for friends and relatives to accept the deaths of loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of having abandoned the person,\u201d said Rosana Bohrer, a psychologist from Bras\u00edlia and specialist in emergencies and disasters. \u201cWhen you follow a [funeral] ritual, you make the death concrete. You have closure.\u201d The disaster came three years after another tailings dam collapsed at a mine near Mariana in the same state, killing 19 people and causing what at the time was Brazil\u2019s worst ever environmental disaster. That mine was operated by Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between Anglo-Australian giant BHP Billiton and the Brazilian firm Vale \u2013 which also operated the dam at Brumadinho. No individual has been made responsible for the Mariana disaster, and while billions have been spent on clean-up, Samarco has only paid a fraction of all the fines levied. Vale has hired a consulting outfit to help investigate the causes of the tragedy and said it is providing \u201call the necessary resources (food, water, medicines, clothing, transportation, etc)\u201d. The company has had $2.4bn blocked and been handed \u00a372m in fines. Last week, three Vale employees and two engineers from German company T\u00dcV S\u00dcD were arrested by prosecutors investigating the catastrophe. But the arrests were of little comfort to Enio do Amaral, 56, whose sister Gislene, 51, worked for Vale and is still missing. On a recent morning in Mario Campos, a roadside community near Brumadinho, he held up her photo in her workwear. \u201cShe was a sensational person, a hard worker, honest, all the qualities,\u201d he said. He and his two brothers were preparing to set off for the morgue, which had asked them to bring Gislene\u2019s toothbrush and dental records and provide DNA samples in the hope of identifying some of her remains. \u201cWe are mourning every day and we don\u2019t have a body. It is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a body to end this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor members of parliament\u2019s standing committee on economics are considering lodging a complaint with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or attempting a referral to the privileges committee, declaring recent behaviour by the Liberal chairman \u201can outrageous abuse\u201d of longstanding conventions. Labor MPs on the committee are furious with the Liberal MP Tim Wilson, who has used an inquiry into the opposition\u2019s contentious policy to scrap cash refunds for franking credits to marshal political opposition to the initiative, including, they say, drafting pro-forma submissions on behalf of complainants. The committee\u2019s deputy chair, Matt Thistlethwaite, told Guardian Australia on Sunday he would raise breaches of process at a public hearing in Merimbula on Monday, \u201cand I will raise it in the parliament when we return\u201d. Another Labor member of the committee, Josh Wilson, said the non-government members were seeking advice from officials about what, if any, remedial action could be taken, and were also considering a complaint to the House Speaker, Tony Smith, or a referral to privileges. Wilson noted that the economics committee had not previously been a forum for \u201cpartisan game playing\u201d and he said the tactics used by Wilson in relation to the current inquiry were \u201cnot healthy for the parliament\u201d. Labor MPs are objecting to a number of incidents over the course of the inquiry. Thistlethwaite says at a hearing last week, Liberals handed out party membership forms to disgruntled retirees objecting to Labor\u2019s policy. Hearings undertaken by federal parliamentary committees are funded by taxpayers. They are not generally forums for partisan activity, or political campaigning. There are also objections to a website accompanying the committee inquiry created by Wilson, where people register to attend public hearings. That site is privately funded, and contains an authorisation by Wilson in his capacity as the chairman of standing committee on economics. The website signs people up to not only attending hearings, but for a petition against \u201cthe retirement tax\u201d and allows them to be contacted about \u201cfuture activities to stop the retirement tax\u201d. Wilson told Guardian Australia on Sunday the default sign-up for future contact was an error on the site that had been rectified. Labor\u2019s policy is not a \u201cretirement tax\u201d. The policy, unveiled last March, ends cash refunds for excess imputation credits claimed by retirees and self-managed superannuation funds. Paul Keating introduced dividend imputation in 1987 to prevent the double taxation of dividends, once as company profits and once as personal income, and the Howard government then enhanced that scheme by allowing individuals and super funds to claim cash refunds for any excess imputation credits not used to offset their tax liabilities. The policy change being proposed by Labor will impact mostly wealthy people with no tax liability who use their imputation credits to claim a cash refund, and there has been a backlash among self-funded retirees and self-managed super funds. Labor MPs say Wilson, as part of his website, has offered up pro-forma submissions to opponents of the policy, submissions he will then have to assess independently as the committee chairman. Josh Wilson, one of the Labor members of the committee, said: \u201cEvidence written by the chairman, then assessed by the chairman, is circular, improper and ridiculous.\u201d Tim Wilson says there\u2019s no issue. He told Guardian Australia on Sunday people can edit the pro-forma submission before lodging it with the inquiry, adding and subtracting information. \u201cWhether they send it in is entirely a matter for them.\u201d After a complaint on social media by Stephen Koukoulas, a professional economist and former ALP policy adviser, who had wanted to attend one of the public hearings, but did not want to check the box for the petition or to be contacted further, Tim Wilson replied that the default sign-up was an \u201cerror\u201d that was now \u201cfixed\u201d. Koukoulas also inquired how his data would be used, noting registration \u201crequired me to provide my phone number, email &amp; postal address\u201d. He asked Wilson: \u201cCan you confirm these will not be used in anyway as part of any data base for any purpose by the economics committee or anyone else?\u201d Wilson told Guardian Australia on Sunday he was unaware of any plans to use the data for any purpose beyond the current inquiry, and people had consented to specific future contacts. He said the Labor complaints were overblown. \u201cThey are talking rubbish,\u201d he said.

Neither amendment asked MPs to commit to a firm Brexit position; they were simply seeking a route out of the stasis that has enveloped the Commons.

It reeked by turns of blackcurrant and paraffin, of the deep earth below and the blue sky above. It was a languid afternoon, bottled.

      "body": "<p>Ah well, I suppose in these fractious times that we must take our comforts where we can find them \u2013 and so we must look to Italy and the prognostications of my favourite hyperbolic <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/01/28/italys-credit-crunch-deepens-recession-stalks-europe/\" title=\"\">economic commentator</a>, who never fails to cheer, with his dazzling and fresh lexicon of doom and chaos. Last week was no exception. As the country slides into recession, he thundered about a \u201crecessionary vortex\u201d that has \u201cmetastasised\u201d over the past two months, while a former chief economist at the Italian treasury offers the terrifying warning that the country is \u201centering a self-defeating loop of negative growth\u201d. (I\u2019m not certain if a self-defeating loop is the same as a doom loop, but I\u2019m pretty sure they must be related.) Further, \u201cthe downturn is tightening the noose on their non-performing loans\u201d, while the pay-off - \u201cItaly\u2019s debt trajectory can quickly go parabolic\u201d \u2013 conjures a suitably apocalyptic vision of a country deeper into the doo-doo than even this benighted isle.</p> <p>And so, almost inevitably, to the weather. While much of America suffers perishingly cold conditions thanks to the polar vortex (and if I were in charge, I would ban snow \u2013 filthy, worthless stuff), what do we get from the BBC forecasters but: \u201cA quick heads up about the weather today.\u201d Please, can we agree to proscribe the poxy phrase \u201cheads up\u201d, with all its ghastly PR/advertising/marketing overtones? And can we also chuck into the great big bin marked \u201credundant phrases\u201d \u201cspits and spots of rain\u201d and \u201cmist and murk\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ah well, I suppose in these fractious times that we must take our comforts where we can find them \u2013 and so we must look to Italy and the prognostications of my favourite hyperbolic economic commentator, who never fails to cheer, with his dazzling and fresh lexicon of doom and chaos. Last week was no exception. As the country slides into recession, he thundered about a \u201crecessionary vortex\u201d that has \u201cmetastasised\u201d over the past two months, while a former chief economist at the Italian treasury offers the terrifying warning that the country is \u201centering a self-defeating loop of negative growth\u201d. (I\u2019m not certain if a self-defeating loop is the same as a doom loop, but I\u2019m pretty sure they must be related.) Further, \u201cthe downturn is tightening the noose on their non-performing loans\u201d, while the pay-off - \u201cItaly\u2019s debt trajectory can quickly go parabolic\u201d \u2013 conjures a suitably apocalyptic vision of a country deeper into the doo-doo than even this benighted isle. And so, almost inevitably, to the weather. While much of America suffers perishingly cold conditions thanks to the polar vortex (and if I were in charge, I would ban snow \u2013 filthy, worthless stuff), what do we get from the BBC forecasters but: \u201cA quick heads up about the weather today.\u201d Please, can we agree to proscribe the poxy phrase \u201cheads up\u201d, with all its ghastly PR/advertising/marketing overtones? And can we also chuck into the great big bin marked \u201credundant phrases\u201d \u201cspits and spots of rain\u201d and \u201cmist and murk\u201d. I know we are obsessed with the weather, but these infantile phrases mean nothing. Anyway, back to the not so dolce vita. As I say, we must take our comforts where we can. \u2022 Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

He once referred to his colleague Graeme Garden as \u201ca quiet genius\u201d, a phrase that could be applied equally well to Hardy himself. His death leaves a gap in the comedy landscape that won\u2019t easily be filled and we will miss his wisdom in the years to come.",

Its gush of soft fruit and alcohol feeling like a direct transfer of warming southern European sun is at least as effective in seeing off SAD as an hour in front of a daylight lamp. These wines are the fruit of a variety, known as grenache in France and elsewhere, that is widespread in Spain \u2013 often in very old vines \u2013 but that has only relatively recently taken its place at the forefront of quality Spanish wine. At their most direct and uncomplicated, Spain\u2019s garnachas offer a mouth-filling dollop of soft succulence \u2013 all bright berries and a dash of freshening paprika spiciness. Remarkable value, too, in the case of the evergreen version from Borsao in Aragon\u2019s Campo de Borja region.</p> <p><strong>Domaines Lupier El Terroir Garnacha, Navarra, Spain 2012 </strong>(<em>\u00a317.50, <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\">The Wine Society</a></em>) Garnacha\u2019s reputation owes a lot to its use in the star Catalan region of Priorat, where it plays the principal role in a blend with other varieties.

      "bodyText": "Bodegas Borsao Garnacha, Campo de Borja, Spain 2017 (\u00a36.19, Rannoch Scott; Slurp) In the frigid depths of February, Spanish garnacha is the antidote to winter blues. Its gush of soft fruit and alcohol feeling like a direct transfer of warming southern European sun is at least as effective in seeing off SAD as an hour in front of a daylight lamp. These wines are the fruit of a variety, known as grenache in France and elsewhere, that is widespread in Spain \u2013 often in very old vines \u2013 but that has only relatively recently taken its place at the forefront of quality Spanish wine. At their most direct and uncomplicated, Spain\u2019s garnachas offer a mouth-filling dollop of soft succulence \u2013 all bright berries and a dash of freshening paprika spiciness. Remarkable value, too, in the case of the evergreen version from Borsao in Aragon\u2019s Campo de Borja region. Domaines Lupier El Terroir Garnacha, Navarra, Spain 2012 (\u00a317.50, The Wine Society) Garnacha\u2019s reputation owes a lot to its use in the star Catalan region of Priorat, where it plays the principal role in a blend with other varieties. Like the region from which they come, these versions of garnacha tend to be more rugged and craggy in texture, more layered, complex and rich, but with a characteristic lick of mineral refreshment. Two to try at relatively accessible prices are the dense liquorice of Morrisons The Best Priorat 2014 (\u00a310) and the bright but intense Marco Abella Loidana Priorat 2015 (\u00a316.50, Cambridge Wine).

As the MP for Birmingham Yardley pointed out, many people, including nurses and care workers, earn considerably less. However, while Phillips\u2019s derision for overpaid thickos got most of the attention (\u201cI\u2019ve met lots of people who earn way more than \u00a330,000 who have absolutely no discernible skills\u2026 not even one\u201d), I was also struck by how warmly she talked about immigration. </p> <p>\u201cIt sticks slightly in the craw of a person who grew up in Birmingham,\u201d she said, \u201cto listen to people who don\u2019t live among migrants\u2026 talk about how difficult it is for communities to have to live in places of high migration.

The Caribbean setting has a hallucinatory quality \u2013 you can read it in the dead of winter and still feel the sticky heat, and Antoinette (Bertha in Jane Eyre) is the kind of character I would most love to create \u2013 desperate and wild and bruised and unapologetic.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>A second reading of Carpentaria by Alexis Wright: wry, majestic, allegorical, and at the same time shamefully real.

The stories are grouped in order of voice \u2013 first, second and third \u2013 and they explore darkness, dispossession, and the surreal just under the surfaces of people\u2019s lives. But there is also humour in the collection: I take the reader on a journey from the offbeat to the sad to the moving, before coming back to the quirky and the optimistic.</p> <p>In the final story, Zebra, a female prime minister believes that her role involves harmony, grace, forgiveness, reconciliation and a total lack of ego and personal ambition (pretty much everything politicians are not!). But she is disturbed and attacked by her own neighbour, and then challenged by the gift of a zebra for her garden. This story was written from a state of anger and resentment but it offers something conciliatory and affirming \u2013 I hope!</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>Anne Patchett\u2019s Bel Canto. While it has nothing to do with the title story of Zebra, I was so intrigued by the central idea \u2013 a home is violated when terrorists intrude on a private concert \u2013 that it made me consider closely the idea of home, of a cherished place, and what might disrupt all that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>Probably Gerald Murnane\u2019s Border Districts. His hypnotic style is either enthralling or irritating, and I have given up on some of his \u201cfictions\u201d, but I am prepared to have another go because his earlier novel, The Plains, is extraordinary and totally original.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ginger Gorman<br></strong><em><strong>Troll Hunting: Inside the World of Online Hate and its Human Fallout</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Hardie Grant</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"82341e3693da72c59cbaab11aad8cce06d0ec506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82341e3693da72c59cbaab11aad8cce06d0ec506/0_0_771_1181/653.jpg\" alt=\"Troll Hunting, a book by Australian journalist Ginger Gorman, out February 2018\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Your book in your own words: </strong>My journey into the dark belly of the internet started in 2013, when my family and I became the subject of an orchestrated online hate campaign, triggered by my work as a journalist. My husband and I were genuinely scared something would happen to our children.</p> <p>Once the fear subsided, curiosity took over. Over the next five years, I spoke to psychologists, trolling victims, law enforcement, academics and, most importantly, trolls themselves. The strange and enduring relationships I formed with these men \u2013 mostly angry, young and white \u2013 gave me unprecedented access to their thoughts and beliefs.</p> <p>The book links predator trolling to all kinds of real-life horrors including: shootings, suicide and suicide attempts, terrorism, stalking, domestic violence, PTSD, mental illness, limitless misogyny, racism and antisemitism. Troll Hunting is page-turning investigative journalism. But it\u2019s not run-of-the-mill. I bring a wide open mind and heart to this harrowing story \u2013 and sometimes I can\u2019t get out.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>The book that probably had the most impact on<em> </em>Troll Hunting<em> </em>was Jon Ronson\u2019s gripping book, The Psychopath Test. Firstly, Ronson\u2019s in-depth discussion of a psychological assessment tool called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist made me consider some of my own interviews in totally different way. Secondly, the author\u2019s unique style made me realise I could also break from tradition and employ empathy and humanity in my writing.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>I\u2019ve just picked up my friend Carly Findlay\u2019s book, Say Hello<em>. </em>As well as being a fashionista and a writer, Carly identifies as a disabled woman with a facial difference. She\u2019s forging a new path when it comes to disability activism. I see her as a warrior.

It attempts to pin down a selection of fleeting moments that collectively tell the story of the intimate and the expansive experience of being a human being. It\u2019s about ageing, love, loss and connection. What began as an exercise in using memory to practice the multi-disciplinary language of comics ended as a body of work that wanted to make its own connections. With the aim of reflecting a universal understanding of the world in which we live, regardless of how confusing that world may seem, my book also speaks of the deeply personal experience of being alive.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>A diary comic called Snakepit by US cartoonist Ben Snakepit. His deceptively simple drawing style complements his insightful, funny and addictive stories \u2013 stories that always leave me wanting more. I attempted a diary comic with the intention of creating work that reflects what I love to read myself.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>Damascus by Christos Tsiolkas. His work continues to stun me with its raw unflinching perspective and his powerful writing. I\u2019ve read all of his books, and after hearing him do a live reading of an excerpt of this new book on The Garret podcast I was left wanting more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Graeme Simsion <br></strong><em><strong>The Rosie Result</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Text</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5de489f1fc9955b8880fc9b7c7d5fb454e7fa938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5de489f1fc9955b8880fc9b7c7d5fb454e7fa938/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Rosie Result by Graeme Simsion\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Your book in your own words: </strong>The Rosie Result is the final book in the trilogy that began with Don Tillman\u2019s unconventional search for a life partner in The Rosie Project and continued with his efforts to sustain that relationship in The Rosie Effect. Now he and Rosie have an 11-year-old son who\u2019s struggling at school \u2013 it\u2019s been suggested he could be autistic, but Don\u2019s certain that all he needs is some coaching. Indeed, Don faced similar problems himself as a child.</p> <p>It\u2019s a setup for comedy, and for exploring Don\u2019s own childhood. In the first two books, I skirted the question of whether Don was autistic, but both my own and community awareness have changed in the six years since The Rosie Project was published. I\u2019ve taken the opportunity to explore current thinking and issues around autism, as well as broader questions about identity, disability and discrimination.</p> <p>My publishers have made a point of getting advance copies to prominent members of the autism community, and I\u2019ve been encouraged and relieved by their response.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>Suddenly, A Knock at The Door, a collection of short stories by Etgar Keret. I generally avoid fiction when I\u2019m writing but occasional doses of Keret served as a reminder that writing can be accessible, creative, intelligent, transgressive, challenging, funny \u2013 and popular \u2013 all at the same time.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>Axiomatic by Maria Tumarkin. It\u2019s been lauded for its intelligence, originality and prose \u2013 and the subject of how the past shapes the present would have drawn me to it in any case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kirsten Drysdale</strong><br><em><strong>I Built No Schools in Kenya</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Vintage</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c44a18e21710562cb6196ca1a1059a3fd5f3c055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c44a18e21710562cb6196ca1a1059a3fd5f3c055/0_0_1808_2759/655.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for I Built No Schools in Kenya by Kirsten Drysdale\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Your book in your own words: </strong>I Built No Schools In Kenya<em> </em>is a time-warp travelogue about my truly bizarre year as a dementia carer for a very old, very wealthy, very senile, ex-British colonial man in Nairobi.</p> <p>A friend had roped me into the position \u2013 pitching it to me as an easygoing \u201cglorified babysitting\u201d gig. It was only on arrival that I discovered the situation was a little more complex than that: the man\u2019s daughter suspected his wife was trying to kill him. I was expected to spy on her and prevent his murder, maintain a complicated care routine and recreate an era a half-century from the past, while the \u201csweet old man\u201d I thought I\u2019d come to look after frequently threatened violence \u2013 and occasionally romance, depending on his mood.</p> <p>Desperate to escape the flashback madness of the family home I also managed to explore modern Kenya, discover long-lost family running a bar on the other side of the city, tag along to diplomatic soir\u00e9es, attend music festivals, visit biblical theme parks and cover the East African bodybuilding scene for a local newspaper.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>Everywhere I Look by Helen Garner. I love the way Helen Garner so closely observes the details of the world around her \u2013 how she perfectly captures small moments that say so much. I tried to do the same when mining my own memories to describe my time in Kenya.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? </strong>The Lost Man by Jane Harper. I loved her first book, The Dry, and after a very busy few months (and having my head in Africa so much) am looking forward to a page-turning escape in an Australian setting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Robyn Bowles<br></strong><em><strong>Death on the Derwent </strong></em><strong><br><sub>Scribe</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a1baa21f8060b466f27105aef0ee5dac02586dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1baa21f8060b466f27105aef0ee5dac02586dc2/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Death on the Derwent by Robin Bowles\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Your book in your own words: </strong>Death on the Derwent is about Sue Neill-Fraser, a Hobart woman accused and convicted of killing her partner Bob Chappell on a yacht in Tasmania. Her trial produced no body, no witnesses, no motive, no murder weapon, no cause of death, no confession and dodgy forensic evidence. Still protesting her innocence, she got 26 years.</p> <p>During the 10 years since, all appeal avenues failed. However, a groundswell of legal luminaries, civil liberties representatives, parliamentarians and ordinary people are all agitating for Sue\u2019s release. In 2015 Tasmania legislated for a \u201clast chance\u201d appeal if \u201cfresh compelling evidence\u201d could be produced. This threw the Tasmanian legal system into a mad scramble to keep Sue imprisoned, regardless of new evidence from new witnesses, several of whom are now charged with perverting justice and imprisoned themselves.</p> <p>My book concentrates on police determination to ensure Sue stays in jail and the impact on those who have risked prison to tell the truth. Informed by these very witnesses, other community members and Sue herself, it is a story that had to be told.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading when you wrote it? </strong>Transcripts of Sue Neill-Fraser\u2019s trial and covert phone and prison visit recordings, which shocked me and strongly affected the content of my book.

      "bodyText": "Kate Richards Fusion Hamish Hamilton Your book in your own words: Sea and Serene are adult conjoined twins who have two heads, one complete body and cannot ever be separated. They live deep in the alpine wilderness with their young cousin, who one day brings home an injured stranger. Over a period of weeks the twins come to the horrifying realisation that as they enfold the stranger into their lives, their relationship with each other destabilises and threatens to fall apart. What were you reading when you wrote it? Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys. The Caribbean setting has a hallucinatory quality \u2013 you can read it in the dead of winter and still feel the sticky heat, and Antoinette (Bertha in Jane Eyre) is the kind of character I would most love to create \u2013 desperate and wild and bruised and unapologetic. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? A second reading of Carpentaria by Alexis Wright: wry, majestic, allegorical, and at the same time shamefully real. This work reminds me of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, although I don\u2019t think Alexis Wright needs to be compared with anyone. Debra Adelaide Zebra and Other Stories Picador Your book in your own words: Zebra is a collection of short fiction, culminating in a novella. The stories are grouped in order of voice \u2013 first, second and third \u2013 and they explore darkness, dispossession, and the surreal just under the surfaces of people\u2019s lives. But there is also humour in the collection: I take the reader on a journey from the offbeat to the sad to the moving, before coming back to the quirky and the optimistic. In the final story, Zebra, a female prime minister believes that her role involves harmony, grace, forgiveness, reconciliation and a total lack of ego and personal ambition (pretty much everything politicians are not!). But she is disturbed and attacked by her own neighbour, and then challenged by the gift of a zebra for her garden. This story was written from a state of anger and resentment but it offers something conciliatory and affirming \u2013 I hope! What were you reading when you wrote it? Anne Patchett\u2019s Bel Canto. While it has nothing to do with the title story of Zebra, I was so intrigued by the central idea \u2013 a home is violated when terrorists intrude on a private concert \u2013 that it made me consider closely the idea of home, of a cherished place, and what might disrupt all that. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? Probably Gerald Murnane\u2019s Border Districts. His hypnotic style is either enthralling or irritating, and I have given up on some of his \u201cfictions\u201d, but I am prepared to have another go because his earlier novel, The Plains, is extraordinary and totally original. Ginger Gorman Troll Hunting: Inside the World of Online Hate and its Human Fallout Hardie Grant Your book in your own words: My journey into the dark belly of the internet started in 2013, when my family and I became the subject of an orchestrated online hate campaign, triggered by my work as a journalist. My husband and I were genuinely scared something would happen to our children. Once the fear subsided, curiosity took over. Over the next five years, I spoke to psychologists, trolling victims, law enforcement, academics and, most importantly, trolls themselves. The strange and enduring relationships I formed with these men \u2013 mostly angry, young and white \u2013 gave me unprecedented access to their thoughts and beliefs. The book links predator trolling to all kinds of real-life horrors including: shootings, suicide and suicide attempts, terrorism, stalking, domestic violence, PTSD, mental illness, limitless misogyny, racism and antisemitism. Troll Hunting is page-turning investigative journalism. But it\u2019s not run-of-the-mill. I bring a wide open mind and heart to this harrowing story \u2013 and sometimes I can\u2019t get out. What were you reading when you wrote it? The book that probably had the most impact on Troll Hunting was Jon Ronson\u2019s gripping book, The Psychopath Test. Firstly, Ronson\u2019s in-depth discussion of a psychological assessment tool called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist made me consider some of my own interviews in totally different way. Secondly, the author\u2019s unique style made me realise I could also break from tradition and employ empathy and humanity in my writing. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? I\u2019ve just picked up my friend Carly Findlay\u2019s book, Say Hello. As well as being a fashionista and a writer, Carly identifies as a disabled woman with a facial difference. She\u2019s forging a new path when it comes to disability activism. I see her as a warrior. Can\u2019t wait to get stuck in! Mandy Ord When One Person Dies the Whole World is Over Brow Books Your book in your own words: When One Person Dies The Whole World Is Over is a diary comic that records a year of a life \u2013 my life. It attempts to pin down a selection of fleeting moments that collectively tell the story of the intimate and the expansive experience of being a human being. It\u2019s about ageing, love, loss and connection. What began as an exercise in using memory to practice the multi-disciplinary language of comics ended as a body of work that wanted to make its own connections. With the aim of reflecting a universal understanding of the world in which we live, regardless of how confusing that world may seem, my book also speaks of the deeply personal experience of being alive. What were you reading when you wrote it? A diary comic called Snakepit by US cartoonist Ben Snakepit. His deceptively simple drawing style complements his insightful, funny and addictive stories \u2013 stories that always leave me wanting more. I attempted a diary comic with the intention of creating work that reflects what I love to read myself. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? Damascus by Christos Tsiolkas. His work continues to stun me with its raw unflinching perspective and his powerful writing. I\u2019ve read all of his books, and after hearing him do a live reading of an excerpt of this new book on The Garret podcast I was left wanting more. Graeme Simsion The Rosie Result Text Your book in your own words: The Rosie Result is the final book in the trilogy that began with Don Tillman\u2019s unconventional search for a life partner in The Rosie Project and continued with his efforts to sustain that relationship in The Rosie Effect. Now he and Rosie have an 11-year-old son who\u2019s struggling at school \u2013 it\u2019s been suggested he could be autistic, but Don\u2019s certain that all he needs is some coaching. Indeed, Don faced similar problems himself as a child. It\u2019s a setup for comedy, and for exploring Don\u2019s own childhood. In the first two books, I skirted the question of whether Don was autistic, but both my own and community awareness have changed in the six years since The Rosie Project was published. I\u2019ve taken the opportunity to explore current thinking and issues around autism, as well as broader questions about identity, disability and discrimination. My publishers have made a point of getting advance copies to prominent members of the autism community, and I\u2019ve been encouraged and relieved by their response. What were you reading when you wrote it? Suddenly, A Knock at The Door, a collection of short stories by Etgar Keret. I generally avoid fiction when I\u2019m writing but occasional doses of Keret served as a reminder that writing can be accessible, creative, intelligent, transgressive, challenging, funny \u2013 and popular \u2013 all at the same time. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? Axiomatic by Maria Tumarkin. It\u2019s been lauded for its intelligence, originality and prose \u2013 and the subject of how the past shapes the present would have drawn me to it in any case. Kirsten Drysdale I Built No Schools in Kenya Vintage Your book in your own words: I Built No Schools In Kenya is a time-warp travelogue about my truly bizarre year as a dementia carer for a very old, very wealthy, very senile, ex-British colonial man in Nairobi. A friend had roped me into the position \u2013 pitching it to me as an easygoing \u201cglorified babysitting\u201d gig. It was only on arrival that I discovered the situation was a little more complex than that: the man\u2019s daughter suspected his wife was trying to kill him. I was expected to spy on her and prevent his murder, maintain a complicated care routine and recreate an era a half-century from the past, while the \u201csweet old man\u201d I thought I\u2019d come to look after frequently threatened violence \u2013 and occasionally romance, depending on his mood. Desperate to escape the flashback madness of the family home I also managed to explore modern Kenya, discover long-lost family running a bar on the other side of the city, tag along to diplomatic soir\u00e9es, attend music festivals, visit biblical theme parks and cover the East African bodybuilding scene for a local newspaper. What were you reading when you wrote it? Everywhere I Look by Helen Garner. I love the way Helen Garner so closely observes the details of the world around her \u2013 how she perfectly captures small moments that say so much. I tried to do the same when mining my own memories to describe my time in Kenya. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? The Lost Man by Jane Harper. I loved her first book, The Dry, and after a very busy few months (and having my head in Africa so much) am looking forward to a page-turning escape in an Australian setting. Robyn Bowles Death on the Derwent Scribe Your book in your own words: Death on the Derwent is about Sue Neill-Fraser, a Hobart woman accused and convicted of killing her partner Bob Chappell on a yacht in Tasmania. Her trial produced no body, no witnesses, no motive, no murder weapon, no cause of death, no confession and dodgy forensic evidence. Still protesting her innocence, she got 26 years. During the 10 years since, all appeal avenues failed. However, a groundswell of legal luminaries, civil liberties representatives, parliamentarians and ordinary people are all agitating for Sue\u2019s release. In 2015 Tasmania legislated for a \u201clast chance\u201d appeal if \u201cfresh compelling evidence\u201d could be produced. This threw the Tasmanian legal system into a mad scramble to keep Sue imprisoned, regardless of new evidence from new witnesses, several of whom are now charged with perverting justice and imprisoned themselves. My book concentrates on police determination to ensure Sue stays in jail and the impact on those who have risked prison to tell the truth. Informed by these very witnesses, other community members and Sue herself, it is a story that had to be told. What were you reading when you wrote it? Transcripts of Sue Neill-Fraser\u2019s trial and covert phone and prison visit recordings, which shocked me and strongly affected the content of my book. I decided that while still criticising the whole legal debacle, my main role would be to provide voices to those still suffering from this botched investigation. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? Light and Shadow by Mark Colvin. Keen to read because Mark was a favourite ABC radio presenter throughout my coming of age, bringing the world to a house-bound mum daily on PM and World Today. Also, my father was a spy and I look forward to Mark\u2019s childhood memories of being dragged around the world, like me. Death on the Derwent is available from 19 February Lee Kofman Imperfect: How Our Bodies Shape the Person We Become Affirm Your book in your own words: By the time I was 11, I had undergone numerous operations on a defective heart and on injuries I received when a bus ran me over in a drink-driving accident. My body now hosts a constellation of disfiguring scars which have impacted my life choices, and even my personality, deeply. In Imperfect, I explored whether my sense that appearance, even when it is more \u201cnormal\u201d than mine, goes deeper than skin is something that other people experience generally. I concluded it is. I also explored what we can do when the way our bodies shape us isn\u2019t in sync with our wishes. My own imperfect story drives the narrative, but I also tell stories of other people I met \u2013 those with common imperfections (such as noticeable birthmarks), rare conditions (like Marfan syndrome and dwarfism) and extreme body modifiers who un-perfect themselves intentionally, as well as beautiful people. What were you reading when you wrote it? Lucy Grealy\u2019s memoir Autobiography of a Face was pivotal to my thinking in Imperfect. Lucy describes with incomparable intelligence and zero sentimentality how her disfigured face had shaped her life, mostly tragically. I was particularly inspired by her refusal to use euphemisms and redemptive clich\u00e9s in order to make her story more \u201cpalatable\u201d. What\u2019s the next Australian book you\u2019ll read? The Hollow Bones by Leah Kaminsky. I loved Kaminsky\u2019s poetic voice in her earlier works; and while I\u2019ve read many books about the Nazis, this novel explores the little-known Nazi love affair with occult ideas and pseudoscience. Plus, part of the story is narrated by a stuffed panda. So how can I resist? Jane Caro Accidental Feminists MUP Your book in your own words: It is the story of my generation of women, who were born in the 50s and 60s and who grew up to change the world \u2013 without really meaning to.
