      "bodyText": "Labour anti-Brexit activists will lead another push to harden the party\u2019s position in favour of remain at Labour\u2019s annual conference this year, with local parties urged to submit motions committing the party to \u201ccampaign energetically\u201d for a second referendum. Grassroots activists, including the pro-remain groups Another Europe is Possible and the youth group For our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS), were behind a major push at last year\u2019s conference in Liverpool which compelled the party to adopt a position that a public vote on Brexit should be an option if a general election could not be forced. A record number of constituency Labour parties, more than 100 in total, submitted conference motions last year calling for a public vote to become Labour policy, though organisers behind this year\u2019s push said their efforts were unlikely to produce such numbers again, with competition from other popular motions including on Green New Deal. Another Europe is Possible, the leftwing anti-Brexit group which was a major driver behind the motions to conference last year, said they had received assurances that at least 40 local parties were planning to submit a motion on remaining in the EU. Michael Chessum, the group\u2019s national organiser said conference was \u201ctaking place on the edge of the cliff\u201d and said activists would no longer accept a compromise composite motion like the one brokered last year when members agreed to the wording that \u201cLabour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. \u201cIf it really does come down to a vote on conference floor, we can expect the debate to be sharp,\u201d Chessum said. \u201cWith Labour already committed to a public vote and an option to remain, we have no incentive to accept a fudge \u2013 and we can expect overwhelming support from members, as well as significant union backing. Ultimately, Labour needs to be able to answer the question: \u2018Do you want to stop Brexit or deliver it?\u2019\u201d The group has been phone-banking contacts in constituency Labour parties since June to persuade local parties to submit their motion, containing the line \u2013 \u201cLabour will campaign energetically for a public vote and to remain. We support revoking article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal.\u201d Though the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has committed to holding a public vote and campaigning to remain on any Conservative-brokered Brexit deal, as well as holding a referendum should his party get into power before any EU exit, the new motion would go substantially further than any Labour policy. It would commit the party to proactively campaigning for a referendum, as well as campaigning for remain on any deal, including one clinched by a Labour government, as well as backing revoking article 50 as a measure to stop no deal. The final clause in particular is likely to be robustly opposed by some Labour MPs in leave seats. Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis, who is backing the motion, said the party needed to ensure its Brexit position was crystal clear before conference starts. \u201cEither we can disappoint our leave voters on Brexit and win them back with a radical domestic programme, or we can fudge the issue, lose our base and watch as the free-market Brexit dream becomes a reality and demolishes the welfare state,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt would be better for everyone if this shift happened in advance of conference \u2013 not forced by members but owned by the leadership, as part of a serious strategy to stop Boris Johnson, ditch Brexit and rebuild Britain instead.\u201d Sources behind the drive to harden Labour policy said the circumstances had fundamentally changed since last year\u2019s conference, including much firmer support from trade unions for a public vote, as well as from the shadow cabinet. However, CLPs are only permitted to put forward one conference motion and anti-Brexit activists pushing the motions concede many are unlikely to want to submit a motion on the same topic as last year. One popular alternative motion, endorsed by Momentum, commits Labour to a Green New Deal which some activists are wary about competing with. Nadia Whittome, a member of Another Europe\u2019s national committee, said they did not want to view it as an arms race. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Brexit\u2019s biggest cheerleaders are rightwing climate change deniers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the fact that this year\u2019s conference will see a renewed wave of motions on all kinds of issues, especially on the environment. In fact our motion will also include a call for a Europe-wide Green New Deal because saving the planet is one of the main reasons why we need to stop Brexit, Johnson and Trump.\u201d FFS, which is linked to the main People\u2019s Vote campaign, has also been canvassing CLPs to submit their version of an anti-Brexit motion, which commits Labour unequivocally to a public vote. It seeks pledges that \u201cLabour will now throw the full weight of our movement behind efforts to secure a confirmatory vote \u2026 If a general election is held, the Labour manifesto must include a commitment to a confirmatory referendum with remain on the ballot.\u201d A People\u2019s Vote rally is planned for weekend of Labour conference in Brighton, as well as a youth and student rally on the Monday. FFS will also launch a Together Against Brexit app for use by Labour delegates who want to organise against Brexit.",
