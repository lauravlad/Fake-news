Party loyalty will only deliver them enough votes to come second. This means Labour can only win one seat, and the third north-east seat will be a battle between the Lib Dems and the Brexit party. It is essential we do not allow the Brexit party to win a second seat in the region. I am truly sorry for the current Labour MEPs, who have served this region well, but their party leadership has let them down badly. It has lost them votes that should have returned them comfortably.</p> <p>If I am wrong \u2013 and I want to be \u2013 then Labour will come top and the third seat will go to Labour\u2019s Paul Brannen or the Lib Dems\u2019 Fiona Hall. I would be happy with either over any Brexit party candidate. Many of my former Labour colleagues are joining me in voting tactically for the Liberal Democrats on Thursday.

If Farage\u2019s \u201cparty\u201d wins a clear plurality of the votes, a Johnson victory in the Tory leadership contest would be likely, and so would a hard Brexit. A strong Labour vote, on the other hand, could open the way at least to a customs union, at best to a referendum. And a customs union, though not ideal, could be a relatively attractive option. Leo Varadkar has suggested a sui generis arrangement involving a consultation process with the UK on the EU\u2019s future trade deals. This would keep open the option of a return to full membership in the future, which a Johnson-Farage-led Brexit would not. Remainers \u2013 think strategically, think long term!<br><strong>Bill Myers</strong><br><em>Leicester </em></p> <p>\u2022 I want to elect Labour MEPs, but I don\u2019t want my vote to be misrepresented as pro-Brexit. So I think I will vote, not with a cross, but with a ring of 12 dots like the EU flag. That will count, as long as it isn\u2019t regarded as \u201ca mark by which the voter could be identified\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland does the country and the pro-EU cause a great disservice by advocating an anti-Labour protest vote (Remainers have no option but to ignore Labour next week, 18 May). Leave won the referendum campaign partly because of the dominance of reactionary, pro-status-quo voices and a failure to engage with policies and political influence within the EU. Mr Freedland falls into the same trap. Better advice is firstly to vote for a party with an EU manifesto and for MEPs who won\u2019t disrupt the EU parliament. This leaves Labour, Greens, Tories (just) and Lib Dems. Then, vote for parties best placed to fight austerity and the climate emergency. This rules out Tories and Lib Dems on austerity and for the classification of their EU groupings as \u201cdinosaurs\u201d or \u201cdelayers\u201d on climate emergency action, according to Climate Action Network Europe. Next, vote for candidates who will be good pro-EU MEPs in the EU and the UK (though they cannot revoke article 50 or vote in parliament). Finally, consider the influence of the EU grouping the party belongs to. Unlike Greens, Labour MEPs have a prospect of electing the president (through the Socialists &amp; Democrats group), with the associated power and influence over EU policies, direction and narrative. We need passionate and influential Labour MEPs to help make the socialist case that we are all better off in the EU and to help us remain. This is why Europhiles like me are ignoring Jonathan Freedland\u2019s advice, voting Labour, and urging others to do the same. Magi Young Exeter \u2022 After nearly 30 years as a Labour activist and the last few as a Labour councillor, I have with a heavy heart decided I will be voting Liberal Democrat in the European election on Thursday. A study of the regional and national polls makes for grim reading, and I find it impossible to see how voting Labour can stop Nigel Farage\u2019s party winning two seats in the north-east. Labour\u2019s vote is collapsing. Party loyalty will only deliver them enough votes to come second. This means Labour can only win one seat, and the third north-east seat will be a battle between the Lib Dems and the Brexit party. It is essential we do not allow the Brexit party to win a second seat in the region. I am truly sorry for the current Labour MEPs, who have served this region well, but their party leadership has let them down badly. It has lost them votes that should have returned them comfortably. If I am wrong \u2013 and I want to be \u2013 then Labour will come top and the third seat will go to Labour\u2019s Paul Brannen or the Lib Dems\u2019 Fiona Hall. I would be happy with either over any Brexit party candidate. Many of my former Labour colleagues are joining me in voting tactically for the Liberal Democrats on Thursday. I urge fellow remain-minded voters to do so too, to stop Nigel Farage getting a second MEP in the north-east. David Hardman Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 Jonathan Freedland urges remainers in England to vote Green, which is all very well if they want to uphold a noble principle, but it\u2019s bad politics. If Farage\u2019s \u201cparty\u201d wins a clear plurality of the votes, a Johnson victory in the Tory leadership contest would be likely, and so would a hard Brexit. A strong Labour vote, on the other hand, could open the way at least to a customs union, at best to a referendum. And a customs union, though not ideal, could be a relatively attractive option. Leo Varadkar has suggested a sui generis arrangement involving a consultation process with the UK on the EU\u2019s future trade deals. This would keep open the option of a return to full membership in the future, which a Johnson-Farage-led Brexit would not. Remainers \u2013 think strategically, think long term! Bill Myers Leicester \u2022 I want to elect Labour MEPs, but I don\u2019t want my vote to be misrepresented as pro-Brexit. So I think I will vote, not with a cross, but with a ring of 12 dots like the EU flag. That will count, as long as it isn\u2019t regarded as \u201ca mark by which the voter could be identified\u201d. To avoid that, would others please do so too?

Bassett then served as Irish joint secretary to the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast between 2001 and 2005, just prior to the signing of the second major peace deal between unionism and nationalism - the St Andrews Agreement. He also served as an ambassador, but after leaving the Republic\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs stunned some of his former colleagues by turning against the EU and getting involved with the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom party.</p> \n  <p>Today Bassett claims that Irish/EU pressure leading to Theresa May not getting a deal she could sell will result in a real Brexiter entering 10 Downing Street. On his Facebook page the former senior Irish diplomat warns: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With the imminent ending of Theresa May\u2019s leadership of the British Conservative party, and also [her time] as prime minister, the Irish government should reflect on the part they played in her, and indeed moderate Conservatism\u2019s, demise in our neighbour. The likely prospect now seems that Boris Johnston will be the next PM of the UK, or Dominic Raab. </p> \n   <p>The failure to give the UK a reasonable deal in the withdrawal agreement politically killed off May and those around her. It was extremely short sighted to place all Ireland\u2019s eggs in the Brussels basket.

At the same time, the SNP would retain or seek European Union membership.</p> \n  <p>Brown told the Labour rally:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just look at the decisions made by the SNP conference. You know in 2014 Alex Salmond told us we were only leaving the political union. That was all. We were staying in the other unions. Well what is the policy now? It\u2019s a far more extreme version of independence. They have moved, if you like, from soft independence to hard independence. Because they will now leave the British pound, they will leave the UK currency union.</p> \n   <p>[Of] course they want to stay in the European Union after they leave Britain so they\u2019ll leave the UK customs union as well. They have to leave the UK single market; they will leave the UK social welfare union, so pensions and everything else will have to be decided in Scotland and not decided as part of the UK pension scheme we have all contributed to.</p> \n   <p>So this is a far more extreme policy that the SNP are now putting forward and people have got to recognise that if you vote for the SNP on Thursday you\u2019re voting to give recognition and legitimacy and credibility to a more extreme form of independence than ever we have seen. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Scottish Labour is desperately worried about a haemorrhage of support from pro-remain voters to the SNP, the Scottish Greens or Liberal Democrats in Thursday\u2019s election.

On Brexit - indeed, on most topics - it did not take us much beyond what we already know. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Theresa May is expected to speak to cabinet colleagues today ahead of a cabinet meeting tomorrow where ministers will discuss whether or not to hold so-called indicative votes before the vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first of June, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said.</strong> But the spokesman would not give any indication as to whether the indicative votes would go ahead before the bill\u2019s second reading debate (as one government leak last week suggested) or not. In his Today interview this morning <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, suggested <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asabenn/status/1130412857961717760\">there was no point holding indicative votes before the second reading debate</a> because MPs could express their views through amendments to the bill as it was going through parliament. At lobby the spokesman sidestepped a question about whether May agreed with Hancock on this or not.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman was unable to confirm reports saying May is planning to give a speech defending the Brexit bill this week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman would not say when the EU withdrawal agreement bill would be published.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that the bill would amount to a \u201cnew, improved deal\u201d.</strong> He would not give details, but he said there would be provisions designed to assure MPs the government would be working hard to make sure alternative arrangements to the backstop could be in place by the end of 2020.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to confirm <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9100748/nigel-farage-brexit-party-boris-johnson/\">a report</a> claiming that the vote on the bill has been pencilled in for Friday 7 June.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56fdc453d9e727401b8d6a31f50f09aaf48ea325\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56fdc453d9e727401b8d6a31f50f09aaf48ea325/1784_35_3483_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce272b08f088c3e913d9ae9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-20T09:56:45.188Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greens calls for EU-wide legislation for minimum income</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong>, the Green party\u2019s co-leader, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning that all European Green parties were jointly calling for EU legislation to establish a minimum income across the EU.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/images/national-site/eu-2019/eu-manifesto-online-19-05-13.pdf\">The party\u2019s manifesto (pdf)</a> sets this ambition for the European parliament for the next five years:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>European framework legislation must enforce, through a minimum income directive passed by the next European parliament, that member states guarantee their citizens a decent minimum income, respecting national social security systems ....</p> \n   <p>[Green ambition for 2019-2024] Work with member states and stakeholders to establish citizen basic income experiments to understand the viability and practical implementation of establishing a universal basic income for all EU citizens. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked why that was necessary, Bartley said the UK was \u201clagging so far behind when it comes to poverty\u201d. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at 1.6m emergency food bank parcels being issued last year by the Trussell Trust, if you look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/19/uk-government-cruel-policies-child-hunger-breach-human-rights-says-ngo\">the report from Human Rights Watch today about the state of poverty,</a> and the UN rapporteur who is going to come out on Wednesday, I believe, with a very damning report on the state of poverty - something has to be done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Bartley said, under the Green plan, the EU would legislate for a minimum income, but it would be up to member states to decide how they implemented it. He said it should be set at 60% of average income - around \u00a317,000 a year in the UK.<br></p> \n  <p>And he rejected claims that there was economic evidence showing minimum income laws did not work. He said the Tories said 1m jobs would be lost if the government introduced a minimum wage, but those claims turned out to be untrue.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.</p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Greens have been in touch to clarify their policy on a universal basic income (UBI). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/20/brexit-latest-news-developments-may-fresh-bid-to-get-tories-to-back-brexit-bill-faltering-as-david-davis-says-hes-now-voting-against-live-news?page=with:block-5ce272b08f088c3e913d9ae9#block-5ce272b08f088c3e913d9ae9\"> </a>At the last general election<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/02/green-party-universal-basic-income-eliminate-poverty-trap\"> the Green party was campaigning for a universal basic income</a> - a basic payment to everyone, regardless of whether they are working or not working, rich or poor. In these European elections, the Greens and their fellow EU Green parties are calling for EU legislation forcing member states to guarantee people a minimum income. This would involve top-pay payments going to the poor but, unlike a UBI, it would not involve payments to the rich. The Greens think this a realistic EU aspiration for the near future. They also want UBI to be piloted on an EU-wide basis, but they accept that it would take much longer to introduce this across Europe. I have amended the post so that it describes what the party is calling for more accurately.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57d49115d9aa275ab57520bc9880803e9dc550e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d49115d9aa275ab57520bc9880803e9dc550e9/40_0_798_479/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Bartley\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Bartley</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-20T14:34:55.256Z\">at 3.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce271998f08ea3978d8a11e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-20T09:24:51.249Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Responding to the extracts from Gordon Brown\u2019s speech released in advance (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/20/brexit-latest-news-developments-may-fresh-bid-to-get-tories-to-back-brexit-bill-faltering-as-david-davis-says-hes-now-voting-against-live-news?page=with:block-5ce268ff8f088c3e913d9a95#block-5ce268ff8f088c3e913d9a95\">9.52am), </a>the SNP said Brown should apologise to Scotland for campaigning against independence in 2014. <strong>Christian Allard</strong>, one of the party\u2019s European elections candidates, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People in Scotland remember Gordon Brown as playing a key role in the campaign to ensure that we would continue having to live under Tory governments we didn\u2019t vote for - and now that Tory Government is trying to drag Scotland out of the EU against our will. </p> \n   <p>So if he wants people to even consider listening to Labour on anything, Mr Brown should start by apologising to Scotland for the mess he has helped create. </p> \n   <p>While Labour are all over the place on Brexit, a vote for the SNP is a vote to stop Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ce26b768f08ea3978d8a0ea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-20T09:20:01.455Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Change UK could end up fighting general election under new format, Heidi Allen suggests</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Change UK has been criticised for not being very clear about its name.

Then they established themselves as a proper party, Change UK, although early in the European elections campaign sometimes they described themselves as the remain alliance.</p> \n  <p>In an interview on the Today programme this morning <strong>Heidi Allen</strong>, the party\u2019s interim leader, hinted that further change could be coming.

Whatever format, let\u2019s hope we know, depends when the new general election comes, later rather than sooner.

But, whatever the brand new world party looks like, at that point at the general election in South Cambridgeshire, absolutely, I\u2019m not going back to the Conservatives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When why she was suggesting Change UK could change its name again, Allen replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because I want us to get bigger.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have a strong view about the sort of leader that we need - we need a leader not just for now but also for the future, we need to be absolutely four-square in the centre-ground of British politics.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A \u201cleader ... for the future\u201d means \u201csomeone young\u201d.

In interviews this morning, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> the health secretary, said that if MPs wanted Brexit to happen, they should vote for the bill at second reading; if they wanted to change the terms of Brexit, they could amend it later, he argued.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/20/mps-have-duty-to-pass-theresa-may-brexit-deal-says-hancock\">MPs 'have duty' to pass Theresa May's Brexit deal, says Hancock</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>But this morning <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/19/theresa-mays-bold-brexit-offer-just-retread-old-ideas-leaked/\">the Daily Telegraph reports (paywall) </a>that it has seen a summary of the bill sent to cabinet ministers last week and that it confirms that all the supposedly new concessions are ones that have been offered already.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A five-page summary of the bill sent to cabinet ministers last week contained no ideas on how to bridge the gap between the Tories and Labour on a possible customs union with the EU, and no fresh thinking on <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/03/12/brexit-backstop-irish-border-important-deal/\">the Northern Irish backstop</a>, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland if no trade deal is agreed.</p> \n   <p>Instead, it promises to incorporate an idea first proposed by the Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire in January that would give parliament the final say on implementing the backstop, as well as an obligation for the government to \u201cseek\u201d alternative arrangements to the backstop by the end of 2020.</p> \n   <p>It would also incorporate an amendment first proposed to the third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in March by the Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell, which would give parliament a say in what the objectives of future trade negotiations should be.</p> \n   <p>In an attempt to appease the DUP, on whose votes Mrs May relies for her working majority, the document also says the Northern Ireland assembly - which has been suspended for the past two years - will be given a \u201crole\u201d in any decision over the backstop.</p> \n   <p>Sir Bill Cash, the Brexiteer Tory MP who has consistently voted against Mrs May\u2019s deal, said: \u201cThis is pretty cosmetic stuff.

But now he has, and he is voting against. Asked if he would vote for the bill, he told the Today programme this morning:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No. The reason I voted for the last two variants of it is that it had been modified a bit, but what was clear was if we didn\u2019t get that through, there would be a chaotic consequential outcome. And that is what we are seeing now, this chaos.</p> \n   <p>And the trouble is - Matt [Hancock] was doing a good job of defending the line this morning. But this is not a great new offer; it\u2019s a great new concession. What it will do, and this is the critical thing, is, if we pass that act, it opens things up so that the successor to the prime minister, the next prime minister, will have their hands tied.

Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, has played down the significance of a document released at the weekend saying ministers can share information obtained from third parties where there is a \u201cserious risk\u201d of torture \u201cif ministers agree that the potential benefits justify accepting the risk and the legal consequences that may follow\u201d. Speaking in response to a Commons urgent question about the document, Mordaunt said: The UK government stands firmly against torture and does not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment for any purpose. Our policy and activities in this area are in accordance with both domestic and international law. Mordaunt said the new document, released in response to a freedom of information request, dated from 2018 and did not introduce any \u201csubstantial changes\u201d from previous policy. But she also said the wording of the current guidance on this matter was being reviewed. Esther McVey has launched a campaign to reconnect the Conservatives with working-class voters by promising to slash the overseas aid budget and give the money saved to schools and police. The former Labour minister Jane Kennedy has said the party is \u201cbroken to the core\u201d and has been hijacked by \u201csomething really nasty and dark in the hard left\u201d. As Josh Halliday reports, Kennedy, the police and crime commissioner for Merseyside, quit the Labour party in March after the resignation of Luciana Berger, saying it had failed to get to grips with antisemitism.The former Liverpool Wavertree MP, who served as a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said on Monday that other centre-left figures were being \u201chounded out\u201d as a result of ongoing antisemitism and homophobia in local Labour parties. The home secretary has applied to the high court for a secret hearing to prevent public disclosure of the nature of \u201cserious\u201d breaches recently admitted by MI5 in its surveillance safeguards. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Workers at two government departments, including cleaners and caterers, will launch a fresh campaign of strikes on Tuesday in disputes over pay and conditions. As the Press Association reports, members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) at the Foreign Office (FCO) will walk out for two days, while workers at the Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy Department (BEIS) will take action for four days. The dispute at the FCO involves Interserve, which the union accuses of making \u201crepeated blunders\u201d on pay, while PCS says ISS and Aramark are refusing to pay the London living wage. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has a useful tweet on divisions in the Tory leadership race. Off the top of my head, here are a few other questions that are likely to matter in the leadership contest, with different candidates taking different views. A pact with the Brexit party? (Esther McVey would not rule one out, see 2.47pm, although Nicky Morgan has said it would be a death knell for the party.) Holding an early election? (There is not much enthusiasm for one in the party, but some candidates might be more willing to rule one out than others.) Increasing defence spending? (In truth, the division will be more about, by how much? Jeremy Hunt wants to double it.) Cutting taxes? (Again, the division will be about how firmly this can be promised, and by how much. Dominic Raab is already talking about a penny of the basic rate.) Banning Huawei from 5G infrastructure contracts? These are from ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt, who\u2019s been covering a Brexit party rally in Wakefield. Gordon Brown\u2019s office has tweeted this joke from his speech at the Labour rally earlier. Ray Bassett was one of the senior Irish diplomats advising Bertie Ahern\u2019s government the during the run up to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal for Northern Ireland in 1998. Bassett then served as Irish joint secretary to the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast between 2001 and 2005, just prior to the signing of the second major peace deal between unionism and nationalism - the St Andrews Agreement. He also served as an ambassador, but after leaving the Republic\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs stunned some of his former colleagues by turning against the EU and getting involved with the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom party. Today Bassett claims that Irish/EU pressure leading to Theresa May not getting a deal she could sell will result in a real Brexiter entering 10 Downing Street. On his Facebook page the former senior Irish diplomat warns: With the imminent ending of Theresa May\u2019s leadership of the British Conservative party, and also [her time] as prime minister, the Irish government should reflect on the part they played in her, and indeed moderate Conservatism\u2019s, demise in our neighbour. The likely prospect now seems that Boris Johnston will be the next PM of the UK, or Dominic Raab. The failure to give the UK a reasonable deal in the withdrawal agreement politically killed off May and those around her. It was extremely short sighted to place all Ireland\u2019s eggs in the Brussels basket. We needed a good deal for Britain, in our own interests, but the EU Commission needed to teach the deserting Brits a lesson. It was a repeat of the fiasco of the Cameron renegotiation, where our political establishment\u2019s excessive Europhilia trumped the national interest. A sad day for Ireland. Three in five British voters say politics in Westminster and Brussels is broken, according to a poll that finds pro- and anti-Brexit parties are running neck and neck ahead of the European elections on Thursday, my colleague Mark Rice-Oxley reports. Here is the key chart. And here is Mark\u2019s story. The milkshake attack on Nigel Farage is being widely condemned. Downing Street has criticised what happened, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair has said the attack was \u201chorrible\u201d, the Telegraph\u2019s Harry Yorke reports. This is from the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. And this is from Brendan Cox, whose Labour MP wife Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist during the 2016 referendum campaign. YouGov has released some European elections polling for ITV and Cardiff University showing Labour, which has been the dominant party in Welsh politics for almost a century, on course to come third, behind the Brexit party and Plaid Cyrmu. And the Conservatives are on course to come sixth, also behind the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Here is an excerpt from Prof Roger Awan-Scully\u2019s write-up for ITV. These poll results clearly have immediate potential implications for Thursday\u2019s election. But there is a broader historical context here. Since Lloyd George\u2019s victory in the December 1918 general election, there have been 39 Wales-wide electoral contests. The Labour party have come first in 38 of those 39 contests \u2013 the sole exception being the 2009 European election when, at the absolute lowest point of Gordon Brown\u2019s unhappy period as prime minister, Labour finished narrowly behind the Conservatives in Wales. Unless our poll is horribly inaccurate, or Labour stage an astonishing resurgence in the last few days of the European election campaign, we are going to see Labour defeated in Wales for only the second time in the last one hundred years. Mark Drakeford\u2019s first electoral test as Welsh Labour leader will have been failed. We don\u2019t yet know what political implications might follow from such an outcome, but this result in itself would be truly historic. The Greens have been in touch to clarify their policy on a universal basic income (UBI). (See 10.56am.) At the last general election the Green party was campaigning for a universal basic income - a basic payment to everyone, regardless of whether they are working or not working, rich or poor. In these European elections, the Greens and their fellow EU Green parties are calling for EU legislation forcing member states to guarantee people a minimum income. This would involve top-pay payments going to the poor but, unlike a UBI, it would not involve payments to the rich. The Greens think this a realistic EU aspiration for the near future. They also want UBI to be piloted on an EU-wide basis, but they accept that it would take much longer to introduce this across Europe. I\u2019ve just been to see Esther McVey formally launch a new group called Blue Collar Conservatism, an internal party campaign intended to push for policies attracting working voters in former industrial areas, which is also viewed as a vehicle for McVey\u2019s own leadership ambitions. The ex-work and pension secretary, who left government at the end of last year in protest at Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans, is seen as an outsider, but as with many of these efforts the aim is as much to push the individual MP\u2019s policy aims and stature in the party. Speaking in a packed room in parliament \u2013 she had made the wise move of both booking a fairly small space and removing all the chairs \u2013 McVey said the Conservatives must take votes from those who felt abandoned by Labour, in part by delivering Brexit quickly. If that sounds a bit like the Brexit party, there were definite similarities, not least a video featuring uplifting music, the views of annoyed voters and a claim that Labour has abandoned working class people. In a brief Q&amp;A afterwards, McVey declined to say whether she would ever work with Nigel Farage\u2019s party. The main policy specific was to pare back overseas aid funding to 2010 levels and to spend what Mcvey said would be the left over \u00a37bn a year on schools and the police. There were some hiccups more reminiscent of Change UK than the Brexit party \u2013 the first video took some lengthy laptop key-pressing to start, while McVey mis-read her script and referred to having to \u201cclear up the mess that was left by the Conservatives\u201d but the event saw a fair turnout of fellow Tory MPs. McVey also made it clear that she would only back a die-hard Brexiter to replace May, Asked whether someone like Jeremy Hunt or Sajid Javid would suffice, she said it had to be someone who \u201cbelieves in Brexit with a passion\u201d. Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s story about Nigel Farage being hit with a milkshake in Newcastle. Farage has posted this message on Twitter about the incident. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard Farage talk about losers\u2019 consent - a concept that it very well explained in this Twitter thread from Richard Wyn Jones, a professor of Welsh politics. Jones argues that Welsh devolution has been successful because, after a very narrow vote for devolution in 1997, Labour made an effort to obtain losers\u2019 consent to ensure wide support for the assembly that was set up. He posted this Twitter thread to make a point about Brexit, where, he argues, the government has singularly failed to make an effort to accommodate the concerns of remainers. Even though Farage has used the term, it is not apparent that he understands the concept. He is using it to say remainers should just accept Brexit. Jones is arguing that remainers consent would only be forthcoming if the government adopted a softer version of Brexit - something that would appal Farage. (He thinks Theresa May\u2019s Brexit, which would involve being outside the single market and the customs union, is too soft, and is pushing for no-deal as the only proper Brexit.) Farage is also not someone who has shown much willingness to grant losers\u2019 consent himself. Famously, before the 2016 referendum he said that if leave lost narrowly, he would be pushing for a further referendum. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has been in Cyprus where he has warned that the bloc is preparing for a no-deal \u2013 even if it is a scenario that would not be of its choice. He told journalists: We have offered all options to the United Kingdom, from the single market to the customs union or a free trade agreement. We are now waiting for clarity from the United Kingdom. In the meantime, we keep preparing for a no-deal. This is not, and will not be, the EU\u2019s choice. It is for the UK to take its responsibilities. The withdrawal agreement remained the country\u2019s only way to securing an orderly transition, if it still wanted to leave, he told a press conference after flying to the island to especially discuss Brexit with the island\u2019s president Nicos Anastasiades. Cyprus has two British military bases \u2013 a legacy of its colonial era \u2013 whose post-Brexit future has been the focus of talks. \u201cToday the fundamental choices in front of the United Kingdom remain the same: deal, no-deal, no Brexit,\u201d Barnier said. Whatever happens and whatever the political situation in the UK, the issues and solutions remain the same. Let me be clear: if the UK still wants, ratifying the withdrawal agreement is the only way to secure a transition period. That period of transition would give the United Kingdom time to sort out its negotiation positions. This transition period would also give time to both sides to figure out what specific arrangements are necessary in relation to the Northern Irish border on top of the overall EU/UK relationship. The Electoral Commission has said it will visit the Brexit party offices tomorrow to check it is complying with the electoral law about donations, the BBC\u2019s Jessica Parker reports. Gordon Brown has accused the Scottish National party of pursuing a \u201cfar more extreme\u201d version of independence than it has before, as he sought to shore up Labour\u2019s fragile vote in Thursday\u2019s European elections. He told a Labour election rally in Glasgow, where he failed to answer any questions from the media or party members, that the SNP had now abandoned the \u201csoft independence\u201d pursued by Alex Salmond, the then first minister, during the 2014 independence referendum. Then Salmond had wanted to leave the so-called political or parliamentary union between Scotland and the rest of the UK, but retain the monetary union by keeping the pound, and staying in the so-called social union by sharing pensions and some welfare powers. However, the SNP\u2019s spring conference narrowly voted to pursue leaving sterling and setting up an independent Scottish currency immediately after a yes vote in any future independence referendum. At the same time, the SNP would retain or seek European Union membership. Brown told the Labour rally: Just look at the decisions made by the SNP conference. You know in 2014 Alex Salmond told us we were only leaving the political union. That was all. We were staying in the other unions. Well what is the policy now? It\u2019s a far more extreme version of independence. They have moved, if you like, from soft independence to hard independence. Because they will now leave the British pound, they will leave the UK currency union. [Of] course they want to stay in the European Union after they leave Britain so they\u2019ll leave the UK customs union as well. They have to leave the UK single market; they will leave the UK social welfare union, so pensions and everything else will have to be decided in Scotland and not decided as part of the UK pension scheme we have all contributed to. So this is a far more extreme policy that the SNP are now putting forward and people have got to recognise that if you vote for the SNP on Thursday you\u2019re voting to give recognition and legitimacy and credibility to a more extreme form of independence than ever we have seen. Scottish Labour is desperately worried about a haemorrhage of support from pro-remain voters to the SNP, the Scottish Greens or Liberal Democrats in Thursday\u2019s election. The polls show it is likely to hold only one of its two European parliament seats, with the SNP on course to win three of Scotland\u2019s six places. Brown sought to shore up support for the party by insisting only Labour wanted to focus on policies which affected ordinary voters\u2019 every day lives such as the NHS, schools and the economy. The SNP and Tories, he said, had: a constitutional obsession; here you\u2019ve got a never-ending, non-stop Punch and Judy show \u2013 the Conservatives versus the SNP, fighting it out over the minutiae of the constitution and ignoring the main issues that affect the people of Scotland. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, has urged Conservative MPs not to vote for Theresa May\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement bill because it would tie the hands of her successor. Davis did vote for May\u2019s deal when it was defeated for the third time, in March, and his decision to revert to opposing it suggests she is at risk of an even bigger defeat at the next vote, in early June. (See 9.20am.) Downing Street said at tomorrow\u2019s cabinet ministers will discuss whether or not to hold indicative votes before the bill\u2019s second reading. (See 11.57am.) Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has dismissed a call from Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, for an investigation into his party\u2019s finances as an \u201cabsolutely disgusting smear\u201d. (See 12.45pm.) Farage has been hit by a milkshake while campaiging in Newcastle. (See 1.25pm.) Brown has accused the SNP of pushing for \u201chard independence\u201d. (See 9.52am.) Hostile state actors \u2013 spies, assassins or hackers directed by the government of another country \u2013 are to be targeted by refreshed espionage and treason laws, the home secretary has announced. The top Change UK choice in Scotland for this week\u2019s European elections has written an open letter to his fellow party candidates urging them to consider following his lead and voting for the Liberal Democrats or other remain parties. The British government is appointing an international ambassador dedicated to the promotion of human rights, in a move that is likely to put the UK\u2019s patchy approach to autocratic regimes under greater scrutiny. As Patrick Wintour reports, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has appointed Rita French, formerly his principal private secretary, to take on the task of promoting the UK\u2019s work at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council and the cause of human rights internationally. The role is the first of its kind for the British government, although a clutch of other countries including France, Germany and the Netherlands have had the role, some for more than a decade, often taking outspoken positions with countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said that leaving the single market would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Scotland. Speaking ahead of a visit to a fish processing plant in Aberdeen with SNP MEP candidate Christian Allard, she said: The free movement of goods and people across Europe is vital for Scotland\u2019s economic success. But those benefits that we all enjoy are plunged into peril by Brexit. The EU accounts for more than half of Scottish exports - worth \u00a315.7bn to our economy. Blocking Scotland from trading freely with the European Union post-Brexit will be catastrophic to businesses here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been hit by a milkshake while campaigning in Newcastle. These are from the Newcastle Chronicle\u2019s Sean Seddon. Here are some tweets from journalists attending the launch of Esther McVey\u2019s Blue Collar Conservatism campaign. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has described Gordon Brown\u2019s call for the Brexit party to be subject to an Electoral Commission investigation into the source of its funding as an \u201cabsolutely disgusting smear\u201d. Farage told BBC News: This from the man who was part of a Labour party that, through Lord Levy, were, shall we say, making a lot of big donors members of the House of Lords. How dare he? Most of our money has been raised by people giving \u00a325 to become registered supporters. And over 100,000 - nearly 110,000 - of them now have done that. And, frankly, this smacks, I think, of jealousy, because the other parties simply can\u2019t do this. Heidi Allen, Change UK\u2019s interim leader, will apply for an emergency debate later on revoking article 50. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gave a speech this morning in which he said he would use a new power to ban British nationals from entering or remaining in parts of conflict-stricken Syria. As my colleague Jamie Grierson reports, Javid was asked about his own leadership ambitions at the event. Javid was even less forthcoming than Matt Hancock. (See 9.42am.) He said: The prime minister has said she will step down, when she does there will be no shortage of candidates and whether I\u2019m one of them, you\u2019ll have to wait and see. This is from my colleague Severin Carrell, who is at at the Labour event in Glasgow where Gordon Brown has been speaking. Change UK and the Brexit party have spent more on Facebook advertising than any other party in the lead-up to the European elections, new figures show. As the Press Association reports, data from the social media network showed Change UK spent a total of \u00a3107,442 on the platform in the 30 days from April 19. Nigel Farage\u2019s party - currently leading in several polls - spent \u00a395,222 over the same period, which ran until May 18. The Liberal Democrats were the fourth biggest spenders with \u00a376,102 spent over the period on mostly anti-Brexit ads. The party was behind Facebook itself, which spent \u00a386,457 on adverts assuring the public that it was taking action on misinformation. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. On Brexit - indeed, on most topics - it did not take us much beyond what we already know. Here are the main points. Theresa May is expected to speak to cabinet colleagues today ahead of a cabinet meeting tomorrow where ministers will discuss whether or not to hold so-called indicative votes before the vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first of June, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. But the spokesman would not give any indication as to whether the indicative votes would go ahead before the bill\u2019s second reading debate (as one government leak last week suggested) or not. In his Today interview this morning Matt Hancock, the health secretary, suggested there was no point holding indicative votes before the second reading debate because MPs could express their views through amendments to the bill as it was going through parliament. At lobby the spokesman sidestepped a question about whether May agreed with Hancock on this or not. The spokesman was unable to confirm reports saying May is planning to give a speech defending the Brexit bill this week. The spokesman would not say when the EU withdrawal agreement bill would be published. The spokesman insisted that the bill would amount to a \u201cnew, improved deal\u201d. He would not give details, but he said there would be provisions designed to assure MPs the government would be working hard to make sure alternative arrangements to the backstop could be in place by the end of 2020. The spokesman refused to confirm a report claiming that the vote on the bill has been pencilled in for Friday 7 June. Jonathan Bartley, the Green party\u2019s co-leader, told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning that all European Green parties were jointly calling for EU legislation to establish a minimum income across the EU. The party\u2019s manifesto (pdf) sets this ambition for the European parliament for the next five years: European framework legislation must enforce, through a minimum income directive passed by the next European parliament, that member states guarantee their citizens a decent minimum income, respecting national social security systems .... [Green ambition for 2019-2024] Work with member states and stakeholders to establish citizen basic income experiments to understand the viability and practical implementation of establishing a universal basic income for all EU citizens. Asked why that was necessary, Bartley said the UK was \u201clagging so far behind when it comes to poverty\u201d. He explained: If you look at 1.6m emergency food bank parcels being issued last year by the Trussell Trust, if you look at the report from Human Rights Watch today about the state of poverty, and the UN rapporteur who is going to come out on Wednesday, I believe, with a very damning report on the state of poverty - something has to be done. Bartley said, under the Green plan, the EU would legislate for a minimum income, but it would be up to member states to decide how they implemented it. He said it should be set at 60% of average income - around \u00a317,000 a year in the UK. And he rejected claims that there was economic evidence showing minimum income laws did not work. He said the Tories said 1m jobs would be lost if the government introduced a minimum wage, but those claims turned out to be untrue. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. UPDATE: The Greens have been in touch to clarify their policy on a universal basic income (UBI). At the last general election the Green party was campaigning for a universal basic income - a basic payment to everyone, regardless of whether they are working or not working, rich or poor. In these European elections, the Greens and their fellow EU Green parties are calling for EU legislation forcing member states to guarantee people a minimum income. This would involve top-pay payments going to the poor but, unlike a UBI, it would not involve payments to the rich. The Greens think this a realistic EU aspiration for the near future. They also want UBI to be piloted on an EU-wide basis, but they accept that it would take much longer to introduce this across Europe. I have amended the post so that it describes what the party is calling for more accurately. Responding to the extracts from Gordon Brown\u2019s speech released in advance (see 9.52am), the SNP said Brown should apologise to Scotland for campaigning against independence in 2014. Christian Allard, one of the party\u2019s European elections candidates, said: People in Scotland remember Gordon Brown as playing a key role in the campaign to ensure that we would continue having to live under Tory governments we didn\u2019t vote for - and now that Tory Government is trying to drag Scotland out of the EU against our will. So if he wants people to even consider listening to Labour on anything, Mr Brown should start by apologising to Scotland for the mess he has helped create. While Labour are all over the place on Brexit, a vote for the SNP is a vote to stop Brexit. Change UK has been criticised for not being very clear about its name. When eight Labour MPs and three Tories defected in the Commons, they originally set up as the Independent Group, because they were not a party at that stage. They were also known as TIG (The Independent Group), or the Tiggers. Then they established themselves as a proper party, Change UK, although early in the European elections campaign sometimes they described themselves as the remain alliance. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Heidi Allen, the party\u2019s interim leader, hinted that further change could be coming. Asked about claims that she could defect to the Liberal Democrats, she ruled that out. But then she said: Will I stand again in South Cambridgeshire, my constituency, as Change UK? Whatever format, let\u2019s hope we know, depends when the new general election comes, later rather than sooner. If we\u2019ve managed to bring together other MPs from the House of Commons, the format might be slightly different. But, whatever the brand new world party looks like, at that point at the general election in South Cambridgeshire, absolutely, I\u2019m not going back to the Conservatives. When why she was suggesting Change UK could change its name again, Allen replied: Because I want us to get bigger. I want us to get more successful, I want us to have more MPs, more opportunities, to change politics in this country ... I see a modern world of coalition, where it isn\u2019t just about two big parties. I think the whole way that parliament operates at Westminster needs a damn good shake-up, and I want to be part of that. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, is speaking at an election campaign event in Glasgow this morning. As the Guardian reports, he will call for an investigation into the Brexit party\u2019s finances. But he will also claim that Scotland is being let down by the growing intransigence of the SNP and the Conservatives over independence and devolution. In particular, he will accuse the SNP of pushing for \u201chard independence\u201d. According to extracts from his speech released in advance, he will say: I fear for the future of Scotland unless it can break free from this non-stop, never-ending, constitution-obsessed SNP/Conservative Punch and Judy show. Both parties bang on day after day about independence, continuously ratcheting up the decibel levels with their ever-more hard-line policy stances - the SNP for all-out independence, nothing less, that now has become even more extreme with their plans to abandon the British pound and exit the UK customs union and single market - which would not now count as a soft independence, but a hard independence. Meanwhile, the Conservatives increasingly reveal their hand as hostile to devolution - and because in Scotland they can\u2019t talk about Europe or about their policy for austerity they talk about nothing else than the constitutional issues. Essentially, we have two parties dug-in for a trench warfare that suits both of them because they have nothing positive to offer on any other issues. In fact the two parties\u2019 total neglect of the issues that really do affect people - our NHS, our schools, our law and order and our economy - can only have disastrous long-term consequences for the Scottish economy and for Scotland\u2019s public services. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is understood to be planning to stand for the Conservative party leadership. But in an interview on the Today programme this morning, he refused to confirm that he would be a candidate. He told the programme: It\u2019s flattering that lots of people have asked me to put my name forward and proposed to support me if I do but that isn\u2019t the point, which is we still have to get this legislation to deliver Brexit through. Asked if he was not announcing his bid because a recent poll of Conservative members put his support at just 1%, he said: No, because the contest hasn\u2019t started yet. But, as he continued his answer, Hancock did go on to sum up his pitch for the top job in a sentence. He said: I have a strong view about the sort of leader that we need - we need a leader not just for now but also for the future, we need to be absolutely four-square in the centre-ground of British politics. A \u201cleader ... for the future\u201d means \u201csomeone young\u201d. Hancock is just 40, meaning that he is the youngest of the cabinet-level contenders for the job. And someone \u201cin the centre-ground of British politics\u201d means \u201cnot a rightwinger\u201d. Most of the leading candidates in the contest are on the right of the party. Hancock himself is more aligned to the centre right, and he will be looking for support from this wing. Yesterday, in an article for the Sunday Times (paywall), Theresa May said that when MPs vote on the EU withdrawal agreement bill in the first week of June, it would involve a \u201cnew, bold offer\u201d with \u201can improved package of measures\u201d that she hoped would win over some of those MPs who voted against her Brexit deal on the previous three occasions. In interviews this morning, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that if MPs wanted Brexit to happen, they should vote for the bill at second reading; if they wanted to change the terms of Brexit, they could amend it later, he argued. But this morning the Daily Telegraph reports (paywall) that it has seen a summary of the bill sent to cabinet ministers last week and that it confirms that all the supposedly new concessions are ones that have been offered already. A five-page summary of the bill sent to cabinet ministers last week contained no ideas on how to bridge the gap between the Tories and Labour on a possible customs union with the EU, and no fresh thinking on the Northern Irish backstop, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland if no trade deal is agreed. Instead, it promises to incorporate an idea first proposed by the Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire in January that would give parliament the final say on implementing the backstop, as well as an obligation for the government to \u201cseek\u201d alternative arrangements to the backstop by the end of 2020. It would also incorporate an amendment first proposed to the third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d in March by the Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell, which would give parliament a say in what the objectives of future trade negotiations should be. In an attempt to appease the DUP, on whose votes Mrs May relies for her working majority, the document also says the Northern Ireland assembly - which has been suspended for the past two years - will be given a \u201crole\u201d in any decision over the backstop. Sir Bill Cash, the Brexiteer Tory MP who has consistently voted against Mrs May\u2019s deal, said: \u201cThis is pretty cosmetic stuff. It will not have any effect on leave-supporting MPs and in fact there are votes coming back to our side from people who backed the deal last time.\u201d Ominously for May, there are signs that the majority against her deal in June could be even bigger than the 58-vote majority against it in the last vote, in March. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, supported her last time, and in an interview for the BBC\u2019s Week in Westminster on Saturday he said he had not decided what he would do next time. But now he has, and he is voting against. Asked if he would vote for the bill, he told the Today programme this morning: No. The reason I voted for the last two variants of it is that it had been modified a bit, but what was clear was if we didn\u2019t get that through, there would be a chaotic consequential outcome. And that is what we are seeing now, this chaos. And the trouble is - Matt [Hancock] was doing a good job of defending the line this morning. But this is not a great new offer; it\u2019s a great new concession. What it will do, and this is the critical thing, is, if we pass that act, it opens things up so that the successor to the prime minister, the next prime minister, will have their hands tied. And I think the next prime minister must have the right to reset the negotiations on their terms. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a walkabout in Exeter. Later he is holding campaign events in Newcastle, Halifax and Horwich. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, speaks at a Labour rally for the European elections in Glasgow. 1pm: Esther McVey, a candidate for the Conservative leadership, launches a Blue Collar Conservatism campaign. 1.45pm: Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, and Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP candidate, hold a rally in Bristol. 2.30pm: Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons for the fist time. 4pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, gives evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about the role of parliament in authorising the use of military force. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

I\u2019ve done a lot of things, I\u2019ve written a lot of things and I\u2019m comfortable with everything. Except for one thing: this rise of Brexit, this rise of populism, this possible collapse of the EU. This is something my generation is responsible for and something, if it happens, future generations will never forgive us for. And rightly so.</p> <p>That is why on the day before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-elections\">the European elections</a> \u2013 in which I will vote for Macron and, were I British, I would vote for the Liberal Democrats since they are the only party fighting to remain \u2013 I will be in Britain to give a special performance of my one-man play, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/05/please-please-remain-bernard-henri-levy-performs-one-man-brexit-play\">Last Exit Before Brexit</a> (now Looking For Europe).</p> <p>Its message? Please, please don\u2019t go. Brexit will be a disaster for the UK. You will collapse \u2013 from Great Britain to Little England \u2013 and all of Europe will suffer. I don\u2019t think France and Germany, and I say this as a Frenchman, understand the extent of their need for the UK. The ideas of British liberalism are at the heart of the European ideal.

In 1948, the year I was born, my parents encouraged me to listen to the radio when Churchill gave his Zurich speech [in which he said: \u201cWe must re-create the European family in a regional structure called the United States of Europe.\u201d] My parents said this was the voice of absolute good. And that\u2019s what Britain has meant to me. If everywhere else became fascist, if everywhere else turned its back on liberalism, Britain would stand firm.</p> <p>For me your parliament was the greatest parliament in the world, the first and best democracy. For me it is a sacred space. To see it reduced to this theatre of shadows is a tragedy. I do not know what Jeremy Corbyn stands for, except failing to deal with anti-Semitism in his own party. And Theresa May? She says she remains firm, but she does not know what courage and bravery are \u2013 they involve acting in the consciousness of history. It is like Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm: if you turn down the volume on the TV and look from one to the other, they are the same.</p> <p>One thing I will talk about in my play is the Irish Question. Achieving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/it-took-me-years-to-accept-it-would-work-readers-on-the-good-friday-agreement\">peace in Ireland</a> has been the greatest achievement of the EU. This is not Airbus, Arte or Erasmus we\u2019re talking about \u2013 it\u2019s peace in Ireland. And that is now under threat. Ireland is not a detail, it is a member of the European family. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/04/invisible-irish-border-crucial-support-backstop-brexit-northern-ireland\">hard border</a> again is intolerable. And if there is Brexit then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">Scotland will leave</a>. No doubt about that. The UK will become a broken family surrounded by hard borders.</p> <p>I\u2019ll make you this bet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/16/nigel-farage-truth-honesty-brexit-party\">Nigel Farage</a> will know soon enough what kind of world he desires. It will be one of unemployment for you, of insularity, a little England, a corpse. I\u2019ll make another bet. You have never experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\">fascism</a> like the rest of Europe has. When I was younger, I thought England would be the last place in the world to collapse into fascism. It was the country of Churchill, not Mosley.

This doesn\u2019t work in the 21st century. We have to take responsibility. We have to be together. And we have to fight against this nightmare of Brexit. You really have a problem Britain, my God!</p> <p>You may not have heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verit%C3%A0\">La Monte Verit\u00e0</a> [The Hill of Truth]. But for me that is the model of how artists should be. It was an alternative colony in Switzerland in the early 20th century where artists and intellectuals \u2013 Rudolph Steiner, Carl Jung, Paul Klee, Isadora Duncan and Bauhaus members \u2013 formed a utopian community without nationalities or borders. They had conferences discussing dance as art, and women\u2019s rights. They tried to find a new meaning to life communally. In the early 20th century, they created a model of what Europe might be: a place without borders.</p> <p>You ask if I am a member of an elite art world because I love the idea of such utopias? You worry that the populists like Trump and Farage will say they are the true voices of the people, opposing elitists like me? That makes me laugh. I am 73 years old and I have had a 50-year career, but I started off as an underground artist. Only after my show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2012/jul/04/marina-abramovic-the-artist-is-present-video\">The Artist Is Present</a>, at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art in 2010, did I suddenly become seen as a jetsetter. But I\u2019ve never been a jetsetter. I am an artist who believes in changing the world.</p> <p>I have chosen a piece to be auctioned for the United Artists of Europe initiative. It is a photograph of a little girl from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/laos\">Laos</a> sitting on my lap holding a gun. I was working with children in Laos aged four to 10. They had experienced the kinds of disaster most of Europe in my lifetime has not \u2013 with the exception of my former homeland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jul/13/siege-of-sarajevo-ian-traynor-maggie-okane-1993\">Yugoslavia</a>. There were unexploded bombs in their forests. All the children knew about guns.</p> <p>This seven-year-old girl knew what a gun was and how to use it. This was part of an installation I did called <a href=\"http://www.li-ma.nl/lima/catalogue/art/marina-abramovic/8-lessons-on-emptiness-with-a-happy-end/14039#\">8 Lessons on Emptiness with a Happy End</a>. I gave the children these Chinese weapons and, at the end, they burned them. Will there be a happy end for Europe? I\u2019m not optimistic.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Brexit backers can take out their anger on our punchbag\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, artists; Michael Elmgreen was born in Denmark, Ingar Dragset in Norway; they now live in Berlin</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d0dc00225a5d02e4d3367a54e0f732676dd5f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d0dc00225a5d02e4d3367a54e0f732676dd5f34/0_411_4000_5250/762.jpg\" alt=\"Please punch \u2026 Anger Management by Elmgreen & Dragset.\" width=\"762\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Please punch \u2026 Anger Management by Elmgreen &amp; Dragset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artists and Victoria Miro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why is there an EU flag on our Anger Management punchbag? Because it would be ideal if Brexit backers could take out some of their anger on something other than a whole nation. They should each have a punchbag and go crazy on it at home. Then afterwards, they might be more balanced and nuanced in political debates.</p> <p>MPs have for a long time blamed the EU for domestic problems caused by their own decision-making or, rather, lack of decision-making. So it was no wonder the referendum turned out as it did. It was a campaign based on lies influenced by years of this scapegoating.</p> <p>Right now, one of the Tory government\u2019s arguments for backing Brexit is that they want more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/16/brexit-talks-with-government-have-stalled-says-corbyn\">deregulation</a>, which means being able to import chemical-infested food from the US and getting rid of regulations that protect human rights and labour conditions.</p> <p>Everyone should have a role in the Brexit debate. You as a citizen \u2013 artist or not \u2013 have an obligation to be engaged because the outcome will shape generations to come. We think artworks have a role in the Brexit debate because they speak in a different language, one that can hit you where a politician\u2019s words or a newspaper article cannot.</p> <p>Our punchbag sculpture uses humour to speak about something that is actually tragic. But the motif on the punchbag could be anything you fear in a simplistic way. It is there to help you take out your frustrations \u2013 in a healthier way than attacking other people. It should sit in the lobby of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/palace-of-westminster\">Westminster</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I like cities and people, not nationalities and borders\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Ron Arad, British-Israeli architect, artist and designer</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35c498c495488b7cd151131cad8549f7f5bf6a26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c498c495488b7cd151131cad8549f7f5bf6a26/0_121_1600_2279/702.jpg\" alt=\"Absence \u2026 the sitter-less seat by Ron Arad.\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Absence \u2026 the sitter-less seat by Ron Arad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was born in Tel Aviv, but I live and work in Europe. I don\u2019t like nationalities. I like cities and people. I don\u2019t like borders \u2013 and Brexit is all about borders. I teach at the Royal College of Art in London and I love it when my students return from working in Europe all fired up with new ideas. This won\u2019t happen if they find it more difficult to travel.</p> <p>For architects, freedom to travel is important. I\u2019m about to go to Toronto for the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/143112233\">launch of Safe Hands, a 31-metre tall </a>cylindrical tower. I got an idea of what Brexit might be like when I was told that I couldn\u2019t use Europeans to make it. I really moaned because I wanted to work with people I trusted. It was fine in the end because I found this little place in Toronto, run by a man and his dog, who made the stainless steel tower. It looks like it\u2019s going to fall on you but it won\u2019t. That\u2019s why I called it Safe Hands. No, it\u2019s not an ironic reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>.</p> <p>For this auction, I chose to donate a chair. It\u2019s not just a chair but a sculpture, a negative impression of an invisible sitter, an everyman. The sitter could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/14/twiggy-face-of-1966-reveals-she-hated-her-looks\">Twiggy</a> or Pavarotti. It\u2019s named after my friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gormley\">Antony Gormley</a>, but spelled differently: Rod Gomli. When no one\u2019s sitting on it, it just tilts up and points at the sky. I\u2019ll miss it when it\u2019s gone.

I gave the children these Chinese weapons and, at the end, they burned them. Will there be a happy end for Europe? I\u2019m not optimistic. \u2018Brexit backers can take out their anger on our punchbag\u2019 Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, artists; Michael Elmgreen was born in Denmark, Ingar Dragset in Norway; they now live in Berlin Why is there an EU flag on our Anger Management punchbag? Because it would be ideal if Brexit backers could take out some of their anger on something other than a whole nation. They should each have a punchbag and go crazy on it at home. Then afterwards, they might be more balanced and nuanced in political debates. MPs have for a long time blamed the EU for domestic problems caused by their own decision-making or, rather, lack of decision-making. So it was no wonder the referendum turned out as it did. It was a campaign based on lies influenced by years of this scapegoating. Right now, one of the Tory government\u2019s arguments for backing Brexit is that they want more deregulation, which means being able to import chemical-infested food from the US and getting rid of regulations that protect human rights and labour conditions. Everyone should have a role in the Brexit debate. You as a citizen \u2013 artist or not \u2013 have an obligation to be engaged because the outcome will shape generations to come. We think artworks have a role in the Brexit debate because they speak in a different language, one that can hit you where a politician\u2019s words or a newspaper article cannot. Our punchbag sculpture uses humour to speak about something that is actually tragic. But the motif on the punchbag could be anything you fear in a simplistic way. It is there to help you take out your frustrations \u2013 in a healthier way than attacking other people. It should sit in the lobby of Westminster. \u2018I like cities and people, not nationalities and borders\u2019 Ron Arad, British-Israeli architect, artist and designer I was born in Tel Aviv, but I live and work in Europe. I don\u2019t like nationalities. I like cities and people. I don\u2019t like borders \u2013 and Brexit is all about borders. I teach at the Royal College of Art in London and I love it when my students return from working in Europe all fired up with new ideas. This won\u2019t happen if they find it more difficult to travel. For architects, freedom to travel is important. I\u2019m about to go to Toronto for the launch of Safe Hands, a 31-metre tall cylindrical tower. I got an idea of what Brexit might be like when I was told that I couldn\u2019t use Europeans to make it. I really moaned because I wanted to work with people I trusted. It was fine in the end because I found this little place in Toronto, run by a man and his dog, who made the stainless steel tower. It looks like it\u2019s going to fall on you but it won\u2019t. That\u2019s why I called it Safe Hands. No, it\u2019s not an ironic reference to Theresa May. For this auction, I chose to donate a chair. It\u2019s not just a chair but a sculpture, a negative impression of an invisible sitter, an everyman. The sitter could be Twiggy or Pavarotti. It\u2019s named after my friend Antony Gormley, but spelled differently: Rod Gomli. When no one\u2019s sitting on it, it just tilts up and points at the sky. I\u2019ll miss it when it\u2019s gone. But it will free some space in the studio, a negative of its presence. \u2022 The United Artists for Europe projectwill exhibit works by various figures at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, London, 21-23 May; the pieces will be auctioned at Maison Assouline on 3 June, in aid of pro-Europe cultural causes. More details: artistsforeurope.org. Looking for Europe is a free show airing at 6.30pm, 22 May at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac",

First, because it does not add up. Kellner\u2019s argument is based on the premise that the number of working-class leave voters who voted Labour in 2017 is relatively small. Working-class leave voters were far more likely to vote Tory, for smaller parties or not to vote at all in 2017.</p> <p>But many of them were Labour voters once. Between 2001 and 2015 we lost millions of working-class votes \u2013 which, by the last general election, left us with an electoral profile quite unlike anything we held previously. This was a trend highlighted best by Labour\u2019s stunning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/28/canterbury-we-made-a-difference-election-labour-tory\" title=\"\">success in Canterbury</a>, and by the staggering loss of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/22/mansfield-miners-strike-general-election-brexit\" title=\"\">Mansfield</a>, which had voted Labour for generations. To abandon any prospect of representing those voters again is effectively an argument to abandon much of the working class \u2013 and with it any prospect of a Labour government.</p> <p>To win a majority in the country, Labour needs to win seats in the parts of the UK that backed leave. There is no route to 10 Downing Street that doesn\u2019t run through areas that voted heavily to leave and heavily to remain. It is right to acknowledge that, in all these seats, many 2017 Labour voters backed remain; but what of the millions of who voted leave the year before and Labour in 2017?</p> <p>And what of the millions of former Labour supporters who voted leave, and who see Labour advocates in the media daily calling for their votes to be ignored? While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/labour-and-tories-enjoy-mixed-night-of-results-in-local-elections-in-england\" title=\"\">2018 local elections</a> saw us pile up votes in places such as Trafford and the London boroughs, we lost councillors in Sunderland, Bolton and Wigan despite eight years of austerity. We cannot win without the trust and support of those towns.</p> <p>Moreover, calls for a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d with only Theresa May\u2019s unpopular agreement and remain on the ballot will be seen by many of those voters as dishonest. Significant numbers now want to leave without a deal and would consider this to be a referendum without a genuine leave option at all. For others, this is a straightforward attempt to overturn the result of the first referendum without making any attempt in good faith to implement it.</p> <p>In areas where we\u2019ve seen decades of decline, where good jobs have been replaced with zero-hours contracts and young people have left in large numbers, there is already a lingering sense that people\u2019s views and experiences are not understood or respected. A rigged referendum will cost us the trust and respect of millions of current and former Labour voters. In a representative democracy trust is the glue that binds us together. Without it the system will not survive.</p> <p>And the issue goes so much further than electoral maths. I may take a different view to many of my constituents on Brexit, but I like and respect them enough to know that wanting to leave the EU is not the same as being stupid or racist, as they have too often been labelled. They listened to the economic arguments I, and others, put forward in 2016 and took a judgment to vote leave. I am yet to meet more than a handful of people who have changed their minds.</p> <p>Those working-class men and women come from families who worked in the mining, railway and textile industries to build this country\u2019s prosperity and influence in the world. They have supported the Labour and trade union movement for a century and enabled us collectively to win employment, healthcare and housing rights that have changed this country forever. In recent years Labour has also been building its support in city and metropolitan areas, and I welcome that. But we also have a historic duty to the families in towns outside those big urban centres where we are struggling to retain support. A Labour party that cannot also speak for them doesn\u2019t feel much like a Labour party at all.</p> <p>We represent the most leave and remain areas of the country, which have been moving apart for decades. But our dilemma is the country\u2019s dilemma, and if ever there was a time to step up to that challenge, it is now. It is the mark of real leadership not to pick a side and wave a flag, but to seek to bring these complex alliances and interests together to find a solution. Nobody else is trying. That is what Labour must redouble its efforts to do.</p> <p>\u2022 Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for Wigan</p>",

They listened to the economic arguments I, and others, put forward in 2016 and took a judgment to vote leave. I am yet to meet more than a handful of people who have changed their minds. Those working-class men and women come from families who worked in the mining, railway and textile industries to build this country\u2019s prosperity and influence in the world. They have supported the Labour and trade union movement for a century and enabled us collectively to win employment, healthcare and housing rights that have changed this country forever. In recent years Labour has also been building its support in city and metropolitan areas, and I welcome that. But we also have a historic duty to the families in towns outside those big urban centres where we are struggling to retain support. A Labour party that cannot also speak for them doesn\u2019t feel much like a Labour party at all. We represent the most leave and remain areas of the country, which have been moving apart for decades. But our dilemma is the country\u2019s dilemma, and if ever there was a time to step up to that challenge, it is now. It is the mark of real leadership not to pick a side and wave a flag, but to seek to bring these complex alliances and interests together to find a solution. Nobody else is trying. That is what Labour must redouble its efforts to do. \u2022 Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for Wigan",
