But, of course, this is impossible because it is 19th-century France and she is a young woman who has borne a child out of wedlock and sold her teeth. Still, I enjoyed the possibility.</p> <h2>The Gwyneth Paltrow onion for tears on demand</h2> <p>This ought to go to Fantine (Collins) for perfecting a tuberculosis cough and a realistic death rattle. But in fact I found myself more moved by the moral turmoil facing Valjean (West). There is something touching and real about what West is portraying: he really knows how to show what Valjean is wrestling with both externally (against Javert) and internally (against his own conscience), depicting this with very few lines of dialogue.

Dramas in which the lineaments of a luminescent, semi-naked-to-a-carefully-contracted-degree, smooth-fleshed, blood-spattered female corpse are traced by a slow-moving camera to galvanise the tortured protagonist to push himself ever harder in pursuit of justice for the innocent victim and redemption for himself. And I vacillate. Sometimes I think TV should try harder, avoid lazy conceits, stop shoring up the cultural shibboleth that says men are heroes and women natural victims. And sometimes I think men should stop killing women so much in real life, so that television might mercifully follow suit. I don\u2019t see much hope for the medium\u2019s success if it simply denies the truth at every turn, nor much use in doing so. Although, of course, there are always less lovingly-lingering ways to portray it.</p> <p>The portrayals of real-life murder cases generally avoid this pitfall. Even the most obtuse writer and director will usually have the common decency not to drool over a living family\u2019s loved and lost one, or use her as mere window dressing for another\u2019s story. They raise concerns about exploitation and the raking over of terrible griefs and, if the programme is not made with the explicit consent of the bereaved, then I suppose it is a matter of deals between God, the devil and their conscience all round and hoping for the best.</p> <p>It is not clear how happy \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 the families of murdered 13-year-old Milly Dowler, 22-year-old Am\u00e9lie Delagrange and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell are about Manhunt, the ITV adaptation of the memoirs of Colin Sutton, the detective in charge of the Delagrange investigation that came to identify Levi Bellfield as the killer of them all. But, running over three consecutive nights, this sober, responsible production that has even managed to avoid the temptation of hyping it as Martin Clunes\u2019s first foray into straight drama and aggrandising him or the production at their expense.</p> <p>Clunes does fine work as an utterly ordinary detective (which I suppose is not quite the same thing as an utterly ordinary bloke) finding himself in charge of an utterly extraordinary investigation. His fleetness and lightness of touch remain, but are pressed into the service of credibility rather than comedy. As the pressures and politics accumulate, Sutton remains, as humans do, still able to flex and chide and laugh, and keep himself and others around him sane. When his second-in-command reassures him that he is up to the investigative task with the words \u201cYou\u2019re as good for this as anyone\u201d, his reply, \u201cNow you\u2019ve ruined it\u201d, restores them both, and back to work they go. It is one of numerous subtle, gentle moments in Ed Whitmore\u2019s script that aerates what could otherwise be a suffocating story.</p> <p>Delagrange\u2019s battered body is found on Twickenham Green on 19 August 2004. First, she must be identified \u2013 she has no ID on her \u2013 and then the police can set their faces towards whoever saw fit to raise a hammer and kill her after she missed her stop and had to walk home across a patch of common land alone after dark.</p> <p>The drama\u2019s mapping of the murder squad\u2019s work is almost as detailed as the work itself. It moves outwards in concentric circles from the white tent erected over the body, to the fingertip search of the green we see in the background, to the repositioning of the cordon to stop contamination of the scene by a careless public, and then on through the CCTV tapes from further and further afield that gradually piece together Delagrange\u2019s movements and \u2013 eventually \u2013 the brief appearance just before her murder and disappearance, just after, of a van.</p> <p>More circles, wider-spaced, emanate, meanwhile, from McDonnell\u2019s case. She was killed the year before Delagrange, in the same part of south-west London, with a hammer as she walked home alone from a bus stop. But the investigation was wound down, prematurely in Sutton\u2019s view, when they found a likely suspect, even though he was sectioned before he could be arrested or charged. In the overlap of this awful Venn diagram, a murder can be found.</p> <p>When Delagrange\u2019s parents arrive from France, Sutton takes them to the spot where she died. Her mother presses her palm to the blood-soaked turf. No redemption anywhere.</p>",

First, she must be identified \u2013 she has no ID on her \u2013 and then the police can set their faces towards whoever saw fit to raise a hammer and kill her after she missed her stop and had to walk home across a patch of common land alone after dark. The drama\u2019s mapping of the murder squad\u2019s work is almost as detailed as the work itself. It moves outwards in concentric circles from the white tent erected over the body, to the fingertip search of the green we see in the background, to the repositioning of the cordon to stop contamination of the scene by a careless public, and then on through the CCTV tapes from further and further afield that gradually piece together Delagrange\u2019s movements and \u2013 eventually \u2013 the brief appearance just before her murder and disappearance, just after, of a van. More circles, wider-spaced, emanate, meanwhile, from McDonnell\u2019s case. She was killed the year before Delagrange, in the same part of south-west London, with a hammer as she walked home alone from a bus stop. But the investigation was wound down, prematurely in Sutton\u2019s view, when they found a likely suspect, even though he was sectioned before he could be arrested or charged. In the overlap of this awful Venn diagram, a murder can be found. When Delagrange\u2019s parents arrive from France, Sutton takes them to the spot where she died. Her mother presses her palm to the blood-soaked turf. No redemption anywhere.",

      "bodyText": "And with that, good night. Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it, and thanks for reading. Here\u2019s a little round-up of the games earlier today, in Spain and around Europe. And so, Barcelona go five points clear at the top of the table, ten ahead of Real Madrid who are sloshing around down there in fifth. Really good game, that. Getafe\u2019s attacking threat faded towards the last 20-odd minutes, but they were at the very worst competitive against a Barca team with Messi as otherworldly as ever. Peeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +3: Messi booms a massive ball from left to right, finding Suarez at the back post, but despite having a couple of options at the edge of and in the area, he shoots straight into the shins of the first man. 90 mins +1: More brilliance from Messi, exchanging passes with Alena down the right and he cuts into the middle, is fouled but keeps his feet and passes to Suarez, but he runs straight into a defender as he tries to nutmeg him. 90 mins: Three minutes of added time.... 88 mins: And the final sub of the game: Alena is on for Barca, with Artur shuffling off. 86 mins: Messi is dragged to the floor about 25 yards from goal, just to the right of centre. He lines up the free-kick himself, but sticks it high and wide. 85 mins: Coutinho\u2019s first task is to swing over a corner from the left, which he does right onto Lenglet\u2019s head, but he sticks the effort wide. 84 mins: Changes for both teams: Coutinho comes on in place of Dembele, while for Getafe Robert Ibanez replaces Portillo. 83 mins: Getafe give Messi three yards of space on the edge of the box, which is an interesting defensive approach. Soria does well to push the shot out, Dembele is first to it and squares across the six-yard box where Suarez is waiting to tap home, but the excellent Djene gets there first and clears. 81 mins: Mata drags Rakitic to the ground. There\u2019s been just enough unpleasantness and needle to this game. 79 mins: From a corner, Saiz tries to batter a first-time volley at goal and...well, let\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t connect as he\u2019d like. 77 mins: Yellow card for Maksimovic for a trip on Suarez, who limps away as if there were axes on his opponent\u2019s boots. 75 mins: Big chances for Messi: Dembele runs through from deep and waits, waits, waits then smartly slips the pass through to Messi. He never really looks like the ball is under control, but he digs it out enough to shoot, and Soria saves. 74 mins: Another sub for Getafe, and FAO Leeds fans: Samu Saiz is on for Angel Rodriguez. 72 mins: Hopefully this is coming across, but this is an absolutely belting game. Djene smartly levers Suarez out of the way but is then penalised for a foul on Artur. 70 mins: Sub for Barcelona, and here\u2019s Busquets, on for Vidal. 69 mins: Cabrera goes into the book and is probably lucky not to get harsher punishment for absolutely ploughing through Suarez. Late, aggressive, clumsy, out of control. Oof. 68 mins: That Molina miss was a bit like the moment that you first approach someone you find attractive and are suddenly unable to speak. Looking at the replay, rather than his tongue he lost control of his feet just after he took it round the keeper. 67 mins: Oh lord, what a miss! Molina goes through on goal, he gently shimmies around Ter Stegen, but just as he\u2019s about to put the ball into the empty net, he suddenly appears to become aware of the size of the moment, and he skews it wide. Oh lord, what a miss! 66 mins: Portillo plays a nice ball down the right side of the area to Molina, but his cross is weak and towards the near post, and Ter Stegen claims. 65 mins: Booking for Vidal, for chopping Armabarri to the floor in midfield. 64 mins: Happens to literally the best of them. 63 mins: Messi goes for the opposite corner, but puts it over the bar. He chastises himself at length. 61 mins: A Barca counter at terrifying speed, led by Dembele. He flicks it to Messi, who in turn instantly helps it on to Suarez, but Soria races off his line to smother it. However, Messi had been taken out after the ball had gone, and Barca have a free-kick on the edge of the D, to the left of centre... 59 mins: Getafe should be level again! A brilliant header from a corner by Cabrera, running onto it at pace like a latter-day Les Ferdinand, is tipped over the bar. That corner came when Alba wasn\u2019t a million miles away from scoring an own-goal, flicking a back-header from a free-kick just wide. 57 mins: Change for Getafe, and it\u2019s an attacking one: Folquier, who\u2019s been on the right of midfield, is withdrawn in favour of striker Jorge Molina. 56 mins: Getafe counter at some pace down the right but Mata\u2019s skimmed, head-height cross is cleared before it can reach Rodriguez. 54 mins: Dembele does well after a testing pass by Alba and some close attention from Djene to clip a cross over from the left of the area. That cross is only half-headed clear, and falls to Messi who lashes it towards goal with his right foot, but it\u2019s straight at Soria. His palms are stung, but you\u2019d think if that was on Messi\u2019s left, the keeper would\u2019ve stood no chance. 52 mins: Suarez (Damian) chucks a long ball forward which Ter Stegen does the hoary old keeper thing of barreling out and punching clear, taking out everything in his path, including Mata. But it was all for nought in the end, because the flag had gone up, Mata being offside. 49 mins: Oh my days, Getafe should be level. Lenglet overhits a backpass to Ter Stegen, who rushes into his clearance and puts it high in the air. Folquier gets there first and sends it first-time to Rodriguez, who is through on goal and shoots across the face...and it clips the outside of the post with Ter Stegen beaten. 47 mins: Classic Suarez (Luis), as he runs in front of Suarez (Damian), stops and shoves himself backwards, and thus into his opponent/namesake, then throws himself to the floor to win a free-kick. The referee is suitably hoodwinked, and gives the Barca man a free-kick. 46 mins: We\u2019re away again for the second half. No changes for either side as yet. Good game, this. Barcelona could well be about three or four ahead but at the same time Getafe might feel they deserve to be level. They\u2019ve had a goal disallowed touch and go fashion, plus have attacked to a sensible degree, but just haven\u2019t been able to keep out some absolute brilliance from Barcelona\u2019s usual suspects. Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: Here\u2019s that Suarez goal. Clean. 43 mins: Barcelona aren\u2019t happy after Dembele claimed he was fouled when driving towards the box, but Antunes carries on and crosses from deep on the left to the back post, where Rodriguez volleys it back across goal where Jaime Mata arrives to scuff into the empty net. Now then. 41 mins: Post! Getafe nearly get right back into the game straight away. Rodriguez crosses from the left, Arambarri makes a Lampardian run late into the box and hits it first time on the volley aiming for the right corner of the net, but it takes a massive deflection and hits the left upright. Lucky, and unlucky. 39 mins: From that free-kick conceded by Antunes, Messi sticks it into the mixer, from which it is headed to the edge of the box by Djene. There Suarez is waiting, and he positions his body superbly and volleys perfectly into the near corner. That could have gone anywhere, but thanks to Suarez\u2019s brilliance it\u2019s a goal. WOOF! What a strike! 38 mins: Antunes barrels right into Sergi Roberto as if he\u2019s trying to break down a door with his shoulder, and is lucky not to be booked. Roberto limps away but will be OK to continue. 36 mins: Messi tries to thread a pass through to Suarez (Luis), but it\u2019s intercepted by Suarez (Damian). Suarez (Luis) then barges Suarez (Damian) over from behind, and concedes a free-kick. 34 mins: Getafe with a rare sortie up field, but Mata tosses it away by lashing a poor cross much too close to Ter Stegen who plucks it from the air. 32 mins: Rakitic is playing in the Busquets role tonight, and he\u2019s doing it pretty well. He whips the ball away from Rodriguez as he tries to set something up by bringing the ball down on his chest. 29 mins: And another huge chance. Suarez makes space with one of those beautifully simple little shifts of his body, shifts the ball from left to right foot and shoots just a little bit wide. He\u2019s apoplectic that the referee doesn\u2019t spot the slight deflection that perhaps carried the ball past the post. 26 mins: Lordy, Barca should be two up. The corner from that last move isn\u2019t properly cleared, it falls for Messi who zips into the box and stabs it to Artur, who cuts back to Pique, unmarked, about seven yards out, but he strikes his shot too close to Soria who makes a good save. 25 mins: There\u2019s Alba again, set loose behind the Getafe defence as he speeds towards the byline, but his cut-back cross is put behind. 23 mins: Barca nearly go two ahead as Suarez shoots from a tight angle, which Soria does well to stand up to and block, with Alba probably in a better position but ignored. 20 mins: The ball loops into the area, looking like it will land between two Getafe defenders and goalkeeper Soria, but who should speed in there like Roadrunner, nip the ball away and make the three crash into each other like Acme villains? Obviously Messi, whose initial effort is blocked before his collision by Soria, it breaks to the thinnest of angles and Messi strokes it into the net while not even looking up. Solid player, this lad. He continues to be absolutely extraordinary. 17 mins: Good lord. Vidal gets himself into a little trouble in the Barca right-back position, but instead of sticking the ball out or looking for a short pass, he hoofs it back towards his own goal. Ter Stegen deals with it pretty well, controlling on his chest and volleying away under significant pressure from Rodriguez who fouls him, but that was all for nought as the referee had blown up for a foul on Vidal to start with. 15 mins: A couple of bookings now, as Folquier and Alba clash down the left side of the Barca penalty area. Not entirely sure why both men were booked, but it was a free-kick to Getafe in the end. 12 mins: Artur goes into the book after a stray arm into the face of Rodriguez. Interesting one: either that was accidental, in which case it shouldn\u2019t have been a foul, or it was a full elbow to the face, in which case it could well have been a red card. 10 mins: Just before that disallowed goal Getafe should probably have been given a penalty, after Vidal shoved an arm into the back of Folquier as they both went up for a header. Spicy couple of minutes for the ref. 9 mins: GOA...no! No goal! A cross loops over from the Getafe left and Mata sidefoots a nice volley home. But the referee blows his whistle, having perceived a shove by Rodriguez on Lenglet. But that looked like the Barca defender had more tripped over his own feet than was sent over by nefarious means. Soft, at best. 6 mins: Quick chance for Getafe - well, half-chance really, as Rodriguez finds a yard of space in the box and snatches a half-volley over the bar. 5 mins: Dembele turns on those rockets on his heels and speeds into the box, where he arrives in Djene\u2019s general orbit and goes down. No penalty given, and the forward is encouraged to get to his feet. 3 mins: Not much of note in the early minutes. Jordi Alba aimed a long pass towards Suarez, but it was headed clear. Getafe have barely touched the ball. 1 min: And we\u2019re off. A few players are wearing red boots with their salmon kits and it\u2019s clashing. Tut tut. The teams are out, Barcelona in their...well, I\u2019m going to call it \u2018salmon\u2019 away kit. This is a good read from Ed Aarons, whose byline picture is now out of date because he\u2019s grown a thick, lovely beard. Pictures! Gertcha pictures! A dozen of them, in \u2018The Dozen\u2019, from the weekend of football just gone. And now Madrid are 2-0 down! What japes! So with a victory in this one Barca will be ten points ahead of their old foes, them rapidly fading into insignificance. Meanwhile...are you sure about this Andres? No Busquets for Barcelona and, for those English-based transfer-heads out there, no Denis Suarez in the squad either. Arsenal, for reasons not entirely clear, are apparently looking to spend some of their limited transfer budget on another midfielder. Getafe Soria; Damian, Djene, Cabrera, Antunes; Folquier, Arambarri, Maksimovic, Mata; Angel, Portillo. Subs: Chichizola, Bruno, Saiz, Flamini, Cristoforo, Ibanez, Molina. Barcelona Ter Stegen; Sergi Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Jordi Alba; Vidal, Arthur, Rakitic; Suarez, Messi, Dembele. Subs: Cillessen, Murillo, Coutinho, Malcom, Semedo, Busquets, Alena. And to add to Barca\u2019s hilarity, Real Madrid are currently losing to Real Sociedad, with 26 minutes remaining. Welcome back to Barcelona. The Spanish league has bought you a gift: it\u2019s second-place Atletico Madrid dropping points! Just what you always wanted? Diego Simeone\u2019s side drew 1-1 against Sevilla earlier on, meaning should Barca win this one they will go a breezy five points clear at the top of the table, and with a pretty friendly set of fixtures coming up, you\u2019d rather expect them to extend that lead too. And yet Ernesto Valverde still might not be there next season. \u201cI have a contract with the club which was two years plus an option and at the end of the season we have to decide whether I continue or not,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe will postpone that decision for further down the line, depending on how the season goes.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s got somewhere better to be. Still, Getafe are - as they say - no chumps. They\u2019re flirting with the fringes of the European places and have only lost once in the last 11 games, have a solid, settled team and have only conceded four goals at home all season. So this might be a live one. Stick around, let\u2019s enjoy ourselves of a Sunday evening. Kick-off: 19.45 GMT",

Malaysia\u2019s King Sultan Muhammad V has stepped down, ending weeks of speculation and following rumours he married a former Miss Moscow in Russia. Sultan Muhammad V\u2019s decision marks the first time a king has abdicated in the Muslim-majority country since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.

Saudi courts will notify women by text message when they get divorced, in a new regulation that took effect on Sunday. The measure approved by the justice ministry appears to be aimed at curbing cases of men secretly ending marriages without informing their wives. Czech MPs will vote on a radical new bankruptcy law this month in response to the country\u2019s growing personal debt crisis.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump said on Sunday the US military has killed Jamal al-Badawi, an al-Qaida militant wanted in connection with the attack on the USS Cole. Seventeen US sailors died and at least 40 people were wounded in the October 2000 attack, in which suicide bombers almost sank the guided missile destroyer while it lay in Aden harbour. The attack on the USS Cole foreshadowed the attacks of 11 September 2001, in which 2,977 people were killed in New York City, Washington DC and Pennsylvania. Badawi was indicted in 2003 and charged with terrorism offences including the murder of US nationals and military personnel. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006. There was a $5m reward for information leading to his arrest. It was reported on Friday that US defence officials were trying to confirm reports an airstrike on 1 January had killed Badawi. On Sunday, via Twitter, the president confirmed it. \u201cOur GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole,\u201d the president wrote, while en route from the White House to Camp David. \u201cWe have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against [al-Qaida] continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!\u201d Two hours later, US Central Command issued a tweet of its own, saying it had \u201cconfirmed that Jamal al-Badawi was killed in a precision strike in Marib governate [on 1 January]. Jamal al-Badawi was an [al-Qaida] operative involved in the USS Cole bombing. US forces confirmed the results of the strike following a deliberate assessment process.\u201d The news came amid further turmoil in the US defense establishment, which in the past month has digested the resignations of defense secretary Jim Mattis and envoy Brett McGurk over Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to declare the fight against Islamic State militants won and to order the withdrawal of troops from Syria. National security adviser John Bolton seemed to be walking back that order in a visit this weekend to Israel and Turkey, but at home in Washington another key Pentagon figure, chief of staff Kevin Sweeney, announced his resignation. In a short statement on Saturday night, the retired Rear Admiral said: \u201cAfter two years in the Pentagon, I\u2019ve decided the time is right to return to the private sector.

The health service will make it easier for patients offered screening appointments to attend by extending the use of new tests for bowel cancer, mobile lung cancer screening units and rapid diagnostic centres that yield a result on the same day. The age at which people are offered bowel cancer screening will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/10/bowel-cancer-screening-age-england-lowered-50\">be lowered from 60 to 50</a>.</p> <p>All this is aimed at increasing the number of people diagnosed with cancer when it is at stage one or two, as that makes it easier to treat and means they have a greater chance of survival. Currently, 52% of the 10 commonest cancers are diagnosed at stages one and two. Ministers want this to be 75% by 2028.</p> <h2>Mental health</h2> <p>Mental health services \u2013 a key personal priority for Theresa May \u2013 are set to undergo the biggest overhaul of any area of NHS care, which ministers say is \u201cthe largest expansion of mental health services in a generation\u201d. About 2 million more people who suffer from a mental health condition such as anxiety or depression will benefit from at least \u00a32.3bn of extra funding being invested in the sector by 2023-24. An estimated 350,000 more children and young people will be treated, and an extra 380,000 more adults offered access to talking therapies, over the next five years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/06/simon-stevens-told-to-transform-the-nhs-and-keep-it-out-of-the-headlines\">Simon Stevens told to transform the NHS \u2013 and keep it out of the headlines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New support teams in schools will help identify mental health problems earlier and support those in need.

This major expansion of primary care and community services is central to reducing the burden on hospitals, which are struggling to cope with the rising demand for care created by the ageing and growing population. New \u201c24/7 rapid response teams\u201d made up of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists will give patients urgent care and support in the community as an alternative to hospital.</p> <h2>Alcohol abuse</h2> <p>The NHS will be making much greater efforts to persuade heavy drinkers who end up in hospital to reduce their alcohol intake. It plans to set up alcohol care teams in the 50 hospitals that have the largest number of people who need to be admitted for treatment as a result of drink, in advice sessions lasting 20-40 minutes. Nurses and doctors will adopt a more interventionist approach and will talk to problem drinkers about their habit and how to cut down.</p> <p>People will receive personalised feedback about how risky their drinking is and advice about how to drink less. Hospitals which already have such a team have found they significantly reduce the number of attendances at A&amp;E, days heavy drinkers spend in a bed, readmissions and ambulance callouts. The NHS hopes rolling out these teams will prevent 50,000 hospital admissions involving 250,000 bed days over the next five years, as alcohol costs it \u00a33.7bn a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f50df4d11f10cfae3b8e5cb5833e6da47196b69a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50df4d11f10cfae3b8e5cb5833e6da47196b69a/0_154_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cigarette being stubbed out\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All smokers who become NHS inpatients will be encouraged to quit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Smoking</h2> <p>In future, NHS staff will encourage all smokers who become a hospital inpatient, or a patient in a mental health or learning disabilities unit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/05/smokers-admitted-hospital-offered-help-to-quit-nhs-england\">to quit</a>. As with heavy drinkers, nurses and doctors will automatically talk to them about their smoking and suggest they try to kick the habit with the help of stop-smoking services. The initiative will particularly target mothers-to-be who are still smoking despite their pregnancy, and also encourage their partners to give up, in the hope of making it easier for the women to do the same. NHS bosses hope the move will further reduce smoking rates and say they are hopeful of success because most smokers, when asked, want to stop.</p> <h2>Childbirth</h2> <p>Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, has promised that by March 2021 the majority of women in England will have one named midwife to guide and support them through their pregnancy, labour and after their baby has been born.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the match report from Stuart James. And with that I\u2019ll leave you \u2013 what a game, and cup shock, that was. Thank you for enjoying it with us! Mike Flynn speaks: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the players, what they\u2019ve done, they were excellent on and off the ball, we created quite a few chances and I\u2019m very proud of them. We didn\u2019t have any beers in the dressing room so we had to make do with water.\u201d Thank goodness Leicester can now focus on finishing ... seventh eh? This is Newport\u2019s day though. Here\u2019s Matt: \u201cA little bit surreal at the moment, it\u2019s not really sunk in. We all fight for each other and [Amond] has come up with the winner. I thought we had a few chances in the first half to go 2-0 up but in the first half we knew we had to keep calm. We expected them to come out but defended brilliantly, all the boys put in a shift and I\u2019m absolutely buzzing.\u201d And Amond: \u201cObviously it\u2019s brilliant to score the winner but it\u2019s a big one, we deserved it. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a few celebrations.\u201d As for Leicester, perhaps Puel will wish he\u2019d played Maddison from the start and perhaps Gray, too. Maybe even Vardy. But this was a side that, as I said at the top of the show, should have had enough to win. They didn\u2019t do enough and Puel might find there are further question marks over his position now. Oh, my! What a result. And what a well deserved one. Newport really had to dig in during that second half and there was a touch of inevitability behind Ghezzal\u2019s equaliser. It seemed only one team could go on and win \u2013 but it was the League Two side, mustering the wherewithal to go again, earn themselves a penalty and convert it through the ice-cool Amond. What a bold, courageous, gutsy performance from Mike Flynn\u2019s inspirational side. They have done it!!! It\u2019s surely the shock of the round! 90+4 min: And they only just do, Maddison curling barely a metre wide from 20 yards! Is that it now? 93 min: Choudhury tees up King in the kind of 16-yard zone he used to score quite a lot of goals from ... but he puts it straight into Day\u2019s clutches! Newport have one minute to survive! 90+2 min: Amond releases Semenyo on the left. He goes for the shot rather than the corner flag and it\u2019s deflected narrowly wide of the diving Ward\u2019s post! Newport have exactly what they want now \u2013 a corner \u2013 but don\u2019t get to play keepball for that long and Leicester win a throw. 90+1 min: Newport have four added minutes to see this through. The tension in there, the anticipation and excitement, is something else. 90 min: This is absolutely gripping. Franks concedes a corner with Iheanacho breathing down his neck. It\u2019s delivered well beyond the back post, though, and Pipe whacks it upfield for Leicester to retrieve and come again. 88 min: Albrighton has a serious error to atone for and swings a decent cross up towards Iheanacho, but Pipe does really well to put him off the header. 87 min: What drama. What a game. Newport kept on going, tried to go forward anew even after what seemed a crushing equaliser. And they earned their shot at a winner! O\u2019Brien now comes on for Dolan to help them see this out. He rolls it into the corner, sending Ward the wrong way! They looked out on their feet \u2013 but they\u2019re on the verge of doing this! Incredible! Neufville crosses from the left, it strikes Albrighton on the outstretched arm and that is a spot kick all day! They have a chance to win it. It\u2019s Amond ... It\u2019s happened in the 82nd minute again, unfortunately. Day makes a sensational point-blank save from Maddison and Newport seem to have survived. But Franks, lying prone, can only half-scoop the ball away to the edge of the area and Ghezzal meets it first time, absolutely *thundering* the ball into the top corner. Heartbreak for Newport and now they need to make sure they don\u2019t lose. 80 min: Willmott, absolutely tireless, slide-tackles against Ghezzal now and wins a goal kick to wild cheers. 79 min: Morgan knocks down a Maddison corner and Willmott blocks Ghezzal\u2019s volley. Some of this has been real bodies-on-the-line stuff. Then Demetriou puts Maddison off enough to prevent him making contact with a raking ball upfield. 77 min: Kane equalised in the 82nd minute last year. It was a bit gutting at that moment for Newport, but by the end they were roared off the pitch. They are entering the period now where an equaliser would seem genuinely upsetting. Semenyo, brilliant here, thunders in to dispossess Albrighton on the near byline before he is joined by another Bristol City loanee, Tareeq Bakinson, who finally does replace Matt. 75 min: Respite comes for Newport in the form of a long throw from Demetriou. There\u2019s a bit of head-tennis around the Leicester box and then a clearance, but they\u2019re enjoying getting up the pitch a bit. 74 min: Matt appeared to be coming off but, apparently, mouthed \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m coming off\u201d at Flynn and, indeed, he isn\u2019t. 72 min: Matt is down getting treatment. He has been excellent up there, holding the ball up so well and of course showing that vital cutting edge too. Andy King now replaces James for his first Leicester appearance in a year! 70 min: Some desperate defending now \u2013 Franks heroically blocks a Maddison effort from 12 yards and fist-pumps after doing so. This is going to be one heck of a hairy last 20. 69 min: Now Albrighton takes aim again but it\u2019s not as close as his last one, skidding wide. 68 min: Pipe\u2019s first involvement is to leather a clearance away and you\u2019d fancy a few more of those will be required. Leicester keep up the pressure and Wes Morgan, briefly cameoing as a winger, earns a corner. Matt volleys Maddison\u2019s delivery upfield. 67 min: Newport freshen things up by bringing the experienced David Pipe on for right-back Forbes, who has done well out there. 65 min: Leicester might be well on top now, with Newport looking increasingly flustered whenever they get a rare hold of the ball, but the fact is they still haven\u2019t scored \u2013 and they don\u2019t have Harry Kane like Tottenham did last year. They don\u2019t have Jamie Vardy either. So don\u2019t hang your hat on them finding a leveller. 62 min: Demetriou gets away with one! He completely miscues from a diagonal Albrighton ball and tees it up for Iheanacho \u2013 who has to spin sharply but should hit the target. Instead he screws wide! 61 min: \u201cAs a Leicester fan, I feel obliged to point out that this scoreline is by no means a shock to me. That is all,\u201d writes Rai Skrupskis. It\u2019s probably not surprising to long-serving fans who remember the old days but the current side should be better than this. 59 min: Yes, Leicester are dominant now and starting to look like producing something, although Albrighton is beaten by the pitch and slices a cross over after encountering a bobble. They are going to make a very attacking change now, Simpson replaced by Gray. 57 min: Maddison is starting to get Leicester playing a bit. Newport need to get out a little more; Leicester\u2019s pressure was always going to ramp up but they don\u2019t want to be totally encamped in their own half for 35 minutes or so. 54 min: Leicester\u2019s best effort yet \u2013 Albrighton hits the bar! They\u2019ve upped the tempo here and, coming in from the left, he dips a wonderfully-struck effort onto the frame and out! 52 min: Now that was more meaningful from Iheanacho, getting up well to force a save from the solid-looking Day with a combination of head and shoulder. 51 min: And they almost get a chance on the break as Matt can\u2019t quite find Amond in absolutely acres of space, two Leicester defenders dashing back to cover. Iheanacho *gets a touch of the ball* shortly afterwards, winning a header, but his glance runs through to Day. Then it\u2019s back to the other end again and Amond tries a spectacular overhead kick that flies wide! 50 min: Leicester haven\u2019t had the chance to build up any pressure in a stop-start beginning to the half. All good for Newport so far. 47 min: Choudhury and James in midfield have made too many \u201csafe\u201d passes for Leicester here. Maddison should at least provide a good, purposeful option dropping in for them. Newport kick us back off. Leicester substitution: James Maddison is on for Okazaki and you can colour me not very surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that in these cynical times that we still have the occasional magic of the FA Cup,\u201d writes Speakeasy Ray. Second half coming right up. Leicester are going to have to improve a *lot*. They can\u2019t say they were not warned by Spurs\u2019 experience of last season. If I am then I\u2019m wasting a huge opportunity to be able to afford to eat this month. The half ends with an Okazaki booking. This has been everything you\u2019d want from an FA Cup tie, unless you\u2019re a Leicester fan. Newport deserve their lead. The Premier League side have had a couple of good chances but the hosts, roared on by a raucous home crowd, have not exactly sat back since scoring and had several more dangerous moments themselves. A big shock is most definitely on here \u2013 stay with us! 44 min: Newport are just a touch deeper than they had been, now, with the half coming to a close. They\u2019ll want to avoid any errors in the next couple of minutes and Willmott swipes a diagonal ball behind for a Leicester corner. They\u2019ve looked a threat from these but Morgan, swinging a boot at it, can\u2019t make contact. 42 min: Incidentally, I promise you that Kelechi Iheanacho is playing. I\u2019m just genuinely not certain he\u2019s touched the ball yet. 40 min: An escape for Newport there! Fuchs overlaps on the left, crosses and Okazaki is on hand to play a sidefoot volley ... into the flailing form of Franks, who gets in the way before the diving Day! 38 min: FucHs goes for a long throw of his own. It feels like a compliment from Leicester to fight fire with fire but it earns a corner, which Albrighton flicks wide of the near post. 36 min: Semenyo looks a really good young player and shows great feet to start a Newport move out on the far touchline. They genuinely look more likely to score a second, just now, than Leicester do to equalise. 33 min: Another Demetriou long throw is cleared, but only as far as Dolan. His daisycutter is fumbled by the perhaps unsighted Ward; Semenyo looks to pounce on the rebound but is offside. Newport are giving more than they\u2019re getting at the moment. 31 min: Albrighton fires one down the throat of Day, whose protection has been better in the last 10 minutes. 30 min: Close to a second! Amond chases a ball down the left and *just* hooks it back from the byline. Matt is running in and his first touch is brilliant, but he just runs out of space and Ward can gather at his feet. 29 min: Matt and Semenyo are absolute menaces, the latter eventually pulled up for some relentless hassling of Albrighton. Fair Fuchs, that\u2019s funny. 26 min: More sterling work from Willmott, who is simply going for the line in the old-fashioned style whenever he wins possession, gains Newport another corner. Dolan aims it to the back stick and Ward punches it away, a bit unconvincingly but sufficiently, with Matt lurking. 25 min: A long Newport throw in comes in from Demetriou and Matt is up above the defenders to win it again ... but can\u2019t get any direction on his flick. 23 min: Ghezzal is felled close to the edge of the box and this is a fine opportunity for Leicester to get another shot in. Ghezzal shrugs Albrighton and Fuchs aside, this one\u2019s his ... but he floats it a couple of yards over and draws distinctly withering glares from his team-mates. Puel looks similarly annoyed. 22 min: Newport look absolutely set on going for a second goal. And Leicester are certainly creating opportunities. It\u2019s an excellent cup tie at the moment. 19 min: This is a great game. Semenyo has a go for Newport and it\u2019s deflected wide, so now they have a corner of their own. Willmott plays a low one in to Amond at the near post and he lays back to the onrushing Dolan. It\u2019s a sweet routine and Dolan, cracking one from 20 yards, forces Ward to save with his legs! 18 min: Albrighton should score! Fuchs takes advantage of some iffy defending to get to the line and pulls back for the winger, who seems certain to bury it ... but two defenders throw themselves in and his effort glances off one of them and over! From the corner, Okazaki heads across and Choudhury can\u2019t get a clean connection when, once again, the goal is begging. 17 min: What if ... what if Newport could score a second? That\u2019s what everyone is wondering when Simpson fouls the awkward Semenyo 25 yards out ... and they come close, Dolan curling up and around the wall, drawing a decent save by Ward, who manages to keep hold of the ball too. 16 min: Encouragingly for Newport, they haven\u2019t given Leicester a sniff since Matt scored. Lots of managers, in these situations, like to take a game in 10-minute stages. Hitting the 20-minute mark in front would be a big plus. 13 min: Morgan won\u2019t want to see that again. He was absolutely murdered for the goal by Matt, a journeyman lower-league striker. Credit to Willmott\u2019s excellent delivery, though. 12 min: The shock is on! Now the next little spell of 10 or 15 minutes is crucial for Newport. Here we go! Willmott receives possession just inside the Leicester half and, for the second time in the game, makes ground down that right flank. He takes it to the edge of the Leicester box and then whips in a delicious ball for Matt, who outjumps Wes Morgan and plants a header in off the post! 9 min: But they allow Ghezzal to carry the ball inside here and lift a 20-yarder into Day\u2019s arms. Leicester will feel encouraged by the spaces they\u2019ve found early on. Oh \u2013 hang on ... 9 min: Last season Newport absolutely rampaged around Spurs in midfield, with a tireless harrying effort led by Joss Labadie. He\u2019s not playing today but they still seem to have plenty of energy here. 6 min: Another save from Day, grabbing a low, fizzing one from Okazaki after a decent lay-off from Ghezzal. Newport won\u2019t want to be allowing shots on target with this regularity. 5 min: Willmott, who from memory caused Spurs issues with his long throws last season, has a good run down the right and sees a low shot blocked. Leicester have had that decent early chance but the hosts look willing and able to play. 4 min: A big early save from Day! Newport defend unconvincingly and Ghezzal, at an angle on the right, looks for the far corner. The keeper deflects it around the near post, and Newport just about survive the subsequent flag kick. 2 min: A nice early turn by Semenyo earns applause and suggests Newport have a little flair on show. Apart from that it\u2019s been pinging from front to back, and then back again, in the first couple of minutes. Leicester kick off. They\u2019re in white and kicking right to left. The pitch is fairly low-lit and retains its rugby markings, as usual. It doesn\u2019t look comfortable for a Premier League side. Out come the teams \u2013 Rodney Parade is vibrant! And another shock here \u2013 Paul Doyle watched Oldham win 2-1 at Fulham! David Hytner was at Woking 0-2 Watford \u2013 and you can see what he thought here: Claude Puel: \u201cWe have an experienced team and I think we will need that for this game. The pitch, the opposition, the opponent ... we know it\u2019s the FA Cup and it will be difficult.\u201d Newport give a senior debut to 19-year-old left-back Vashon Neufville, who only joined on loan from West Ham two days ago. And they have an 18-year-old up front in the form of Bristol City loanee Antoine Semenyo. In last year\u2019s third round, of course, Newport beat Leeds here to set up that Spurs tie. Their very impressive manager, Mike Flynn, knows how to get his side going for these. Anything could happen this afternoon. There was no cup shock at the Etihad. Unless you\u2019re surprised that Man City put seven past Rotherham. Jamie Jackson was there to take it in his stride: We have a cup shock already today! Conference side Barnet have done the unthinkable and won at Championship promotion chasers Sheffield United! Even better, we had Ben Fisher there to bring you the report: That\u2019s seven changes for Leicester from the side that won at Everton but it\u2019s still a Team That Should Be Able To Win The Game. The likes of James Maddison and Demarai Gray are on the bench just in case, but Jamie Vardy gets a rest. Newport: Day, Forbes, Franks, Bennett, Demetriou, Willmott, Neufville, Dolan, Matt, Amond, Semenyo. Subs: Townsend, Pipe, Bakinson, Marsh-Brown, Sheehan, Foulston, O\u2019Brien. Leicester: Ward, Simpson, Morgan, Evans, Fuchs, Albrighton, Choudhury, James, Ghezzal, Okazaki, Iheanacho. Subs: Jakupovic, Soyuncu, Gray, Maddison, Ricardo, Mendy, King. This one brims with cup romance! Welcome to Newport, 13th in League Two, against Premier League, errrm, best-of-the-rest contenders Leicester and if you think it\u2019s a done deal at the outset then think on. Perhaps cast your mind back, instead, to last season\u2019s fourth round when only a late Harry Kane goal salvaged a draw for Tottenham at Rodney Parade. I was lucky enough to cover that one from the stadium and it was everything you\u2019d want from a cup game: rickety old stands, a sketchy pitch, a crackling January night and a raw, visceral atmosphere. There is something old-world about this venue and Leicester will feel it when they step out. Newport started the season well but have tailed off a little. Their last two home games were a 4-1 defeat to Forest Green and a goalless draw with Crawley. But all that goes out of the window now, it really does. In Padraig Amond they have a canny forward who scored their goal against Spurs last year \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t confidently say that a repeat is impossible and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing Newport try. Drop me a line with your thoughts, predictions, hopes and dreams. Maybe you were at that game last year? Kick-off is at 4.30pm UK time!",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is in no hurry to find permanent replacements for the quarter of his cabinet currently serving in an acting capacity, because, the president said on Sunday, the situation gives him \u201cmore flexibility\u201d. His words will do little to dampen rising concern about the lack of experienced counsel around a president who said on Sunday he might soon react to the government shutdown by declaring a national emergency, a move likely to lead to a collision with a Congress part-controlled by Democrats. \u201cI am in no hurry,\u201d Trump told reporters as he left for Camp David and meetings on the shutdown. About a quarter of the US government has been closed for more than two weeks and about 800,000 workers are without pay. \u201cI like acting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great cabinet.\u201d He did not elaborate on why acting officials give him more flexibility or say why that should be a good thing, but he spoke as critics continued to voice alarm over the departure of a succession of senior advisers who were seen as able to restrain his wilder impulses. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson, defense secretary Jim Mattis, national security adviser HR McMaster, attorney general Jeff Sessions and chief of staff John Kelly have all been forced out by Trump. United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley resigned. Mattis, Sessions, Haley and Kelly\u2019s replacements are all serving in an acting capacity. On Saturday night, the Pentagon chief of staff \u2013 not a cabinet post \u2013 announced his resignation. Obama-era UN ambassador Samantha Power responded by tweeting: \u201cIt is [5 January] 2019: we have no Secretary of Defense &amp; now no DoD chief of staff, no Attorney General &amp; no evident guardrails in Trump\u2019s inner circle. \u201cThe President is unhinged \u2013 even GOP zealots know it. Rs inside &amp; outside the admin must stop enabling Trump &amp; protect America.\u201d Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN on Sunday he agreed \u201cthat all of the adults are one by one being forced out of the room. Anyone who had the standing \u2026 to tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear, has been pushed aside.\u201d There are 24 cabinet-level positions and six are now filled by individuals serving in an acting capacity, after the departure of members confirmed by the Senate. Other than the White House chief of staff and the vice-president, cabinet-level officials require such confirmation. Federal law allows presidents to temporarily fill vacancies by appointing acting department heads who are already employees there. Trump said last month he was in no hurry to name a new defense secretary, after Mattis quit. On Friday he reacted to reports that he was considering the Vietnam veteran and former Democratic senator and presidential candidate Jim Webb by praising the acting secretary, Patrick Shanahan. \u201cThe story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is a fine man, but I don\u2019t know Jim, and never met him.

      "body": "<p>Life, as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years, has just changed forever. Quagmired in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/dec/11/donald-trump-government-shut-down-chuck-schumer-white-house-video\" title=\"\">government shutdown of his own making</a>, Trump\u2019s ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year. The more he struggles against his new surroundings, the more he sinks.</p> \n<p>Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts, as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/elizabeth-warren-2020-run-president-trump\" title=\"\">officially emerge to run against him next year</a>. And it won\u2019t be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/03/trump-mueller-investigation-manafort-cohen\" title=\"\">Mueller investigation</a> continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Outside Trump\u2019s wall of delusion and distractions, there is a host of strong women candidates poised to join Warren</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>So it may be early, but it\u2019s not too soon to survey who is best placed to eject Trump from the White House, if indeed the 45th president makes it that far.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s no coincidence that the first candidate to emerge against Trump \u2013 and enrage him \u2013 is a woman. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, represents at least two constituencies that have driven grassroots politics over the last decade.</p> \n<p>That is something Trump should recognise from his own campaign. Almost every US election since 2006 has been defined by a wave of voters seeking change, especially in the shape of a new candidate promising to reform a broken system.</p> \n<p>Nancy Pelosi swept to power as House speaker first in 2006 amid the disaster of President Bush\u2019s second term, and she returned this week to the same position promising adult supervision of an even more calamitous Republican. Each cycle in between \u2013 with the exception of Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012 \u2013 has seen the same dynamic of turfing out incumbents in the pursuit of hope and change.</p> \n<p>Warren has long given voice and academic heft to the argument that the root cause of the broken system is a broken economy, skewed by Wall Street and the super-wealthy. But on that basis, as with most other policies, she will find herself in a crowded space with most of the other Democrats who will join her in this contest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"97e9bc8b-b80d-4971-869b-2c00ffd299ae\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-18FvsoE-qY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The second factor propelling Warren\u2019s candidacy is the dramatic political turn in November\u2019s midterms: the sharp shift among women voters. Democrats held a 19-point advantage among women, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/07/why-did-democrats-win-house-one-word-women/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.71bb33e98a6e\" title=\"\">according to the exit polls</a>, six points higher than two years earlier. In particular, Democrats moved from a nine-point loss among white women to parity with Republicans as married women shifted allegiance.</p> \n<p>This is not a trend that Trump knows how to stop. In fact, his reaction to Warren\u2019s candidacy only underscores his limited grasp of the shifting political realities that kicked his own party out of power late last year. He told Fox News this week that \u201cyou\u2019d have to ask her psychiatrist\u201d to know if Warren believes she can win, and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/05/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa-campaign-native-american/index.html\" title=\"\">he continued to troll her on Twitter about her Native American family roots</a>.</p> \n<p>Outside Trump\u2019s wall of delusion and distractions, a host of strong women candidates is poised to join Warren. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/13/democratic-2020-hopefuls-progressive-conference-we-the-people\" title=\"\">Kirsten Gillibrand</a> of New York and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/02/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nomination-amy-klobuchar\" title=\"\">Amy Klobuchar</a> of Minnesota have often found themselves entirely misjudged by the men around them. Gillibrand was considered vulnerable in her first Senate election in 2010, but she trounced all comers in all of her contests. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/09/27/the-most-telling-moment-kavanaugh-goes-after-sen-klobuchar/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.0114f4f1663d\" title=\"\">Klobuchar</a> proved more than a match for the clumsy bullying of supreme court nominee \u2013 now Justice \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh last year.</p> \n<p>But one likely candidate particularly intrigues. Kamala Harris embodies the driving force pushing Democrats to record turnouts in non-presidential contests over the last two years: women of colour. The California senator has served just two years in Congress \u2013 like the last freshman senator to win the Democratic nomination, in 2008. But unlike Barack Obama, Harris has a very significant record of public service in her pre-Senate career, serving as her state\u2019s attorney general for six years and as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney for seven years.</p> \n<p>While all the Democratic candidates can appeal beyond their own demographics, personal perspectives can and do influence political character. There\u2019s no mystery about why Trump performs so well with older white men. And there should be no surprise that Harris \u2013 the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants \u2013 has already won the overwhelming support and respect of influential women of colour who will help shape the Democratic primaries.</p> \n<p>Harris, like the other candidates of colour, will face the same questions Obama did in 2008 about appealing to the white working-class voters across the rust-belt states that Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. However, working-class challenges are most acutely experienced by minorities, and each of the former industrial states that tipped the 2016 election \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/01/donald-trump-will-be-president-thanks-to-80000-people-in-three-states/?utm_term=.623fc8910713\" title=\"\">Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin</a> \u2013 have diverse electorates that shifted decisively against Trump last year.</p> \n<p>The test for Harris, and all the other Democrats, is whether she can effectively demonstrate that she is listening and responding to those voters in order to overcome the culture wars that Trump will happily wage. Obama succeeded in 2008 by showing he was the adult in the middle of a financial crisis. He succeeded again in 2012, by showing Mitt Romney was out of touch with economic reality. If anything, Trump fills both boxes even more snugly than his predecessors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/this-is-nancy-pelosi-moment-donald-trump-should-be-very-afraid\">This is the Nancy Pelosi moment and Donald Trump should be very afraid | Sarah Churchwell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Well before the general election, the candidates will need to navigate the primary and caucus voters, where Democrats \u2013 even in less diverse states like Iowa \u2013 tend to be more progressive and want more change, not less. There\u2019s no reason to think a candidate of colour cannot succeed there, where Obama did in 2008. The biggest difference this time around is that the largest state of all has moved forward its primary \u2013 with all its nominating delegates \u2013 to March, three months ahead of where it used to be. That state, California, is home to Kamala Harris.</p> \n<p>All the challengers will claim they can appeal to working-class and middle-class voters with more affordable healthcare and education, and a fairer economy.

      "bodyText": "Life, as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years, has just changed forever. Quagmired in a government shutdown of his own making, Trump\u2019s ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year. The more he struggles against his new surroundings, the more he sinks. Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts, as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to officially emerge to run against him next year. And it won\u2019t be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence, while the Mueller investigation continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian. So it may be early, but it\u2019s not too soon to survey who is best placed to eject Trump from the White House, if indeed the 45th president makes it that far. It\u2019s no coincidence that the first candidate to emerge against Trump \u2013 and enrage him \u2013 is a woman. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, represents at least two constituencies that have driven grassroots politics over the last decade. That is something Trump should recognise from his own campaign. Almost every US election since 2006 has been defined by a wave of voters seeking change, especially in the shape of a new candidate promising to reform a broken system. Nancy Pelosi swept to power as House speaker first in 2006 amid the disaster of President Bush\u2019s second term, and she returned this week to the same position promising adult supervision of an even more calamitous Republican. Each cycle in between \u2013 with the exception of Obama\u2019s reelection in 2012 \u2013 has seen the same dynamic of turfing out incumbents in the pursuit of hope and change. Warren has long given voice and academic heft to the argument that the root cause of the broken system is a broken economy, skewed by Wall Street and the super-wealthy. But on that basis, as with most other policies, she will find herself in a crowded space with most of the other Democrats who will join her in this contest. The second factor propelling Warren\u2019s candidacy is the dramatic political turn in November\u2019s midterms: the sharp shift among women voters. Democrats held a 19-point advantage among women, according to the exit polls, six points higher than two years earlier. In particular, Democrats moved from a nine-point loss among white women to parity with Republicans as married women shifted allegiance. This is not a trend that Trump knows how to stop. In fact, his reaction to Warren\u2019s candidacy only underscores his limited grasp of the shifting political realities that kicked his own party out of power late last year. He told Fox News this week that \u201cyou\u2019d have to ask her psychiatrist\u201d to know if Warren believes she can win, and he continued to troll her on Twitter about her Native American family roots. Outside Trump\u2019s wall of delusion and distractions, a host of strong women candidates is poised to join Warren. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have often found themselves entirely misjudged by the men around them. Gillibrand was considered vulnerable in her first Senate election in 2010, but she trounced all comers in all of her contests. Klobuchar proved more than a match for the clumsy bullying of supreme court nominee \u2013 now Justice \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh last year. But one likely candidate particularly intrigues. Kamala Harris embodies the driving force pushing Democrats to record turnouts in non-presidential contests over the last two years: women of colour. The California senator has served just two years in Congress \u2013 like the last freshman senator to win the Democratic nomination, in 2008. But unlike Barack Obama, Harris has a very significant record of public service in her pre-Senate career, serving as her state\u2019s attorney general for six years and as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney for seven years. While all the Democratic candidates can appeal beyond their own demographics, personal perspectives can and do influence political character. There\u2019s no mystery about why Trump performs so well with older white men. And there should be no surprise that Harris \u2013 the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants \u2013 has already won the overwhelming support and respect of influential women of colour who will help shape the Democratic primaries. Harris, like the other candidates of colour, will face the same questions Obama did in 2008 about appealing to the white working-class voters across the rust-belt states that Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. However, working-class challenges are most acutely experienced by minorities, and each of the former industrial states that tipped the 2016 election \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2013 have diverse electorates that shifted decisively against Trump last year. The test for Harris, and all the other Democrats, is whether she can effectively demonstrate that she is listening and responding to those voters in order to overcome the culture wars that Trump will happily wage. Obama succeeded in 2008 by showing he was the adult in the middle of a financial crisis. He succeeded again in 2012, by showing Mitt Romney was out of touch with economic reality. If anything, Trump fills both boxes even more snugly than his predecessors. Well before the general election, the candidates will need to navigate the primary and caucus voters, where Democrats \u2013 even in less diverse states like Iowa \u2013 tend to be more progressive and want more change, not less. There\u2019s no reason to think a candidate of colour cannot succeed there, where Obama did in 2008. The biggest difference this time around is that the largest state of all has moved forward its primary \u2013 with all its nominating delegates \u2013 to March, three months ahead of where it used to be. That state, California, is home to Kamala Harris. All the challengers will claim they can appeal to working-class and middle-class voters with more affordable healthcare and education, and a fairer economy. The key primary test for all candidates will be who can best take the fight to Trump while still talking to voters beyond the reach of his tweets. In politics they say you should never wrestle with a pig, but the desire to stay clean did little for Trump\u2019s opponents in 2016. Voters expect their candidates to stand up for themselves while still talking about what matters in their lives. The test for the female (and male) candidates of 2020 is how to sling mud without getting stuck in it. \u2022 Richard Wolffe is a columnist for the Guardian US",

      "bodyText": "Like Britain\u2019s schoolchildren, many of whom will be returning to their classrooms after the Christmas break, MPs will spend Monday reacquainting themselves with their friends and reluctantly returning their attention to work. The task ahead of them is formidable \u2013 with Britain due to leave the European Union in less than 12 weeks\u2019 time, parliament has neither approved an exit deal, nor put in place the necessary legislation to ensure a smooth departure. Theresa May is hoping MPs have spent the fortnight\u2019s break considering their duty to honour the result of the 2016 referendum, even if they don\u2019t love every detail of her deal. How will Theresa May be kicking off the new parliamentary term? She\u2019ll be away from Westminster, making a speech to launch the government\u2019s 10-year plan for the NHS, which will underpin the \u00a320bn-a-year increase in funding announced last summer. The plan was delayed before Christmas, and some in government believe it is still not ready to see the light of day, but the prime minister is keen to highlight \u2013 both to the public and her own MPs \u2013 that she has other priorities to get on with, if they will just let her get Brexit out of the way. When do MPs get back to talking about Brexit? The House of Commons is due to begin debating the prime minister\u2019s deal on Wednesday. No date has yet been set for the meaningful vote, but May has indicated it will be Tuesday 15 or Wednesday 16 January. MPs will have to pass a motion before the debate begins, setting out how many days of discussion will be held. There has been speculation of a fresh delay before the vote, as May seeks reassurances from the EU27 \u2013 in particular about the Irish backstop. But time is already extremely tight to pass the legislation implementing the withdrawal bill, and to make other necessary changes. Delaying again would be an even more desperate measure than last month\u2019s postponement. Has anything changed? May told Andrew Marr on Sunday that MPs could expect reassurances in the next few days in three areas: on Northern Ireland; on the role of parliament in future negotiations; and from the EU27 member states. Downing Street is vehemently hoping to win over the 10 MPs of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), as May promised she would try to do when she appealed to Tory colleagues to back her in the no-confidence vote last month. But the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson appeared implacable, in remarks made this week. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the government\u2019s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU,\u201d he said. The DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the backstop provision remained the \u201cpoison\u201d affecting any vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. \u201cTheresa May still insists that what she has negotiated is a good deal. She should remember that it would already have been consigned to the bin but for her pulling the vote in December.\u201d Germany and Ireland have been consulting closely in recent days on a joint plan to offer the prime minister a helping hand, including by extending the non-legally binding political declaration to include promises that the Irish backstop will never need to be used. Jean-Claude Juncker has also been closely involved in seeking a compromise, speaking directly to May. However, Brexit-watchers report a reluctance to offer significant concessions before the deal has been voted down. \u201cThere is a desire in Brussels to leave the final concessions until the very last minute, so it is too late for Eurosceptics to demand more,\u201d says Mujtaba Rahman, of the consultancy Eurasia Group. What happens if the vote is lost? That depends partly on the margin of defeat. If it is less than, say, 100, the government may hope it can have one last go at winning something extra from the EU27, and then come back to the Commons for another roll of the dice. Parliamentary convention would make that difficult, as it suggests a government cannot simply table the same motion repeatedly in the hope of winning it; but substantive enough concessions might allow May to argue she is asking MPs to consider a different proposition. Labour is likely to table a vote of no confidence in the government, though it is unclear whether it would do so immediately \u2013 and even less unclear whether it could win it. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour\u2019s approach would then be to try to force May to pursue a different approach to Brexit \u2013 in particular a permanent customs union. Pressure on May from inside the cabinet would also intensify \u2013 though her ministers are themselves divided, with Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom advocating a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d, at one end of the spectrum, and Amber Rudd, at the other, willing to countenance a second referendum in the face of deadlock at Westminster. Downing Street still hopes to convince MPs \u2013 perhaps at second time of asking \u2013 that they face a choice between her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit. And if they can win over the DUP, they hope less hardline Tory Leavers will follow; Labour MPs in Leave-leaning seats might swing behind her too, if the only other option appears to be no deal, or ditching Brexit altogether. What if she loses again? A crushing defeat next week, or a second loss later in the month (as the stopwatch runs down towards 29 March) would amount to a major political crisis, with the government simply unable to get its deal ratified. What would happen next is anyone\u2019s guess. May could herself decide to pull the emergency cord and call for a referendum, or a general election \u2013 though both would require extending article 50, which in turn demands the agreement of the EU27. The prime minister could try to test the will of MPs for alternative options, through a series of so-called indicative votes \u2013 though there is scant enthusiasm for that idea in No 10. She could even tack towards centrist Tories and the Labour frontbench, by shifting towards a permanent customs union. The House of Lords will consider the trade bill on 21 and 23 January, which crossbench peers hope to use as another opportunity to force the issue. With time running out, May could even face a mass cabinet walkout, aimed at persuading her to step aside and let a successor take on the unenviable challenge of ramming Brexit through a hung parliament. And meanwhile, MPs advocating alternative approaches \u2013 whether Labour\u2019s own closer, Norway-style relationship or a second referendum \u2013 will seize the opportunity to ramp up the pressure, using every parliamentary tactic they can think of. As the prime minister herself said, if the deal is rejected, \u201cwe are going to be in uncharted territory\u201d, but there is little evidence as yet that the Christmas break has shifted the dynamic in Downing Street\u2019s favour. As one sardonic Whitehall source put it on Sunday, \u201cit\u2019s almost as if changing nothing and telling MPs to go and have a think isn\u2019t a strategy\u201d.",

We need a statesmanlike leader who can not only see that leaving the EU will disadvantage Britain, but will act to reinvigorate Britain\u2019s capabilities. Much needs to change to redress the balance of unrestrained capitalism that has seen a huge increase in disparity in earnings.

The African Union and Southern African Development Community are on the ground but have yet to make strong statements; the latter called the election \u201cwell managed and smooth\u201d.</p> <p>The eastern cities of Beni and Butembo were not allowed to vote in the election \u2013 their \u201cpoll\u201d will take place in March, after the announcement of the winner, thus disenfranchising more than a million voters.

The church had previously claimed that there was a clear winner of the election and called on Ceni to release the \u201ctrue\u201d results, signalling \u2013 though not saying outright \u2013 that Shadary had lost. Polling just before the election indicated that the opposition candidate Martin Fayulu was in the lead by a wide margin. A government spokesman, Lambert Mende, said the church could go to the courts if it was not satisfied with the results released by the electoral commission. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the Vatican here, we\u2019re in the Congo, and there\u2019s a law that determines how things are done,\u201d he said. On Friday, Kabila met the church\u2019s secretary general, Donatien Nshole, and a delegation of priests. According to Nshole, Kabila said he wanted to \u201cleave the country united and peaceful\u201d. A host of irregularities and the suppression of voting rights were detailed in a Human Rights Watch report published on Saturday. The group pointed out that many polling stations across Kinshasa had abruptly closed, preventing people from voting, while others had opened late, and voters had had trouble using new electronic machines, thousands of which were burned shortly before the election in an alleged arson attack. The government has not denied that it has effected an internet shutdown. Observers were also blocked from many polling stations and armed men coerced people in North Kivu province to vote for Shadary, HRW said. Ida Sawyer, the deputy director of HRW\u2019s Africa division, called on South Africa to exert serious diplomatic pressure on the DRC leadership \u201cto ensure real election results are published\u201d. The African Union and Southern African Development Community are on the ground but have yet to make strong statements; the latter called the election \u201cwell managed and smooth\u201d. The eastern cities of Beni and Butembo were not allowed to vote in the election \u2013 their \u201cpoll\u201d will take place in March, after the announcement of the winner, thus disenfranchising more than a million voters. At least 43 people were arrested in demonstrations in Beni in the past week, according to the UN radio station Radio Okapi. According to African Confidential, among the thousands of troops newly deployed to Kinshasa\u2019s streets are many former members of the Rwanda-backed M23, a rebel group accused of committing many war crimes including rape, execution and recruiting child soldiers. Rwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame is said to support Kabila\u2019s choice of Shadary because he believes it the best way to control the conflict on the countries\u2019 shared border.",

      "bodyText": "Portraying getting older in a positive light and raising expectations as to what people can achieve has to be welcomed (12 steps to a happy later life, G2, 3 January). However, giving examples of people who have done amazing things needs to be balanced by the possibility that for many people, who have led hectic lives, that to learn to relax and not have to achieve anything, if you don\u2019t want to, is equally valid. For women who have had to balance child-rearing, careers and generally putting the needs of others before their own, one of the most important lessons is that it is OK to do what you want and not feel guilty. If you fancy sitting down and reading a book for a few hours, that\u2019s fine. It is also important to accept that the ageing process affects individuals in different ways and what one person can do others cannot and that does not reflect negatively on those who can do less. Dr Hilary Hodge (aged 73) Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire \u2022 I sat down to read G2 and nearly choked on my cuppa. The first step to a happy later life is apparently not to acknowledge that you are old. This is simply to reinforce ageism, like telling gay people they will be happier if they don\u2019t acknowledge they are gay. I am glad to be old, thanks to luck, the NHS and welfare state, my family and friends and my genes. Let\u2019s reclaim old age as something to be proud of and grateful for, not be ashamed of.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Jr and long-term Trump aide Roger Stone face a heightened threat of criminal charges as Democrats on Capitol Hill prepare to hand evidence to Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. They could be charged with perjury if there is evidence that they lied to Congress during interviews behind closed doors with the House intelligence committee. The California Democrat Adam Schiff will take over leadership of the committee now that his party has control of the House, following victory in the midterm elections. Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Schiff made clear he would be handing over transcripts which had been withheld from Mueller\u2019s investigation by Republicans when they controlled the panel. The committee staged 73 interviews with dozens of witnesses, including Jared Kushner, Trump Jr and Stone. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, has already pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to Congress over attempts to make a deal to construct a Trump Tower in Moscow. Schiff said he was \u201ctrying to deconflict\u201d with special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation because over the last two years the committee, under Republican leadership, had actively tried to make the special counsel\u2019s work more difficult. Schiff said he planned \u201cas one of our first acts to make the transcripts of our witnesses fully available to special counsel for any purpose, including the bringing of perjury charges\u201d. Trump Jr is in peril because he orchestrated the now infamous Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russians after being promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. He would face problems if he told Congress that his father was unaware of the meeting but Mueller has obtained evidence to contradict that. Stone has been under scrutiny over whether he joined the Russian conspiracy to hack Democratic party emails and whether he had prior knowledge of their publication by WikiLeaks. Kushner, Trump\u2019s son in law and senior adviser, has faced questions over his contacts with Russian officials during the transition period between the November 2016 election and the start of the Trump administration in January 2017. Mueller\u2019s investigation has had access to emails and other records which can be used to test whether witnesses were honest in their evidence to Congress. Schiff did not name any individuals, but said: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to protect these witnesses. There\u2019s every reason to validate Congress\u2019s interest in not having people come before it and lie. \u201cI think people felt that they had some kind of immunity when the GOP majority at the time because they would often intervene and tell witnesses: \u2018You don\u2019t have to answer that question.\u2019\u201d Schiff also underlined that his committee will start to investigate the Trump Organization and any possible connections to Russian money. He said last month he wanted to investigate finances of the Trump Organization, naming Deutsche Bank, which has a history of laundering Russian money and which for a time was the only lender willing to do business with Trump. On Sunday, Schiff said his committee had gone to work seeking records from private institutions. Trump has consistently claimed the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign is a hoax and a witch-hunt. On Friday, it was confirmed that judge Beryl Howell, chief judge of US district court in Washington DC, had granted a six-month extension to the grand jury which has been reviewing evidence and recommending or rejecting charges in connection with the Mueller investigation. Under federal rules, a grand jury can serve no longer than 18 months unless the chief judge extends its service by a period of six months or less, \u201cupon determination that such extension is in the public interest\u201d. So far, 33 people and three Russian organisations have been charged, convicted or have pleaded guilty in connection with Mueller\u2019s investigation. Schiff said it was premature to talk about the possible impeachment of Trump, saying \u201cwe need to see what Bob Mueller has to say\u201d. He said impeachment was a theoretical possibility, but could only go ahead if it was a bipartisan process with Senate Republicans in support.",

Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said Labour could campaign on a promise to negotiate a better Brexit deal than that secured by Theresa May, and said he personally believed that any such deal could then be put to the public. Labour\u2019s official policy is to push for a general election if the prime minister fails to get her Brexit deal through parliament, but that all other options remain on the table. Jeremy Corbyn is facing demands from MPs \u2013 including several shadow cabinet members \u2013 to throw his weight behind a referendum if Labour cannot force an early election. Pressure has intensified after a major opinion poll commissioned by the People\u2019s Vote campaign indicated Labour could suffer a backlash from voters if it failed to oppose Brexit in parliament. The YouGov poll of more than 25,000 people indicated a second referendum is backed by 75% of Labour voters. Gardiner, interviewed on Sky News, said the quickest way of getting a people\u2019s vote was to have a general election, because legislating for a referendum would take far longer. At an election, Labour \u201cwould set out what we would seek to negotiate in Europe to try and deliver,\u201d, he told presenter Sophy Ridge. Gardiner said May had botched her EU negotiations because of her red lines. \u201cIf we as a new, incoming Labour government were to go to Europe without those red lines we know that we could get a different, better deal. \u201cAt that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, \u2018here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate, this is the deal that we have managed to conclude because we don\u2019t have the same red lines as Theresa May.\u2019 \u201cAnd it seems to me, at a personal level, what I would then say is that is the time when we would then say to people, \u2018now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude,\u2019\u201d he said. Gardiner\u2019s comments come after the YouGov poll found Labour trail the Tories at 34% to 40% as it stands, with Labour\u2019s support falling to 26% if Labour MPs voted with the Tories to bring about Brexit. A Labour source said the party had made clear its priority was a good deal or a general election but without these, \u201call options\u201d remained on the table, including a campaign for a public vote. In further signs of tensions over the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Emily Thornberry accused it of seeking to \u201cslap the Labour party around\u201d. The shadow foreign secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics: \u201cWhat I would like them to be particularly focusing on is taking the arguments as to why we should remain in the European Union to people who voted to leave and to try to change some hearts and minds, rather than using it \u2013 as some people I think do \u2013 as an opportunity to attack the Labour party and the leadership of the Labour party.\u201d A People\u2019s Vote spokesman said Thornberry was \u201cbadly mistaken\u201d in her views about the campaign, adding: \u201cWhat we are doing is highlighting the biggest poll on Brexit yet, which shows that Labour will suffer its worst electoral defeat since the 1930s if it continues promising to enable some sort of Brexit to go ahead. \u201cIn that situation, it won\u2019t be us slapping the leadership but millions of Labour voters who want the party to fight for the public services, rights and living standards that will otherwise be hammered by any kind of Brexit deal.\u201d",

One of the issues it is due to look at is how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/20/lisa-jones-girlfriend-of-undercover-police-office-mark-kennedy-interview\">the police spies frequently</a> formed intimate relationships with women while concealing their real identities.</p> <p>According to the inquiry, Straven denied the existence of the two relationships in a signed statement in October 2017. At that time, he <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Open-Application-for-restriction-orders-by-separately-represented-officers.pdf\">had for more than a year been attempting</a> to persuade the inquiry to make a legal order keeping his identity secret.</p> <p>However, in April 2018 he admitted he had had intimate <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181025-ruling_core_participants-23.pdf\">relationships with both women</a>, according to the inquiry.</p> <p>The women have now become <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/\">part of the inquiry</a> and are due to give evidence about how he deceived them.</p> <p>One of the women, known as Sara as she has been granted anonymity by Mitting, has told the inquiry that Straven <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/20181025-ruling_core_participants-23.pdf\">conducted a deceitful intimate relationship</a> with her between late 1998 and March 2001.</p> <p>Sara said: \u201cWhy should we be surprised that he hasn\u2019t been honest? Anything any undercover officer has to say is up for argument \u2013 they are trained liars and deceivers.</p> <p>\u201cApart from the confusion and deep emotional effects of these officers on the women targeted, what appals me is that these relationships appear to have been sanctioned at a higher level, which amounts to state abuse and institutionalised sexism. No concern at all for using women\u2019s lives, including the wives of the officers.\u201d</p> <p>The second woman, known as Ellie, has told the inquiry that in 2001, <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180920_ruling_core_participants_21.pdf\">Straven had initiated a sexual relationship</a> with her that lasted about a year.</p> <p>Straven lost his attempt to keep his identity concealed as <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180920_ruling_core_participants_21.pdf\">Mitting did not accept his denial</a> about the sexual relationships.</p> <p>Straven said he \u201cintends to fully cooperate with the inquiry and will provide any evidence he is able to give to the inquiry and it does not seem appropriate that matters the inquiry is going to investigate should be ventilated in the media beforehand\u201d.</p> <p>The inquiry was set up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/stephen-lawrence-theresa-may-inquiry-police\">2014 by the then home secretary, Theresa May</a>, after what she called \u201cserious failings\u201d <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-announces-statutory-inquiry-into-undercover-policing\">in undercover policing</a> had been exposed. The inquiry \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/undercover-policing-inquiry-will-not-deliver-final-report-before-2023\">which has been much delayed</a> \u2013 is due to start hearing evidence in public in June.</p> <p>An analysis by the Guardian shows that so far, 20 undercover officers deployed in political groups <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/31/woman-reveals-police-spy-tricked-her-into-relationship-in-1970s\">between the mid-1970s</a> and 2010 are known to have had sexual relationships, some of them lasting years, while using fake identities. All but one are men. Some of the men had relationships with more than one woman during their undercover missions.</p> <p>Police have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/20/met-police-apologise-women-had-relationships-with-undercover-officers\">paid compensation to at least 12 women</a> who were deceived by undercover officers who spied on political groups.</p> <p>Straven was a member of the Metropolitan police\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/24/special-demonstration-squad-undercover-unit-analysis\">special demonstration squad (SDS)</a>, which infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008.

One of the issues it is due to look at is how the police spies frequently formed intimate relationships with women while concealing their real identities. According to the inquiry, Straven denied the existence of the two relationships in a signed statement in October 2017. At that time, he had for more than a year been attempting to persuade the inquiry to make a legal order keeping his identity secret. However, in April 2018 he admitted he had had intimate relationships with both women, according to the inquiry. The women have now become part of the inquiry and are due to give evidence about how he deceived them. One of the women, known as Sara as she has been granted anonymity by Mitting, has told the inquiry that Straven conducted a deceitful intimate relationship with her between late 1998 and March 2001. Sara said: \u201cWhy should we be surprised that he hasn\u2019t been honest? Anything any undercover officer has to say is up for argument \u2013 they are trained liars and deceivers. \u201cApart from the confusion and deep emotional effects of these officers on the women targeted, what appals me is that these relationships appear to have been sanctioned at a higher level, which amounts to state abuse and institutionalised sexism. No concern at all for using women\u2019s lives, including the wives of the officers.\u201d The second woman, known as Ellie, has told the inquiry that in 2001, Straven had initiated a sexual relationship with her that lasted about a year. Straven lost his attempt to keep his identity concealed as Mitting did not accept his denial about the sexual relationships. Straven said he \u201cintends to fully cooperate with the inquiry and will provide any evidence he is able to give to the inquiry and it does not seem appropriate that matters the inquiry is going to investigate should be ventilated in the media beforehand\u201d. The inquiry was set up in 2014 by the then home secretary, Theresa May, after what she called \u201cserious failings\u201d in undercover policing had been exposed. The inquiry \u2013 which has been much delayed \u2013 is due to start hearing evidence in public in June. An analysis by the Guardian shows that so far, 20 undercover officers deployed in political groups between the mid-1970s and 2010 are known to have had sexual relationships, some of them lasting years, while using fake identities. All but one are men. Some of the men had relationships with more than one woman during their undercover missions. Police have paid compensation to at least 12 women who were deceived by undercover officers who spied on political groups. Straven was a member of the Metropolitan police\u2019s special demonstration squad (SDS), which infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008. He spied on the Animal Liberation Front and a group of London activists from Brixton and Croydon who opposed foxhunting. Mitting\u2019s inquiry is also examining why Straven appears to have used a second false identity while undercover, without the authorisation of his SDS supervisors. According to the inquiry, this second identity was Kevin Crossland, a five-year-old boy who had died in a plane crash in the former Yugoslavia in 1966 when going on holiday with his family. Undercover officers routinely stole the identities of dead children but did so with the authority of their superiors.",

A plastic drum that has been buried in the ground with its rim at surface level is metres away, the small trap a form of passive collection used during ecology studies. As she steps over the small fenceline that draws the animals in, elation washes over Kate Taylor\u2019s face \u2013 there\u2019s a painted dragon, bright blue and green. One of two managers of Bon Bon station reserve in the Australian outback, she hasn\u2019t seen one of these small lizards for years.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s day two of my visit and the suspense is killing me as we slowly walk towards the last of the pitfall traps we are checking that day. A plastic drum that has been buried in the ground with its rim at surface level is metres away, the small trap a form of passive collection used during ecology studies. As she steps over the small fenceline that draws the animals in, elation washes over Kate Taylor\u2019s face \u2013 there\u2019s a painted dragon, bright blue and green. One of two managers of Bon Bon station reserve in the Australian outback, she hasn\u2019t seen one of these small lizards for years. She gently picks it up as it wraps its claws around her index finger. The lizard barely reaches her second knuckle. Its colours are so vibrant and it feels like we just won the lottery. Top: A painted dragon. Below: Mount Ernest at sunset The sun is now setting and the repetition of looking for small creatures in plastic tubes is yet to bore me. Each long drive to multiple trapping sites showcases a range of ecosystems and backdrops. This is exactly the thing Kate and Clint Taylor, the managers of Bon Bon, live for. Clockwise from top: Coober Pedy, the mailbox at the beginning of Bon Bon station\u2019s driveway, a wedge-tailed eagle on the Stuart Highway Bon Bon station reserve is a 2,164 sq km piece of South Australian land previously run as a sheep station. It was purchased in 2008 by Bush Heritage, a privately owned company that buys land for the future preservation of its flora and fauna. The closest airport is at Coober Pedy, known for its small population and having the largest opal mining area in the world, and when I arrive Clint Taylor collects me. Bon Bon station reserve office The dry, hot wind is unexpected and harsh. The horizon has transformed into a mirage from the heat. \u201cAbout a 180km,\u201d he says as we cruise along the Stuart Highway, \u201cthat\u2019s how far to Bon Bon.\u201d Measuring anything in time here is pointless, distances reign supreme. Just before we pull into the driveway of the station a huge wedge-tailed eagle flies past the car. I have never seen one this close, and it is utterly breathtaking. Clint Taylor at his home checking the water gauge We pull into Bon Bon headquarters where we meet project manager Kate. She is commanding attention from six volunteers who have come to participate in the annual South Australian species survey. Kate and Clint have spent the past 10 years working towards a common goal. They both volunteered for Bush Heritage after hearing about the work it does and have built up relationships and skills to prepare them for running a reserve together on their own. Bush Heritage was founded by Bob Brown and started with just a few hundred hectares in 1991 in Tasmania\u2019s Liffey Valley. Now it protects more than 8m hectares across Australia. Bon Bon station is its second largest reserve. Top: Sunset over Bon Bon station with Kate\u2019s car in the background. Bottom: Kate Taylor The reserve is the Taylors\u2019 office, home and playground. They have a small veggie garden in the courtyard of their home and chickens who supply the homestead\u2019s eggs. On the drive out to Mount Earnest, the second highest point on the property, they explain how they ended up in the middle of nowhere working and living together in complete isolation. \u201cWe met in Roxby Downs and our first conversation was about how we both loved camels.

Last financial year, <a href=\"https://infocomm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/594393/OIC-Ann-Rep-2017-18.pdf\">the NT government granted just 292 of the 900 FOI requests it finalised</a>, and partially granted another 298.</p> <p>It refused 246 FOI requests, or 27%. Victoria refused 3.89% and Western Australia 3.2%. It is also significantly higher than the commonwealth\u2019s refusal rate of 17%, which is itself a record high. Data for other jurisdictions in 2017-18 is not yet available.</p> <p>The year prior, the NT had by far the highest refusal rate (28%) of any jurisdiction. The next closest was Queensland at 20%. The commonwealth refused 10% of FOI requests in the same year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/04/complaints-about-underresourced-foi-system-spike-by-72-in-a-single-year\">Complaints about underresourced FOI system spike by 72% in a single year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The total volume of FOI requests received in the NT is low compared with the rest of the country, making the refusal rate more susceptible to change than larger jurisdictions. There can be legitimate reasons for refusing an FOI request, including that the documents are legally exempt or do not exist, or that the application itself is deficient.</p> <p>But the NT\u2019s refusal rate has now been above 20% for four years running, and experts believe there are deeper problems inhibiting the release of information.</p> <p>Ken Parish, an NT-based legal academic at Charles Darwin University, said there was no obvious reason for the high refusal rate, given the territory\u2019s FOI legislation is no more restrictive than other jurisdictions.</p> <p>Parish believes the result may partly be a cultural problem within the NT public service. He also believes the NT\u2019s status as the last Australian jurisdiction to introduce FOI may also have played a role.</p> <p>Parish said the territory had a huge public-sector workforce, relative to other states and territories. The workforce was also top-heavy, he said, with almost half the workforce being made up of managerial or administrative staff.</p> <p>\u201cI hypothesise that what we\u2019ve got therefore is a very large public service culture.\u201d He said the public service was dominated by managers who were \u201cvery much politicised because of the senior executive service and a large and still-growing set of ministerial advisers\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt may well be that the rate of non-response to FOI requests is in one sense a part of that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The territory\u2019s large public-sector workforce also ought to mean refusing FOI requests on practical grounds was less likely, he said.</p> <p>Guardian Australia approached the office of the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, for comment, but did not receive a response.</p> <p>The Gunner government made numerous promises to improve transparency and accountability before taking office in 2016. It promised to set up an integrity commission, which it has done, reform political donations and disclose politicians\u2019 registrable interests.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Territory government is refusing one in four freedom-of-information requests \u2013 a rate seven times higher than Victoria\u2019s and eight times higher than Western Australia\u2019s. An analysis of state and territory FOI data shows the Northern Territory is by far the most likely jurisdiction to block requests for government documents. Last financial year, the NT government granted just 292 of the 900 FOI requests it finalised, and partially granted another 298. It refused 246 FOI requests, or 27%. Victoria refused 3.89% and Western Australia 3.2%. It is also significantly higher than the commonwealth\u2019s refusal rate of 17%, which is itself a record high. Data for other jurisdictions in 2017-18 is not yet available. The year prior, the NT had by far the highest refusal rate (28%) of any jurisdiction. The next closest was Queensland at 20%. The commonwealth refused 10% of FOI requests in the same year. The total volume of FOI requests received in the NT is low compared with the rest of the country, making the refusal rate more susceptible to change than larger jurisdictions. There can be legitimate reasons for refusing an FOI request, including that the documents are legally exempt or do not exist, or that the application itself is deficient. But the NT\u2019s refusal rate has now been above 20% for four years running, and experts believe there are deeper problems inhibiting the release of information. Ken Parish, an NT-based legal academic at Charles Darwin University, said there was no obvious reason for the high refusal rate, given the territory\u2019s FOI legislation is no more restrictive than other jurisdictions. Parish believes the result may partly be a cultural problem within the NT public service. He also believes the NT\u2019s status as the last Australian jurisdiction to introduce FOI may also have played a role. Parish said the territory had a huge public-sector workforce, relative to other states and territories. The workforce was also top-heavy, he said, with almost half the workforce being made up of managerial or administrative staff. \u201cI hypothesise that what we\u2019ve got therefore is a very large public service culture.\u201d He said the public service was dominated by managers who were \u201cvery much politicised because of the senior executive service and a large and still-growing set of ministerial advisers\u201d. \u201cIt may well be that the rate of non-response to FOI requests is in one sense a part of that,\u201d he said. The territory\u2019s large public-sector workforce also ought to mean refusing FOI requests on practical grounds was less likely, he said. Guardian Australia approached the office of the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, for comment, but did not receive a response. The Gunner government made numerous promises to improve transparency and accountability before taking office in 2016. It promised to set up an integrity commission, which it has done, reform political donations and disclose politicians\u2019 registrable interests.",

Six microphones were placed in a curve behind the frontline and a soldier near the frontline was given a button connected to a string galvanometer, inside which each microphone was connected to a thin wire that moved when that microphone picked up a sound. As each wire cast a shadow on to a moving piece of photographic film, a record was made of the sound picked up by each microphone.</p> <p>The century old-technology means there is a photographic record of the guns at 11am on 11 November 1918. Modern technology has since allowed the artillery fire of the minute before to be recreated in a sound artefact at IWM London, where listeners can hear the gun\u2019s vibrations through a special wooden elbow board.</p> <p>Field Music, who have a reputation for innovative and varied live performances, were commissioned by the museum to create a commemorative sound and light show.</p> <p>David Brewis said the sets had been inspired by the graphic record and sound artefact, which he described as \u201cthis tiny, incomplete fragment, not much more than a moment, but one which could be both the beginning and the ending of a huge story\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have done is really try to capture the echoes of the first world war in all the time since,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have taken a lot of things, both visually and sonically, from the piece,\u201d he added, explaining the two shows would involve animation as well as songs \u2013 some funny.</p> <p>\u201cWe have looked at little stories, events, moments, or technological advances, which happened in the war, or immediately after, and drawn a line from there across the next 100 years.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the project, the brothers researched the New Zealand-born surgeon Harold Gillies, who during the war pioneered facial cosmetic surgery and who went on to carry out one of the first gender realignment operations.</p> <p>The duo were also inspired by a small Wisconsin company that developed a new material for dressing wounds and then adapted it for the first modern sanitary product. The company was Kimberly-Clark, and its product called Kotex.</p> <p>\u201cThe spaces we will be performing in are so incredible and so intense,\u201d said Brewis, \u201cso we have to be respectful to the gravitas of the stories those museums are telling.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The IWM North performance is on 24 January from 9-11pm, and at IWM London on 31 January from 9-11pm.

Six microphones were placed in a curve behind the frontline and a soldier near the frontline was given a button connected to a string galvanometer, inside which each microphone was connected to a thin wire that moved when that microphone picked up a sound. As each wire cast a shadow on to a moving piece of photographic film, a record was made of the sound picked up by each microphone. The century old-technology means there is a photographic record of the guns at 11am on 11 November 1918. Modern technology has since allowed the artillery fire of the minute before to be recreated in a sound artefact at IWM London, where listeners can hear the gun\u2019s vibrations through a special wooden elbow board. Field Music, who have a reputation for innovative and varied live performances, were commissioned by the museum to create a commemorative sound and light show. David Brewis said the sets had been inspired by the graphic record and sound artefact, which he described as \u201cthis tiny, incomplete fragment, not much more than a moment, but one which could be both the beginning and the ending of a huge story\u201d. \u201cWhat we have done is really try to capture the echoes of the first world war in all the time since,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken a lot of things, both visually and sonically, from the piece,\u201d he added, explaining the two shows would involve animation as well as songs \u2013 some funny. \u201cWe have looked at little stories, events, moments, or technological advances, which happened in the war, or immediately after, and drawn a line from there across the next 100 years.\u201d As part of the project, the brothers researched the New Zealand-born surgeon Harold Gillies, who during the war pioneered facial cosmetic surgery and who went on to carry out one of the first gender realignment operations. The duo were also inspired by a small Wisconsin company that developed a new material for dressing wounds and then adapted it for the first modern sanitary product. The company was Kimberly-Clark, and its product called Kotex. \u201cThe spaces we will be performing in are so incredible and so intense,\u201d said Brewis, \u201cso we have to be respectful to the gravitas of the stories those museums are telling.\u201d \u2022 The IWM North performance is on 24 January from 9-11pm, and at IWM London on 31 January from 9-11pm.

Starting with the Men\u2019s Handball World Championship, co-hosted by \u201cthe two handball-loving countries of Germany and Denmark\u201d, which starts on Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/06/football-level-playing-field-cash-premier-league\">Football is not a level playing field when the game is so governed by cash | Andrew Anthony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all that the event is about pitting nation against nation in very literally hand-to-hand combat, it is imbued with a spirit of cooperation that does not end with the harmonious hosts. The German singer Dominik Klein \u2013 not to be confused with the German international handball player Dominik Klein, even though he seems to have been chosen quite deliberately for that purpose \u2013 collaborated with the Danish DJ Kongsted to record the official song, the suitably energetic Stand Up Stand Out (\u201cFull arenas and the best handball in the world need a song that gets us all excited and ready to party,\u201d says Klein) while the mascot was designed \u201cpartly by fans\u201d after a global crowdsourcing initiative.</p> <p>This might have been a tactical error. They ended up with a moon-faced humanoid called Stan, who looks like Frank Sidebottom has just joined the Power Rangers. Stan, it turns out, is a visitor from the fictional planet GD19 where \u201cmost days we just celebrate, dance and sing\u201d. The German handball association started its press release introducing Stan with the assertion that \u201cmascots have always been born of strange ideas\u201d and it is certainly true of theirs.</p> <p>January, however, is full of events that do not need an outsized alien to get people muttering about strange ideas. Take the World Ice Fishing Championship, which starts in Batak, Bulgaria, in a fortnight, and involves contestants drilling access to a frozen lake and attempting to coax fish from its frigid depths by rapidly wiggling their miniature rods. \u201cThis sport is very interesting,\u201d said the Russian Nikolai Volodin after he came 76th in 2017. \u201cChess on ice, you could say.\u201d</p> <p>There are certainly more meaningless things to do on ice, as contestants of this week\u2019s IceSnowFootball World Cup will surely discover. The event has attracted four star-studded sides to the Swiss town of Arosa, including St\u00e9phane Chapuisat from the host nation, Germany\u2019s Torsten Frings and Mario Basler, Spain\u2019s Gaizka Mendieta and, somehow finding himself in a global all-stars squad, Danny Mills. All will attempt to play the game on the unforgiving terrain of an Alpine ice rink covered in snow, and though it must be extremely hard for players to keep their footing in such conditions, anyone who watched Neymar\u2019s performances in Russia last year will appreciate that the same is sometimes true on perfectly-manicured grass, only without the obvious excuse.</p> <p>Those in search of something a little less prone to melting or falling over should look instead to Las Vegas on 23 January, when the Bricklayer World Championship will be not so much played as laid. To the outsider this looks like the undoubted highlight of the industry conference it is crowbarred into, thrillingly entitled World of Concrete, and is apparently known as the \u201cSuper Bowl of Masonry\u201d. It involves two-man teams attempting to build a 26ft 8in, double wythe brick wall over the course of a single hour. The biggest wall wins, though \u201ca team\u2019s final brick count may be adjusted down if judges detect workmanship infractions\u201d.</p> <p>This sounds like exactly the event Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been working towards in recent years, his career having turned into an exercise in putting up barriers both on the pitch and off it, ending up with something curiously like a double wythe wall in that observers increasingly discerned a big gap in the middle where something meaningful might have been. Less promisingly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/22/respect-covering-jose-mourinho-manchester-united-wild-ride\" title=\"\">his final months at Old Trafford</a> were practically littered with workmanship infractions.</p> <p>Football, like most sports, is an inherently competitive endeavour, but as the Bricklayer World Championship suggests, increasingly there is nothing humans will not turn into some kind of battle. Witness the first of this month\u2019s cookery-related contests, the 2019 World Championship Scotch Pie Awards, whose winners will be announced on 15 January. It takes a bit of cheek to apply the word \u201cworld\u201d to a competition with three English finalists, 47 from Scotland and none from anywhere else, or to associate it with 2019 when the pies were both cooked and judged last November, but this is the world we live in.</p> <p>The Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie is a step up in seriousness. Teams from 21 countries will head to Lyon this month to create a range of frozen and baked morsels over 10 hours of remorseless kitchen-based action. This year among the required products is a honey biscuit, included because, according to the event\u2019s president, Philippe Rigollot: \u201cWe considered it fitting to use the fame of the Coupe du Monde de la P\u00e2tisserie to further a cause as noble and important as the defence of bees, who are true sentinels of our environment.\u201d This is a noble goal, though whoever decided a good way to further the cause of bees would be to steal their honey and use it to make biscuits was almost certainly more interested in biscuits than bees. Still, these aren\u2019t the World Beekeeping Awards \u2013 we\u2019ve got to wait until September for those.</p>",

The German singer Dominik Klein \u2013 not to be confused with the German international handball player Dominik Klein, even though he seems to have been chosen quite deliberately for that purpose \u2013 collaborated with the Danish DJ Kongsted to record the official song, the suitably energetic Stand Up Stand Out (\u201cFull arenas and the best handball in the world need a song that gets us all excited and ready to party,\u201d says Klein) while the mascot was designed \u201cpartly by fans\u201d after a global crowdsourcing initiative. This might have been a tactical error. They ended up with a moon-faced humanoid called Stan, who looks like Frank Sidebottom has just joined the Power Rangers. Stan, it turns out, is a visitor from the fictional planet GD19 where \u201cmost days we just celebrate, dance and sing\u201d. The German handball association started its press release introducing Stan with the assertion that \u201cmascots have always been born of strange ideas\u201d and it is certainly true of theirs. January, however, is full of events that do not need an outsized alien to get people muttering about strange ideas. Take the World Ice Fishing Championship, which starts in Batak, Bulgaria, in a fortnight, and involves contestants drilling access to a frozen lake and attempting to coax fish from its frigid depths by rapidly wiggling their miniature rods. \u201cThis sport is very interesting,\u201d said the Russian Nikolai Volodin after he came 76th in 2017. \u201cChess on ice, you could say.\u201d There are certainly more meaningless things to do on ice, as contestants of this week\u2019s IceSnowFootball World Cup will surely discover. The event has attracted four star-studded sides to the Swiss town of Arosa, including St\u00e9phane Chapuisat from the host nation, Germany\u2019s Torsten Frings and Mario Basler, Spain\u2019s Gaizka Mendieta and, somehow finding himself in a global all-stars squad, Danny Mills. All will attempt to play the game on the unforgiving terrain of an Alpine ice rink covered in snow, and though it must be extremely hard for players to keep their footing in such conditions, anyone who watched Neymar\u2019s performances in Russia last year will appreciate that the same is sometimes true on perfectly-manicured grass, only without the obvious excuse. Those in search of something a little less prone to melting or falling over should look instead to Las Vegas on 23 January, when the Bricklayer World Championship will be not so much played as laid. To the outsider this looks like the undoubted highlight of the industry conference it is crowbarred into, thrillingly entitled World of Concrete, and is apparently known as the \u201cSuper Bowl of Masonry\u201d. It involves two-man teams attempting to build a 26ft 8in, double wythe brick wall over the course of a single hour. The biggest wall wins, though \u201ca team\u2019s final brick count may be adjusted down if judges detect workmanship infractions\u201d. This sounds like exactly the event Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been working towards in recent years, his career having turned into an exercise in putting up barriers both on the pitch and off it, ending up with something curiously like a double wythe wall in that observers increasingly discerned a big gap in the middle where something meaningful might have been. Less promisingly, his final months at Old Trafford were practically littered with workmanship infractions. Football, like most sports, is an inherently competitive endeavour, but as the Bricklayer World Championship suggests, increasingly there is nothing humans will not turn into some kind of battle. Witness the first of this month\u2019s cookery-related contests, the 2019 World Championship Scotch Pie Awards, whose winners will be announced on 15 January. It takes a bit of cheek to apply the word \u201cworld\u201d to a competition with three English finalists, 47 from Scotland and none from anywhere else, or to associate it with 2019 when the pies were both cooked and judged last November, but this is the world we live in. The Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie is a step up in seriousness. Teams from 21 countries will head to Lyon this month to create a range of frozen and baked morsels over 10 hours of remorseless kitchen-based action. This year among the required products is a honey biscuit, included because, according to the event\u2019s president, Philippe Rigollot: \u201cWe considered it fitting to use the fame of the Coupe du Monde de la P\u00e2tisserie to further a cause as noble and important as the defence of bees, who are true sentinels of our environment.\u201d This is a noble goal, though whoever decided a good way to further the cause of bees would be to steal their honey and use it to make biscuits was almost certainly more interested in biscuits than bees. Still, these aren\u2019t the World Beekeeping Awards \u2013 we\u2019ve got to wait until September for those.",

      "body": "<p>Up a narrow staircase at the labyrinthine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/goldsmiths\">Goldsmiths college</a> in London is an airy room where researchers, film-makers, AI experts, investigative journalists and archaeologists pore over computer screens. This is the nerve centre of <a href=\"https://www.forensic-architecture.org/\">Forensic Architecture</a>, the research agency that was a strong contender for the 2018 Turner prize (they lost out to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/04/iphone-film-maker-charlotte-prodger-wins-2018-turner-prize\">Charlotte Prodger</a>) and which has gained a name for its meticulous \u201ccounter-forensic\u201d investigations into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights\">human rights</a> abuses.</p> <p>In this post-truth era, verification is paramount, so myriad documentation sources have to be corroborated in minute detail. On a recent visit I paid them, researchers were synchronising police bodycam film and extended thermal footage with film shot by an activist. Someone else was scrutinising CCTV footage connected to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2018/09/26/gay-activist-dies-in-athens-after-brutal-public-beating\">the recent unsolved murder of an LGBTQ activist in Greece</a>. The investigative film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/laura-poitras\">Laura Poitras</a> was visiting and journalists from the New York Times had been over to learn about setting up a visual investigations unit. A team is currently training Chicago activists to respond to police violence.</p> <p>Goldsmiths is once again the incubator of a new movement, 30 years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/damienhirst\">Damien Hirst</a> and his fellow students swaggered into British art history with the landmark exhibition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/01/art\">Freeze</a>. But where the Young British Artists were about ego and in-your-face art, with its sharks and suggestive arrangements of kebabs and fried eggs, this is collaborative, research based and politically committed, spanning architecture, journalism, law and science. As with all the most interesting movements, there\u2019s controversy over whether it\u2019s even art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2546022975a8c22592690e1b56559e3568baccde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2546022975a8c22592690e1b56559e3568baccde/0_144_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strong contender \u2026 Forensic Architecture at the Turner prize exhibition in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strong contender \u2026 Forensic Architecture at the Turner prize exhibition in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This movement has emerged and takes its name from the <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/architecture/\">Centre for Research Architecture</a> (CRA) at Goldsmiths. Research architecture has nothing to do with designing buildings but everything to do with the politics of space, especially how it is manipulated by states and corporations against civilians and the environment \u2013 from drone strikes in Pakistan to mining in the Amazon. Using sophisticated technologies such as remote sensing, 3D modelling and vessel-tracking, hard evidence of wrongdoing is gathered. The final work is as likely to be presented in an international court as in an art gallery. Evidence compiled by Forensic Architecture has been submitted to the International Criminal Court on Israel\u2019s 2014 assault on Gaza; to the Inter-American court on Guatemala\u2019s genocide; and to the European Court of Human Rights on Italy\u2019s role in migrant drowning deaths. </p> <p>\u201cWe are confrontational, interventional,\u201d says architect and activist <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/visual-cultures/w-eizman/\">Eyal Weizman</a>, founder of Forensic Architecture, the most high-profile group to emerge from the CRA. As well as a research agency, Forensic Architecture has also evolved into an investigative, case-driven discipline within the broader field of research architecture. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea of really working as detectives,\u201d explains Lorenzo Pezzani, who has collaborated with the group and teaches a course in forensic architecture at the CRA. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576097ffdd98a9e7e4664730e2acc40e9e35c324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576097ffdd98a9e7e4664730e2acc40e9e35c324/95_0_2811_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea Watch v Libyan Coast Guard, Central Mediterranean Sea \u2026 a past investigation by Forensic Oceanography and Forensic Architecture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sea Watch v Libyan Coast Guard, Central Mediterranean Sea \u2026 a past investigation by Forensic Oceanography and Forensic Architecture</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forensic Architecture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Serving as a petri dish for this new field, the CRA was set up as a postgraduate faculty at Goldsmiths by <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/visual-cultures/w-eizman/\">Weizman</a> in 2005. Fourteen years of experimentation later, it is, according to Polly Staple of the <a href=\"https://chisenhale.org.uk/\">Chisenhale Gallery</a>, one of the most important creative bases in the UK. \u201cIt offers,\u201d she says, \u201ca radically different position to that which is understood as \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 by mainstream media and the art market.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not art destined for collectors' homes.

It\u2019s not about beautiful paintings or even self-expression. Students and staff at the CRA are passionately confronting the power structures responsible for violence and destruction, employing multiple journalistic and technological tools to uncover hidden stories. They call themselves \u201cspatial practitioners\u201d rather than architects or artists, since exhibiting their films, images, installations and books in galleries is just one aspect of their work, which also includes teaching, collaborating with experts and ongoing research.

In 2016, Abu Hamdan worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty to conduct interviews with former detainees of Syria\u2019s notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/18/saydnaya-prison-syria-assad-amnesty-reconstruction\">Saydnaya prison</a>, where inmates are mostly kept in darkness and sound is used as a weapon of torture, about what they heard. The result of this collaboration was presented last year to a German prosecutor in a petition against the Syrian government.<strong> </strong>For his show, Abu Hamdan displayed a selection of objects such as a popcorn maker, a car door and cannelloni pasta as a sound effects library, objects which could make the sound of a punch, kick or gunshot.</p> <p>Where Abu Hamdan explores audio, Alon Schwabe and Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez Pascual of the duo <a href=\"http://www.cooking-sections.com/\">Cooking Sections</a> look at the world through the lens of food. Their long-term project <a href=\"https://climavore.org/\">Climavore</a> promotes the idea of adapting food production and consumption to climate change. Last year the pair built a structure in Skye that functions both as an oyster farm at high tide and a dining table at low tide, where convivial discussions are held with residents, farmers, politicians and fishermen about viable alternatives to Skye\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/18/skye-salmon-farms-approved-despite-warnings-of-irrecoverable-damage\">damaging salmon farming industry</a>. \u201cOne of the great things we learned at the centre was how do you really engage with these different stakeholders and agents working in the field?\u201d says Schwabe.</p> <p>The centre grew out of the lack of an architecture discipline at Goldsmiths, but given the college\u2019s long history of experimentation and activism, it was never going to be a traditional course. \u201cThere was a sense that new social and political conditions were unfolding in which new practices and thinkers were urgently needed,\u201d says centre director <a href=\"http://susanschuppli.com/\">Susan Schuppli</a>, whose own practice explores the legal and aesthetic implications of damaged ecologies and pollution. Her recent project <a href=\"http://susanschuppli.com/exhibition/nature-represents-itself/\">Nature Represents Itself </a>used aerial, underwater and satellite imagery, as well as CGI simulation, to argue that the swirling oil slick from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico amounted to a kind of camera-less photography, a chemical reaction caused by hydrocarbon atoms interacting with water and sunlight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10d22caf810dd7466678422b9b3106f2a92ec565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10d22caf810dd7466678422b9b3106f2a92ec565/0_587_3000_1409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking Sections\u2019 Climavore project on the Isle of Skye \u2013 bringing fish farmers together in discussion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking Sections\u2019 Climavore project on the Isle of Skye \u2013 bringing fish farmers together in discussion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Hattersley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weizman launched the centre as a peer-to-peer PhD programme and brought in like-minded thinkers such as curator <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/architecture/research-students/past-phd-students/anselm-franke/\">Anselm Franke</a>, film-maker <a href=\"https://www.documenta14.de/en/artists/1935/angela-melitopoulos\">Angela Melitopoulos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.celinecondorelli.eu/\">C\u00e9line Condorelli</a>, an artist and architect. This first phase of the centre was known as Round Table One, because a huge round table was the gathering point for fierce debates among participants and guest speakers.

      "bodyText": "Up a narrow staircase at the labyrinthine Goldsmiths college in London is an airy room where researchers, film-makers, AI experts, investigative journalists and archaeologists pore over computer screens. This is the nerve centre of Forensic Architecture, the research agency that was a strong contender for the 2018 Turner prize (they lost out to Charlotte Prodger) and which has gained a name for its meticulous \u201ccounter-forensic\u201d investigations into human rights abuses. In this post-truth era, verification is paramount, so myriad documentation sources have to be corroborated in minute detail. On a recent visit I paid them, researchers were synchronising police bodycam film and extended thermal footage with film shot by an activist. Someone else was scrutinising CCTV footage connected to the recent unsolved murder of an LGBTQ activist in Greece. The investigative film-maker Laura Poitras was visiting and journalists from the New York Times had been over to learn about setting up a visual investigations unit. A team is currently training Chicago activists to respond to police violence. Goldsmiths is once again the incubator of a new movement, 30 years after Damien Hirst and his fellow students swaggered into British art history with the landmark exhibition Freeze. But where the Young British Artists were about ego and in-your-face art, with its sharks and suggestive arrangements of kebabs and fried eggs, this is collaborative, research based and politically committed, spanning architecture, journalism, law and science. As with all the most interesting movements, there\u2019s controversy over whether it\u2019s even art. This movement has emerged and takes its name from the Centre for Research Architecture (CRA) at Goldsmiths. Research architecture has nothing to do with designing buildings but everything to do with the politics of space, especially how it is manipulated by states and corporations against civilians and the environment \u2013 from drone strikes in Pakistan to mining in the Amazon. Using sophisticated technologies such as remote sensing, 3D modelling and vessel-tracking, hard evidence of wrongdoing is gathered. The final work is as likely to be presented in an international court as in an art gallery. Evidence compiled by Forensic Architecture has been submitted to the International Criminal Court on Israel\u2019s 2014 assault on Gaza; to the Inter-American court on Guatemala\u2019s genocide; and to the European Court of Human Rights on Italy\u2019s role in migrant drowning deaths. \u201cWe are confrontational, interventional,\u201d says architect and activist Eyal Weizman, founder of Forensic Architecture, the most high-profile group to emerge from the CRA. As well as a research agency, Forensic Architecture has also evolved into an investigative, case-driven discipline within the broader field of research architecture. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea of really working as detectives,\u201d explains Lorenzo Pezzani, who has collaborated with the group and teaches a course in forensic architecture at the CRA. Serving as a petri dish for this new field, the CRA was set up as a postgraduate faculty at Goldsmiths by Weizman in 2005. Fourteen years of experimentation later, it is, according to Polly Staple of the Chisenhale Gallery, one of the most important creative bases in the UK. \u201cIt offers,\u201d she says, \u201ca radically different position to that which is understood as \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 by mainstream media and the art market.\u201d This is not an art destined for collectors\u2019 homes. It\u2019s not about beautiful paintings or even self-expression. Students and staff at the CRA are passionately confronting the power structures responsible for violence and destruction, employing multiple journalistic and technological tools to uncover hidden stories. They call themselves \u201cspatial practitioners\u201d rather than architects or artists, since exhibiting their films, images, installations and books in galleries is just one aspect of their work, which also includes teaching, collaborating with experts and ongoing research. Whether they\u2019re investigating claims of a so-called climate refugee community in Alaska threatened by the impact of global warming or Australia\u2019s violations against immigrants offshore, their aim is to effect political change. Recently, CRA graduate Lawrence Abu Hamdan staged a show that centred on the notion of \u201cear witness\u201d testimony. In 2016, Abu Hamdan worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty to conduct interviews with former detainees of Syria\u2019s notorious Saydnaya prison, where inmates are mostly kept in darkness and sound is used as a weapon of torture, about what they heard. The result of this collaboration was presented last year to a German prosecutor in a petition against the Syrian government. For his show, Abu Hamdan displayed a selection of objects such as a popcorn maker, a car door and cannelloni pasta as a sound effects library, objects which could make the sound of a punch, kick or gunshot. Where Abu Hamdan explores audio, Alon Schwabe and Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez Pascual of the duo Cooking Sections look at the world through the lens of food. Their long-term project Climavore promotes the idea of adapting food production and consumption to climate change. Last year the pair built a structure in Skye that functions both as an oyster farm at high tide and a dining table at low tide, where convivial discussions are held with residents, farmers, politicians and fishermen about viable alternatives to Skye\u2019s damaging salmon farming industry. \u201cOne of the great things we learned at the centre was how do you really engage with these different stakeholders and agents working in the field?\u201d says Schwabe. The centre grew out of the lack of an architecture discipline at Goldsmiths, but given the college\u2019s long history of experimentation and activism, it was never going to be a traditional course. \u201cThere was a sense that new social and political conditions were unfolding in which new practices and thinkers were urgently needed,\u201d says centre director Susan Schuppli, whose own practice explores the legal and aesthetic implications of damaged ecologies and pollution. Her recent project Nature Represents Itself used aerial, underwater and satellite imagery, as well as CGI simulation, to argue that the swirling oil slick from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico amounted to a kind of camera-less photography, a chemical reaction caused by hydrocarbon atoms interacting with water and sunlight. Weizman launched the centre as a peer-to-peer PhD programme and brought in like-minded thinkers such as curator Anselm Franke, film-maker Angela Melitopoulos and C\u00e9line Condorelli, an artist and architect. This first phase of the centre was known as Round Table One, because a huge round table was the gathering point for fierce debates among participants and guest speakers. They realised their combined intellectual resources could be a powerful practical tool. \u201cWhat made Round Table so unique was it didn\u2019t have to deliver architects,\u201d says Condorelli. \u201cArchitecture is very much a methodology used to look at the world, it\u2019s not an object of study at the CRA.\u201d Since those early days, CRA graduates have spearheaded innovations in diverse fields. Lebanese-British practitioner Helene Kazan is pushing to extend international law to further protect the individual in conflict zones. Her video Masking Tape Intervention: Lebanon 1989 takes as its starting point her father\u2019s photo of their kitchen with masking tape gridding the window to prevent shelling from shattering the glass during Lebanon\u2019s civil war. Paulo Tavares focuses on land and human rights violations in Amazonia, using complex mapping of plants and trees, as well as testimonies from indigenous communities, to argue for the forest to have legal rights as a civic entity. The sea is the arena of Lorenzo Pezzani and film-maker Charles Heller, together known as Forensic Oceanography. Their 2011 project The Left-to-Die Boat drew on an astonishing array of surveillance tools to document the case of a distressed migrant boat from Libya that was left to drift for two weeks without intervention from nearby Nato vessels, resulting in the death of 63 migrants. For its Turner prize show, Forensic Architecture\u2019s multimedia display unravelled the cover-up of the killing of a Bedouin Palestinian teacher by Israeli police during a demolition operation in a Bedouin village. \u201c[The police] were absolutely stunned by the level of analysis that was unleashed on the case. Never has there been a group of modellers, architects, sound analysts doing that. We just decided to focus on that case because we thought it was paradigmatic enough,\u201d says Weizman. Sifting through information displayed in film, maps, tweets and models is a big ask of the viewer, but it\u2019s impossible not to be gripped by the unfolding narrative that\u2019s all the more shocking because it\u2019s real.

      "body": "<p>Like all great tailors, Joe Casely-Hayford was an outsider who observed how men define their personal identities and pledge group allegiances; the personal is the political and there is nothing more personal than the four metres of cloth in the average male outfit. He liked to cite his great-grandfather Joseph Casely-Hayford\u2019s 1911 book, Ethiopia Unbound, because it was about \u201cduality and double-consciousness\u201d. Casely-Hayford\u2019s grandfather \u201cwore Kente cloth to study at Cambridge and Savile Row to visit family in Ghana\u201d.</p> <p>Casely-Hayford, who has died aged 62 after suffering from cancer, applied that inheritance of black insight \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re aware of both yourself and how you\u2019re viewed by the majority at all times\u201d \u2013 to everybody, through clothes, mediating between tradition and street cred, formal three-piece and sportswear. </p> <p>His suits were worn by Bono and Gordon Brown; he was the first serious name to collaborate with Topshop, in 1993; and the first to make mini-ranges for middle Britain\u2019s redoubt, John Lewis. He adored the anarchic power of punk (its politics, not its binbags) and as creative director of the arch-Savile Row firm Gieves &amp; Hawkes (2005-08) took it to the Paris catwalk. Mixing it: that was life and the future.</p> <p>His father, Victor Casely-Hayford, a barrister from Ghana, had settled in the UK and he and his wife, Ransolina, expected much from Joe and his siblings, Gus, Peter and Margaret. Joe was not particularly academic and did not feel he belonged, \u201cso that made me interested in the cult of the individual. I wanted to create my own identity and that\u2019s what drew me into fashion\u201d. The rebellion was to cut his own gear from secondhand tat and wear Manolo Blahnik women\u2019s shoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90329aab041484f8e474e758300b865372dd7d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90329aab041484f8e474e758300b865372dd7d0e/0_0_1876_2818/666.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Casely-Hayford, left, with his son and business partner, Charlie, on the catwalk of the Casely-Hayford show at London Fashion Week in 2017.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Casely-Hayford, left, with his son and business partner, Charlie, on the catwalk of the Casely-Hayford show at London Fashion Week in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet his higher education was as thorough as the family could have wished: the workshop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/03/fashion.mainsection\" title=\"\">Doug Hayward</a>, favourite of celebrities and workng-class dandies; the Tailor and Cutter Academy; and then fashion design at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, followed by history of art at the ICA. He knew how to set a sleeve head well before he met a theory.</p> <p>The London fashion business was still informal in the 1980s, with low rents, low volume and a let\u2019s-make-it-right-here-on-the-kitchen-table attitude. Casely-Hayford\u2019s first brand, KIT, was just what it said on the label \u2013 army surplus canvas tents bought mouldering from a Bankside warehouse, bleached, distressed and cut up into garments.</p> <p>That they were found in the Clink, SE1, mattered, because the cacophony of London always fed Casely-Hayford\u2019s creativity. He knew the East End best, because West End fashion had historically outsourced hand-finishing east to Whitechapel, so when he took cheap workspace in 1984 to design for his new Joe Casely-Hayford label, it was in Brick Lane, where inspiration walked past his door, \u201cmixing English-gentleman pieces with their religious clothing\u201d on the way to the mosque. Surplus supplies were dwindling, so he was among the earliest designers to look for quality piece goods still being millwoven in the UK, and from these he made his first collection.</p> <p>The tailoring was old-school Savile Row, but the ideas were global, with sartorial jokes including shirts that buttoned back and front.

      "bodyText": "Like all great tailors, Joe Casely-Hayford was an outsider who observed how men define their personal identities and pledge group allegiances; the personal is the political and there is nothing more personal than the four metres of cloth in the average male outfit. He liked to cite his great-grandfather Joseph Casely-Hayford\u2019s 1911 book, Ethiopia Unbound, because it was about \u201cduality and double-consciousness\u201d. Casely-Hayford\u2019s grandfather \u201cwore Kente cloth to study at Cambridge and Savile Row to visit family in Ghana\u201d. Casely-Hayford, who has died aged 62 after suffering from cancer, applied that inheritance of black insight \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re aware of both yourself and how you\u2019re viewed by the majority at all times\u201d \u2013 to everybody, through clothes, mediating between tradition and street cred, formal three-piece and sportswear. His suits were worn by Bono and Gordon Brown; he was the first serious name to collaborate with Topshop, in 1993; and the first to make mini-ranges for middle Britain\u2019s redoubt, John Lewis. He adored the anarchic power of punk (its politics, not its binbags) and as creative director of the arch-Savile Row firm Gieves &amp; Hawkes (2005-08) took it to the Paris catwalk. Mixing it: that was life and the future. His father, Victor Casely-Hayford, a barrister from Ghana, had settled in the UK and he and his wife, Ransolina, expected much from Joe and his siblings, Gus, Peter and Margaret. Joe was not particularly academic and did not feel he belonged, \u201cso that made me interested in the cult of the individual. I wanted to create my own identity and that\u2019s what drew me into fashion\u201d. The rebellion was to cut his own gear from secondhand tat and wear Manolo Blahnik women\u2019s shoes. Yet his higher education was as thorough as the family could have wished: the workshop of Doug Hayward, favourite of celebrities and workng-class dandies; the Tailor and Cutter Academy; and then fashion design at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, followed by history of art at the ICA. He knew how to set a sleeve head well before he met a theory. The London fashion business was still informal in the 1980s, with low rents, low volume and a let\u2019s-make-it-right-here-on-the-kitchen-table attitude. Casely-Hayford\u2019s first brand, KIT, was just what it said on the label \u2013 army surplus canvas tents bought mouldering from a Bankside warehouse, bleached, distressed and cut up into garments. That they were found in the Clink, SE1, mattered, because the cacophony of London always fed Casely-Hayford\u2019s creativity. He knew the East End best, because West End fashion had historically outsourced hand-finishing east to Whitechapel, so when he took cheap workspace in 1984 to design for his new Joe Casely-Hayford label, it was in Brick Lane, where inspiration walked past his door, \u201cmixing English-gentleman pieces with their religious clothing\u201d on the way to the mosque. Surplus supplies were dwindling, so he was among the earliest designers to look for quality piece goods still being millwoven in the UK, and from these he made his first collection. The tailoring was old-school Savile Row, but the ideas were global, with sartorial jokes including shirts that buttoned back and front. Casely-Hayford stayed faithful to the East End, moving the studio to Shoreditch, and then tracking undeveloped zones up as far as Seven Sisters. He had to expand, because everybody wanted his output or intervention. Before he even had a studio, he had styled for Island Records and the Clash came calling; U2 followed, as did Take That, Liam Gallagher, Lou Reed and Jarvis Cocker. He was on call 24/7 through the 80s and 90s for stage costumes and wedding suits, and also worked for magazines: \u201cWhen I saw the first issue of i-D, I saw people who were outsiders and that gave me hope in a socio-political sense. Prior to that, black people did \u2018black things\u2019.\u201d He showed in Paris and Tokyo, sold in New York, and set up a 1995 Barbican Art Gallery exhibition on African textiles. Before that, he had not consciously brought Africa much into his work, but its fabrics had become as local to Kingsland Road, Hackney, as a Greggs bakery, so it joined the mix. The label, which also produced womenswear, ran until 2005, when Casely-Hayford was recruited by Gieves &amp; Hawkes to see if a heritage tailoring establishment could be modernised as couture houses had been. This meant questioning every pad and stitch and he transferred all that R&amp;D over in 2009 into a new brand, its label, Casely-Hayford, standing for his work and that of his son and business partner, Charlie. They survived in the relentless clothing industry (more collections, volume and hype) by careful withdrawal, sometimes designing on the way to Japan, where they cultivated factories sympathetic to their English style, defined by Casely-Hayford Sr as \u201ccountry estates and housing estates\u201d. Besides selling in the usual grand international venues, father and son opened a small, kindly shop in Marylebone. Casely-Hayford said that through his children (his daughter Alice works for British Vogue) he saw \u201cyou can be where you want to be now. Thirty years ago we were fighting for our self-expression \u2026 it was very difficult to operate outside those parameters.\u201d He was appointed OBE in 2007. His wife, Maria Stevens, whom he met at St Martin\u2019s and married in 1980, survives him, as do their children, Charlie and Alice, and his siblings. \u2022 Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford, tailor and designer, born 24 May 1956; died 3 January 2019",

      "bodyText": "The battle of Hastings pier has erupted in public insults and accusations after a decision, announced at the end of December, to close the seaside town\u2019s prize-winning attraction for two months. Furious locals have accused owner Sheikh Abid Gulzar of keeping them in the dark over his plans for the pier\u2019s future after his sudden decision to shut it until March for repairs and improvements. Gulzar responded saying campaigners had been rude and insulting and \u201cwanted everything for free\u201d. The latest outbreak of hostilities, conducted mainly on social media, marks a new low in relations between campaigners and the owner. The warring sides have different visions for the pier, which won the prestigious Stirling prize for architecture in 2017. Hastings residents accuse Gulzar of cheapening the listed Victorian structure with the installation of fibreglass animals, including an elk and a gold baby hippopotamus, and plans for an amusement arcade. James Chang, of the campaign group Friends of Hastings Pier (FoHP), said locals wanted \u201csympathetic development\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not objecting to the development, we\u2019re objecting to the nature of development,\u201d he told the Guardian. In an interview with BBC Sussex, Chang added: \u201cWhat we are asking for is transparency. We want to know the plans for the pier. We need to know that the pier is being well cared for and looked after. There\u2019s \u00a314m of public money that has been invested.\u201d Gulzar, a hotelier and businessman who also owns Eastbourne pier, hit back, saying there had been arson attacks and thefts on the pier. He said a recent fire in the cafe was a close call. \u201cSafety is paramount. We have had one or two incidents that have frightened me \u2026had that fire happened early morning or late evening, the whole of that building would have gone up in flames,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI will make sure this pier will be one of the best, but I will not tolerate any nonsense where people come and use swear words and want everything for free. The most important thing is to get on with this work. I will do everything right. I love Hastings, it\u2019s one of the best seafronts, but it should improve.\u201d Since it opened in 1872, Hastings pier has gone from Victorian pleasure park to popular music venue \u2013 which saw performances by Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones \u2013 to crumbling edifice that engineers described as \u201cone good storm away from collapse\u201d in 2009. It was extensively damaged by fire in 2010 and reopened in 2016 after a \u00a314m renovation paid for by the Heritage Lottery Fund. However, a local charity set up to run the pier went bankrupt in November 2017. FoHP raised around \u00a3750,000 in crowdfunding and put in an offer to buy the pier on behalf of the community, but to local fury, administrators sold it to Gulzar in June last year for \u00a360,000, according to Land Registry documents. On a wintry day in Hastings, Peter Wheeler, the pier\u2019s former chief maintenance engineer, had a face as cloudy as the sky as he watched the wind and waves batter the structure. He and several other pier staff are taking legal action against Gulzar for constructive dismissal. \u201cAt the moment, there is no dedicated team available to work on Hastings pier. We had eyes on it every day, checking it, making sure bolts were tightened and things like that,\u201d Wheeler told the Guardian. He said \u201cmalevolent acts\u201d had been taking place on and under the pier. \u201cSomeone has been climbing up underneath and unscrewing the sewage pipe caps. We spotted it and replaced them, but two days later the caps were taken again. You\u2019d have to be pretty nimble to climb up the underneath. It\u2019s malevolent, not just a jolly jape.\u201d Wheeler insisted the pier needed constant maintenance, but accused Gulzar of closing it unnecessarily. \u201cThere\u2019s always maintenance to be done, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut the pier,\u201d he said. The local MP, Amber Rudd, has expressed concern over the sudden closure, but Peter Chowney, Hastings borough council leader, said the authority had no direct control over Hastings pier. \u201cIt is privately owned, and the owner is entitled to adopt whatever opening hours he wants to,\u201d Chowney told the Hastings &amp; St Leonard\u2019s Observer, adding that it was \u201cunfortunate that no prior notice was given\u201d and the closure \u201ccould have been handled better\u201d. Gulzar\u2019s spokesman, Brett McLean, told the Guardian the essential repairs included rewiring and he hoped the pier could be opened by mid-February. He said an engineering team based at Eastbourne was carrying out regular checks on the structure. At the weekend, pictures of engineers reportedly replacing a guard on one of the pier columns were published on the pier\u2019s Facebook page.

      "bodyText": "The Arsenal manager, Joe Montemurro, expressed his frustration at conceding two goals as Arsenal had to come from behind at Rush Green to beat West Ham 4-2. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we copped two goals,\u201d said Montemurro. \u201cThey were set pieces, goal-kicks, and we\u2019ve not had a problem with those all season but for some reason we got our shape wrong. It\u2019s crazy but that\u2019s football.\u201d Two goals from Dani\u00eblle van de Donk and a debut goal from Janni Arnth helped Arsenal make up for their defensive fragility to gain a second testing victory against the Hammers. And the manager was pleased with the performance of the Danish defender Arnth, who was handed her first start: \u201cIt was evident that she is an experienced defender. She controlled her area, her passing was fantastic, her final pass was fantastic and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d Arnth has been brought in along with Katrine Veje from Montpellier to help shore up a heavily depleted squad. \u201cIt\u2019s well-noted the number of players we\u2019ve got in rehab and coming back,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cI think they were all sitting in the grandstand. There were seven of them. That\u2019s a million-dollar bench there. It\u2019s crazy. They\u2019re all slowly coming back.\u201d The injury-hit Gunners\u2019 unbeaten run collapsed against their title rivals Manchester City at the start of December \u2013 their last league outing \u2013 and they needed a bright start.

Set up in the aftermath of the 2011 London riots by former Crystal Palace coach Harry Hudson, the initiative has so far helped 33 young players from some of London\u2019s most deprived areas earn professional contracts. But as well as rising stars like Aribo, Sunderland\u2019s Josh Maja and Manchester City youngster Yeboah Amankwah, who signed a professional contract at the Premier League champions last year, Hudson is just as proud of the hundreds of other boys that don\u2019t make the grade. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very careful that we don\u2019t sell dreams,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have been successful in producing professional footballers but we would never say to a boy: \u2018Come here and you will definitely make it.\u2019 You just don\u2019t know. There\u2019s so many factors involved but what is important is that their experiences broaden their horizons in general. You have to trust in the process.\u201d</p> <p>That is a lesson that Aribo can certainly relate to. Having progressed through Kinetic\u2019s youth sides, he was signed by former Wimbledon striker Marcus Gayle for non-league side Staines Town at the age of 19 before finally being snapped up by Charlton a year later. He has since become a regular first-team player at the Valley and has even been compared to Patrick Vieira and Dele Alli by former manager Karl Robinson.</p> <p>\u201cKinetic helped me a lot because I was really timid and shy when I first started coming here and they brought that out of me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve really developed as a player but as a person as well. I\u2019m always telling younger players that at one stage I was going to stop playing altogether, so I\u2019m really glad that I stuck at it.

Students are offered a full range of qualifications in partnership with nearby Woodcote School \u2013 from entry level BTec up to A-levels \u2013 while Hudson, 29, estimates that a series of community projects which also include a new netball scheme allows them to reach up to 700 young people a week in an area which has been blighted by knife crime in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the [2011] riots happened, we realised from working with some of the gangs how much impact you can have,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go to any estate in south London you will see people playing football. Our model takes a kind of carrot and stick approach: they want to play football and we can give the best chance possible to help them achieve that dream. In exchange, they have to complete their education and three hours of volunteering in their community if they are part of the programme. We try to have a relationship with young people where they trust us and we become positive role models for them. When they arrive, they want to be a pro. But we slowly start to open their eyes as to what else their talents can be used for to try and create positive change in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson estimates that more than 90% of his players come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with many having been released by professional clubs somewhere along the line. A partnership with local non-league side Croydon FC that allows young players the opportunity to prove themselves in senior football has also helped to attract prospective talent, as has Hudson\u2019s role as manager of Isthmian League South East Division side Whyteleafe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3901ff9bb05607bd32ad54dda06f9d1751e55d5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3901ff9bb05607bd32ad54dda06f9d1751e55d5b/126_108_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Maja, now of League One Sunderland, playing for Kinetic Academy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Maja, now of League One Sunderland, playing for Kinetic Academy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor every success story, there are another 10 to 15 young people who never get back into the system,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they all need additional support \u2013 they struggle quite a lot with their self-esteem because when a club releases them, there is no accountability for what happens next. I\u2019ve worked at five professional clubs and there is no follow-up procedure. It\u2019s simply: \u2018You\u2019re not right for us, good luck for the future.\u2019 It\u2019s organisations like ours that have to try and pick these players up.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson adds: \u201cUntil the age of 15, they build them up to believe they are going to be a professional player and surround them with all the materialistic elements which they unfortunately strive towards \u2013 the fast cars, nice clothes, jewellery \u2013 so they have that aspiration. The clubs often take them away from school at an early age to do day-release programmes, which really has a negative impact on the value a young person really applies to their education because they think: \u2018Well, if they are taking me out of school now, I don\u2019t need it.\u2019 When they are released at 15 with the aspirations for the highest earnings possible, the only options open to them are earning \u00a38 an hour stacking shelves in Sainsbury\u2019s or the gang environment, which ends up being more appealing to someone with those materialistic values. They think: \u2018Well I can earn 15 grand a year and never be able to drive a Mercedes or I can go and sell drugs and have all of that.\u2019 They are very impressionable and that is a root cause of many social problems.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/oct/10/next-generation-2018-20-of-the-best-talents-at-premier-league-clubs\">Next Generation 2018: 20 of the best talents at Premier League clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while delighted with the success of Aribo and that of Maja, who spent 18 months at Kinetic after he was released by Fulham at 15 and is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/josh-maja-sunderland-contract-extension-premier-league\" title=\"\">wanted by several Premier League clubs</a>, Hudson admits Kinetic actually lose money when a player joins a professional club because they rely heavily on funding from educational grants.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to work out how we alter that,\u201d he admits. \u201cAs a society as a whole, we often throw money at an issue to try and make things better but the fundamental thing is the relationship you have with these kids \u2013 you\u2019ve got a far better chance of actually reaching them if they trust you.

A partnership with local non-league side Croydon FC that allows young players the opportunity to prove themselves in senior football has also helped to attract prospective talent, as has Hudson\u2019s role as manager of Isthmian League South East Division side Whyteleafe. \u201cFor every success story, there are another 10 to 15 young people who never get back into the system,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they all need additional support \u2013 they struggle quite a lot with their self-esteem because when a club releases them, there is no accountability for what happens next. I\u2019ve worked at five professional clubs and there is no follow-up procedure. It\u2019s simply: \u2018You\u2019re not right for us, good luck for the future.\u2019 It\u2019s organisations like ours that have to try and pick these players up.\u201d Hudson adds: \u201cUntil the age of 15, they build them up to believe they are going to be a professional player and surround them with all the materialistic elements which they unfortunately strive towards \u2013 the fast cars, nice clothes, jewellery \u2013 so they have that aspiration. The clubs often take them away from school at an early age to do day-release programmes, which really has a negative impact on the value a young person really applies to their education because they think: \u2018Well, if they are taking me out of school now, I don\u2019t need it.\u2019 When they are released at 15 with the aspirations for the highest earnings possible, the only options open to them are earning \u00a38 an hour stacking shelves in Sainsbury\u2019s or the gang environment, which ends up being more appealing to someone with those materialistic values. They think: \u2018Well I can earn 15 grand a year and never be able to drive a Mercedes or I can go and sell drugs and have all of that.\u2019 They are very impressionable and that is a root cause of many social problems.\u201d But while delighted with the success of Aribo and that of Maja, who spent 18 months at Kinetic after he was released by Fulham at 15 and is now wanted by several Premier League clubs, Hudson admits Kinetic actually lose money when a player joins a professional club because they rely heavily on funding from educational grants. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work out how we alter that,\u201d he admits. \u201cAs a society as a whole, we often throw money at an issue to try and make things better but the fundamental thing is the relationship you have with these kids \u2013 you\u2019ve got a far better chance of actually reaching them if they trust you. The problem isn\u2019t knife crime \u2013 the problem is the social unrest and the outcome is the knife crime. We need to try to change that as a country as a whole.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Match report: Thanks for joining me today, and hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it. Do continue your footballing afternoon with Rob Smyth and Woking v Watford now; I\u2019ll be back later with Newport v Leicester. Bye! Couldn\u2019t argue with the result or margin in the end, with Arsenal completely dominating the second half after those scares in the first. They go three points clear. Over to you, Man City! 90+2 min: A late Arsenal sub, Little receiving warm applause as she comes off. Kuyken comes on. 90+1 min: We will have three added minutes, I believe. 89 min: Little is destined not to score! Van de Donk has all the time in the world to tee her up eight yards out and, in fairness, Spencer saves brilliantly. The corner is hacked away a bit desperately by Rafferty. Time is almost up. 87 min: Ross takes it, going for the hat-trick, but it\u2019s into the wall. 86 min: Lehmann, West Ham\u2019s best player, is in some pain after winning a free-kick in a dangerous position 25 yards out. She gets up and now this is a chance to get a shot in ... 85 min: Arsenal are still pressing and win *yet* another corner. It\u2019s worked short again and Mead is played in to tee up Arnth, who is unattended 12 yards out but clips over the bar. 83 min: Van de Donk wriggles her way into winning a free-kick about 30 yards out. But first Arsenal make the game\u2019s first change, Quinn replacing Evans. The set-piece is taken short and no serious danger results. 80 min: Now Lehmann is booked, too, as things get just a little niggly. 79 min: It\u2019s a slight surprise that Little is still on, I guess, but the gaps are there for Arsenal and the tempo isn\u2019t too high now so this is a nice comeback game for her. Rafferty, meanwhile, takes a ball in the face from Mead and although she\u2019ll be OK she needs a bit of attention. 77 min: Van de Donk is booked for a late one on Flaherty. She does have a spiky side to go with the knack for important goals. 75 min: West Ham show for the first time this half and almost make something of it, the dangerous Lehmann crossing to Ross from the right. This time, though, her shot is blocked. Then Little has a *glorious* chance to score after Spencer fumbles a cross from Arsenal\u2019s right flank. She\u2019s literally a yard out but can\u2019t sort her feet out and the ball somehow squirts wide! 73 min: Arsenal have total control of the ball here, and West Ham would probably like to get off with the deficit at two. I think they\u2019ve done well overall though and what this game has shown, in general, is that the mid-table sides in this division are far more competitive than they were - say \u2013 a decade ago. 70 min: Miedema can\u2019t quite lay on a chance for Walti and West Ham spirit the ball back to Spencer, who gets away with a rather scuffed clearance. 67 min: Arsenal could easily get another couple here. West Ham just haven\u2019t been in this half. A minor delay now though as Mead receives some treatment. I\u2019d fancy that is that. The source is familiar. Mead\u2019s corner from the left is well dealt with but the ball is returned to her. She yet again has time to swing a cross in and West Ham make two mistakes: Spencer comes out for a ball she can\u2019t get and nobody from the home side tracks the diminutive Van de Donk, who steals in to head into the vacant goal. 62 min: I\u2019d be very surprised, on the last 17 minutes\u2019 evidence, if West Ham can come back again but this has been a surprising enough game to make one reserve final judgment. It was starting to look a matter of time. McCabe\u2019s low first-time delivery from the left is deflected, leaves the West Ham defence rooted and runs all the way to Van de Donk at the far post. She makes no mistake, and that\u2019s her ninth goal of the WSL season. 57 min: Miedema tries to let a Van de Donk cross run onto her left foot and the ball squirms away from her. She\u2019s not been at her sharpest so far, several shooting opportunities having been passed up on, but she\u2019s the last person on the pitch you would write off. 55 min: And another Arsenal corner, but Flaherty nods it away and perhaps West Ham have learned from the first half\u2019s errors in that department. 54 min: Nearly a dream comeback for Little. An Evans centre is miscued to the back post by Miedema and Little, improvising, tries the backheel. Spencer has to bundle it behind from point blank range. The corner is well defended. 52 min: Bloodworth shoots well wide, but it\u2019s been all Arsenal since half-time. 50 min: Spencer is uncertain again, having to navigate her own defender Flaherty to claw away a Van de Donk cross. West Ham cannot afford to continue this sloppily. 48 min: Off the line! West Ham are again at sixes and sevens, Spencer fumbling a long ball forward and inviting the chip from Little, whose effort is sailing towards goal but headed away by a covering defender! 46 min: West Ham are a little lucky within seconds, presenting the ball to Miedema inside their own box \u2013 but neither she nor Little can get shots off. West Ham kick off. They\u2019re back out at Rush Green. Can we expect a second half of similar see-sawing drama? I\u2019ll be back for the second half shortly but, in the meantime, Rob Smyth has some buildup to the big men\u2019s FA Cup clash between Woking and Watford: Well, what a half! West Ham had a fine first 20 minutes and deserved the lead but were overrun for the next 20, conceding two identical goals and finding themselves at severe risk of going in with the game beyond them. But Arsenal\u2019s defence has looked wobbly: it was exposed again by the clinical Ross, right out of the blue, a few minutes ago and the second period is set up tantalisingly now. Out of nothing! It\u2019s a bit like West Ham\u2019s first, coming from a poorly defended long kick from Spencer. Visalli is allowed to head the ball on, completely uncontested, and sends Ross running in behind the defence. She sets herself and finishes superbly across Peyraud-Magnin and I, for one, did not see that coming. 42 min: More joy down the right for Arsenal brings their latest flag kick. Mead doesn\u2019t beat the first defender this time and West Ham are closer to being able to regroup at the break. 40 min: Evans makes a superb surge down the right and finds Miedema, who eventually works it across to Mead. She tries to curl into the far corner and it\u2019s deflected narrowly wide off Longhurst. Across she goes to take the corner and Arnth gets a head on that one too, but it\u2019s defended. 38 min: Rafferty puts it in from the right and it beats everybody, flying out to the left. It was a fine delivery and Flaherty wasn\u2019t too far from getting something on it. 37 min: Better from Lehmann, winning the ball back in Arsenal\u2019s half and gaining a throw-in. West Ham need to start getting up the pitch again \u2013 and they then earn their first corner ... 35 min: For West Ham, who have completely gone in the last 15 minutes, it is now a case of trying to stay in this until half-time. 33 min: That goal was coming but West Ham will be gutted that both Arsenal centre-backs have been allowed to score. Spencer was left rooted twice. It might be a long way back now. It\u2019s a carbon copy! Neat interplay between Little and Van de Donk brings Arsenal another corner. This time the goal comes directly from Mead\u2019s set-piece delivery \u2013 it\u2019s a superb, searching cross and this time it\u2019s right onto the head of the debutant Arnth, who plonks in an absolutely identical header to the one Williamson converted five minutes earlier! 29 min: Miedema fizzes one in from the right byline but nobody is waiting to convert and it\u2019s hacked away. They\u2019re currently attacking at will though. 27 min: And the turnaround is almost complete as Spencer has to save well at an angle from Miedema. West Ham need to sort this out at the moment; Arsenal have suddenly got a real grip on things. But West Ham can\u2019t defend that! Arsenal keep the ball after that corner and the centre-backs stay up. Mead collects it again on the right and, this time, nobody is really pressuring her. She has time to pick out the perfect cross for the defender Williamson, rising at the far post, to plant a fine header into the far corner. 25 min: Arsenal are getting better though, moving the ball more slickly and beating the press more often than they were. They get another corner and Mead\u2019s cross is well defended by the solid-looking Flaherty. 23 min: West Ham survive another little flurry and then get to slow the game down. They\u2019ll no doubt try and do that when necessary from now on. 20 min: Oh, you\u2019d have backed Miedema to put this away! She has the goal at her mercy after Van de Donk, collecting Miedema\u2019s original lay-off in acres of space on the right of the box, passes back across \u2013 but Flaherty dives in to block her shot from six yards. If she\u2019d got her shot away more quickly that was surely 1-1. That was Arsenal\u2019s first real opening, and it was a big one. 18 min: Mead wants a penalty again, this time after trying to turn Flaherty, but again she doesn\u2019t get one and again it\u2019s correct. It won\u2019t help Arsenal if they start getting frustrated. 17 min: Peyraud-Magnin stretches to claim a deep Percival cross. West Ham aren\u2019t sitting back; they seem to have noticed that Arsenal, with a new centre-back partnership of Williamson and Arnth, look unsteady. 15 min: Ross flicks Visalli away on the left but she can\u2019t find a cross. West Ham look good here but will want to ensure they don\u2019t concede a quick equaliser. 13 min: Miedema has a shot blocked by Hendrix as Arsenal look to respond. It\u2019s game on now though and, for the neutral, that early West Ham goal was exactly what the doctor ordered. Now then! A long clearance from Spencer completely evades Arsenal\u2019s defence and sends Lehmann away on the right. She still has plenty to do and, with players coming back, any ball across really has to be spot-on. But she finds the perfect centre for Ross, who sidefoots coolly into the corner! 11 min: Mead goes down under a fairly light challenge from Percival. No penalty, and rightly, but the Arsenal winger isn\u2019t especially happy and has a few words. 9 min: Walti wins Arsenal the game\u2019s first corner, out on the left flank. It\u2019s drilled in but Spencer claims it very well. 8 min: A lovely no-look backheel from Little in midfield gives a very nice early view of what she can do. 7 min: West Ham are certainly trying to pen Arsenal in, winning a throw-in near the corner flag just now. They\u2019ve made a good, solid beginning. 5 min: Trevor Brooking is watching in the stand. That\u2019s great to see \u2013 and hopefully he\u2019ll sprinkle a little stardust out there today, if it\u2019s needed. 4 min: It\u2019s a slow start though. I will stop banging on about the venue but it\u2019s wide open and doesn\u2019t really lend itself to an intense occasion, in my view. West Ham are pressing high, that said, and clearly want to stop their visitors playing from the back. 2 min: Van de Donk slices an early cross behind the goal. Arsenal will, I\u2019m sure, have most of the ball here. Arsenal, in light blue, start us off and kick left to right. Out come the teams! Kick-off will soon be upon us ... This match will take place at West Ham\u2019s training ground, which does have a small stand so it\u2019s not completely a case of everyone standing around the side of a pitch. But you\u2019d hope that in future they can play somewhere more suitable for top-level football: nobody\u2019s asking them to be playing at the London Stadium but in the long run they need a better facility. We kick off in the next eight or nine minutes, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the game \u2013 and indeed half-season \u2013 ahead before then. Send your emails and tweets to the addresses above! Today\u2019s other WSL games: Birmingham v Reading (2pm) Chelsea v Everton (2pm) Liverpool v Brighton (2pm) Bristol City v Manchester City (2pm) All eyes will be on the bottom one of those, no matter what transpires at West Ham shortly. It\u2019s so big for Arsenal to have Little back. She\u2019s one of the very best around and, given that they\u2019ve not long since lost another top star, Jordan Nobbs, for the long term it\u2019s brilliant news that she is back. For West Ham, the main danger will probably be the four-goal Alisha Lehmann. They also have some very familiar faces for Arsenal fans at the back: Gilly Flaherty spent a decade with the Gunners and Rebecca Spencer, the keeper, was similarly long-serving. West Ham: Spencer, Percival, Flaherty, Hendrix, Rafferty, Reichardt, Sampson, Longhurst, Lehmann, Ross, Visalli. Subs: Moorhouse, Simic, Kmita. Arsenal: Peyraud-Magnin; Evans, Williamson, Arnth, McCabe; Bloodworth, Walti, Little; Van de Donk, Miedema, Mead. Subs: Van Veenendaal, Quinn, Kuyken, Grant, Bailey-Gayle, Mitchell. The big news here is a timely return from long-term injury \u2013 a fractured fibula \u2013 for the outstanding Kim Little. There is also a place for the Denmark defender Janni Arnth, who Arsenal signed in November. Back to league action, then, and Arsenal have it all to do. You might remember that, in their last WSL outing a lifetime or so ago, they were turned over 2-0 by title rivals Manchester City - scuppering their 100% record and meaning the pair sit level on points at the top, albeit the Gunners have a game in hand. Joe Montemurro\u2019s side have been dealt a particularly unkind hand by injuries and it\u2019s absolutely vital they get back on the bike pronto. They ought to do that against West Ham, who sit mid-table, but the east London side are no mugs under Jack Sullivan Matt Beard and gave Arsenal a rattling good game in August, losing 4-3 away from home. So this has banana skin writ large on it. We could be in for a big afternoon in the title race so strap in, send over your thoughts and predictions, and stay tuned!",

      "body": "<p>Here, with Orson Welles and Spike Lee on the walls, and James Dean and Natalie Wood on the doors to the toilets, is where Robert De Niro might have died. In October, a pipe bomb addressed to the actor was sent to the New York warehouse where his film production company hugs an atrium dotted with vintage movie posters.</p> <p>A security guard found the suspicious package in the mailroom at 5am and police vehicles swarmed the Tribeca neighbourhood before dawn. De Niro got a call from security early that morning telling him the pipe bomb was being removed. \u201cNaturally you are concerned,\u201d he says phlegmatically. \u201cIt\u2019s just what it is. Just be careful.\u201d</p> <p>Cesar Sayoc, a bodybuilder, pizza deliveryman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/26/cesar-sayoc-who-is-he-pro-trump-pipe-bomb-suspect-criminal-record-party-affiliation\" title=\"\">fanatical supporter of Donald Trump</a>, was subsequently arrested in Florida and charged with sending a total of 13 pipe bombs to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other critics of the president. De Niro says only: \u201cThere are a lot of crazy people out there. Everybody\u2019s got their reasons.\u201d</p> <p>How did the double Oscar-winner find himself on a hit list alongside Obama and Clinton? The short answer is that De Niro has become one of the most colourful, pugnacious and unsubtle decriers of the Trump presidency.</p> <p>The late politicisation of De Niro is all the more remarkable because of his reputation as a man of few words, notorious for responding to journalists\u2019 questions with terse monosyllables. He stormed out of interviews with the BBC\u2019s Barry Norman \u2013 who rashly gave chase \u2013 and with the Radio Times, claiming he was being asked questions with a \u201cnegative inference\u201d. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/magazine/robert-de-niro.html\" title=\"\">mused in 1993</a>: \u201cNo one, perhaps, is better suited to being an actor and less suited to being a personality.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"720bc082a003a05aadf678159fe33acbca76e75e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/720bc082a003a05aadf678159fe33acbca76e75e/0_16_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"De Niro with Martin Scorsese on the set of Raging Bull.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Niro with Martin Scorsese on the set of Raging Bull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet when he greets the Guardian he is warm, generous with his time and even garrulous, at least on the subject of Trump. Wearing a black T-shirt, he relaxes into a chair in a personal office so full of memorabilia it resembles a Robert De Niro museum. He points out a photo of himself with Nelson Mandela, a Godfather poster signed by the cast and a prop from his upcoming film The Irishman, directed by his old friend Martin Scorsese. The brooding, saturnine artist has evolved into a genial grandfather. Perhaps it comes as a relief, at 75, to finally not be asked about himself, his method or whether his best work is behind him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m older now and I\u2019m just upset about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you see someone like [Trump] becoming president, I thought, well, OK, let\u2019s see what he does \u2013 maybe he\u2019ll change. But he just got worse. It showed me that he is a real racist. I thought maybe as a New Yorker he understands the diversity in the city but he\u2019s as bad as I thought he was before \u2013 and much worse. It\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s a bad thing in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who launched his political career by propagating conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s birthplace, has drawn moral equivalence between white nationalists and anti-fascist protesters and turned back the clock on racial diversity in the White House. De Niro, who has six mixed-race children, admits: \u201cYeah, I worry, and one of my kids is gay, and he worries about being treated a certain way. We talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>Like many white liberals, he says, he was \u201cnaive\u201d about Obama\u2019s two election wins and their implication of a post-racial America. \u201cI felt we were on a new thing. I didn\u2019t realise how against him certain people were \u2013 racially against him, offended that he was there.\u201d</p> <p>Would he call Trump a white supremacist? \u201cYes,\u201d De Niro says instantly. And what about a fascist? \u201cI guess that\u2019s what it leads to. If he had his way, we\u2019d wind up in a very bad state in this country. I mean, the way I understand it, they laughed at Hitler. They all look funny. Hitler looked funny, Mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What bothers me is that there will be people in the future who see him as an example but they\u2019ll be a lot smarter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat bothers me is that there will be people in the future who see him as an example and they\u2019ll be affected in some way, but they\u2019ll be a lot smarter and have many more colours to their personality and be more mercurial and become someone with the same values as he has but able to get much further and do more damage as a despot. That\u2019s my worry. There are people who look up to him: \u2018I want to be like him.\u2019 But they\u2019ll do it much better and they\u2019ll be more smart about it.\u201d</p> <p>De Niro is speaking just after Trump has described his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, as a \u201crat\u201d for cooperating with federal investigators, prompting news networks to play clips from some of the actor\u2019s greatest mobster hits, such as Goodfellas, The Godfather Part II and The Untouchables. He muses: \u201cI mean, a mob boss calls people \u2018a rat\u2019. That means you lied and somebody snitched on you, so you did commit the crime. So that\u2019s interesting and he makes mobsters look bad because there are mobsters who will shake your hand and keep their word. He can\u2019t even do that.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a con artist. He\u2019s a huckster. He\u2019s a scam artist. And what bothers me is that people don\u2019t see that. I think that The Apprentice had a lot to do with that, which I never saw but once, maybe. It\u2019s all smoke and mirrors, it\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpFDyKeqyA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hFpFDyKeqyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump and De Niro have some things in common. Both are entrepreneurs who own hotels and restaurants. Both are in their 70s. And both are New Yorkers who deliver blunt insults. But they have met just once, De Niro recalls, at a baseball game. They shook hands but that was it. \u201cI never had an interest in meeting him. He\u2019s a buffoon.\u201d De Niro would not go as far as banning Trump from one of the restaurants he owns but vows: \u201cIf he walked into a restaurant that I was in, I would leave. I would not want to be there.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, De Niro made a video in which he called Trump a punk, a pig and a dog, and said he would like to punch him in the face. Last June, at the Tony awards in New York, the actor took the stage and declared: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=eEqze64b-m0\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump!\u201d</a> The primal scream won a standing ovation. The president responded the next day on Twitter, calling De Niro a \u201clow IQ individual\u201d who had taken \u201ctoo many shots to the head\u201d.

This is what he\u2019s going to leave. This is his legacy. It\u2019s disgraceful. He\u2019s cynical, amoral, but he has a responsibility.

      "bodyText": "Here, with Orson Welles and Spike Lee on the walls, and James Dean and Natalie Wood on the doors to the toilets, is where Robert De Niro might have died. In October, a pipe bomb addressed to the actor was sent to the New York warehouse where his film production company hugs an atrium dotted with vintage movie posters. A security guard found the suspicious package in the mailroom at 5am and police vehicles swarmed the Tribeca neighbourhood before dawn. De Niro got a call from security early that morning telling him the pipe bomb was being removed. \u201cNaturally you are concerned,\u201d he says phlegmatically. \u201cIt\u2019s just what it is. Just be careful.\u201d Cesar Sayoc, a bodybuilder, pizza deliveryman and fanatical supporter of Donald Trump, was subsequently arrested in Florida and charged with sending a total of 13 pipe bombs to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other critics of the president. De Niro says only: \u201cThere are a lot of crazy people out there. Everybody\u2019s got their reasons.\u201d How did the double Oscar-winner find himself on a hit list alongside Obama and Clinton? The short answer is that De Niro has become one of the most colourful, pugnacious and unsubtle decriers of the Trump presidency. The late politicisation of De Niro is all the more remarkable because of his reputation as a man of few words, notorious for responding to journalists\u2019 questions with terse monosyllables. He stormed out of interviews with the BBC\u2019s Barry Norman \u2013 who rashly gave chase \u2013 and with the Radio Times, claiming he was being asked questions with a \u201cnegative inference\u201d. The New York Times mused in 1993: \u201cNo one, perhaps, is better suited to being an actor and less suited to being a personality.\u201d Yet when he greets the Guardian he is warm, generous with his time and even garrulous, at least on the subject of Trump. Wearing a black T-shirt, he relaxes into a chair in a personal office so full of memorabilia it resembles a Robert De Niro museum. He points out a photo of himself with Nelson Mandela, a Godfather poster signed by the cast and a prop from his upcoming film The Irishman, directed by his old friend Martin Scorsese. The brooding, saturnine artist has evolved into a genial grandfather. Perhaps it comes as a relief, at 75, to finally not be asked about himself, his method or whether his best work is behind him. \u201cI\u2019m older now and I\u2019m just upset about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you see someone like [Trump] becoming president, I thought, well, OK, let\u2019s see what he does \u2013 maybe he\u2019ll change. But he just got worse. It showed me that he is a real racist. I thought maybe as a New Yorker he understands the diversity in the city but he\u2019s as bad as I thought he was before \u2013 and much worse. It\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s a bad thing in this country.\u201d Trump, who launched his political career by propagating conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s birthplace, has drawn moral equivalence between white nationalists and anti-fascist protesters and turned back the clock on racial diversity in the White House. De Niro, who has six mixed-race children, admits: \u201cYeah, I worry, and one of my kids is gay, and he worries about being treated a certain way. We talk about it.\u201d Like many white liberals, he says, he was \u201cnaive\u201d about Obama\u2019s two election wins and their implication of a post-racial America. \u201cI felt we were on a new thing. I didn\u2019t realise how against him certain people were \u2013 racially against him, offended that he was there.\u201d Would he call Trump a white supremacist? \u201cYes,\u201d De Niro says instantly. And what about a fascist? \u201cI guess that\u2019s what it leads to. If he had his way, we\u2019d wind up in a very bad state in this country. I mean, the way I understand it, they laughed at Hitler. They all look funny. Hitler looked funny, Mussolini looked funny and other dictators and despots look funny. \u201cWhat bothers me is that there will be people in the future who see him as an example and they\u2019ll be affected in some way, but they\u2019ll be a lot smarter and have many more colours to their personality and be more mercurial and become someone with the same values as he has but able to get much further and do more damage as a despot. That\u2019s my worry. There are people who look up to him: \u2018I want to be like him.\u2019 But they\u2019ll do it much better and they\u2019ll be more smart about it.\u201d De Niro is speaking just after Trump has described his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, as a \u201crat\u201d for cooperating with federal investigators, prompting news networks to play clips from some of the actor\u2019s greatest mobster hits, such as Goodfellas, The Godfather Part II and The Untouchables. He muses: \u201cI mean, a mob boss calls people \u2018a rat\u2019. That means you lied and somebody snitched on you, so you did commit the crime. So that\u2019s interesting and he makes mobsters look bad because there are mobsters who will shake your hand and keep their word. He can\u2019t even do that. \u201cHe\u2019s a con artist. He\u2019s a huckster. He\u2019s a scam artist. And what bothers me is that people don\u2019t see that. I think that The Apprentice had a lot to do with that, which I never saw but once, maybe. It\u2019s all smoke and mirrors, it\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d Trump and De Niro have some things in common. Both are entrepreneurs who own hotels and restaurants. Both are in their 70s. And both are New Yorkers who deliver blunt insults. But they have met just once, De Niro recalls, at a baseball game. They shook hands but that was it. \u201cI never had an interest in meeting him. He\u2019s a buffoon.\u201d De Niro would not go as far as banning Trump from one of the restaurants he owns but vows: \u201cIf he walked into a restaurant that I was in, I would leave. I would not want to be there.\u201d In 2016, De Niro made a video in which he called Trump a punk, a pig and a dog, and said he would like to punch him in the face. Last June, at the Tony awards in New York, the actor took the stage and declared: \u201cI\u2019m gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump!\u201d The primal scream won a standing ovation. The president responded the next day on Twitter, calling De Niro a \u201clow IQ individual\u201d who had taken \u201ctoo many shots to the head\u201d. There were also voices who warned that such profanity-laced outbursts were counterproductive. Frank Bruni, a New York Times columnist, responded that anger is not a strategy and spewing four-letter words is falling into a trap. \u201cWhen you answer name-calling with name-calling and tantrums with tantrums, you\u2019re not resisting him,\u201d Bruni wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re mirroring him. You\u2019re not diminishing him. You\u2019re demeaning yourselves. Many voters don\u2019t hear your arguments or the facts, which are on your side. They just wince at the din.\u201d De Niro is aware of the criticism but is not entirely repentant. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again because that\u2019s not the way to get things done. [But] I felt that this is something I should say because it\u2019s basic. Trump is basic. He\u2019s just a guy who just thinks he can rattle off his mouth and say anything.

You\u2019ve got to stand up, you can\u2019t be so gentlemanly all the time because you\u2019ve just got to say: \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m nice to a point, then I\u2019ve got to push back.\u2019 \u201cYou have to fight fire with fire. You\u2019ve got to say: \u2018I\u2019m sorry \u2013 let\u2019s call a spade a spade. You are who you are and we\u2019ve got to confront you at your own game and that\u2019s what\u2019s needed.\u2019 You can do it in a nice way but you have to be hard and tough about it.\u201d Rightwing media seized on De Niro\u2019s Tonys outburst as a symbol of fancy New York and Hollywood elites who are out of touch with salt-of-the-earth folk in middle America (\u201cthe deplorables\u201d) and driven insane by their loathing of the president.

      "body": "<p>Here we go again. As we return, haggard and hungover, from the Christmas break, the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament. And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off. Prepare for a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/increasing-number-of-tory-mps-considering-no-deal-brexit-as-a-viable-plan-b_uk_5c2f6bbce4b0407e908ad874?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\" title=\"\">succession of Brexiteers</a> touting the idea of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/17/theresa-may-pushes-forward-2bn-no-deal-brexit-preparations\" title=\"\">managed no deal</a>\u201d as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no-deal outcome. They\u2019re wrong.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth tracing the \u201clogic\u201d deployed by proponents of this approach, because it has gone through three distinct stages.</p> <p>The first was to argue that no deal would be just fine for the UK, and that an immediate move to \u201cWTO [World Trade Organization] rules\u201d would not result in any new barriers to trade, because the EU would be obliged to recognise that the UK already complies with all EU regulatory standards. This zombie claim, made most notably by the <a href=\"https://www.economistsforfreetrade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Alternative-Brexit-Economic-Analysis-Final-2-Mar-18.pdf\" title=\"\">Economists for Free Trade</a>, has been <a href=\"https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/uktpo/2018/08/03/mamma-mia-here-we-go-again-equivalence-for-goods-regulation-in-the-chequers-proposal/\" title=\"\">debunked</a> by almost every UK trade expert.</p> <p>The EU intends to treat the UK as a third country \u2013 as is its right and, in some respects, its obligation \u2013 from day one. And our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/wto-brexit-trade-uk-economy\" title=\"\">much-vaunted WTO membership</a> will do little to mitigate this situation. Moreover, as Alex Stojanovic, a researcher at the thinktank the Institute of Government, has pointed out, the <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/uk-cant-rely-wto-rules-soften-blow-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">WTO makes no provision</a> for things such as truck drivers licensing, pilot certification, or transfer of data. In other words, the potential consequences of a \u201cchaotic\u201d Brexit go far beyond just the implications for trade and supply chains, but extend to medicines, transport and the status of EU citizens in the UK and that of Brits in the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Repeated assertions that the EU was bluffing, and would eventually back down, have proved to be just that \u2013 assertions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recognising this, the proponents of no deal have pivoted. Their new approach is a rebranding exercise \u2013 not simply \u201cno deal\u201d, still less \u201ccrashing out\u201d, but the far more cuddly sounding \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/02/preparing-no-deal-properly-will-get-good-brexit-democracy-demands/\" title=\"\">David Davis, for example, explains</a> that it is simply an \u201cillusion\u201d to suggest that no deal means, er, no deal. \u201cLeaving without a withdrawal agreement is not the same as leaving without agreements.\u201d</p> <p>But while the EU has indeed set out some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/17/brussels-plans-for-status-quo-in-few-key-sectors-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">contingency plans for no deal</a> \u2013 and it is true that those will enable us to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios \u2013 these are very different from the kind of side deals that Davis seems to envisage. They are distinctly one-sided, temporary, and intended to defend the EU against the worst of the disruption resulting from a no-deal outcome. And they leave important gaps.</p> <p>So, for instance, while they would allow point-to-point flying between UK and EU cities, as yet they provide no concessions on ownership rules. That means, for example, that International Airlines Group (which owns British Airways and Iberia) will have difficulties maintaining its EU licence. Equally, key areas such as medicines and data are simply not covered. And <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/11/16/eu-leaders-warn-britain-no-hope-renegotiating-brexit-deal/\" title=\"\">Michel Barnier has insisted</a> that mini-deals to supplement these basic plans are off the table.</p> <p>How to solve the Irish question in the event of no deal is perhaps the most glaring omission from the narratives spun by those who claim no deal is not something we should worry about. Showcasing his trademark disdain for detail, Mr Davis airily dismisses the notion that a no-deal outcome would require a border in Ireland \u2013 Shanker Singham says we won\u2019t need one, apparently. This argument is unlikely to reassure the 1,000 English and Scottish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/03/police-reinforcements-for-northern-ireland-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit-1000-officers-training-trouble-hard-border\" title=\"\">police officers who will be taken away from their day jobs</a> of actually fighting crime to be trained \u2013 at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland \u2013 for deployment in Northern Ireland in the case of Brexit-related disorder.</p> <p>The third leg of the no-deal argument, then, is not to claim that no deal will be easy or painless \u2013 but that it will be just as painful for the EU27, which will suffer disruption to their largest single trading partner and the massive hole in the EU budget that will result. The logic here is that some member states simply won\u2019t tolerate the minimalist arrangements being proposed. After all, around 13,000 Irish truckers use the UK as a land bridge to the EU, via the Channel Tunnel. The Spanish will be concerned about Iberia\u2019s rights. The French would not want long queues at Calais.</p> <p>If we just hold our nerve, then, up to and possibly even after 29 March, the EU27 will come to their senses and give us what we want \u2013 a stripped-down version of the withdrawal agreement that includes a two-year transition period, avoiding any immediate disruption, and which does not include the \u201cbackstop\u201d. Versions of this argument have been advanced both by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/12/02/need-hold-nerve-brexit-can-do-much-better-deal/\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> and, extraordinarily, by the leader of the House of Commons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/theresa-may-cabinet-collectively-focused-on-passing-brexit-deal\" title=\"\">Andrea Leadsom</a>.</p> <p>But this simply reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the UK\u2019s bargaining position. The EU insisted from the start on the withdrawal agreement as a precursor to talks on trade because member states identified as the priority issues the rights of EU citizens, the Brexit bill and the Irish border, and it was prepared to leverage the threat of no deal ruthlessly to ensure that.

      "bodyText": "Here we go again. As we return, haggard and hungover, from the Christmas break, the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament. And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off. Prepare for a succession of Brexiteers touting the idea of a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no-deal outcome. They\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s worth tracing the \u201clogic\u201d deployed by proponents of this approach, because it has gone through three distinct stages. The first was to argue that no deal would be just fine for the UK, and that an immediate move to \u201cWTO [World Trade Organization] rules\u201d would not result in any new barriers to trade, because the EU would be obliged to recognise that the UK already complies with all EU regulatory standards. This zombie claim, made most notably by the Economists for Free Trade, has been debunked by almost every UK trade expert. The EU intends to treat the UK as a third country \u2013 as is its right and, in some respects, its obligation \u2013 from day one. And our much-vaunted WTO membership will do little to mitigate this situation. Moreover, as Alex Stojanovic, a researcher at the thinktank the Institute of Government, has pointed out, the WTO makes no provision for things such as truck drivers licensing, pilot certification, or transfer of data. In other words, the potential consequences of a \u201cchaotic\u201d Brexit go far beyond just the implications for trade and supply chains, but extend to medicines, transport and the status of EU citizens in the UK and that of Brits in the EU. Recognising this, the proponents of no deal have pivoted. Their new approach is a rebranding exercise \u2013 not simply \u201cno deal\u201d, still less \u201ccrashing out\u201d, but the far more cuddly sounding \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d. David Davis, for example, explains that it is simply an \u201cillusion\u201d to suggest that no deal means, er, no deal. \u201cLeaving without a withdrawal agreement is not the same as leaving without agreements.\u201d But while the EU has indeed set out some contingency plans for no deal \u2013 and it is true that those will enable us to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios \u2013 these are very different from the kind of side deals that Davis seems to envisage. They are distinctly one-sided, temporary, and intended to defend the EU against the worst of the disruption resulting from a no-deal outcome. And they leave important gaps. So, for instance, while they would allow point-to-point flying between UK and EU cities, as yet they provide no concessions on ownership rules. That means, for example, that International Airlines Group (which owns British Airways and Iberia) will have difficulties maintaining its EU licence. Equally, key areas such as medicines and data are simply not covered. And Michel Barnier has insisted that mini-deals to supplement these basic plans are off the table. How to solve the Irish question in the event of no deal is perhaps the most glaring omission from the narratives spun by those who claim no deal is not something we should worry about. Showcasing his trademark disdain for detail, Mr Davis airily dismisses the notion that a no-deal outcome would require a border in Ireland \u2013 Shanker Singham says we won\u2019t need one, apparently. This argument is unlikely to reassure the 1,000 English and Scottish police officers who will be taken away from their day jobs of actually fighting crime to be trained \u2013 at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland \u2013 for deployment in Northern Ireland in the case of Brexit-related disorder. The third leg of the no-deal argument, then, is not to claim that no deal will be easy or painless \u2013 but that it will be just as painful for the EU27, which will suffer disruption to their largest single trading partner and the massive hole in the EU budget that will result. The logic here is that some member states simply won\u2019t tolerate the minimalist arrangements being proposed. After all, around 13,000 Irish truckers use the UK as a land bridge to the EU, via the Channel Tunnel. The Spanish will be concerned about Iberia\u2019s rights. The French would not want long queues at Calais. If we just hold our nerve, then, up to and possibly even after 29 March, the EU27 will come to their senses and give us what we want \u2013 a stripped-down version of the withdrawal agreement that includes a two-year transition period, avoiding any immediate disruption, and which does not include the \u201cbackstop\u201d. Versions of this argument have been advanced both by Boris Johnson and, extraordinarily, by the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom. But this simply reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the UK\u2019s bargaining position. The EU insisted from the start on the withdrawal agreement as a precursor to talks on trade because member states identified as the priority issues the rights of EU citizens, the Brexit bill and the Irish border, and it was prepared to leverage the threat of no deal ruthlessly to ensure that. Repeated assertions that the EU was somehow bluffing, and would eventually back down, have proved to be just that \u2013 assertions. It also speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of what article 50 is all about. For all its flaws \u2013 and there are more than enough of these to make one wonder why Lord Kerr is so keen to claim authorship \u2013 it provides a unique way of managing the passage from membership to non-membership. Not least, it allows for a transition period \u2013 basically a unique form of EU relationship with a third state \u2013 to be agreed by qualified majority vote. Should there be no withdrawal agreement, there would be no such mechanism to allow for a temporary new relationship to be agreed. Of course the EU has much to lose from no deal. But both sides know, and have known all along, who has more to lose. As we get closer to 29 March \u2013 and even more so, in the weeks after, as reality bites \u2013 our negotiating position becomes weaker, not stronger. Our basic choices and trade-offs will not have fundamentally changed \u2013 they will just have become even more constrained.

That was a very bad day at the office for Australia. </p> <p>Before the recriminations, credit has to first go to Jordan for preparing and executing a perfect gameplan to neutralise Graham Arnold\u2019s Socceroos. Defensively they were superb, denying Australia any space through the middle of the park and crowding out any crosses from wide areas. When they broke forward they broke dangerously and at speed. Khalil Bani Ateyah, Yasen Bakheet, and Mousa Suleiman were all superb, hassling and harrying and offering plenty of threat. </p> <p>By contrast Australia were sloppy and off the pace. In his postmatch interview captain Mark Milligan described the performance as \u201ca little lethargic, maybe with a few nerves.\u201d Trent Sainsbury looked uncertain in defence, Josh Risdon was replaced at half-time, Robbie Kruse shortly afterwards, while Jamie Maclaren made little impact as the starting No9. Set-pieces were poor, there were few attacking combinations, and everything was directed through the off colour Tom Rogic. </p> <p>Awer Mabil was perhaps the brightest spark, while both Chris Ikonomidis and Jackson Irvine made an impact off the bench. </p> <p>There is much for Graham Arnold and his coaching team to ponder.</p> <p>The match against Palestine on Friday is now a must-win and thoughts are already turning to the permutations of qualifying for the knockout phase and what might await Australia should they not progress as group winners. </p> <p>Thank you for your company tonight. Stay tuned for plenty more from the UAE.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcbc44d930638b20d936ba998bf636f81be9aaa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcbc44d930638b20d936ba998bf636f81be9aaa2/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan celebrate a famous Asian Cup victory over Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan celebrate a famous Asian Cup victory over Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T13:14:18.177Z\">at 1.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c31fb5ce4b0cebe76180efc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T12:58:17.036Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s your match report.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/06/socceroos-stunned-by-jordan-as-asian-cup-defence-gets-off-to-nightmare-start\">Socceroos stunned by Jordan as Asian Cup defence gets off to nightmare start</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c31fa9de4b02fb91ff0f2c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T12:56:08.897Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-Time: Australia 0-1 Jordan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The defending champions have been humbled.

Kick off from Hazza bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain is 10pm AEDT (3pm local time). </p> <p>According to Fifa\u2019s metrics this fixture pits the best side in the group against the worst but 41st ranked Australia will be wary of their 109th ranked opponents. Four times these sides have met in the past for two wins apiece, each victory arriving on home soil.<br></p> <p>Australia begin their campaign as defending champions but this is a much different outfit from the one that achieved such great heights four years ago. The coach has changed, so has the captain, and the Socceroos can no longer call on their greatest ever player, Tim Cahill, in case of emergency. </p> <p>Graham Arnold\u2019s tenure in the hot-seat has started promisingly but he approaches his first major tournament with no shortage of issues to address. The Socceroos\u2019 wait for a potent striker shows no sign of ending, key players are lacking minutes at club level, while injuries have robbed him of arguably his best player (Aaron Mooy) and his most exciting prospect (Daniel Arzani). The late loss of Martin Boyle and doubts over Matt Leckie and Tom Rogic have added to the less than ideal preparation. </p> <p>Despite these setbacks Arnold has quickly established a confident playing style and a quiet assurance among his group. He now gets to test his methods in the crucible of tournament football. </p> <p>This is the second match in the tournament following the UAE\u2019s last gasp draw against Bahrain in Group A yesterday. A reminder, if any were needed, that nothing can be taken for granted in international competition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d46bc5f405f01d0d214ca11f6462ecb9ce41e01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d46bc5f405f01d0d214ca11f6462ecb9ce41e01/0_0_2357_3000/786.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Arnold\u2019s fifth game in charge of Australia is the Asian Cup opener against Jordan.\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Arnold\u2019s fifth game in charge of Australia is the Asian Cup opener against Jordan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T11:05:39.731Z\">at 11.05am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Oh boy. That was a very bad day at the office for Australia. Before the recriminations, credit has to first go to Jordan for preparing and executing a perfect gameplan to neutralise Graham Arnold\u2019s Socceroos. Defensively they were superb, denying Australia any space through the middle of the park and crowding out any crosses from wide areas. When they broke forward they broke dangerously and at speed. Khalil Bani Ateyah, Yasen Bakheet, and Mousa Suleiman were all superb, hassling and harrying and offering plenty of threat. By contrast Australia were sloppy and off the pace. In his postmatch interview captain Mark Milligan described the performance as \u201ca little lethargic, maybe with a few nerves.\u201d Trent Sainsbury looked uncertain in defence, Josh Risdon was replaced at half-time, Robbie Kruse shortly afterwards, while Jamie Maclaren made little impact as the starting No9. Set-pieces were poor, there were few attacking combinations, and everything was directed through the off colour Tom Rogic. Awer Mabil was perhaps the brightest spark, while both Chris Ikonomidis and Jackson Irvine made an impact off the bench. There is much for Graham Arnold and his coaching team to ponder. The match against Palestine on Friday is now a must-win and thoughts are already turning to the permutations of qualifying for the knockout phase and what might await Australia should they not progress as group winners. Thank you for your company tonight. Stay tuned for plenty more from the UAE. Here\u2019s your match report. The defending champions have been humbled. Jordan are jubilant. What a start to this Asian Cup! 90+5 mins: Two final chances for Australia, first to Ikonomidis, then to Irvine but Shafi stands tall and repels both. With the ball in his clutches the final whistle blows. 90+5 mins: ... cleared by Jordan. 90+4 mins: Corner to Australia... 90+3 mins: It\u2019s all getting desperate and thoughtless for Australia. Jordan are milking every second off the clock that they can. They are on the cusp of a momentous and deserved victory. 90+2 mins: Ahmed Ersan almost seals it with a thrilling counterattacking run and shot that just clips the outside of Ryan\u2019s near post. 90+1 mins: Five minutes of injury time. 90 mins: Saeed Al Murjan now replaced by Ahmed Saleh. 89 mins: Cramp everywhere. Ahmad Ersan comes on for Yasen Bakheet. Tom Rogic smashes a speculative shot well wide. 87 mins: Maclaren has the ball in the net but the flag\u2019s up for offside. It was a poacher\u2019s finish following a penalty box scramble after some lovely interplay between Rogic and Mabil led to the Celtic star driving a shot against a forest of bodies. Replays show Maclaren was offisde by the smallest of margins. While Australia are still gathering their thoughts Jordan almost prosper with some old fashioned rout one bish bash bosh but after the flick-on from the goal kick the shot is straight at Ryan. 85 mins: Deep crosses from the right are the order of the day for Australia and the latest again finds Ikonomidis but he heads wide under pressure. 83 mins: Another excellent Grant cross causes mayhem in Jordan\u2019s box. Ikonomidis\u2019 header forces Shafi into a save before Australia appeal vociferously for a penalty for a high boot against Maclaren but again it\u2019s waved away. 82 mins: Excellent cross from deep from Grant, free header for Irvine just inside the box, but it dribbles harmlessly wide. 79 mins: Out of nowhere Mabil thrashes a shot against the post! Typical rope-a-dope from Jordan almost came back to haunt them as Mabil showed quick feet in the box, engineered half a yard of space and with little backlift unleashed a fierce piledriver that beat Shafi at his near post and cannoned back off the upright. All manner of Jordanian players are suffering cramp now. For Australian fans the next ten minutes is going to be hellish. 77 mins: Jordan\u2019s turn to appeal for a handball. Behich heading a clearance down onto his wrist. Another in the \u201cyou\u2019ve seen them given\u201d bracket but it would have been desperately harsh. 76 mins: It\u2019s all getting a bit predictable from Australia now, unable to find joy through the middle but lacking pace on the ball to engineer width either. With the freedom of space to counterattack Jordan always look dangerous. 73 mins: The sub is immediately in on goal too but it\u2019s a tame effort. The chance came about following a promising opportunity for Australia but Ikonomidis couldn\u2019t make the most of it in the box. Final sub from Arnold sees Jackson Irvine replace Luongo. 71 mins: Australia are trying to gamble with some one-touch stuff on the edge of the Jordanian box but the bounce just isn\u2019t favouring them. After a patient build up Behich eventually finds space down the left and whips a pull-back to the instep of Rogic at the top of the box but his effort lacks technique and spoons over the bar. Jordan remove the very tasty Al-Taamari with Baha Seif. 68 mins: Jordan down to ten men for the time being, inviting Australia to come at them. They do, but Rogic can\u2019t unpick the lock on a couple of occasions, Luongo has a penalty appeal turned down for being on the receiving end of a robust shoulder barge, and then the pressure is once again released with a foul in midfield. 67 mins: A rare sortie forward from Jordan ends with a stinging Saeed Murjan snapshot straight into Ryan\u2019s bread basket. He does himself a mischief stretching for the shot though and the stretcher is out to see him off the field. 66 mins: Australia are trying to shift Jordan\u2019s block from one side to the other but it is a well organised 6-4-0 block that is as defensively sound as Cheteshwar Pujara. 64 mins: It\u2019s been nearly all Australia this second half and they\u2019re turning the screw, camped on the edge of Jordan\u2019s box. A soft free-kick in midfield allows some respite though and the Socceroos have to rebuild from deep. 62 mins: Better delivery from Mabil from a free-kick not far from the corner flag but Jordan defend it well. Australia remain on the front foot though and Rogic eventually takes possession in time and space on the edge of the box but his powerful left foot shot is straight at Shafi. Probably the best chance of the night so far. 61 mins: Poor set-piece. The latest in a long line of poor set-pieces it has to be said. That was Mabil\u2019s fault for a wasteful delivery but even when he has delivered something tempting the support hasn\u2019t arrived in the box to convert. Again, Mooy\u2019s influence is being missed. 60 mins: Off the ball free-kick to Australia right on the corner of the penalty area down the left hand side. Inches from a penalty following an obstruction on Behich attempting to overlap. What can Mabil do with the delivery? 58 mins: A rare combination for Australia sees Milligan and Maclaren combine nicely but the ball doesn\u2019t drop kindly for Ikonomidis. Again, the ball to Maclaren was head high, which is far from the diminutive No9\u2019s forte. 57 mins: Yaseen Al-Bakhit again shows his quality down the left, turning Sainsbury inside out and earning a corner. Jordan in no hurry to take this, already milking the clock. When the set piece is eventually taken it\u2019s cleared by Australia before the scraps are wellied with serious venom over the bar. 55 mins: First substitution for Australia. The anonymous Kruse replaced by Ikonomidis. Kruse\u2019s starting place surely has to be under threat. 53 mins: Another corner, and again the first ball - which is decent - fails to hit an onrushing Australian. The second ball finds Behich outside the box but his dipping shot is always going over. From the goal kick Yaseen Al-Bakhit skins Grant down the left but his wicked cross doesn\u2019t find a red shirt. 52 mins: First corner of the half to Australia but it isn\u2019t threatening. They are pressurising Jordan in these early minutes of the second half though. 51 mins: Oooh, that was nasty from Al-Taamari, late on Behich near the corner flag, and he gets a deserved yellow card. This is a very Mooy game. 49 mins: Rogic ghosts past his marker 40m from goal, drifts forward and then drags his shot wide from distance. Promising signs early this half for the Socceroos. 48 mins: Grant has an instant impact, creating space on the right for Mabil to exploit and whip in a dangerous cross that Shafi palms into the danger zone but the ball falls kindly to a red shirt. 47 mins: Jordan\u2019s game is built around a very well-executed press. They\u2019re happy to concede possession in large parts of the field but when the ball reaches their key zones they are onto Australia in a flash. They are especially keen to deny Behich any room down the left. 46 mins: Daniel Garb is on the money. Australia begin the second half with Grant replacing Risdon at right-back. With the dirty mullet and scruffy facial hair he looks a Bintang singlet short of a backpacker. Very few bright sparks that half for Australia. Mabil the liveliest of any forwards, Rogic the most dangerous in midfield but it is a low ceiling. Kruse and Maclaren have both been anonymous while further back Sainsbury has looked shaky while Luongo was guilty of conceding a series of cheap turnovers. However, this doesn\u2019t look to be a problem simply to be solved by a couple of substitutions. Jordan\u2019s solidity down the spine and Australia\u2019s inability to even threaten to penetrate with 70% possession suggests a tactical rethink is also required. \u201cSainsbury seems to be lacking confidence the past 3-4 games. Maybe having to rid himself of some rustiness through lack of club match time?\u201d. Yep, looks like it Marzi De Santi. He has played well below his excellent best recently and would have no complaints if he is replaced by Milligan and more creativity introduced to midfield. Jordan take a well-earned lead into the interval. Australia up against it. Outplayed, outfought and outthought in that opening half. 45+2 mins: Nearing half-time and Australia still can\u2019t pass their way through Jordan. Hmmmm, I\u2019ve seen another angle of the penalty shout and I\u2019m now leaning towards a spot-kick. Not definitively, but, enough. 44 mins: Was that a handball? Australia cry for a penalty but their claims are waved away by the Omani offical. Replays show it\u2019s very much ball to hand, but the hand was trailing behind the defender as he put his body in a position to block a cross from the left. No pen for mine, but you see them given more often than not in the A-League, but that\u2019s another issue... 43 mins: Sasa Ognenovski is raving about Khalil Bani Attiah who has put in an almighty shift for Jordan. Much of what I\u2019ve described about Australia being unable to work the ball through midfield is down to that man. A display of old school defensive hassle and putting a foot in. 41 mins: Australia\u2019s passing lanes are non-existent, which is a compliment to Jordan defensively and an indictment of how the Socceroos have moved the ball. On the rare occasions a gold shirted forward finds possession he is immediately set upon by red clad enemies. 38 mins: That challenge on Luongo typifies Jordan\u2019s half. They are not giving an inch. Another Australian corner comes to nought, this time Mabil picking out Rogic but the Celtic man miscontrolled. He\u2019s then bundled over and in need of treatment (sorry Celtic fans). Replays show it\u2019s a rolled ankle after he trod on the foot of a Jordanian defender. He\u2019 a bit proppy. 36 mins: Delay in play while Luongo receives treatment for a drop of claret leaking out of the back of his head. He\u2019s been bandaged up a la Terry Butcher/Joel Selwood/a lazy fancy dress Mummy. They are playing as though he, or his ghost, is there. 35 mins: Rogic is struggling to find possession in dangerous areas so he\u2019s dropping deep to collect the ball. The consequence of that is an isolated Maclaren and little link-up play. This is not the fluid, roaming interchangeable forward line of recent friendlies. 32 mins: \u201cYou have to admire the intensity of Jordan,\u201d states Simon Hill on TV, and he\u2019s bang on. They\u2019ve suffocated Australia in midfield and the Jordanian front three look more than a match for Australia\u2019s back four. Plenty for Graham Arnold to ponder in terms of personnel and structure. 29 mins: Ryan magnificently tips a superb free-kick onto the crossbar! Australia are on the ropes here. 28 mins: This is not going to script for Australia at all. Yellow card for Sainsbury for hauling down Al-Taamari on the edge of the box after getting caught out of position - and not for the first time. Very dangerous shooting opportunity coming up for Abdel-Rahman. Bosh! Inswinging corner, big lad from the back gets up at the near post and thumps it into the net. Jordan delirious. 26 mins: There\u2019s a slight delay following a collision in the Jordanian box and it interrupts Australia\u2019s flow. Shortly after the restart Australia are - not for the first time - robbed in midfield and Jordan enjoy two or three phases of attacking play that culminates in a corner. 23 mins: Australia have started to assert themselves in the past few minutes, thanks largely to players breaking lines with the ball at their feet, first Rogic, then Luongo. When the QPR man threatens to reach a gallop he\u2019s brought down and from the resulting free-kick Shafi once again races off his line to punch the ball away with two clenched fists and both feet off the ground. That really has been the defining image of the game so far. 20 mins: This is the least dynamic performance so far under Arnold. There isn\u2019t any forward momentum, the outcome often long diagonals from deep hoping for second ball scraps. Rogic is putting himself about though, which is encouraging. Another Mabil corner is theatrically punched clear. 18 mins: Rogic puts in a superb chase and tackle to halt a Jordanian counterattack. From the resulting move Risdon has time to deliver a cross from the right and despite being nowhere near his intended target it causes Shafi some nervous moments at his far post. 15 mins: Sainsbury is manhandled by Khalil Bani Attiah at a long throw and Jordan have another shot on goal, but it\u2019s a tame one across the face. Again Australia struggle to clear the midfield block in transition, the Socceroos sloppy heading forward and Jordan keen as mustard steeping in to break up play. 13 mins: Jordan have their tails up, snapping into tackles in midfield and hassling forward whenever an opportunity presents. Australia respond well though, Mabil slipping behind the Jordanian defence and unleashing a snapshot with his left foot that Shafi keeps out smartly at his near post. After a lacklustre opening ten minutes this game is coming to the boil nicely. 12 mins: First shot of the day comes from Yousef Al-Rawashdeh and it\u2019s a rasping drive from outside the box that Ryan has to be alert to keep out. The chance originated from sloppy play by Luongo. 10 mins: First moment of real intent from the Jordanians and it\u2019s the dangerous Musa Al-Taamari hustling and bustling down the right, but he\u2019s outnumbered by the time he reaches the penalty area. 8 mins: Kruse earns a corner that is acrobatically punched clear by Amer Shafi. That was reminiscent of a Hollywood stuntman, flying full length forward and two-fisting the ball miles. 6 mins: Luongo commits a foul on halfway that later in the game would likely result in a yellow card. From there Jordan mount a tepid attack that allows Australia to transition into attack quickly from the back and look threatening in the process. When the ball is moved more slowly and structured there\u2019s less penetration, and that\u2019s how Jordan have set up, to allow Australia as much time on the ball as they like in their own half. 4 mins: First chance for Risdon to get free down the right and whip a cross in but it\u2019s cleared easily by Jordan. The right proves fertile ground for Australia a few seconds later with first Maclaren then Mabil doing well. The latter runs at pace into space but runs out of ideas and momentum before a chance can be fashioned. 2 mins: Quiet start from both sides. Australia dominating possession but lacking an obvious release ball from defence. One long diagonal was aimed towards Maclaren but as we are all now well aware, that is not his game. Australia\u2019s Asian Cup defence is underway! The referee tonight is Ahmed Al-Kaf. He is from Oman. Anthem time. A good chance to admire the vast empty spaces in the Hazza bin Zayed Stadium. The teams are waiting in the tunnel, Australia top to toe in gold, Jordan a block of red. Last preview link before we settle into the action, and it\u2019s from me, when I temporarily dispensed with my Socceroos commemorative supporter wear (TM) to try to gauge the potential of this Asian Cup in providing a unifying moment for football in Australia. The conclusion wasn\u2019t overly optimistic. Logistics are far from conducive to unifying the country. 10pm AEDT is the most family friendly kick-off time during the tournament with matches at the business end of proceedings taking place in the witching hours. Add to that, all the action from the United Arab Emirates is exclusively on pay TV.\u201d This is the first of three Asian Cup matches today/tonight. Elsewhere in Australia\u2019s Group B Syria will start as favourites against Palestine, while in Group A Thailand will be looking to seize top spot when they take on India. Staying up late? Losing the will to keep your eyelids open? Have a giggle at Chris Sutton\u2019s expense courtesy of David Squires. Graham Arnold has just spoken on the telly. On the late injury-enforced change from Nabbout to Maclaren up front:\u201cNot disruptive at all. Every player who trains knows their role. We\u2019ve got some great depth and go into this game confident.\u201d On preparations so far: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great camp in Dubai, the game against Oman was fantastic and the boys are in great spirits. We\u2019re excited.\u201d And finally, on what to expect from the performance against Jordan: \u201cWe\u2019ll press high and suffocate the life out of them in their half.\u201d Superb looking stadium. Not expecting a packed house for today\u2019s contest though. The lack of a potent striker has hampered Australia for a number of years and it\u2019s a obstacle faced by the current squad, writes Stephen Ganavas. In the absence of Tim Cahill, Australia have a lot of potential goal-scorers but none of them are sufficiently proven at international level. Graham Arnold will need to find at least one amongst his 23-man squad should the Socceroos harbour hopes of going back-to-back at the Asian Cup.\u201d Australia\u2019s group looks straightforward on paper but John Duerden has identified some pitfalls. Of the three Group B opponents lined up in the United Arab Emirates in January, only Palestine present something of a novelty to a nation now in its tweens as a member of the Asian football family. Jordan and Syria were met along the road to Russia 2018 with mixed results and it is the latter that presents the greatest threat to the Socceroos finishing top of the group.\u201d Let\u2019s start our prematch warm-up by looking at some of the Asian Cup preview content elsewhere on the site, starting with John Davidson\u2019s upbeat analysis of the early months of Graham Arnold\u2019s tenure. So far, so good. For all the complaining that came from many sections of Australian football when Graham Arnold was confirmed as the new Socceroos head coach before the 2018 World Cup, on the field Arnold\u2019s side has yet to miss a beat.\u201d Jamie Maclaren gets the nod up front, thanks in part to yet another injury, this time to Andrew Nabbout who tweaked his groin in training yesterday. Alongside him Awer Mabil starts ahead of Chris Ikonomidis while in defence Josh Risdon has held off Rhyan Grant\u2019s challenge at right-back. The Socceroos will line-up in a familiar 4-3-3 formation although with Maclaren starting through the middle the ambition of operating with an interchangeable front three might have to be shelved. Further back Arnold has opted for experience with a midfield trio of Mark Milligan, Massimo Luongo and Tom Rogic. The skipper\u2019s place in midfield means Trent Sainsbury and Milos Degenek will form the central defensive pairing. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Australia\u2019s opening match in the 2019 Asian Cup as they take on Group B rivals Jordan. Kick off from Hazza bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain is 10pm AEDT (3pm local time). According to Fifa\u2019s metrics this fixture pits the best side in the group against the worst but 41st ranked Australia will be wary of their 109th ranked opponents. Four times these sides have met in the past for two wins apiece, each victory arriving on home soil. Australia begin their campaign as defending champions but this is a much different outfit from the one that achieved such great heights four years ago. The coach has changed, so has the captain, and the Socceroos can no longer call on their greatest ever player, Tim Cahill, in case of emergency. Graham Arnold\u2019s tenure in the hot-seat has started promisingly but he approaches his first major tournament with no shortage of issues to address. The Socceroos\u2019 wait for a potent striker shows no sign of ending, key players are lacking minutes at club level, while injuries have robbed him of arguably his best player (Aaron Mooy) and his most exciting prospect (Daniel Arzani). The late loss of Martin Boyle and doubts over Matt Leckie and Tom Rogic have added to the less than ideal preparation. Despite these setbacks Arnold has quickly established a confident playing style and a quiet assurance among his group. He now gets to test his methods in the crucible of tournament football. This is the second match in the tournament following the UAE\u2019s last gasp draw against Bahrain in Group A yesterday. A reminder, if any were needed, that nothing can be taken for granted in international competition.",

He said each year his firm arranged 50-60 sabbaticals lasting a month a month and five-10 lasting 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way to restart or refresh your life,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ezon said many of his clients booking long sabbaticals were entrepreneurs who had sold their businesses and were looking for a proper break. \u201cIt is often tech guys who have floated or sold their companies and are thinking \u2018I have a two-year non-compete clause, what am I going to do with my time?\u2019 For others it is often when their kids are about to go on to college or high school, and they suddenly think \u2018I need to really be spending time with them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A US executive living in Mexico, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he was setting off on a seven-month sabbatical with his wife and two children next month. The family are planning on driving from Punta Arenas, at the very southerly tip of Chile, back to their home in Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve shipped our vehicle down to the very south of Chile, and fitted it out for an extreme adventure, with a tent on the roof and full suspension,\u201d he said. First the family will head to Antarctica, before driving up the Andes, stopping off to trek to Machu Picchu in Peru and to dive the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife and I decided that we had to do this now, to spend some intensive time with our kids before it was too late,\u201d he said. \u201cMy eldest is about to turn 13 and the youngest is nearly 10.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kids will miss more than half a year\u2019s schooling.

Our experts put pins in where they thought some of the best options were and we put a list of suggestions to the family.\u201d He said the super-rich often take their families on sabbatical in order to show them \u201chow real people live\u201d and to learn the power and importance of money. \u201cThey want their children to see some real life, but in a safe and secure way,\u201d he said. In the US, the number of super-rich sabbaticals had \u201cgrown exponentially in the last couple of years\u201d, said Jack Ezon, the president of Ovation Travel Group in New York. He said each year his firm arranged 50-60 sabbaticals lasting a month a month and five-10 lasting 12 months. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to restart or refresh your life,\u201d he said. Ezon said many of his clients booking long sabbaticals were entrepreneurs who had sold their businesses and were looking for a proper break. \u201cIt is often tech guys who have floated or sold their companies and are thinking \u2018I have a two-year non-compete clause, what am I going to do with my time?\u2019 For others it is often when their kids are about to go on to college or high school, and they suddenly think \u2018I need to really be spending time with them.\u2019\u201d A US executive living in Mexico, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he was setting off on a seven-month sabbatical with his wife and two children next month. The family are planning on driving from Punta Arenas, at the very southerly tip of Chile, back to their home in Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019ve shipped our vehicle down to the very south of Chile, and fitted it out for an extreme adventure, with a tent on the roof and full suspension,\u201d he said. First the family will head to Antarctica, before driving up the Andes, stopping off to trek to Machu Picchu in Peru and to dive the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. \u201cMy wife and I decided that we had to do this now, to spend some intensive time with our kids before it was too late,\u201d he said. \u201cMy eldest is about to turn 13 and the youngest is nearly 10.\u201d The kids will miss more than half a year\u2019s schooling. The executive and his wife, who both have experience teaching, plan to home school or \u2013 \u201cvan school\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 the children. Children\u2019s education is often a stumbling block in people\u2019s sabbatical plans, but there are a number of ways around the problem if you have the money, said Ezon. \u201cWe have a roster of teachers and retired teachers that we can suggest to families to take with them on their trips,\u201d he said. He said long trips can easily become very expensive, but \u201cthese are very, very wealthy people and they can afford it. It could be a couple of million dollars to take your family around the world with a teacher in tow.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For the US it was a wake-up call. Convinced that it was a world leader in the knowledge economy, the US was shaken out of its complacency when its communist rival announced a breakthrough in space exploration.</p> <p>More than six decades separates the launch in 1957 by the Soviet Union of Sputnik \u2013 the first artificial satellite \u2013 and China\u2019s success last week in being the first country to land a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/03/china-probe-change-4-land-far-side-moon-basin-crater\">spacecraft on the far side of the moon</a>, but the same question is posed by the two events: is US economic hegemony at risk?</p> <p>In the late 1950s the answer was no, although many Americans thought otherwise. Congress declared a national education emergency, federal funding for science was tripled and President Dwight Eisenhower paved the way for the Apollo moon landings by setting up the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \u2013 better known as Nasa.</p> <p>Eventually, the US stopped panicking. The Soviet Union had a good, basic education system, excellent scientists, and was globally competitive in some specific manufacturing sectors but its command economy was incapable of delivering the living standards enjoyed in the capitalist west. Economic sluggishness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jul/14/soviet-union-collapse-in-pictures\">brought about its collapse</a> little more than 30 years after the launch of Sputnik.</p> <p>China poses a much more realistic threat. For a start, it has posted four decades of staggeringly high growth, which has resulted in rapid improvements in living standards and victory in the battle against extreme poverty.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the caricature of China as a country that just makes cheap goods for the west is out of date. In some areas of the digital economy \u2013 e-commerce and mobile payments for example \u2013 China is a world leader. The authorities in Beijing have ambitious plans for artificial intelligence and the use of big data.</p> <p>While the US still leads the way in the knowledge economy, China comes second in terms of research and development spending and, mindful of the pollution affecting its cities, has been investing impressively large sums into green technologies.</p> <p>China has also developed in its own way. Liberalisation has been slow and careful. The state is firmly in charge of economic management. The overall approach is top down, authoritarian and target driven. One reason that the country is making progress in big data is that little heed is paid to the rights of the individual to privacy when collecting information.</p> <p>Sooner or later China was bound to lock horns with the US. It is a fast-growing country; it wants to compete in cutting-edge technologies; it has a rival ideology; and, despite regular predictions of impending doom, it shows no sign of a Soviet Union-style collapse. Washington has long seen Beijing as an economic, political and military rival, but it has taken the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House to bring those fears to the surface. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/05/china-economy-slowdown-us-tariffs-trade-war\">The tit-for-tat tariff war</a> launched by the US last year is about far more than trade.</p> <p>China badly wants to de-escalate the tension. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/china-slowing-economy-and-inequality-force-new-priorities-for-rulers\">Its economy has clearly been slowing </a>and it is only able to hit official growth targets of 6%-plus by counting wasteful investment.

      "bodyText": "For the US it was a wake-up call. Convinced that it was a world leader in the knowledge economy, the US was shaken out of its complacency when its communist rival announced a breakthrough in space exploration. More than six decades separates the launch in 1957 by the Soviet Union of Sputnik \u2013 the first artificial satellite \u2013 and China\u2019s success last week in being the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, but the same question is posed by the two events: is US economic hegemony at risk? In the late 1950s the answer was no, although many Americans thought otherwise. Congress declared a national education emergency, federal funding for science was tripled and President Dwight Eisenhower paved the way for the Apollo moon landings by setting up the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \u2013 better known as Nasa. Eventually, the US stopped panicking. The Soviet Union had a good, basic education system, excellent scientists, and was globally competitive in some specific manufacturing sectors but its command economy was incapable of delivering the living standards enjoyed in the capitalist west. Economic sluggishness brought about its collapse little more than 30 years after the launch of Sputnik. China poses a much more realistic threat. For a start, it has posted four decades of staggeringly high growth, which has resulted in rapid improvements in living standards and victory in the battle against extreme poverty. What\u2019s more, the caricature of China as a country that just makes cheap goods for the west is out of date. In some areas of the digital economy \u2013 e-commerce and mobile payments for example \u2013 China is a world leader. The authorities in Beijing have ambitious plans for artificial intelligence and the use of big data. While the US still leads the way in the knowledge economy, China comes second in terms of research and development spending and, mindful of the pollution affecting its cities, has been investing impressively large sums into green technologies. China has also developed in its own way. Liberalisation has been slow and careful. The state is firmly in charge of economic management. The overall approach is top down, authoritarian and target driven. One reason that the country is making progress in big data is that little heed is paid to the rights of the individual to privacy when collecting information. Sooner or later China was bound to lock horns with the US. It is a fast-growing country; it wants to compete in cutting-edge technologies; it has a rival ideology; and, despite regular predictions of impending doom, it shows no sign of a Soviet Union-style collapse. Washington has long seen Beijing as an economic, political and military rival, but it has taken the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House to bring those fears to the surface. The tit-for-tat tariff war launched by the US last year is about far more than trade. China badly wants to de-escalate the tension. Its economy has clearly been slowing and it is only able to hit official growth targets of 6%-plus by counting wasteful investment. Stripped of the creative accounting, the economy\u2019s trend growth rate is around 3%. The aim is to steer the economy away from its dependency on investment and exports, but this is proving hard to achieve. China\u2019s fast growth over the past four decades has been based on moving the population out of low-productivity jobs in agriculture into higher productivity jobs in manufacturing \u2013 a process that can only happen once and is now over. Transition to a consumer-led, service-driven economy requires some short-term pain: unprofitable enterprises going bust, factories closing down and unemployment rising. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s strongman leader, certainly does not want his authoritarian rule threatened by economic and social unrest, so every time growth slows down Beijing tightens political control while simultaneously using lower interest rates, easier credit, tax cuts and higher public investment to boost growth. This helps stabilise the economy but at the cost of keeping alive an economic model that the authorities know has to change. In his book on China*, the economist George Magnus questions whether it is possible for a one-party state like China to make the switch from an economy where the government makes all the key decisions to one that encourages the development of new ideas. \u201cBehind a wall of censorship, a surveillance state is developing rapidly that may be very effective at gathering information but also quite stifling in terms of creativity and disruption \u2013 phenomena in which the west has traditionally enjoyed strong advantages.\u201d The monetary stimulus provided in 2018 had little effect and exports growth is sagging as a result of slower global growth and US protectionism.

      "body": "<p>My partner\u2019s mother, Miranda Beavis, who has died aged 83, was a probation officer and sculptor.</p> <p>During her first marriage, to the Guardian editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/04/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Alastair Hetherington</a>, she was an important source of advice and support to him \u2013 an intelligent, liberal-minded sounding board. \u201cThere were few others to whom I could talk candidly,\u201d he recalled. \u201cMiranda was vital in maintaining a sensible perspective.\u201d</p> <p>She was born in Manchester, the daughter of two academics at the university \u2013 Richard Oliver, professor of education, and Anna White, a lecturer in English. She attended Howell\u2019s school in Denbigh, north Wales, and then studied history and English at Newnham College, Cambridge.</p> <p>While at university, Miranda secured a holiday job in the cuttings library of the Manchester Guardian. There she met Hetherington, the paper\u2019s foreign editor, who soon afterwards, in 1956, became editor. Plunged almost immediately into the Suez crisis, Hetherington caused much controversy by taking a strong editorial line against the Eden government\u2019s military action in Egypt. The novice editor would later relate how Miranda gave him much moral support during a \u201cstrenuous and anxious time\u201d.</p> <p>As soon as Miranda graduated the following summer, they married. Dorothy Macmillan, the wife of Harold Macmillan, the new prime minister, spotted their wedding photograph in the Guardian and invited them to No 10.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a happy lunch,\u201d Hetherington later wrote. \u201cMiranda, extremely good-looking and with a sharp mind, was a hit with Harold Macmillan.\u201d Partly as a result, Hetherington re-established amicable relations with Downing Street.</p> <p>In the early years of their marriage, Miranda spent much of her time with their four children in Manchester, while the Guardian moved its base to London in the early 1960s. It meant much commuting for Alastair.</p> <p>The Hetheringtons moved permanently to London in 1964, and bought a house in Blackheath. Miranda would play hostess to influential dinner guests, who often included senior politicians, and they also held huge parties for Guardian staff, which spread out on to Blackheath itself, and involved football matches that lasted many hours.</p> <p>Miranda got involved in several causes, including a charity for prisoners\u2019 wives, and completed a course in social work at Goldsmiths\u2019 College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). When Alastair retired from the Guardian in 1975, and moved to become controller of BBC Scotland, she chose to stay in London.</p> <p>Alastair\u2019s absences, late nights and interrupted weekends had taken their toll. And Miranda sought a career of her own. \u201cThat I understood,\u201d Alastair remarked poignantly in his memoirs, \u201cthough I would not have accepted the BBC offer if I had known that she might not come north.\u201d They divorced in 1978.</p> <p>Miranda went to work for the Probation Service. Having started with a probation officer\u2019s usual workload with convicted criminals, she later served as a court welfare officer, dealing with custody disputes and difficult criminal cases. Eventually, after breaks to care for her elderly parents, Miranda gave up probation work to concentrate on her passion for sculpture. She was successful enough to sell some of her work and received several special commissions.</p> <p>In 1982 Miranda married John Beavis, a fellow probation officer. They enjoyed gardening and the theatre together.</p> <p>He died in 2008. Miranda is survived by her children, Tom, Alex, Lucy and Mary, five granddaughters and five grandsons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My partner\u2019s mother, Miranda Beavis, who has died aged 83, was a probation officer and sculptor. During her first marriage, to the Guardian editor Alastair Hetherington, she was an important source of advice and support to him \u2013 an intelligent, liberal-minded sounding board. \u201cThere were few others to whom I could talk candidly,\u201d he recalled. \u201cMiranda was vital in maintaining a sensible perspective.\u201d She was born in Manchester, the daughter of two academics at the university \u2013 Richard Oliver, professor of education, and Anna White, a lecturer in English. She attended Howell\u2019s school in Denbigh, north Wales, and then studied history and English at Newnham College, Cambridge. While at university, Miranda secured a holiday job in the cuttings library of the Manchester Guardian. There she met Hetherington, the paper\u2019s foreign editor, who soon afterwards, in 1956, became editor. Plunged almost immediately into the Suez crisis, Hetherington caused much controversy by taking a strong editorial line against the Eden government\u2019s military action in Egypt. The novice editor would later relate how Miranda gave him much moral support during a \u201cstrenuous and anxious time\u201d. As soon as Miranda graduated the following summer, they married. Dorothy Macmillan, the wife of Harold Macmillan, the new prime minister, spotted their wedding photograph in the Guardian and invited them to No 10. \u201cIt was a happy lunch,\u201d Hetherington later wrote. \u201cMiranda, extremely good-looking and with a sharp mind, was a hit with Harold Macmillan.\u201d Partly as a result, Hetherington re-established amicable relations with Downing Street. In the early years of their marriage, Miranda spent much of her time with their four children in Manchester, while the Guardian moved its base to London in the early 1960s. It meant much commuting for Alastair. The Hetheringtons moved permanently to London in 1964, and bought a house in Blackheath. Miranda would play hostess to influential dinner guests, who often included senior politicians, and they also held huge parties for Guardian staff, which spread out on to Blackheath itself, and involved football matches that lasted many hours. Miranda got involved in several causes, including a charity for prisoners\u2019 wives, and completed a course in social work at Goldsmiths\u2019 College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). When Alastair retired from the Guardian in 1975, and moved to become controller of BBC Scotland, she chose to stay in London. Alastair\u2019s absences, late nights and interrupted weekends had taken their toll. And Miranda sought a career of her own. \u201cThat I understood,\u201d Alastair remarked poignantly in his memoirs, \u201cthough I would not have accepted the BBC offer if I had known that she might not come north.\u201d They divorced in 1978. Miranda went to work for the Probation Service. Having started with a probation officer\u2019s usual workload with convicted criminals, she later served as a court welfare officer, dealing with custody disputes and difficult criminal cases. Eventually, after breaks to care for her elderly parents, Miranda gave up probation work to concentrate on her passion for sculpture. She was successful enough to sell some of her work and received several special commissions. In 1982 Miranda married John Beavis, a fellow probation officer. They enjoyed gardening and the theatre together. He died in 2008. Miranda is survived by her children, Tom, Alex, Lucy and Mary, five granddaughters and five grandsons.",

Unless work on a tunnel under a railway and a new roundabout starts within a year or so costs will increase enormously. The trust must raise \u00a31m by the end of this year in a campaign led by the actor and canals supporter David Suchet: it has just passed \u00a3530,000.</p> <p>\u2022 Taking the next step on one of the most daunting challenges faced by any of the nation\u2019s restoration projects, the <a href=\"https://cotswoldcanals.com/missing-mile-work-starts-at-westfield-lock/\" title=\"\">Missing Mile</a> on the Cotswold canals, a stretch that was more or less obliterated when the M5 was built.

It should be finished by 2023, bringing Stroud back on to the national network.</p> <p>The IWA\u2019s report aims to change the attitude of funders, politicians, government departments, local authorities, restoration groups and even health professionals. As well as the economic and environmental benefits of canals, it will stress the effects on health, a point made by <a href=\"https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/walking/walking-for-health\" title=\"\">Philippa Moreton</a>, a retired doctor who advised many of her patients to take towpath walks in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, where she worked.</p> <p>Moreton said: \u201cRegular exercise in a beautiful, peaceful natural environment with water has an added bonus. It gives a sense of wellbeing, reduces stress and helps depression. Walking beside a canal not only helps patients with diabetes, hypertension, lung disease and arthritis but also patients with mental health problems.\u201d</p> <p>The report will recommend focusing on micro-projects rather than the entire length of a canal.

It\u2019s quite likely that even the bosses of any ministry don\u2019t actually understand that it\u2019s a major issue. They just think it\u2019s dozens of little local issues and don\u2019t spot that they\u2019re joined up.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this lack of political will, Britain\u2019s canals have had their advocates. In the 1960s, the Queen Mother and the transport minister, Barbara Castle, were among those who spoke up for canals at a time when the attitude of many, especially in local politics, was that they were dirty, dangerous and of no value.</p> <p>John Dodwell, who has been active in restoring the waterways since 1961 and who chairs the Montgomery Canal Partnership, said that a 1970 conference in Oxford on the urban future of canals \u201cwas instrumental in turning the tide with town planners and highway engineers\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe need something similar now, especially with road builders.\u201d Dodwell welcomed the IWA report and pointed out that there were no national planning guidelines covering the restoration of canals.</p> <p>One of the best examples of a self-contained, landlocked restoration that has improved life is in Stroud. The Cotswold canals restoration, a big project that will eventually reconnect the Severn and the Thames, has been heavily supported for 10 years by Stroud district council.</p> <p>Several miles have been reopened, and the council has moved its offices to Ebley Mill, which was a moribund part of town a few years ago. David Marshall, the council\u2019s canal project manager, said: \u201cThe canal used to be a place to avoid \u2013 rubbish, derelict, broken locks \u2013 and now it\u2019s a place to come to. What we\u2019ve done so far stands on its own two feet.\u201d</p> <p>The Cotswold project has more than 7,000 members, more than any other canal trust. Palmer, whose main aim is to generate more externally-funded projects on the waterways, said: \u201cWe want more people to be involved in the waterways.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of our report is to show that you don\u2019t need to fully restore a canal in order to gain all the benefits. If you start with a small piece of restoration and plan it well you will get the benefits right from day one. It might be restoring a kilometre here, restoring a canalside warehouse that becomes a community centre. A lot of people just want somewhere safe to walk, or a cycle path. And when people see one kilometre restored they want the next, and the next\u2026\u201d</p> <p>One day it will be possible, as it was 150 years ago, to travel by inland waterways from Littlehampton in West Sussex to the Lake District. By road, on a good day, that would take six hours. At the more sedate pace of the canals, where the speed limit is 4mph, it would take weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4258f80a0cb1bc68333687ab029f78d4f1bf4435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4258f80a0cb1bc68333687ab029f78d4f1bf4435/0_195_2900_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prunella Scales and Timothy West\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prunella Scales and Timothy West enjoy life in the slow lane on Great Canal Journeys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what\u2019s the rush?

In his hugely popular and still in-print 1944 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1777335.Narrow_Boat\" title=\"\">Narrow Boat</a></em>, he said that canal travel \u201cseemed to me to fulfil in the fullest sense the meaning of travel as opposed to a mere blind hurrying from place to place\u201d.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cTo step down from some busy thoroughfare on to the quiet towpath of a canal, even in the heart of a town, is to step backward a hundred years or more and to see things in a different, and perhaps more balanced, perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Fiona and Emma Wright could not agree more.</p>",

There are long-running disputes with road builders and planners in Swindon; on the route of the abandoned Berkshire and Wiltshire canal; on the new Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway; and on the Lichfield and Hatherton canal. \u201cEverybody is struggling with planning permission, with highway crossings, with water abstraction rights,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cThis report will say to the government, to the Environment Agency, \u2018you need to do better on this\u2019. It\u2019s quite likely that even the bosses of any ministry don\u2019t actually understand that it\u2019s a major issue. They just think it\u2019s dozens of little local issues and don\u2019t spot that they\u2019re joined up.\u201d Despite this lack of political will, Britain\u2019s canals have had their advocates. In the 1960s, the Queen Mother and the transport minister, Barbara Castle, were among those who spoke up for canals at a time when the attitude of many, especially in local politics, was that they were dirty, dangerous and of no value. John Dodwell, who has been active in restoring the waterways since 1961 and who chairs the Montgomery Canal Partnership, said that a 1970 conference in Oxford on the urban future of canals \u201cwas instrumental in turning the tide with town planners and highway engineers\u201d. He said: \u201cWe need something similar now, especially with road builders.\u201d Dodwell welcomed the IWA report and pointed out that there were no national planning guidelines covering the restoration of canals. One of the best examples of a self-contained, landlocked restoration that has improved life is in Stroud. The Cotswold canals restoration, a big project that will eventually reconnect the Severn and the Thames, has been heavily supported for 10 years by Stroud district council. Several miles have been reopened, and the council has moved its offices to Ebley Mill, which was a moribund part of town a few years ago. David Marshall, the council\u2019s canal project manager, said: \u201cThe canal used to be a place to avoid \u2013 rubbish, derelict, broken locks \u2013 and now it\u2019s a place to come to. What we\u2019ve done so far stands on its own two feet.\u201d The Cotswold project has more than 7,000 members, more than any other canal trust. Palmer, whose main aim is to generate more externally-funded projects on the waterways, said: \u201cWe want more people to be involved in the waterways. \u201cThe purpose of our report is to show that you don\u2019t need to fully restore a canal in order to gain all the benefits. If you start with a small piece of restoration and plan it well you will get the benefits right from day one. It might be restoring a kilometre here, restoring a canalside warehouse that becomes a community centre. A lot of people just want somewhere safe to walk, or a cycle path. And when people see one kilometre restored they want the next, and the next\u2026\u201d One day it will be possible, as it was 150 years ago, to travel by inland waterways from Littlehampton in West Sussex to the Lake District. By road, on a good day, that would take six hours. At the more sedate pace of the canals, where the speed limit is 4mph, it would take weeks. But what\u2019s the rush? The yearning for a slower life, revealed to millions of television viewers by Timothy West and Prunella Scales in the nine series of Channel 4\u2019s Great Canal Journeys, is one of the big attractions of the inland waterways. The most popular writer on canals was Tom Rolt, the godfather of canal restoration who helped found the IWA. In his hugely popular and still in-print 1944 book, Narrow Boat, he said that canal travel \u201cseemed to me to fulfil in the fullest sense the meaning of travel as opposed to a mere blind hurrying from place to place\u201d. He wrote: \u201cTo step down from some busy thoroughfare on to the quiet towpath of a canal, even in the heart of a town, is to step backward a hundred years or more and to see things in a different, and perhaps more balanced, perspective.\u201d Fiona and Emma Wright could not agree more.",

The findings also emerge after recent Islamic State-linked attacks in Strasbourg and Morocco and as British police continue to investigate a possible motive behind the New Year\u2019s Eve stabbings in Manchester. Using ethnographic fieldwork and psychological surveys, researchers identified 535 young Muslim men in and around Barcelona, the Spanish city where in 2017 Isis supporters killed 13 and wounded about 100 people in the Las Ramblas district. Of those identified, 38 second-generation Moroccan-origin men, who had \u201cexpressed a willingness to engage in or facilitate violence associated with jihadist causes\u201d, agreed to have their brains scanned. The results showed a striking effect when they were socially excluded by Spaniards while playing a virtual simulation called Cyberball, a ball toss game with three other players who abruptly stopped throwing them the ball. Later scans showed that the neurological impact of being excluded meant that when issues were raised that the individual had not previously considered inviolable \u2013 such as introducing Islamic teaching in schools or unrestricted construction of mosques \u2013 they became far more important and were deemed similar to \u201csacred\u201d and worth fighting for.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 2016, Sharon Van Etten was in a happy but productive lull; touring for her roundly feted fourth album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/sharon-van-etten-are-we-there-review\" title=\"\">Are We There</a></em>, had finally come to a close and she was now in her studio space in Brooklyn, muddling out the beginnings of its successor and working on the score for Katherine Dieckmann\u2019s indie film <em>Strange Weather</em>. She had recently made her acting debut in the Netflix series <em>The OA</em>, and in the autumn would begin studies to become a mental health counsellor. And then she discovered she was pregnant.</p> <p>Her latest album, <em>Remind Me Tomorrow</em>, starts with an opening drone and a strike of slightly sour keys, a sound familiar to anyone who has followed Van Etten\u2019s work since her 2009 debut, <em>Because I Was in Love</em>, and on through <em>Epic</em> and <em>Tramp</em> and <em>Are We There</em>. Across those albums she revealed a voice of lugubrious beauty, and made an art form of songs that were emotionally and musically raw. It was a combination that earned her a fanbase that was not just devoted but deeply and near-spiritually connected to her music. And so her fifth album is one of the year\u2019s most ardently anticipated \u2013 her return awaited by fans and critics alike, and its teaser single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4mewwymxbI\" title=\"\">Comeback Kid</a>, seized upon and analysed upon its release late last year.</p> <p>A faster, firmer and more boisterous record, Comeback Kid confused some listeners: is this, they wondered, a new Sharon Van Etten? It\u2019s a question also raised by the second note on the album\u2019s opening track: bowling off toward somewhere brighter and more hopeful, a prefigurement of the songs to follow, which are punchier and more immediate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wasn\u2019t proud of my country in 2016, but Trump doesn\u2019t represent me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Van Etten attributes some of this new musical vim to a reaction to writing Dieckmann\u2019s score, a guitar-led and spacious work designed to be something akin to Ry Cooder\u2019s soundtrack for <em>Paris, Texas</em>. \u201cWhenever I got to a frustrating point in the writing process where I felt like I was banging my head against the wall, I would just put down the guitar and play anything else to clear my head, like a palate cleanse,\u201d she recalls. She found she gravitated towards unfamiliar sounds and instruments, towards synthesisers and keyboards, particularly the Jupiter-4 synth owned by her studiomate, the actor Michael Cera. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I started a lot of these songs, with a drone and a beat and I would sing over it. Just so I could clear my head.\u201d</p> <p>However the new energy of these songs also owes much to the impact of parenthood: the structured routine of nap times and feeding, the sense of days being shorter and more precious. \u201cBefore I had so much time and I was living for myself,\u201d she says when we meet over coffee in east London. \u201cEverything was open-ended and there was still a lot unresolved, but now I just feel like I have to finish. And I kind of like that it\u2019s about being an adult and making choices and being decisive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6856baa39b607ae28968853751cbc1aa71b6cfd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6856baa39b607ae28968853751cbc1aa71b6cfd0/0_51_2368_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Van Etten onstage in Austin in October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Van Etten on stage in Austin, Texas, in October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since mid-2016 the wider world has also changed considerably \u2013 there was then no Trump in the White House, no talk of border walls, no walking back of legislation on abortion, climate change, healthcare. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t seem as scary at the time,\u201d Van Etten says. \u201cI remember I was alone on election day when I was pregnant, and I was sitting there crying. It\u2019s a dark time. I\u2019m not proud of our country for all that, but he doesn\u2019t represent me.\u201d She gave herself a small pep talk: \u201cI said: \u2018My job right now [will be] to make my kid feel safe and to be a positive role model and to rise above that.\u2019\u201d She has come to feel the most valuable contribution she can make is close to home. \u201cIt\u2019s about the micro and the day-to-day and who you are and the little small acts of kindness, and that is what my son will remember.\u201d</p> <p>Van Etten\u2019s son is not yet two, and still learning to talk. This is her first trip away from him, and she beams as she talks about him \u2013 how the first thing he identified was a dog, how \u201che can say \u2018cool\u2019 and he can point to the guitar and he\u2019ll say, \u2018Guh!\u2019\u201d How excited he gets when she takes out records, how confusing it is for him when he hears her songs played on the radio. How on mornings at home she will start the day by asking her son if he would like to listen to some music. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll just bounce up and down,\u201d she jiggles in her seat. \u201cOr if it\u2019s slow morning rising, he\u2019ll walk over to the piano and pull himself on the bench and just start playing.\u201d</p> <p>If Van Etten\u2019s music was marked by its vulnerability, there seems to be a new kind of candour that comes with romantic commitment, becoming a parent, a 34-hour labour. She nods. \u201cThere\u2019s letting someone in for the first time, and acknowledging that\u2019s the person you want to be with the rest of your life. Looking at our child every day and it\u2019s some of our love that we\u2019re eventually going to let roam the world. I feel like every day I\u2019m at my most vulnerable. Even when he\u2019s just hanging out, I swear, I sometimes just spontaneously start crying just looking at him.\u201d</p> <p>When Van Etten began these songs in the summer of 2016, she was concerned with their music rather than the lyrics. The words came later, after the birth of her son, and she noticed then how this fundamental shift in her life, in her understanding of love and commitment, had also altered the meaning of her songs. \u201cThe song Stay was talking to my man, saying \u2018I know you\u2019re gonna stay no matter what, I\u2019m gonna stay, you\u2019re gonna stay, we\u2019re here for each other even when it gets hard,\u2019\u201d she says. Later she saw it was about more than just romantic tribute. \u201cI put on headphones and I\u2019m listening to the demo whilst staring at my sleeping child and I realised that it\u2019s also about that thing now. So it\u2019s a weird time portal.\u201d</p> <p>It was motherhood, too, that allowed her to be open to the idea of bringing in a producer rather than controlling every element of the record herself. She chose John Congleton, known for his work with St Vincent, John Grant and Angel Olsen, who lit up when she walked into his studio with a selection of influences that might seem surprising to those steeped in Van Etten\u2019s previous work \u2014 Portishead, Suicide, Nick Cave. \u201cI was ready to let go of these songs,\u201d she explains. \u201cI feel a lot of falling in love and settling down and becoming a mother, so much you can\u2019t control, you have to let go. And I feel like the more I let go and trust other people to do the things I need to do, the better off I am and the more I progress as a human being. As soon as I let go, I just feel that I open up as a person.\u201d</p> <p>Working with a producer also allowed Van Etten to focus on her role as a singer. Though here too she recognised a shift \u2014 her vocal range had changed due to the process of giving birth. \u201cAfter thirty-four hours of labour I had to have a C-section, and so I didn\u2019t have any [abdominal] muscle,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to strengthen up again and I found singing more mid to low range was actually easier, the high ones are harder.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4etGf2PJcA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W4etGf2PJcA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4etGf2PJcA\">Watch the video for Jupiter-4 by Sharon Van Etten.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her life has not always been so open or so contented. In 1998, when she was 17, she became embroiled in a turbulent and deeply damaging relationship, which stifled her musical ambitions and her sense of self \u2013 an experience to which she has returned several times in her songs.</p> <p>\u201cHe was an addict and abusive and so I just never knew who I would be coming home to,\u201d she explains. A touring musician, her boyfriend would often be away for long stretches, and Van Etten used those periods of absence to work on her own songs. \u201cI would play when he wasn\u2019t around because he thought my songs were too personal to share,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich, in hindsight, they were, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m that kind of person and just let it out. But he asked me not to play until I could write in a way where people wouldn\u2019t know about our life.\u201d When her boyfriend discovered she had been secretly playing shows, he smashed up her new Gibson guitar.</p> <p>But still she stayed for five years. \u201cI was lost,\u201d she says. Van Etten had also drifted out of contact with her family, who did not agree with her lifestyle. \u201cAnd I was also really proud and I didn\u2019t want to accept help from anybody,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I was self-sufficient, supporting myself, working at a venue and making it work. I was embarrassed.\u201d</p> <p>At a particularly low point, she called her old high\u2011school boyfriend. \u201cI was just feeling really lost and I didn\u2019t know who I was and I realised that because of this relationship, because I was cut off from my family, that my memory was going. I didn\u2019t remember what I used to be like.\u201d</p> <p>The old high-school boyfriend\u2019s phone went to voicemail. \u201cAnd I just left this really long, probably crazy message saying: \u2018I just don\u2019t know who I am right now. I just want to hear a story about who I used to be so I can get back to myself again.\u2019 And the next day his girlfriend called and she was like, \u2018Honestly, he played me the message and he wants you to be well, but he doesn\u2019t really know how to talk about that kind of stuff. But if you ever want to talk, just know that I\u2019m here. I know you don\u2019t know me very well, but call me.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b57c74d52cebe9ea90207ea2e9ea9991c099db89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57c74d52cebe9ea90207ea2e9ea9991c099db89/0_377_3400_4249/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Van Etten\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Why is it that people connect so deeply with music?\u2019 Sharon Van Etten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while Van Etten and her ex\u2019s girlfriend had a friendship she kept secret from her current boyfriend. \u201cI would go for these walks and I would just chainsmoke and we would talk on the phone and she would recommend me writers.

I wasn\u2019t an intellectual. I didn\u2019t absorb information very well. Tests gave me anxiety, and I just couldn\u2019t find myself. I wasn\u2019t great at anything and the only thing I was really good at I didn\u2019t know how to do.

They think they know who they are but they have no idea. Then they go to a strange new place to define themselves around people that don\u2019t know themselves either.\u201d It is such a strange time in a person\u2019s life, she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so easy to see once you\u2019ve been through it. That\u2019s the age when, if I had had someone that I could talk to, maybe [I would] not have gone through what I did.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut no regrets,\u201d she says, and for a moment she sits at the cafe table, a ball of wisdom and contentment and openness, aware that all that she went through has led her to here.</p> <p><em>Remind Me Tomorrow is released via Jagjaguwar on 18 January</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 2016, Sharon Van Etten was in a happy but productive lull; touring for her roundly feted fourth album, Are We There, had finally come to a close and she was now in her studio space in Brooklyn, muddling out the beginnings of its successor and working on the score for Katherine Dieckmann\u2019s indie film Strange Weather. She had recently made her acting debut in the Netflix series The OA, and in the autumn would begin studies to become a mental health counsellor. And then she discovered she was pregnant. Her latest album, Remind Me Tomorrow, starts with an opening drone and a strike of slightly sour keys, a sound familiar to anyone who has followed Van Etten\u2019s work since her 2009 debut, Because I Was in Love, and on through Epic and Tramp and Are We There. Across those albums she revealed a voice of lugubrious beauty, and made an art form of songs that were emotionally and musically raw. It was a combination that earned her a fanbase that was not just devoted but deeply and near-spiritually connected to her music. And so her fifth album is one of the year\u2019s most ardently anticipated \u2013 her return awaited by fans and critics alike, and its teaser single, Comeback Kid, seized upon and analysed upon its release late last year. A faster, firmer and more boisterous record, Comeback Kid confused some listeners: is this, they wondered, a new Sharon Van Etten? It\u2019s a question also raised by the second note on the album\u2019s opening track: bowling off toward somewhere brighter and more hopeful, a prefigurement of the songs to follow, which are punchier and more immediate. Van Etten attributes some of this new musical vim to a reaction to writing Dieckmann\u2019s score, a guitar-led and spacious work designed to be something akin to Ry Cooder\u2019s soundtrack for Paris, Texas. \u201cWhenever I got to a frustrating point in the writing process where I felt like I was banging my head against the wall, I would just put down the guitar and play anything else to clear my head, like a palate cleanse,\u201d she recalls. She found she gravitated towards unfamiliar sounds and instruments, towards synthesisers and keyboards, particularly the Jupiter-4 synth owned by her studiomate, the actor Michael Cera. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I started a lot of these songs, with a drone and a beat and I would sing over it. Just so I could clear my head.\u201d However the new energy of these songs also owes much to the impact of parenthood: the structured routine of nap times and feeding, the sense of days being shorter and more precious. \u201cBefore I had so much time and I was living for myself,\u201d she says when we meet over coffee in east London. \u201cEverything was open-ended and there was still a lot unresolved, but now I just feel like I have to finish. And I kind of like that it\u2019s about being an adult and making choices and being decisive.\u201d Since mid-2016 the wider world has also changed considerably \u2013 there was then no Trump in the White House, no talk of border walls, no walking back of legislation on abortion, climate change, healthcare. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t seem as scary at the time,\u201d Van Etten says. \u201cI remember I was alone on election day when I was pregnant, and I was sitting there crying. It\u2019s a dark time. I\u2019m not proud of our country for all that, but he doesn\u2019t represent me.\u201d She gave herself a small pep talk: \u201cI said: \u2018My job right now [will be] to make my kid feel safe and to be a positive role model and to rise above that.\u2019\u201d She has come to feel the most valuable contribution she can make is close to home. \u201cIt\u2019s about the micro and the day-to-day and who you are and the little small acts of kindness, and that is what my son will remember.\u201d Van Etten\u2019s son is not yet two, and still learning to talk. This is her first trip away from him, and she beams as she talks about him \u2013 how the first thing he identified was a dog, how \u201che can say \u2018cool\u2019 and he can point to the guitar and he\u2019ll say, \u2018Guh!\u2019\u201d How excited he gets when she takes out records, how confusing it is for him when he hears her songs played on the radio. How on mornings at home she will start the day by asking her son if he would like to listen to some music. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll just bounce up and down,\u201d she jiggles in her seat. \u201cOr if it\u2019s slow morning rising, he\u2019ll walk over to the piano and pull himself on the bench and just start playing.\u201d If Van Etten\u2019s music was marked by its vulnerability, there seems to be a new kind of candour that comes with romantic commitment, becoming a parent, a 34-hour labour. She nods. \u201cThere\u2019s letting someone in for the first time, and acknowledging that\u2019s the person you want to be with the rest of your life. Looking at our child every day and it\u2019s some of our love that we\u2019re eventually going to let roam the world. I feel like every day I\u2019m at my most vulnerable. Even when he\u2019s just hanging out, I swear, I sometimes just spontaneously start crying just looking at him.\u201d When Van Etten began these songs in the summer of 2016, she was concerned with their music rather than the lyrics. The words came later, after the birth of her son, and she noticed then how this fundamental shift in her life, in her understanding of love and commitment, had also altered the meaning of her songs. \u201cThe song Stay was talking to my man, saying \u2018I know you\u2019re gonna stay no matter what, I\u2019m gonna stay, you\u2019re gonna stay, we\u2019re here for each other even when it gets hard,\u2019\u201d she says. Later she saw it was about more than just romantic tribute. \u201cI put on headphones and I\u2019m listening to the demo whilst staring at my sleeping child and I realised that it\u2019s also about that thing now. So it\u2019s a weird time portal.\u201d It was motherhood, too, that allowed her to be open to the idea of bringing in a producer rather than controlling every element of the record herself. She chose John Congleton, known for his work with St Vincent, John Grant and Angel Olsen, who lit up when she walked into his studio with a selection of influences that might seem surprising to those steeped in Van Etten\u2019s previous work \u2014 Portishead, Suicide, Nick Cave. \u201cI was ready to let go of these songs,\u201d she explains. \u201cI feel a lot of falling in love and settling down and becoming a mother, so much you can\u2019t control, you have to let go. And I feel like the more I let go and trust other people to do the things I need to do, the better off I am and the more I progress as a human being. As soon as I let go, I just feel that I open up as a person.\u201d Working with a producer also allowed Van Etten to focus on her role as a singer. Though here too she recognised a shift \u2014 her vocal range had changed due to the process of giving birth. \u201cAfter thirty-four hours of labour I had to have a C-section, and so I didn\u2019t have any [abdominal] muscle,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to strengthen up again and I found singing more mid to low range was actually easier, the high ones are harder.\u201d Her life has not always been so open or so contented. In 1998, when she was 17, she became embroiled in a turbulent and deeply damaging relationship, which stifled her musical ambitions and her sense of self \u2013 an experience to which she has returned several times in her songs. \u201cHe was an addict and abusive and so I just never knew who I would be coming home to,\u201d she explains. A touring musician, her boyfriend would often be away for long stretches, and Van Etten used those periods of absence to work on her own songs. \u201cI would play when he wasn\u2019t around because he thought my songs were too personal to share,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich, in hindsight, they were, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m that kind of person and just let it out. But he asked me not to play until I could write in a way where people wouldn\u2019t know about our life.\u201d When her boyfriend discovered she had been secretly playing shows, he smashed up her new Gibson guitar. But still she stayed for five years. \u201cI was lost,\u201d she says. Van Etten had also drifted out of contact with her family, who did not agree with her lifestyle. \u201cAnd I was also really proud and I didn\u2019t want to accept help from anybody,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I was self-sufficient, supporting myself, working at a venue and making it work. I was embarrassed.\u201d At a particularly low point, she called her old high\u2011school boyfriend. \u201cI was just feeling really lost and I didn\u2019t know who I was and I realised that because of this relationship, because I was cut off from my family, that my memory was going.

But if you ever want to talk, just know that I\u2019m here. I know you don\u2019t know me very well, but call me.\u2019\u201d For a while Van Etten and her ex\u2019s girlfriend had a friendship she kept secret from her current boyfriend. \u201cI would go for these walks and I would just chainsmoke and we would talk on the phone and she would recommend me writers. She encouraged me to write more and read more and to reach out to my sister. She was just like: \u2018Get the fuck out of there.\u2019\u201d Van Etten called her sister. \u201cAnd no questions asked, she said: \u2018I\u2019ll book the first flight I can afford.\u2019 On the day that her boyfriend was next heading off on tour, Van Etten put all of her clothes into a duffel bag and pretended she was going to the laundromat.

It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s refreshing. It\u2019s futuristic. She can really sing and, boy, can she dance. You feel like you are watching a music legend being formed before your eyes.

I watched the lion one the other day. I knew nothing about the set-up of prides, where the leader of the pack is a female; it was fascinating to watch. I couldn\u2019t believe that the lions were being poisoned by humans because there was no space for them to graze their cows. It\u2019s hard to watch sometimes, but it\u2019s so important.

And so are your elderly Brexit-voting racist relatives. They are also thicker than eggnog, thicker than Harvey\u2019s Bristol Cream, thicker even than Sainsbury\u2019s Turkey Gravy mixed with the actual fatty juices of the bird and then left congealed in a Pyrex\u2122 pint jug for five days, until finally scraped away by a hungover uncle into a squirrel-gnawed council food recycling bin. And now it is time to write these saboteurs their thank-you letters.</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Gladys. Thank you very much for the Chinese air pollution masks you gave us for Christmas this year. Toxic nitrogen dioxide levels are 50% more than EU legal limits outside our kids\u2019 schools here in London, so the masks are sure to come in handy in order to help us respire. I agree. It is lucky we will be leaving the EU in March so we can stop wearing them, as the stupid red tape from Brussels will no longer apply. As you say Auntie, \u2018Up yours, Delors!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Caddis. Thank you very much for the four pack of baked beans and the toilet roll you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put these in the Anderson shelter in the cellar with the cheese crackers to stock-pile in the event of no-deal Brexit food shortages. I understand that you remember the war and what fun it was, especially jiving with the GIs in exchange for nylons and so you are doubtless looking forward to the camaraderie the coming hard times will generate in dancehall toilets and picture house cloakrooms. I think you will find, however, that \u2018our coloured friends\u2019 will still be here, as they are from Africa and Pakistan, not Poland. You\u2019re right, though, the man in the corner shop is \u2018lovely\u2019 and is \u2018not like the others\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Gladioli. Thank you for the book vouchers you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar to use as hard currency in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And yes, Barbie from <em>Love Thy Neighbour</em> was a lovely girl. It made fun of both sides! I\u2019ll have \u2019alf!! Brexit means Brexit!!!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Gadfly. Thank you very much for the leftover high blood pressure tablets, flatus filters and spare suppositories you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar with the inhalers and the rabies vaccine to stockpile in the event of no-deal Brexit medicine shortages. It was kind of the woman in the chemist\u2019s to let you have them. And yes, you are right, she is \u2018not like the others\u2019 and is \u2018quite westernised, really\u2019. Take back control!!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Caddisfly. Thank you very much for the autobiography of Michael Caine that you gave us for Christmas this year. It is interesting how things in the 60s were different to things in the 40s and things now are different to things in both those times, though some other things have stayed the same, or gone back to what they were like in the first place, having been different for a period of time in the middle, which was bad. As Mrs Gove said to Michael Gove on Brexit day, \u2018You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\u2019 You\u2019re right, though, Lady Caine seems very elegant and \u2018westernised\u2019 and is not like the other Muslims. Not a lot of people know that!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Dear Auntie Eva. I don\u2019t know if I agree with you that \u2018Hitler had some good ideas, he just put them into practice badly\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDear Auntie Savage. Thank you very much for the set of illegal zombie knives you sent me for Christmas this year. They will, as you suggest, come in handy in fighting the civil war that is sure to engulf the country if \u2018the will of the people is not respected\u2019. I agree that we should all practise with them by stabbing things, perhaps our own feet? And yes, you are right, hands are probably better than feet, but some feet could pass for hands and have been quite \u2018handified\u2019. I think you\u2019ll find we voted to leave!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Zavvi. Thank you very much for the record tokens you sent me for Christmas this year. There is no need to worry, as HMV, despite being in administration due to the pincer movement of downloads, streaming, online sales and Amazon\u2019s tax avoidance, have agreed to honour the tokens. That said, I am going to put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar, alongside the book tokens Auntie Gladioli sent, to use as hard currency in the event of a no-deal Brexit. You are right, too. Nipper the HMV logo dog is not like the other dogs. He listens to an old Edison Bell cylinder phonograph like a Victorian English man and seems quite \u2018humanised\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDear Auntie Eva. I don\u2019t know if I agree with you that \u2018Hitler had some good ideas, he just put them into practice badly\u2019. And last time I quoted your Christmas morning comment in this column, readers said I had invented you as a parody of Brexit voters, so you are too unbelievable to be of any use to me.\u201d</p> <p>And I am in the grey street, drunk and banging a dustbin lid with a bread-sauce-smeared wooden spoon. You! You stole your grandchildren\u2019s dreams. Get out! Get out and get back to where you came from!! Inside, I pen my own below-the-line online critique. \u201cIt\u2019s writing like this that caused Brexit!\u201d And on it goes. And on and on.

      "bodyText": "The new year slips in, tailgating quietly through the closing crack of the old, and the elderly Brexit-voting racist relatives you tolerated through gritted skull over the festive season, their presence turning Christmas into a three-dimensional LBC phone-in, to be survived only by the anaesthetic of alcohol, have departed. But blood is thicker than water. And so are your elderly Brexit-voting racist relatives. They are also thicker than eggnog, thicker than Harvey\u2019s Bristol Cream, thicker even than Sainsbury\u2019s Turkey Gravy mixed with the actual fatty juices of the bird and then left congealed in a Pyrex\u2122 pint jug for five days, until finally scraped away by a hungover uncle into a squirrel-gnawed council food recycling bin. And now it is time to write these saboteurs their thank-you letters. \u201cDear Auntie Gladys. Thank you very much for the Chinese air pollution masks you gave us for Christmas this year. Toxic nitrogen dioxide levels are 50% more than EU legal limits outside our kids\u2019 schools here in London, so the masks are sure to come in handy in order to help us respire. I agree. It is lucky we will be leaving the EU in March so we can stop wearing them, as the stupid red tape from Brussels will no longer apply. As you say Auntie, \u2018Up yours, Delors!\u2019\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Caddis. Thank you very much for the four pack of baked beans and the toilet roll you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put these in the Anderson shelter in the cellar with the cheese crackers to stock-pile in the event of no-deal Brexit food shortages. I understand that you remember the war and what fun it was, especially jiving with the GIs in exchange for nylons and so you are doubtless looking forward to the camaraderie the coming hard times will generate in dancehall toilets and picture house cloakrooms. I think you will find, however, that \u2018our coloured friends\u2019 will still be here, as they are from Africa and Pakistan, not Poland. You\u2019re right, though, the man in the corner shop is \u2018lovely\u2019 and is \u2018not like the others\u2019.\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Gladioli. Thank you for the book vouchers you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar to use as hard currency in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And yes, Barbie from Love Thy Neighbour was a lovely girl. It made fun of both sides! I\u2019ll have \u2019alf!! Brexit means Brexit!!!\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Gadfly. Thank you very much for the leftover high blood pressure tablets, flatus filters and spare suppositories you gave us for Christmas this year. I will put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar with the inhalers and the rabies vaccine to stockpile in the event of no-deal Brexit medicine shortages. It was kind of the woman in the chemist\u2019s to let you have them. And yes, you are right, she is \u2018not like the others\u2019 and is \u2018quite westernised, really\u2019. Take back control!!\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Caddisfly. Thank you very much for the autobiography of Michael Caine that you gave us for Christmas this year. It is interesting how things in the 60s were different to things in the 40s and things now are different to things in both those times, though some other things have stayed the same, or gone back to what they were like in the first place, having been different for a period of time in the middle, which was bad. As Mrs Gove said to Michael Gove on Brexit day, \u2018You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\u2019 You\u2019re right, though, Lady Caine seems very elegant and \u2018westernised\u2019 and is not like the other Muslims. Not a lot of people know that!\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Savage. Thank you very much for the set of illegal zombie knives you sent me for Christmas this year. They will, as you suggest, come in handy in fighting the civil war that is sure to engulf the country if \u2018the will of the people is not respected\u2019. I agree that we should all practise with them by stabbing things, perhaps our own feet? And yes, you are right, hands are probably better than feet, but some feet could pass for hands and have been quite \u2018handified\u2019. I think you\u2019ll find we voted to leave!\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Zavvi. Thank you very much for the record tokens you sent me for Christmas this year. There is no need to worry, as HMV, despite being in administration due to the pincer movement of downloads, streaming, online sales and Amazon\u2019s tax avoidance, have agreed to honour the tokens. That said, I am going to put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar, alongside the book tokens Auntie Gladioli sent, to use as hard currency in the event of a no-deal Brexit. You are right, too. Nipper the HMV logo dog is not like the other dogs. He listens to an old Edison Bell cylinder phonograph like a Victorian English man and seems quite \u2018humanised\u2019.\u201d \u201cDear Auntie Eva. I don\u2019t know if I agree with you that \u2018Hitler had some good ideas, he just put them into practice badly\u2019. And last time I quoted your Christmas morning comment in this column, readers said I had invented you as a parody of Brexit voters, so you are too unbelievable to be of any use to me.\u201d And I am in the grey street, drunk and banging a dustbin lid with a bread-sauce-smeared wooden spoon. You! You stole your grandchildren\u2019s dreams. Get out! Get out and get back to where you came from!! Inside, I pen my own below-the-line online critique. \u201cIt\u2019s writing like this that caused Brexit!\u201d And on it goes. And on and on. Happy New Year.

Waiting-time targets are well established for A&amp;E treatment, surgery and cancer care.</p> <p>The plan will include an extra \u00a32.3bn to pay for talking therapies for an additional 350,000 young people and 380,000 adults over the next five years. An around-the-clock helpline will eventually be established. Young people will no longer be forced to restart their treatment with adult services when they turn 18.</p> <p>The plan will also overhaul maternity care and improve staffing levels. It involves spending an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/may-to-unveil-20-billion-pound-a-year-nhs-boost\" title=\"\">extra \u00a320.5bn </a>on the NHS by 2023-24 and has raised concerns inside the Treasury. But Downing Street hopes it will demonstrate that the government still has a domestic agenda outside Brexit. Theresa May said the strategy would achieve \u201ca significant part of our ambition to deliver true <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/16/mental-health-still-losing-out-in-nhs-funding-report-finds\" title=\"\">parity between physical and mental health</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already done a lot to end the stigma that people with mental health face and make sure they can reach out for help, and this expansion, part of our long-term plan for the NHS, will make a real difference and make the UK a world leader when it comes to both the money it spends on mental health services and the support and treatment it offers those who need it.\u201d</p> <p>Labour says that almost a sixth of under-16s in England who suffer a mental health crisis are forced to wait more than four hours in A&amp;E. The number is three times higher than it was in 2014, according to data from a freedom of information request.</p> <p>May said in June that a long-term plan would be drawn up, just after she announced a large spending increase to mark the 70th anniversary of the health service. <br>Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, was given an ambitious brief to use the money to equip the health service to cope with the demands of an ageing population as it suffers a staffing crisis across almost all specialties.</p> <p>Stevens was told that the plan must show how waiting times could be put back on track in areas such as A&amp;E, cancer care and planned operations; stop hospital trusts ending up in the red; solve under-staffing; deliver the long-promised integration of health and social care; improve preventive care; push through unprecedented improvements in mental health care; and embrace technology and spread best practice.</p> <p>The Centre for Mental Health, a charity, said the measures would help \u201cscale up the level of support offered to people with mental health difficulties\u201d. It added: \u201cA truly comprehensive set of access standards, similar to those for physical health services, could help to bring parity a step closer if it is backed up with enough funding and long-term investment in the workforce we need to offer people the right care at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must now also step up and invest in public health, social care, early years and youth services if it is serious about achieving parity for mental health. Without it, too many people will continue to need NHS support and not get the help they need until they reach crisis point.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Munday, chair of the Mental Health Nurses Association, said: \u201cAlongside waiting-time standards there must be safe staffing standards in mental health services. Whatever money is put into the NHS through the long-term plan, it must also be weighed against the millions that have been cut from parts of the NHS and all other public services.</p> <p>\u201cWith the double-digit percentage cuts to local authorities, we\u2019ve seen services that have supported people with mental ill health erased.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "New waiting-time targets for mental health treatment and stronger support for young adults with difficulties will be an important part of the government\u2019s long-awaited 10-year NHS plan to be launched on Monday. \u201cComprehensive access standards\u201d for mental health will be introduced for the first time, in an effort to close the gap between physical and mental health treatment. Waiting-time targets are well established for A&amp;E treatment, surgery and cancer care. The plan will include an extra \u00a32.3bn to pay for talking therapies for an additional 350,000 young people and 380,000 adults over the next five years. An around-the-clock helpline will eventually be established. Young people will no longer be forced to restart their treatment with adult services when they turn 18. The plan will also overhaul maternity care and improve staffing levels. It involves spending an extra \u00a320.5bn on the NHS by 2023-24 and has raised concerns inside the Treasury. But Downing Street hopes it will demonstrate that the government still has a domestic agenda outside Brexit. Theresa May said the strategy would achieve \u201ca significant part of our ambition to deliver true parity between physical and mental health\u201d. \u201cWe have already done a lot to end the stigma that people with mental health face and make sure they can reach out for help, and this expansion, part of our long-term plan for the NHS, will make a real difference and make the UK a world leader when it comes to both the money it spends on mental health services and the support and treatment it offers those who need it.\u201d Labour says that almost a sixth of under-16s in England who suffer a mental health crisis are forced to wait more than four hours in A&amp;E. The number is three times higher than it was in 2014, according to data from a freedom of information request. May said in June that a long-term plan would be drawn up, just after she announced a large spending increase to mark the 70th anniversary of the health service. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, was given an ambitious brief to use the money to equip the health service to cope with the demands of an ageing population as it suffers a staffing crisis across almost all specialties. Stevens was told that the plan must show how waiting times could be put back on track in areas such as A&amp;E, cancer care and planned operations; stop hospital trusts ending up in the red; solve under-staffing; deliver the long-promised integration of health and social care; improve preventive care; push through unprecedented improvements in mental health care; and embrace technology and spread best practice. The Centre for Mental Health, a charity, said the measures would help \u201cscale up the level of support offered to people with mental health difficulties\u201d. It added: \u201cA truly comprehensive set of access standards, similar to those for physical health services, could help to bring parity a step closer if it is backed up with enough funding and long-term investment in the workforce we need to offer people the right care at the right time. \u201cThe government must now also step up and invest in public health, social care, early years and youth services if it is serious about achieving parity for mental health. Without it, too many people will continue to need NHS support and not get the help they need until they reach crisis point.\u201d Dave Munday, chair of the Mental Health Nurses Association, said: \u201cAlongside waiting-time standards there must be safe staffing standards in mental health services. Whatever money is put into the NHS through the long-term plan, it must also be weighed against the millions that have been cut from parts of the NHS and all other public services. \u201cWith the double-digit percentage cuts to local authorities, we\u2019ve seen services that have supported people with mental ill health erased.\u201d",

Those familiar with his work will know that he is not a writer who produces lazy polemic or indulges in glib posturing. He strives to see all sides of an argument and a character and his work is the more interesting for that.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/30/this-house-five-star-review-james-graham-national-theatre-garrick\" title=\"\">This House</a></em>, his breakthrough play in 2012 about the hung parliament of the 1970s, humanised the party whips. <em>Coalition</em> sought audience sympathy for the agonies of Nick Clegg. So folk who like their politics and their dramas served in blacks and whites are going to react badly to this version of the referendum campaign. Fanatical Brexiters will not like the darker tints in the portrayal of their champions, while some Remainers will be upset that the Out gang are not universally depicted as mendacious charlatans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The film absolves senior Tories of their moral responsibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My issue with this film is a different one. I find it unbalanced because the tale is told almost exclusively from the point of view of the campaign \u201cstrategists\u201d on the two sides. An extremely dominant role is given to Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, played by Benedict Cumberbatch.</p> <p>The politicians are reduced to bit parts and comic cameos. Nigel Farage and Arron Banks are boozy, boorish cartoons. Their most entertaining scene has the two Ukippers ranting to each other while they lie, sozzled, on a car bonnet. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are puppets twerking to strings pulled by Cummings/Cumberbatch. This is funny, but also rather absolves these senior Tories of their moral responsibilities for what was perpetrated by the Leave campaign. Cameron is a disembodied voice on the end of a phone. Jeremy Corbyn is a throwaway line in someone else\u2019s mouth and never appears at all. This is, when you think about it, a pretty accurate reflection of the Labour leader\u2019s contribution to the referendum battle.</p> <p>I can see why Graham became so fascinated by Cummings, a self-consciously \u201cclever\u201d rightwing anarchist who likes to claim Mao, Bismarck, Napoleon and other \u201cdisrupters of history\u201d as his inspirations. Cumberbatch, channelling his intensity very effectively, makes him much the most compelling of the characters. All the zingers of the drama rush from the lips of Cummings. At the outset of the campaign, he tells startled fellow Outers that they can overturn expectations and win the referendum if they \u201chack the political system\u201d. On this account, it is Cummings who comes up with all the winning devices employed by the Brexiters, including the smart if deceptive \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\" title=\"\">infamous red bus emblazoned with a lie about NHS funding</a>. He does so via a series of eureka moments, many of which occur while he is brainstorming with himself in a store cupboard.</p> <p>The drama suggests that it is Cummings alone who spots the potential to use social media, data-manipulation and the psychometric targeting of the electorate to swing the result while his counterparts on the Remain side are still relying on old-fashioned voter focus groups. Even when he is behaving badly, the audience is expected to rather relish it. We are invited to admire the way in which he outmanoeuvres the booby Tory MPs on the Leave campaign\u2019s board when they try to sack him for being too outrageous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/you-whitewashed-the-corruption-james-graham-and-carole-cadwalladr-on-brexit-the-uncivil-war\">'You whitewashed the corruption': James Graham and Carole Cadwalladr on Brexit: The Uncivil War</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Remain campaign has a very subordinate role in the drama. Oliver, played by Rory Kinnear, lurches from cocksure complacency at the beginning of the campaign to whining panic by the end of it. As he begins to fear that the battle is slipping away from them, Cameron\u2019s man bursts into one of his focus groups to start arguing with the assembled voters. He and the rest of the Remainers are essentially there to be hapless foils for Cummings\u2019s devilish brilliance.</p> <p>Elements of the portrayal are unsympathetic. The film is not wrong to suggest that the official Leave campaign kept \u201cits hands clean\u201d of the most toxic stuff about immigration because it knew that the unofficial Farage/Banks outfit would whip up xenophobia for them. There are nods to the various scandals associated with the Leave campaign, but the drama struggles to do them complete justice or to integrate them fully into the story.</p> <p>The action was mainly filmed over the summer and we have since learned a lot more about what the Leave campaign got up to. Caption cards with the end credits have to be employed to fill some of the holes, which is never satisfactory.</p> <p>This does not support the argument that it is too early to start making dramas about Brexit. The way things are going, we may be all dead before it reaches any kind of settled resolution. I admire Graham for tackling the most significant, the most divisive and the most complex political event of our recent history. He does so with the intelligence, acuity, energy and wit we have come to expect from him.</p> <p>It is fair to say that this cannot be and will not be the last dramatic word on the subject, though I rather suspect Dominic Cummings would be highly content if it were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"12daf7fdb220888b9cc05b0b4275ada952e1f809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12daf7fdb220888b9cc05b0b4275ada952e1f809/956_370_1547_1933/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Gina Miller</h2> <p><strong>Activist who took the government to court over its right to invoke article 50 without parliamentary approval</strong></p> <p>I experienced a mix of emotions watching the film. My abiding sense is that the referendum just shouldn\u2019t have happened, and it reinforced that for me. It\u2019s like an innocence in British society was polluted \u2013 and in the film you see who the polluters are. Brexit was almost like a game for these people. They weren\u2019t thinking of the hurt it would cause. Towards the end, when Brexit is looking increasingly likely, someone says: \u201cYou can\u2019t put it back in the box\u201d \u2013 and that absolutely sums it all up.</p> <p>The film is a good start, but we need to go much deeper into all of this. We haven\u2019t fully understood the ramifications of what happened and what the legal outcomes and legal remedies will be. Psychological mapping for political ends is now going to be part of every campaign. But how do you regulate it? During the film, I kept thinking: it\u2019s like an eight-legged monster has been unleashed: you tie one leg down and then another leg breaks free.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Leave voters cast a light on what\u2019s been going wrong in England</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t realise how much of a personal vendetta Dominic Cummings had against the establishment. If the film is to be believed, this was about him winning against them. Not only did he use psychology, but he was being driven by his own psychological reaction to the way he was treated by those people. With Boris, the film seems to suggest that he regretted his involvement in the Leave campaign and knew what damage he\u2019d caused, but his behaviour since the referendum doesn\u2019t reflect that. It\u2019s interesting, too, to see how easily turned Michael Gove was.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame that they didn\u2019t focus more on Cambridge Analytica and the fact that it was closed down. It\u2019s important to show that there are repercussions for companies that manipulate the public. I think the role of BeLeave could have been explored further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/24/brexit-whistleblower-cambridge-analytica-beleave-vote-leave-shahmir-sanni\" title=\"\">as they received an illegal donation of \u00a3625,000</a>, most of which went to AggregateIQ (the data firm that was linked to Cambridge Analytica).

What I found odd at the time was that many people didn\u2019t want to go outside London [to test the public mood], so I specifically went out of London in February 2016. I then tried to have a conversation with the Remain office, saying that we were going to lose, because I was hearing all the rhetoric coming from the campaign ads.</p> <p>What struck me was how many people were saying the same things, such as \u201ctake back control\u201d. I\u2019m a marketeer, and I thought the message discipline in the Leave campaign was extraordinary. Once those phrases landed, they created a barrier and you couldn\u2019t get any other information across to people. I can see how clever Dominic Cummings was in doing that. If you were completely unemotional, you\u2019d have to agree it was a brilliant marketing campaign. But when I tried to relay that information, the Remain office didn\u2019t want to listen.</p> <p>I found the film very sad to watch, but I do think there are positives in all of this. People are talking about politics in Britain much more than before. I also think \u2013 and when I say this, other Remainers look at me like I\u2019m crazy \u2013 that the Leave voters cast a spotlight on what\u2019s been going wrong in England. Politicians and people in the main cities had forgotten about them. And now they\u2019ve made themselves heard, and I think they\u2019ve actually done a good thing from that perspective.</p> <p>When they started making the film, the people behind it couldn\u2019t possibly have envisaged the situation we\u2019re in now, where the anger is greater than ever and those on the winning side feel their win is being taken away. It started with lack of trust and now we\u2019re back to lack of trust. I hope the film prompts people, when they read something, to question where it\u2019s coming from, to read more than one source and push themselves to see both sides. Because all the same campaign things are going to be happening again if \u2013 as looks increasingly likely \u2013 we end up with a second referendum.<br><strong>Interview by</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\">Killian Fox</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d9f4c5860bf2c9756ad8ed2dd5cb7c6f64e794e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f4c5860bf2c9756ad8ed2dd5cb7c6f64e794e9/0_117_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gloria De Piero\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Gloria De Piero</h2> <p><strong>Labour MP</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>Ashfield</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>Nottinghamshire</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Voted Remain</strong><strong> but </strong><strong>now wants to follow through with Brexit</strong></p> <p>Like the rest of the country, I\u2019ve had Brexit up to here, so I\u2019m not sure I was craving a drama about it. But I was absolutely gripped by this film, which takes some doing when the main character is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/dominic-cummings-is-the-true-cowardly-face-of-the-brexiters\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>. It\u2019s compelling and it\u2019s prompted a lot of valuable questions about how we reconnect with the voters that we lost. I\u2019d advise anybody to see it.</p> <p>I launched the Labour Remain campaign with Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson and I voted for Remain. The Leave campaign has rightly had a lot of criticism \u2013 about the fact that they broke the law [on electoral overspending], that they talked about \u00a3350m for the NHS, and said that Turkey was going to join the EU \u2013 but the Remain campaign has had rather less scrutiny. What I got from this film was a reminder of why we failed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My God, weren\u2019t there a lot of posh white blokes?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What immediately struck me was, my God, weren\u2019t there a lot of posh white blokes? Women and minorities were hard to come by in either campaign. On the British left, we have to think: how did that happen? How did those posh white boys win over so many of our voters? They even stole our beloved NHS and used that as their tool!</p> <p>Near the beginning of the film, there\u2019s a scene where Cummings is in the pub playing pool and chatting to people about their fears and grievances. I wonder if any of us did that? When I think of my campaign, it really felt very establishment, very business-led. In the film, it\u2019s all PowerPoint presentations and focus groups in the campaign office.</p> <p>I found it funny how ridiculous all the politicians seemed. Everybody was weird and out of touch. Was that unfair? Not really \u2013 it captured us very well. (Not myself, I hope, but that\u2019s for others to judge.) I don\u2019t really know any of the main players in the film. I had dinner with Michael Gove when I was a journalist; he\u2019s very clipped and polite, which is how he appeared in the film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a966c45e617445a3d193a279433f8ee33447349f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a966c45e617445a3d193a279433f8ee33447349f/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings, left, and Benedict Cumberbatch playing him in Brexit: An Uncivil War, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings, left, and Benedict Cumberbatch playing him in Brexit: An Uncivil War, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: YouTube/Getty images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t think the film will change the mind of any Brexit voters in my constituency about whether the vote was fair.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Rawnsley Observer chief political commentator In Brexit: The Uncivil War, James Graham sets out to show how Britons were induced to narrowly vote to leave the EU in June 2016. Those familiar with his work will know that he is not a writer who produces lazy polemic or indulges in glib posturing. He strives to see all sides of an argument and a character and his work is the more interesting for that. This House, his breakthrough play in 2012 about the hung parliament of the 1970s, humanised the party whips. Coalition sought audience sympathy for the agonies of Nick Clegg. So folk who like their politics and their dramas served in blacks and whites are going to react badly to this version of the referendum campaign. Fanatical Brexiters will not like the darker tints in the portrayal of their champions, while some Remainers will be upset that the Out gang are not universally depicted as mendacious charlatans. My issue with this film is a different one. I find it unbalanced because the tale is told almost exclusively from the point of view of the campaign \u201cstrategists\u201d on the two sides. An extremely dominant role is given to Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The politicians are reduced to bit parts and comic cameos. Nigel Farage and Arron Banks are boozy, boorish cartoons. Their most entertaining scene has the two Ukippers ranting to each other while they lie, sozzled, on a car bonnet. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are puppets twerking to strings pulled by Cummings/Cumberbatch. This is funny, but also rather absolves these senior Tories of their moral responsibilities for what was perpetrated by the Leave campaign. Cameron is a disembodied voice on the end of a phone. Jeremy Corbyn is a throwaway line in someone else\u2019s mouth and never appears at all. This is, when you think about it, a pretty accurate reflection of the Labour leader\u2019s contribution to the referendum battle. I can see why Graham became so fascinated by Cummings, a self-consciously \u201cclever\u201d rightwing anarchist who likes to claim Mao, Bismarck, Napoleon and other \u201cdisrupters of history\u201d as his inspirations. Cumberbatch, channelling his intensity very effectively, makes him much the most compelling of the characters. All the zingers of the drama rush from the lips of Cummings. At the outset of the campaign, he tells startled fellow Outers that they can overturn expectations and win the referendum if they \u201chack the political system\u201d. On this account, it is Cummings who comes up with all the winning devices employed by the Brexiters, including the smart if deceptive \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan and the infamous red bus emblazoned with a lie about NHS funding. He does so via a series of eureka moments, many of which occur while he is brainstorming with himself in a store cupboard. The drama suggests that it is Cummings alone who spots the potential to use social media, data-manipulation and the psychometric targeting of the electorate to swing the result while his counterparts on the Remain side are still relying on old-fashioned voter focus groups. Even when he is behaving badly, the audience is expected to rather relish it. We are invited to admire the way in which he outmanoeuvres the booby Tory MPs on the Leave campaign\u2019s board when they try to sack him for being too outrageous. The Remain campaign has a very subordinate role in the drama. Oliver, played by Rory Kinnear, lurches from cocksure complacency at the beginning of the campaign to whining panic by the end of it. As he begins to fear that the battle is slipping away from them, Cameron\u2019s man bursts into one of his focus groups to start arguing with the assembled voters. He and the rest of the Remainers are essentially there to be hapless foils for Cummings\u2019s devilish brilliance. Elements of the portrayal are unsympathetic. The film is not wrong to suggest that the official Leave campaign kept \u201cits hands clean\u201d of the most toxic stuff about immigration because it knew that the unofficial Farage/Banks outfit would whip up xenophobia for them. There are nods to the various scandals associated with the Leave campaign, but the drama struggles to do them complete justice or to integrate them fully into the story. The action was mainly filmed over the summer and we have since learned a lot more about what the Leave campaign got up to. Caption cards with the end credits have to be employed to fill some of the holes, which is never satisfactory. This does not support the argument that it is too early to start making dramas about Brexit. The way things are going, we may be all dead before it reaches any kind of settled resolution. I admire Graham for tackling the most significant, the most divisive and the most complex political event of our recent history. He does so with the intelligence, acuity, energy and wit we have come to expect from him. It is fair to say that this cannot be and will not be the last dramatic word on the subject, though I rather suspect Dominic Cummings would be highly content if it were. Gina Miller Activist who took the government to court over its right to invoke article 50 without parliamentary approval I experienced a mix of emotions watching the film. My abiding sense is that the referendum just shouldn\u2019t have happened, and it reinforced that for me. It\u2019s like an innocence in British society was polluted \u2013 and in the film you see who the polluters are. Brexit was almost like a game for these people. They weren\u2019t thinking of the hurt it would cause. Towards the end, when Brexit is looking increasingly likely, someone says: \u201cYou can\u2019t put it back in the box\u201d \u2013 and that absolutely sums it all up. The film is a good start, but we need to go much deeper into all of this. We haven\u2019t fully understood the ramifications of what happened and what the legal outcomes and legal remedies will be. Psychological mapping for political ends is now going to be part of every campaign. But how do you regulate it? During the film, I kept thinking: it\u2019s like an eight-legged monster has been unleashed: you tie one leg down and then another leg breaks free. I didn\u2019t realise how much of a personal vendetta Dominic Cummings had against the establishment. If the film is to be believed, this was about him winning against them. Not only did he use psychology, but he was being driven by his own psychological reaction to the way he was treated by those people. With Boris, the film seems to suggest that he regretted his involvement in the Leave campaign and knew what damage he\u2019d caused, but his behaviour since the referendum doesn\u2019t reflect that. It\u2019s interesting, too, to see how easily turned Michael Gove was. It\u2019s a shame that they didn\u2019t focus more on Cambridge Analytica and the fact that it was closed down. It\u2019s important to show that there are repercussions for companies that manipulate the public. I think the role of BeLeave could have been explored further, as they received an illegal donation of \u00a3625,000, most of which went to AggregateIQ (the data firm that was linked to Cambridge Analytica). It looks as if it\u2019s all just Vote Leave, but the blame should be equally shared. I was part of the Remain campaign, but I was never in the campaign office, so it was interesting to see it from that side. What I found odd at the time was that many people didn\u2019t want to go outside London [to test the public mood], so I specifically went out of London in February 2016. I then tried to have a conversation with the Remain office, saying that we were going to lose, because I was hearing all the rhetoric coming from the campaign ads. What struck me was how many people were saying the same things, such as \u201ctake back control\u201d. I\u2019m a marketeer, and I thought the message discipline in the Leave campaign was extraordinary. Once those phrases landed, they created a barrier and you couldn\u2019t get any other information across to people. I can see how clever Dominic Cummings was in doing that. If you were completely unemotional, you\u2019d have to agree it was a brilliant marketing campaign. But when I tried to relay that information, the Remain office didn\u2019t want to listen. I found the film very sad to watch, but I do think there are positives in all of this. People are talking about politics in Britain much more than before. I also think \u2013 and when I say this, other Remainers look at me like I\u2019m crazy \u2013 that the Leave voters cast a spotlight on what\u2019s been going wrong in England. Politicians and people in the main cities had forgotten about them. And now they\u2019ve made themselves heard, and I think they\u2019ve actually done a good thing from that perspective. When they started making the film, the people behind it couldn\u2019t possibly have envisaged the situation we\u2019re in now, where the anger is greater than ever and those on the winning side feel their win is being taken away. It started with lack of trust and now we\u2019re back to lack of trust. I hope the film prompts people, when they read something, to question where it\u2019s coming from, to read more than one source and push themselves to see both sides. Because all the same campaign things are going to be happening again if \u2013 as looks increasingly likely \u2013 we end up with a second referendum. Interview by Killian Fox Gloria De Piero Labour MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire. Voted Remain but now wants to follow through with Brexit Like the rest of the country, I\u2019ve had Brexit up to here, so I\u2019m not sure I was craving a drama about it. But I was absolutely gripped by this film, which takes some doing when the main character is Dominic Cummings. It\u2019s compelling and it\u2019s prompted a lot of valuable questions about how we reconnect with the voters that we lost. I\u2019d advise anybody to see it. I launched the Labour Remain campaign with Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson and I voted for Remain. The Leave campaign has rightly had a lot of criticism \u2013 about the fact that they broke the law [on electoral overspending], that they talked about \u00a3350m for the NHS, and said that Turkey was going to join the EU \u2013 but the Remain campaign has had rather less scrutiny. What I got from this film was a reminder of why we failed. What immediately struck me was, my God, weren\u2019t there a lot of posh white blokes? Women and minorities were hard to come by in either campaign. On the British left, we have to think: how did that happen? How did those posh white boys win over so many of our voters? They even stole our beloved NHS and used that as their tool! Near the beginning of the film, there\u2019s a scene where Cummings is in the pub playing pool and chatting to people about their fears and grievances. I wonder if any of us did that? When I think of my campaign, it really felt very establishment, very business-led. In the film, it\u2019s all PowerPoint presentations and focus groups in the campaign office. I found it funny how ridiculous all the politicians seemed. Everybody was weird and out of touch. Was that unfair? Not really \u2013 it captured us very well. (Not myself, I hope, but that\u2019s for others to judge.) I don\u2019t really know any of the main players in the film. I had dinner with Michael Gove when I was a journalist; he\u2019s very clipped and polite, which is how he appeared in the film. I don\u2019t think the film will change the mind of any Brexit voters in my constituency about whether the vote was fair. The Leave campaign has come in for a lot of criticism already, so it\u2019s not exactly news. Yes, there was dodginess and bad behaviour, but my constituents, they knew what they were doing. And they were optimistic. Leave constituents are portrayed as angry but, actually, they wanted change, whereas Remain wanted the status quo. To have a second referendum would be absolutely crazy. If there was a seismic change, it would be different, but there\u2019s no movement in the polls and there\u2019s no appetite for it in my constituency, even among Remainers. All we\u2019ve talked about for over two years is Brexit. I want to talk instead about the things that led to that vote: about low wages, about the fact that so few people in my constituency are able to go to university. In my view, the only way to heal that rift now is to make a decent fist of Brexit. Those people have spoken and, if we ignore them, if we don\u2019t heed their vote, I think the Labour party is in serious trouble. I\u2019d forgotten how hateful and divided it was in the run-up to the referendum, but I think I\u2019ve become desensitised, because all that hate and division is still there. As Remain strategist Craig Oliver said at the end of the film, maybe this is just politics now. There is a case to be made that political advertising needs greater scrutiny. The trouble is, everything is contested. The people in my constituency wanted impartial information but there is no such thing. All arguments are contested by the other side. That\u2019s politics, I guess. Of course, the Leave campaign told some massive porkies and broke electoral law. But if you\u2019re the British left now, you should be thinking, what the hell happened to the Remain campaign? Why didn\u2019t our voters listen to us and why did they listen to a bunch of posh boys instead? Killian Fox Shahmir Sanni Former Leave campaign volunteer turned whistleblower over Vote Leave\u2019s breaking of electoral law When I was told that Benedict Cumberbatch would be starring as Vote Leave strategist Dominic Cummings in a Channel 4 film I was immediately wary. Since the referendum result, it has gradually emerged that Cummings was part of the biggest electoral scandal in modern British history. He and his former colleagues at Vote Leave, the official Leave campaign, are being, or have been, investigated by multiple authorities. Yet Cummings, in contempt of parliamentary procedure, has refused to be questioned by the DCMS select committee. I worked on the official campaign, in the same office as Cummings, so I was keen to see how accurately the film represented what happened there. Cumberbatch\u2019s performance is good. It is an evocative portrayal of a man who liked to write 8,000-word blogs about how stupid everyone else is. Most of the key figures from the Leave side are there and are pretty accurate impersonations: Leave.EU\u2019s Arron Banks and Nigel Farage; Vote Leave\u2019s Boris Johnson, Stephen Parkinson, Victoria Woodcock and Matthew Elliott; and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ\u2019s Zack Massingham. The relationship between Vote Leave and Leave.EU is represented fairly and the story is sort of accurate. Sort of. The film is not a true representation of what happened in a few critical areas. Brexit was won via illegal activity \u2013 that is a fact. Vote Leave used BeLeave (an outreach group that has a two-second cameo in the entire film) to funnel \u00a3625,000 to AIQ for micro-targeting digital ads, on top of the millions of pounds it had already given the company - and someone seemingly tried to cover up the fact that the two campaigns coordinated. Cummings\u2019s campaign was found guilty of breaking the law because this breached campaign spending limits and has been referred to the Met police. The only mention of this in the film is a line of text at the end that says that since the referendum Vote Leave has been found to have broken electoral law. AIQ has \u2013 since the vote \u2013 been censured by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. That is not mentioned in the film. Darren Grimes, campaign manager of BeLeave, who was found guilty of breaking electoral law [he is appealing], also has no mention. Banks\u2019s meetings around the time of the vote with Russian embassy officials are not mentioned. These aren\u2019t just outlying facts, tangential to the story \u2013 they are an integral part of the Brexit story. There is no philosophical, artistic or \u201caiming for balance\u201d argument that justifies missing out these key elements of the story. It\u2019s woefully complacent. We are at a pivotal point in this country\u2019s history. It is a time of uncertainty, division and ignorance.

A better solution would be to limit visitor numbers.\u201d</p> <p>As with the wheeled suitcases, the dilemma is how on earth to turn the plan into a workable and enforceable policy. There have been suggestions that the charge could be added to the cost of arriving in the city either by train, bus or cruise ship, with the respective transport companies passing the proceeds on to Venice authorities.</p> <p>While it is not possible to drive in Venice, people can arrive in the mainland area of the lagoon and park their vehicle for between \u20ac12 and \u20ac29 a day.

Venetians have held several protests in recent years against a tourism industry which they argue has eroded their quality of life, damaged the environment and driven residents away. On some days the current population of 55,000 (down from about 175,000 in the post-second-world-war years) is dwarfed by the number of tourists. </p> <p>Brugnaro has said that some of the extra cash from the fee will help fund the cleaning up of rubbish that daytrippers leave in their wake and improve the lives of locals, but many of those same locals are enraged by the idea that the charge would also have to be paid by departed Venetians visiting home and family. Understandably, that is not something they can celebrate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like adding insult to injury,\u201d said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the Gruppo 25 Aprile activist group. \u201cAfter forcing thousands of people to leave the city, you now force them to pay to visit their families?

But the plan is yet to be approved by the national government. If and when that approval comes, work on the new route, which requires the dredging of canals and construction of a new port, would take an estimated four years. And while diverting the ships would better preserve the historic centre, the move will do little to address concerns about pollution.</p> <p>It goes without saying, however, that Venice\u2019s troubles are not limited to tourism. The city is also endangered by recurring <em>acque alte</em>, or high waters. On 29 October last year, three-quarters of the city was hit by the worst flooding in a decade.

A local newspaper has referred to the autumn flood as a day that Venetians will never forget.</p> <p>For the second time since 2000, water filled St Mark\u2019s Basilica, causing damage to the marble floors, bronze metal doors and mosaic floors of the 1,000-year-old church.

      "body": "<p>We all make mistakes. Even us football writers, as difficult as it may be to believe, have been known to drop the odd ricket over the years. I must confess, to my eternal shame, that in the mild panic of a last-minute, potentially deadline-busting goal during my early years of covering Manchester City I managed to type in the wrong name for the scorer, Gareth Taylor, and credit his heroics to, well, this is awkward ... myself instead.</p> <p>The readers of the newspaper I was working for at the time \u2013 and Gareth himself, I imagine \u2013 must have been bemused to find this rather fanciful version of events slipped past the subeditors and made it into the opening line of the subsequent match report. The only consolation being that it was, thank heavens, before the years when Twitter\u2019s pitchfork mob could be found scouring the internet for fresh prey.</p> <p>Sometimes it is your own carelessness, sometimes it is an error during the editing process and sometimes I haven\u2019t the foggiest, if I can alert you to a recent humdinger from the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s corrections and clarifications page acknowledging, courtesy of one reader, that our recipe for \u201cspaghetti with radicchio, fennel and rosemary\u201d had one problem \u2013 namely that it did not, in fact, contain spaghetti, fennel or rosemary.</p> <p>Some newspapers have their systems set up to change words automatically for their own style preferences \u2013 hence the unfortunate occasion when Matt Holland, the Republic of Ireland midfielder, ended up in a match report as Matt Netherlands \u2013 whereas the list of copytaking cock-ups is the stuff of legend from the days when press box routine involved dictating your match reports through old rotary\u2011style telephones and relying on the person at the other end of the line to take it down accurately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/04/mo-salah-liverpool-real-madrid-galactico\">Resist the machine: Mo Salah should surely fight the urge to be a gal\u00e1ctico | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The classic story is the time Wales were playing in Latvia and one of the copytakers on duty was not entirely up to speed when it came to the names of the players, in particular the line that Rush and Hughes were up front \u2013 resulting in a match report that had a Wales attack led by Russian Jews.</p> <p>Another belter was penned by the motoring correspondent of the <em>Dundee Courier</em> for \u201cany budding Jim Clarks out there\u201d, appearing in print the following morning as \u201cany budding gym clerks\u201d, and there was a beauty from the 1998 World Cup when trouble broke out between rival fans in Marseille and the <em>gendarmes</em> waded in. One reporter\u2019s news desk was baffled to read that \u201cvanloads of John Barnes\u201d had arrived on the scene.</p> <p>The point is that we are all culpable sometimes of getting things wrong. It happens, it is life and when it comes to referees it is why, in part, I do not always see the point being too hard on our match officials. The game at the highest level has never been quicker. The referees you see demonised on social media tend to get a lot more right than wrong and, unpopular as it might be, I tend to think the assistant referees are actually rather brilliant at what they do. Because if you think it is easy to flag for a marginal offside decisions at full speed, keeping an eye on the ball while simultaneously monitoring the last line of defence and having the necessary skills to rule if a single body part \u2013 a foot, a knee, a shoulder or even an eyebrow \u2013 has strayed a few centimetres too far one way, you would be kidding yourself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A player embedded his studs into another man\u2019s thigh, injuring his opponent and getting away with it scot-free</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, if we are being honest about our mistakes here, I do find it rather galling that when a referee misses a red-card offence \u2013 and, by that, I mean seeing what happened but misjudging the seriousness of it \u2013 the authorities are so quick to close ranks and revert to their default setting that nothing can be changed retrospectively. And yes, I suppose this could be referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/newcastle-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that tackle from Jonjo Shelvey</a> that means Paul Pogba was not fit to play for Manchester United in their FA Cup tie against Reading on Saturday.</p> <p>It was, after all, precisely the kind of studs-up challenge that the sport wants to eliminate, we keep hearing. Yet the irony is that if the referee, Andre Marriner, said his view was blocked, or that he was looking the wrong way, Shelvey would now be eligible for a disciplinary charge and staring at a three-match suspension for violent conduct.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\" data-alt=\"Social media\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&description=&link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\">Social media</a> </figure>  <p>Instead, Marriner did see it and because he awarded a free-kick against the Newcastle player the Football Association automatically lets off the player on the rather flimsy basis it does not want to be seen to be re-refereeing games. All of which strikes me as a bit of a cop-out bearing in mind what it leaves us with: one player embedding his studs into another man\u2019s thigh, injuring his opponent and getting away with it scot-free because, by the FA\u2019s logic, it has already been dealt with.</p> <p>If nothing else, at least this is the sort of issue that should no longer be so prevalent when the Premier League brings in VAR next season and referees will have the opportunity to review any incident.</p> <p>For now, however, it is quite something to try to tot up how many players over the years have been spared bans because of this strange loophole whereby the FA does not seem to grasp that punishing a player on video evidence is not actually the same thing as undermining the referee. In particular, when that referee believes the player should be punished, too.</p> <p>Just consider the story Mark Clattenburg tells about one match between Manchester United and Wigan when he was the referee who made a poor call for what should have been a clear red-card offence. \u201cI gave a free-kick against Wayne Rooney when, having later seen the replays, he deserved more,\u201d Clattenburg says. \u201cHe had elbowed Wigan\u2019s James McCarthy but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/28/wayne-rooney-elbow-no-charge\" title=\"\">the FA decided to take no disciplinary action</a> because I had apparently dealt with it on the pitch.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7046df14dea87fae1e4fe0b566a88080d55d2ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7046df14dea87fae1e4fe0b566a88080d55d2ca9/0_18_2788_1673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wayne Rooney pleads innocence to Mark Clattenburg after he had clashed with Wigan's James McCarthy in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wayne Rooney pleads innocence to Mark Clattenburg after he had clashed with Wigan\u2019s James McCarthy (left, feeling his head) in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The system, Clattenburg says with some justification, is entirely flawed. Yet the most relevant part of that story is that he was referring to a match from 2011. It goes back even further \u2013 longer, indeed, than I can even remember \u2013 and every time one of these incidents comes up it doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference that the referee, in the vast majority of cases, is willing to accept he made a lousy call. All the FA wants to know is whether the relevant official had a view of the incident \u2013 and, if so, the case is closed.</p> <p>The exception was the time in 2006, during a match between Manchester City and Portsmouth, when Ben Thatcher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/25/newsstory.sport12\" title=\"\">sent Pedro Mendes into cloud-cuckoo land</a> with a forearm smash that earned the perpetrator, rather bewilderingly, a yellow card from Dermot Gallagher, followed later by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/13/newsstory.portsmouth\" title=\"\">an eight-match suspension</a> (plus an extra 15 matches suspended for two years) \u2013 but only because the FA\u2019s disciplinary chiefs knew if they didn\u2019t do anything the police were likely to intervene.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it finally time to change this rule? It is actually well overdue, particularly now we have moved into an age, thinking back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that game at the Etihad on Thursday</a>, whereby we have technology that can tell us within a matter of seconds that 20.8cm of the ball\u2019s diameter had crossed the goal\u2011line but, crucially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/liverpool-manchester-city-brush-off-disappointment-defeat\" title=\"\">that 1.2cm hadn\u2019t</a>.</p> <p>In another era, that might have been given as a Liverpool goal and nobody would have been any wiser because, to go back to the original point, there will always be human error.

The team\u2019s improved results certainly make it a legitimate debate, with an immaculate record from his first five games after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/manchester-united-reading-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Reading\u2019s defeat at Old Trafford in the FA Cup</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s tuition of Marcus Rashford is a reminder that man-management is often about fluffing up a player\u2019s feathers, peacock-style, making him feel important and talking him up in public, rather than going by the more abrasive tactics favoured by the previous manager \u2013 including, in Rashford\u2019s case, an exaggerated show of touchline disgust from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after a chance went missing in one of their final games together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/05/manchester-united-reading-fa-cup-match-report\">Romelu Lukaku sinks Reading to give Solskj\u00e6r fifth Manchester United win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Solskj\u00e6r, I note, is spending a lot of time talking about the club\u2019s greatness, whereas the narrative for Mourinho was devoted to his own greatness. The sight of five players in red, already 2-0 up, streaming forward in search of another goal during the win at Newcastle felt like a step back in time and there was another flash of nostalgia to hear Solskj\u00e6r talking about there being too many sideways or backward passes for his liking.

It is the classic honeymoon period but, as a body of work, the run of victories still does not get close to Mauricio Pochettino or the other elite managers who are under consideration. Not yet, anyway.</p> <h2>Rowett\u2019s Stoke move a nice little earner but at what price?</h2> <p>So, Gary Rowett, how did that one work out for you? A decent payoff, undoubtedly, but if the stories are true about Stoke planning to move him out, what price a manager\u2019s reputation?</p> <p>Unfortunately for Rowett, he probably shouldn\u2019t expect much in the way of public sympathy given the circumstances of his departure from Derby, the club where he supposedly had a special connection, to pitch up at the other end of the A50 last summer.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t feel like much of an upgrade whatsoever but Stoke, Rowett figured, had a bigger budget and he was willing to prove the point by abandoning a team that reached last season\u2019s play-offs. All of which makes it rather awkward that Stoke currently occupy 14th position in the Championship. A \u201cRowett Out\u201d banner was brandished at the last game to accompany the chants of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d (first heard on 22 August). His team have won eight of 26 league fixtures and regular Stoke-watchers tell me the style of football has been a complete turn-off. Which, without wishing to sound too cruel, is not an accolade any Stoke manager should desire if you saw the club under some of Rowett\u2019s predecessors.</p> <p>As for Rowett\u2019s previous employers, they are going along quite nicely with Frank Lampard in charge, sixth in the Championship and not out of the question when it comes to automatic promotion. Ever heard that saying \u2013 Brian Clough, another former Derby manager, was fond of using it \u2013 about the grass not necessarily being greener on the other side?</p>",

      "bodyText": "We all make mistakes. Even us football writers, as difficult as it may be to believe, have been known to drop the odd ricket over the years. I must confess, to my eternal shame, that in the mild panic of a last-minute, potentially deadline-busting goal during my early years of covering Manchester City I managed to type in the wrong name for the scorer, Gareth Taylor, and credit his heroics to, well, this is awkward ... myself instead. The readers of the newspaper I was working for at the time \u2013 and Gareth himself, I imagine \u2013 must have been bemused to find this rather fanciful version of events slipped past the subeditors and made it into the opening line of the subsequent match report. The only consolation being that it was, thank heavens, before the years when Twitter\u2019s pitchfork mob could be found scouring the internet for fresh prey. Sometimes it is your own carelessness, sometimes it is an error during the editing process and sometimes I haven\u2019t the foggiest, if I can alert you to a recent humdinger from the Guardian\u2019s corrections and clarifications page acknowledging, courtesy of one reader, that our recipe for \u201cspaghetti with radicchio, fennel and rosemary\u201d had one problem \u2013 namely that it did not, in fact, contain spaghetti, fennel or rosemary. Some newspapers have their systems set up to change words automatically for their own style preferences \u2013 hence the unfortunate occasion when Matt Holland, the Republic of Ireland midfielder, ended up in a match report as Matt Netherlands \u2013 whereas the list of copytaking cock-ups is the stuff of legend from the days when press box routine involved dictating your match reports through old rotary\u2011style telephones and relying on the person at the other end of the line to take it down accurately. The classic story is the time Wales were playing in Latvia and one of the copytakers on duty was not entirely up to speed when it came to the names of the players, in particular the line that Rush and Hughes were up front \u2013 resulting in a match report that had a Wales attack led by Russian Jews. Another belter was penned by the motoring correspondent of the Dundee Courier for \u201cany budding Jim Clarks out there\u201d, appearing in print the following morning as \u201cany budding gym clerks\u201d, and there was a beauty from the 1998 World Cup when trouble broke out between rival fans in Marseille and the gendarmes waded in. One reporter\u2019s news desk was baffled to read that \u201cvanloads of John Barnes\u201d had arrived on the scene. The point is that we are all culpable sometimes of getting things wrong. It happens, it is life and when it comes to referees it is why, in part, I do not always see the point being too hard on our match officials. The game at the highest level has never been quicker. The referees you see demonised on social media tend to get a lot more right than wrong and, unpopular as it might be, I tend to think the assistant referees are actually rather brilliant at what they do. Because if you think it is easy to flag for a marginal offside decisions at full speed, keeping an eye on the ball while simultaneously monitoring the last line of defence and having the necessary skills to rule if a single body part \u2013 a foot, a knee, a shoulder or even an eyebrow \u2013 has strayed a few centimetres too far one way, you would be kidding yourself. At the same time, if we are being honest about our mistakes here, I do find it rather galling that when a referee misses a red-card offence \u2013 and, by that, I mean seeing what happened but misjudging the seriousness of it \u2013 the authorities are so quick to close ranks and revert to their default setting that nothing can be changed retrospectively. And yes, I suppose this could be referring to that tackle from Jonjo Shelvey that means Paul Pogba was not fit to play for Manchester United in their FA Cup tie against Reading on Saturday. It was, after all, precisely the kind of studs-up challenge that the sport wants to eliminate, we keep hearing. Yet the irony is that if the referee, Andre Marriner, said his view was blocked, or that he was looking the wrong way, Shelvey would now be eligible for a disciplinary charge and staring at a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Instead, Marriner did see it and because he awarded a free-kick against the Newcastle player the Football Association automatically lets off the player on the rather flimsy basis it does not want to be seen to be re-refereeing games. All of which strikes me as a bit of a cop-out bearing in mind what it leaves us with: one player embedding his studs into another man\u2019s thigh, injuring his opponent and getting away with it scot-free because, by the FA\u2019s logic, it has already been dealt with. If nothing else, at least this is the sort of issue that should no longer be so prevalent when the Premier League brings in VAR next season and referees will have the opportunity to review any incident. For now, however, it is quite something to try to tot up how many players over the years have been spared bans because of this strange loophole whereby the FA does not seem to grasp that punishing a player on video evidence is not actually the same thing as undermining the referee. In particular, when that referee believes the player should be punished, too. Just consider the story Mark Clattenburg tells about one match between Manchester United and Wigan when he was the referee who made a poor call for what should have been a clear red-card offence. \u201cI gave a free-kick against Wayne Rooney when, having later seen the replays, he deserved more,\u201d Clattenburg says. \u201cHe had elbowed Wigan\u2019s James McCarthy but the FA decided to take no disciplinary action because I had apparently dealt with it on the pitch.\u201d The system, Clattenburg says with some justification, is entirely flawed. Yet the most relevant part of that story is that he was referring to a match from 2011. It goes back even further \u2013 longer, indeed, than I can even remember \u2013 and every time one of these incidents comes up it doesn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference that the referee, in the vast majority of cases, is willing to accept he made a lousy call. All the FA wants to know is whether the relevant official had a view of the incident \u2013 and, if so, the case is closed. The exception was the time in 2006, during a match between Manchester City and Portsmouth, when Ben Thatcher sent Pedro Mendes into cloud-cuckoo land with a forearm smash that earned the perpetrator, rather bewilderingly, a yellow card from Dermot Gallagher, followed later by an eight-match suspension (plus an extra 15 matches suspended for two years) \u2013 but only because the FA\u2019s disciplinary chiefs knew if they didn\u2019t do anything the police were likely to intervene. Isn\u2019t it finally time to change this rule? It is actually well overdue, particularly now we have moved into an age, thinking back to that game at the Etihad on Thursday, whereby we have technology that can tell us within a matter of seconds that 20.8cm of the ball\u2019s diameter had crossed the goal\u2011line but, crucially, that 1.2cm hadn\u2019t. In another era, that might have been given as a Liverpool goal and nobody would have been any wiser because, to go back to the original point, there will always be human error. The modern sport is different: more attuned than ever to the importance of getting the key decisions right. It is just a pity, perhaps, that there is still no system in place for when a referee sees a free-kick, just not necessarily the malice, and the authorities slip into their bad old ways by insisting nothing can be done to put that right. Solskj\u00e6r enjoying a fine honeymoon but has a long way to go Already, it is impossible not to detect the beginnings of a campaign in favour of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r being given the Manchester United manager\u2019s job on a permanent basis. The team\u2019s improved results certainly make it a legitimate debate, with an immaculate record from his first five games after Reading\u2019s defeat at Old Trafford in the FA Cup on Saturday. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s tuition of Marcus Rashford is a reminder that man-management is often about fluffing up a player\u2019s feathers, peacock-style, making him feel important and talking him up in public, rather than going by the more abrasive tactics favoured by the previous manager \u2013 including, in Rashford\u2019s case, an exaggerated show of touchline disgust from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after a chance went missing in one of their final games together. Solskj\u00e6r, I note, is spending a lot of time talking about the club\u2019s greatness, whereas the narrative for Mourinho was devoted to his own greatness.

      "body": "<p>Since nearly all of his career has been spent in rebellion against his own party, I guess we should not be too surprised that Jeremy Corbyn seems so determined to defy it over Brexit. Labour members hate Brexit and they want it reversed. With parliament deadlocked and growing public support for taking the question back to the people, a large majority of Labour voters, and an even larger majority of Labour members, wants the party to throw its weight behind another referendum. Compare and contrast with a Labour leader who doesn\u2019t hate Brexit, doesn\u2019t want it to be reversed and will not help facilitate another referendum if he can possibly avoid it.</p> <p>That divide between leader and members has been pretty obvious for a long time to anyone who contemplated Mr Corbyn with clear eyes rather than wearing soft-focus lenses. The split has become more evident as the Labour frontbench has run through various tactical ruses to try to mask the tension between its members and its leader. He is what he is and that is a lifetime opponent of the EU. He has not once expressed a flicker of remorse about the result of the 2016 referendum and treats the momentum behind a second referendum not as an opportunity to be seized, but as a threat to be smothered.</p> <p>It is true that Labour\u2019s position has been deliberately fogged in ambiguities, but where Mr Corbyn really stands has always been deducible so long as you were prepared to listen properly. Back in November, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-labour-leader-corbyn-we-can-t-stop-brexit-a-1237594.html\" title=\"\">he was asked</a>: \u201cIf you could stop Brexit, would you?\u201d He replied: \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered.\u201d</p> <p>He said that even though his party conference had only recently adopted a policy that was supposed to keep another referendum on the table. He really couldn\u2019t have been clearer in November that he doesn\u2019t believe in that policy, but some people weren\u2019t listening then or they pretended not to hear him because it conflicted so starkly with the naive image of the Labour leader that they had constructed for themselves. This left them open to being shocked when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/21/jeremy-corbyn-labour-policy-leaving-eu\" title=\"\">he said</a>, just before Christmas, that he would not seek an escape from Brexit even if there was an election in the near future and Labour won it. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The promise to obey the members was easy to keep so long as their desires converged with those of the leader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I suppose you could argue that Mr Corbyn is being consistent with his convictions \u2013 or at least one set of them. But his increasing exposure as a Brexit-enabler does rather alter his profile as a rebel. During his decades as a dissident backbencher, he defied Labour leaders in the name of upholding true socialist values, as he interpreted them, against the treacheries, by his definition, of the party\u2019s establishment. This record helped him win the leadership in 2015 with a promise to create a party in which the will of the members would be paramount. That promise was highly popular with Labour supporters. Who doesn\u2019t like to be told that they will be listened to? It sustained him when he was under attack from Labour MPs. They, in turn, were threatened with deselection if they failed to defer to activists and comply with party policy.</p> <p>The promise to obey the members was easy to keep so long as their desires converged with those of the leader. Labour activists like the idea of hiking taxes on the rich and taking the railways back into public ownership. So does he. Snap. Everyone is happy. The real test of his pledge to the membership was always going to be the hard cases where his ideological convictions came into conflict with what Labour people wanted. What would Mr Corbyn do when he and his members desired something contradictory? How would he act when they had fundamentally different worldviews? Would he put aside his own preferences in deference to the sovereignty of the Labour people? Or would he behave just like the \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians he has spent a lifetime condemning and seek to subordinate the will of the members to his own opinions?</p> <p>We now know. The Brexit blowtorch has burnt away many fantasises. One of the items on the bonfire of illusions is the notion that the Labour leader is in some way a special one, so different to all other politicians as to be almost not a politician at all. It turns out that he is just another manoeuvring, equivocating hack when he wants one thing and his members want the opposite.</p> <p>This split is not a slight difference of opinion on a low-order issue. We are talking about something a bit more important than how to regulate the provision of manhole covers. This is about the most significant question to face Britain for decades. Some 73% of people currently identifying as Labour supporters think that the UK was wrong to vote to leave the EU. That rises to a whopping 89% among Labour members. As you might expect to follow, most Labour members and most Labour voters want the party to come out in full support of another referendum on Brexit, a move that would transform the chances of the country being given a fresh choice. In another referendum, 88% of Labour members and 71% of Labour voters would cast a ballot to remain within the EU. We know this thanks to the valuable work conducted by the ESRC-funded <a href=\"https://esrcpartymembersproject.org/\" title=\"\">Party Members Project</a> led by Professor Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London. These are not finely balanced results within the margin of error. Labour members, supposedly the sovereign decision-makers within the party these days, want to remain within the EU by a thumping margin of nearly nine to one.</p> <p>The Labour leader\u2019s defiance of his members means he has something in common with Theresa May. She is also at odds with her grassroots. A hefty majority of Tory members don\u2019t like the agreement negotiated by their own leader and the first preference of most of them is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/most-tory-members-would-choose-no-deal-over-may-brexit-plan\" title=\"\">leave at the end of March without any deal at all</a>. That would be grotesquely irresponsible, so Mrs May can at least argue that she is trying to put country before party when she refuses to obey the demand of Tory members for a crash-out Brexit.</p> <p>Labour members have displayed a great deal of loyalty to Mr Corbyn since he became their leader. But even a membership that has been willing to grant him the benefit of the doubt about so much else has begun to notice that he is defying them on Brexit. What\u2019s interesting is how they explain this betrayal to themselves. Asked to say why he is failing to support another referendum, about a tenth think he\u2019s just waiting for the right moment. Since there are now fewer than 90 days left before Britain is scheduled to be out of the EU, I admire these people for their patience more than I respect them for their judgment of character.</p> <p>About a third of Labour members reckon he\u2019s mainly worried about losing the support of Leave voters. This is certainly true of some members of the shadow cabinet who say things such as \u201cwe\u2019ll lose the north\u201d. But I don\u2019t think it is the most important reason for being against a referendum in the case of the leader himself. Nearly a quarter of his members put Mr Corbyn\u2019s unwillingness to embrace a people\u2019s vote down to the fact that he actually supports Brexit. They have been paying attention. The clearest thing he said in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/21/jeremy-corbyn-labour-policy-leaving-eu\" title=\"\">recent interview with the<em> Guardian</em>\u2019s Heather Stewart</a> was when he attacked the EU\u2019s rules on competition and subsidies: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be told by somebody else that we can\u2019t use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country.\u201d</p> <p>This will have a familiar ring to some older readers: it is a variation on one of the ancient arguments from the 1970s against Europe. It was often heard from Mr Corbyn\u2019s antecedents on the left who opposed what was then the EEC because they saw it as nothing better than a capitalist club constructed to do down the workers and thwart socialism. It is highly disputable whether EU membership would prevent a Corbyn government from pursuing a state-directed industrial strategy.

In a previously unpublished interview, he chides the contemporary artistic community for producing \u201csuperficial\u201d work without cultural hinterland or passion.</p> <p>\u201cMy experience of working with dancers and actors is that very few of them have much grounding in the history of their art form, and few explore the related arts \u2013 painting, music, literature and the cinema,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that so few young actors and dancers are interested in what went before.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t explore what went before, and learn from that, the present lacks depth and perspective.

He didn\u2019t invent his plots, but he reinvented and reimagined many tales that had proved themselves effective in the past.\u201d</p> <p>Kemp learned his craft at Ballet Rambert in London and with the mime artist Marcel Marceau in Paris, going on to form his own company and stage ground-breaking productions known for their flamboyant excess. Bowie took dance classes with him in the 1960s and they became friends, collaborating on the Ziggy Stardust concerts and challenging the way rock music was performed live.</p> <p>Talking to Bessell, Kemp also criticised today\u2019s training: \u201cThe rhythms and the musicality of Shakespeare\u2019s language can make the meaning clear for any audience, provided the actor has sufficient training, technique and talent. There isn\u2019t time in rehearsals to teach these skills if they are not already there. These days the actor is rarely equipped with all the performer\u2019s skills which were once de rigueur. In the past, the acrobatic harlequin in pantomime at Drury Lane was often seen, some nights later, playing Shakespeare; in later years [the Australian performer] Robert Helpmann successfully played Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon and afterwards danced the same role in his ballet at Covent Garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"561c1d2e37b0ee5fbaf342ac004a08934ba8d3ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/561c1d2e37b0ee5fbaf342ac004a08934ba8d3ce/332_0_381_476/381.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie, who was mentored by Kemp, in a 1973 production of Pierrot in Turquoise.\" width=\"381\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie, who was mentored by Kemp, in a 1973 production of Pierrot in Turquoise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scottish Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cToday the actor\u2019s training often lacks breadth and body.

It includes 30 interviews with practitioners from some of the larger theatres in the UK and the US. Actors, designers, directors and choreographers, including Gregory Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, give insights into their approaches.As head of research at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe during Mark Rylance\u2019s tenure, Bessell developed a particularly keen interest in verse-speaking techniques. She has directed plays by Shakespeare and modern playwrights on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2016 she and Kemp co-directed <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> for the Verona Shakespeare Festival.

In a previously unpublished interview, he chides the contemporary artistic community for producing \u201csuperficial\u201d work without cultural hinterland or passion. \u201cMy experience of working with dancers and actors is that very few of them have much grounding in the history of their art form, and few explore the related arts \u2013 painting, music, literature and the cinema,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that so few young actors and dancers are interested in what went before. \u201cIf you don\u2019t explore what went before, and learn from that, the present lacks depth and perspective. We see so much today that is superficial, without roots in the heart, or passion.\u201d Kemp was talking frankly to his friend, the director Jaq Bessell, for a forthcoming book on the craft of performing Shakespeare. He said: \u201cShakespeare knew what had gone before, and how little human nature changes over the centuries. He didn\u2019t invent his plots, but he reinvented and reimagined many tales that had proved themselves effective in the past.\u201d Kemp learned his craft at Ballet Rambert in London and with the mime artist Marcel Marceau in Paris, going on to form his own company and stage ground-breaking productions known for their flamboyant excess. Bowie took dance classes with him in the 1960s and they became friends, collaborating on the Ziggy Stardust concerts and challenging the way rock music was performed live. Talking to Bessell, Kemp also criticised today\u2019s training: \u201cThe rhythms and the musicality of Shakespeare\u2019s language can make the meaning clear for any audience, provided the actor has sufficient training, technique and talent. There isn\u2019t time in rehearsals to teach these skills if they are not already there. These days the actor is rarely equipped with all the performer\u2019s skills which were once de rigueur. In the past, the acrobatic harlequin in pantomime at Drury Lane was often seen, some nights later, playing Shakespeare; in later years [the Australian performer] Robert Helpmann successfully played Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon and afterwards danced the same role in his ballet at Covent Garden. \u201cToday the actor\u2019s training often lacks breadth and body. Dance is often not included in drama school courses, and if it is there\u2019s certainly not enough of it.\u201d The book, Shakespeare in Action, will be published by Bloomsbury on 24 January. It includes 30 interviews with practitioners from some of the larger theatres in the UK and the US. Actors, designers, directors and choreographers, including Gregory Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, give insights into their approaches.As head of research at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe during Mark Rylance\u2019s tenure, Bessell developed a particularly keen interest in verse-speaking techniques. She has directed plays by Shakespeare and modern playwrights on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2016 she and Kemp co-directed Romeo and Juliet for the Verona Shakespeare Festival. Her book is dedicated to him.",

For the Good Times is narrated by a jailed republican foot soldier, Sammy, who recalls doing the IRA\u2019s dirty work in 70s Belfast with a debonair gang, for whom a neat pocket square and an ability to hold one\u2019s own on the relative merits of Frank Sinatra and Perry Como count nearly as much as knowing how to rig up a bomb or carry out a kidnapping. Sammy\u2019s memories pivot on his friendship with a fellow republican, Tommy, whose father helps them make their name among paramilitary high-ups when he tips them off about a hidden stash of weapons from Libya. But things sour once Sammy and Tommy get involved with the same woman, Kathy, a waitress they\u2019re ordered to abduct to make her husband settle a debt he owes for running a shop on IRA turf. Despite being held hostage, Kathy gives her captors as good as she gets \u2013 she\u2019s no victim \u2013 which is one of the reasons to wonder what Keenan is up to when she later seduces Sammy in a nightclub toilet, her abduction apparently forgotten. While the novel turns out to be smarter than you would guess from this moment, Kathy\u2019s fantasy-woman act \u2013 added to the heavily stylised violence \u2013 raises one or two early doubts about Keenan\u2019s purpose. Witness the opening scene, in which Tommy randomly blasts passers-by from the roof of a speeding car while belting out Como, or the passage in which Sammy announces that 1977 was \u201cabout to be the bloodiest summer of our lives. And I decided to kick it off in style\u201d, prior to shooting dead a suspected traitor in her sleep. Yet any sense that Keenan is glamorising the bloodshed rubs up against the relentless pratfalls complicating Sammy\u2019s operations. Retrieving that arms cache entails ending up waist-deep in sewage; one early-morning assassination has to be passed off as stag-do shenanigans when a homeless man buttonholes Sammy just as he\u2019s trying to dump the victim\u2019s body in a bin. At one point, his commander says, \u201cStop acting like fucking clowns... see if the IRA could dispense with Irishmen altogether, we\u2019d be one fuck of a formidable fighting unit.\u201d Bumpkin comedy is a steady source of fun here. \u201cWho\u2019s your man? Your man what did all the paintings,\u201d asks Tommy. \u201cPlenty of guys did the paintings,\u201d says Sammy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t fucking narrow it down much. I\u2019m talking about your man Picatsto... What do you know about Picatsto?\u201d A visit to Glasgow proves eye-opening, not least when, while attempting to lie low, the pair find themselves invited to an orgy, and Sammy tells us he\u2019d \u201cnever seen a fucking shaved pussy in my life, you were lucky to get a fucking clean pussy in Belfast\u201d. Keenan generates an anarchic voltage from how suddenly events change direction, or get catastrophically out of hand. But as Sammy suspects infiltration and betrayal afoot, his tale \u2013 part farce, part history lesson \u2013 offers the conventional pleasures of a thriller, too, while reminding us how the rights and wrongs of any conflict are always a matter of perspective (Sammy, we come to realise, is speaking for the benefit of an unseen English interlocutor). Yet it\u2019s far from preachy, and with so much going on \u2013 from dream sequences to segments recasting the action as a superhero adventure \u2013 it proves alarmingly easy to forget what we\u2019re actually reading: the unrepentant testimony of a cold-blooded killer. \u2022 For the Good Times by David Keenan is published by Faber (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>A young man walks into a bar and meets Sam Shepard, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. The man is Tim Roth. The year is 1990, and the actor is in New York to film <em>Jumpin\u2019 at the Boneyard</em>, a bleak movie about drug abuse. Roth, who planned to nurse a quiet beer while watching American football, found himself in conversation with Walken and Shepard. \u201cI thought: \u2018What the fuck have I walked into?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt was purely by chance.\u201d By the time he left, Shepard had promised to write him a part in his next play. It was not the first time Roth had been in the right place at the right time, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p> <p>This unlikely encounter took place at a propitious time, just as Roth was starring as Van Gogh in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/robert-altman-genius-who-reinvented-language-of-cinema\" title=\"\">Robert Altman</a>\u2019s <em>Vincent &amp; Theo</em>, and shortly before his comic double act with Gary Oldman in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/08/tom-stoppard-is-bashful-winner-of-lifetime-achievement-award\" title=\"\">Tom Stoppard</a>\u2019s <em>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead</em> hit the festival circuit. Writing in the <em>New Yorker</em>, Pauline Kael described Roth\u2019s acting as \u201ca form of kinetic discharge\u201d. After a decade in which the film industry had largely curdled into a hit machine of bland studio blockbusters, independent film was stirring into life and craft was back in vogue.</p> <p>Due back in London after filming, Roth instead chose to go prospecting in LA, expecting \u201cto get swiftly kicked out the door\u201d. Like his encounter in a Manhattan bar, serendipity intervened. Its name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/12/ennio-morricone-denies-calling-quentin-tarantino-a-cretin\" title=\"\">Quentin Tarantino</a>, the movie was <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>, and it changed everything. </p> <p>\u201cHe came back to my flat after a night in a bar, and we read every scene with all the characters, had a great time \u2013 and he gave me the job,\u201d says Roth. \u201cI was very fucking lucky. I got given a window, and I jumped.\u201d When Shepard, good as his word, called back with a part in his next Broadway play, it was too late. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Roth says. \u201cI always regret I lost that opportunity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5e80f6482a367831e72fd84e58584bb9594883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5e80f6482a367831e72fd84e58584bb9594883/497_0_4973_2986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Roth spreadeagled on snow, blood on him and the snow and a gun a few feet away\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roth of ages: In Tin Star.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky UK Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are sitting on the veranda at the Langham, an old-world, old Hollywood hotel that has been servicing the rich since the 1930s. A sweep of lawn is framed by slender palm trees and the tropical blooms of birds of paradise. Roth grins. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheesy, right?\u201d Nearby a large party of women fills a room furnished in leather and burgundy wood, the tables a jumble of three-tiered cake plates and pots of tea. \u201cIt\u2019s outside of the Hollywood scene,\u201d Roth explains. \u201cThere are people who live around here, but you never see \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>Next summer, the 57-year-old actor can be seen in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/01/tarantinos-controversial-manson-film-casts-brad-pitt-alongside-leonardo-dicaprio\" title=\"\">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a></em>, his fifth movie with Tarantino, this one set during the Manson Family murders, and stuffed with stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Al Pacino and Margot Robbie. \u201cI think there\u2019s 100-odd characters in it,\u201d says Roth, though he will not be drawn into discussing details.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to get beaten up every day \u2013 I didn\u2019t know how to fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, there\u2019s <em>Tin Star</em>, a kind of contemporary western set in the Canadian Rockies, and returning to Sky this month for a second season. Roth plays British cop Jim Worth with the kind of shuffling weariness of those who know that bad guys usually win \u2013 and reeling from the brutal murder of his son, all while going head-to-head with a mendacious oil company that has sent an executive (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/christina-hendricks\" title=\"\">Christina Hendricks</a>) to cajole and persuade (and maybe dispatch) troublemaking naysayers.</p> <p>After so many American roles, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear Roth using his real accent, still unchanged by the decades of California living. Although the city is crawling with Brits now, he says it was different in 1990. \u201cAt the time that I came out here there were no English actors, except for Gary [Oldman]. He put the bridge out for me, made it seem possible.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Roth rarely misses</strong></em> an opportunity to give credit where it\u2019s due, and his heroes and mentors materialise throughout our conversation, like old friends passing through: fellow actors such as Ray Winstone and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/28/john-hurt-obituary\" title=\"\">John Hurt</a>, former teachers, and the writers and directors \u2013 Alan Clarke, Ken Loach and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/oct/07/barrie-keeffe-a-loss-to-journalism-but-what-a-gift-to-playwriting\" title=\"\">Barrie Keeffe</a> \u2013 who he credits for giving him a career. Roth is grateful to have grown up in 70s London, when a generation of writers were responding to Britain\u2019s post-industrial decline with visceral social realism. It was a world he was familiar with. Cast as a racist skinhead in <em>Made in Britain</em> he was able to nail the nihilism, anger and violence of white working-class men because he\u2019d had a masterclass in how bullies behave at his Lambeth high school. He recalls daily riots, kids charging in through windows, street battles. \u201cI hated it because I used to get beaten up every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to fight.\u201d</p> <p>The bullying grew so bad Roth\u2019s mum moved him to Croydon Tech. \u201cI messed that up, so they sent me back to school,\u201d he says. In the end, he just bunked off altogether. \u201cWe\u2019d put on our uniform, throw a change of clothes in our bag, and head up to the West End, which was a dangerous place to be at that age,\u201d he says. \u201cA couple of my mates got lost into that sex trade shit.\u201d Roth managed to avoid that fate, and spent much of his time at the ICA on the Mall. \u201cAt that time, it was run by three gay guys, and it was very underfunded, very scruffy, but very, very cool,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey gave us safety, and they talked to us as equals, and they gave us some kind of artistic credibility in our sort of small minds.\u201d Invigorated, he returned to school and flourished. The bullies had left and the atmosphere had changed. \u201cWe got to have real conversations about stuff we cared about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979e2d6353c9ad7fd93c0d76140b8f5222efa440\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979e2d6353c9ad7fd93c0d76140b8f5222efa440/0_173_4125_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Roth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s not television any more \u2013 it\u2019s something completely different\u2019: Tim Roth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Meimoon/Quadriga Management</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Punk was on the horizon, mutiny was in the air. Roth organised Rock Against Racism benefits and joined Students Against the Nazis. He dodged rocks on protest marches with his dad. Most importantly, he found his calling, collaborating with a friend on scripts based on a mash-up of the Marx Brothers and Samuel Beckett. \u201cWe fell in love with <em>Waiting for Godot</em>,\u201d he says, sheepishly. \u201cI was going through an utterly obnoxious phase.\u201d</p> <p>He abandoned a place at art college to focus on his acting; there was a lot of angry-young-man stuff by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/20/steven-berkoff-interview-baddies-harvey-weinstein-play\" title=\"\">Steven Berkoff</a> and Keeffe in cramped rooms above pubs. Then came Trevor, the swastika-tattooed delinquent in <em>Made in Britain</em>. Watching it now you are aware of Roth\u2019s alert and restless eyes, the insolent smile, the simmering intimation of violence. That it was put out on ITV seems extraordinary today, but perhaps no less so at the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My father was a\u00a0good man, but a\u00a0complete mess because of his life and the war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The screenwriter David Leland later recalled that the broadcast left people wondering whether their TVs were \u201cplugged in properly\u201d. When Trevor hurls bricks through the windows of Pakistani\u2019s home, yelling \u201cI\u2019m British\u201d, it unrolls like an origins story for the social disintegration that fuelled the referendum result in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI understand why the Brexit thing happened because Trump happened in America \u2013 I get what\u2019s at the root of it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see the knee-jerk of racism which runs through the whole lot.\u201d He believes our only option is to accommodate immigration. \u201cAs a result of climate change, and of economic corruption, there\u2019s a migration system at work. People have got to move \u2013 and when the water levels rise they\u2019re going to move even quicker.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Unusually, his father</strong></em> was the rare migrant who moved from New York to Liverpool. Roth is toying with making a movie based on his story. \u201cHe was from Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, which was really rough at that time, and he had a big and very nasty family,\u201d he says. \u201cThey did the reverse thing and got out of the States. When my father was 11, he was working in brick factories in Liverpool, but they persuaded his father to get them out of there so he moved to Kent and was put to work in the hop fields.\u201d By the age of 17, Roth senior was flying with bomber command in the Second World War.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a good man but he was a complete mess because of his life and the war,\u201d says Roth. \u201cOne of the last conversations I ever had with him, he asked: \u2018Did my dad ever fuck with you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah, me too.\u2019 The bottom falls out of your world, but it gives you a voice. As messy as your life can be, as completely complicated as anything is, there has to be a window you can climb through, and he gave me that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73ae808b40d49235d06059c98fcf2986b8a5657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73ae808b40d49235d06059c98fcf2986b8a5657/0_248_4192_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Roth in \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 - 1982 ITV Archive Drama focusing on 16-year-old Trevor, just out of school, perceptive, articulate, unemployed, a skinhead with a swastika on his forehead and facing yet another appearance in the juvenile court.

Fuelled by his own abuse, Roth\u2019s directorial debut, <em>The War Zone</em>, a movie soggy with rain and despair, explores the impact of incest, its destructiveness, its poison. It\u2019s an astounding movie, shot through with poetic moments of tenderness that make the scenes of sexual violence all the more horrifying. We are not used to seeing monsters portrayed as humans. Roth wanted to show how abusers make their victims complicit in their abuse. \u201cThey are directors and you are the actor, you perform it for them, you keep their secret,\u201d he says. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tarantino came back to my flat and we read every Reservoir Dogs scene</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been 20 years since Roth made <em>The War Zone</em>. Has he thought of directing another movie? \u201cI wanted to make sure my kids [he has three sons, one by Lori Baker in 1984 and two by his wife, Nikki Butler] went to school without coming out with a mortgage hanging around their necks,\u201d he says. He has been sitting on a script for <em>King Lear</em> that Harold Pinter wrote for him, and may direct a movie in Mexico based on a novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/06/fidel-castro-worked-on-gabriel-garcia-marquez-manuscripts\" title=\"\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</a>. \u201cThe family has given it their blessing,\u201d he says. </p> <p>And, of course, there\u2019s <em>Tin Star</em>, in which the episodes allow for a lot of collaboration, just the way Roth likes it. \u201cWe spent a lot of time, myself and the producer Alison Jackson, working on improvising the dialogue and changing the nature of the story.\u201d Was he worried that a class act like <em>Tin Star </em>would be lost in the crowd of so many other great shows? He was not \u2013 that was an old person\u2019s way of thinking of TV. \u201cI track it through my kids and their generation,\u201d says Roth, before giving me a short tutorial on binge-watching. \u201cIt\u2019s not television any more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something completely different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"997d4035516d475e5f9c0d417588425141da5ddd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/997d4035516d475e5f9c0d417588425141da5ddd/0_56_2528_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Roth and Quentin Tarantino at The Hateful Eight film premiere after party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US ally: with longtime collaborator Quentin Tarantino at The Hateful Eight premiere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roth does not expect to live in the UK again, but it\u2019s clear the contours of his working-class childhood still shape his career choices. He plays rich arseholes sparingly. Even his Oscar-nominated turn as the aristo-rapist Archibald Cunningham in <em>Rob Roy </em>operated as a vehicle to illuminate injustice. He says Tarantino gets a kick from writing \u201cfake posh\u201d roles for him, because he can sense his antagonistic relationship to class, a clue perhaps to the kind of character he may play in <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>.</p> <p>His relationship to Tarantino has defined his life in the US in more ways than one. He was in Sundance for the premiere of <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> in 1992 when he met Nikki Butler. A year later, the two were in Belize where Roth was filming <em>Heart of Darkness </em>with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/25/nicolas-roeg-obituary\" title=\"\">Nicolas Roeg</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s when we got married, in the jungle by the river there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe decided to run away and do it on a film set.\u201d Who proposed? \u201cI did. I went and got a tattoo of her initials on my arm and then I went and had a beer with my mate, and went, \u2018Right then, we\u2019re off\u2019, and I got back and did the deed. It\u2019s a private story, but she thought I was going to break up with her.\u201d He chuckles fondly. \u201cIt was a good one.\u201d</p> <p>As Roth departs to meet the woman he still calls the \u201cmissus\u201d, a group of friends sit beside us and proceed to order margaritas. It\u2019s shortly after 1pm, and the sun is bright and high. The atmosphere is festive. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird world,\u201d Roth says in his gruff London accent, but despite this he seems, as always, perfectly placed.</p> <p><em>Series 2 of Tin Star begins on Sky Atlantic on 24 January</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A young man walks into a bar and meets Sam Shepard, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. The man is Tim Roth. The year is 1990, and the actor is in New York to film Jumpin\u2019 at the Boneyard, a bleak movie about drug abuse. Roth, who planned to nurse a quiet beer while watching American football, found himself in conversation with Walken and Shepard. \u201cI thought: \u2018What the fuck have I walked into?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt was purely by chance.\u201d By the time he left, Shepard had promised to write him a part in his next play. It was not the first time Roth had been in the right place at the right time, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. This unlikely encounter took place at a propitious time, just as Roth was starring as Van Gogh in Robert Altman\u2019s Vincent &amp; Theo, and shortly before his comic double act with Gary Oldman in Tom Stoppard\u2019s Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead hit the festival circuit. Writing in the New Yorker, Pauline Kael described Roth\u2019s acting as \u201ca form of kinetic discharge\u201d. After a decade in which the film industry had largely curdled into a hit machine of bland studio blockbusters, independent film was stirring into life and craft was back in vogue. Due back in London after filming, Roth instead chose to go prospecting in LA, expecting \u201cto get swiftly kicked out the door\u201d. Like his encounter in a Manhattan bar, serendipity intervened. Its name was Quentin Tarantino, the movie was Reservoir Dogs, and it changed everything. \u201cHe came back to my flat after a night in a bar, and we read every scene with all the characters, had a great time \u2013 and he gave me the job,\u201d says Roth. \u201cI was very fucking lucky. I got given a window, and I jumped.\u201d When Shepard, good as his word, called back with a part in his next Broadway play, it was too late. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Roth says. \u201cI always regret I lost that opportunity.\u201d We are sitting on the veranda at the Langham, an old-world, old Hollywood hotel that has been servicing the rich since the 1930s. A sweep of lawn is framed by slender palm trees and the tropical blooms of birds of paradise. Roth grins. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheesy, right?\u201d Nearby a large party of women fills a room furnished in leather and burgundy wood, the tables a jumble of three-tiered cake plates and pots of tea. \u201cIt\u2019s outside of the Hollywood scene,\u201d Roth explains. \u201cThere are people who live around here, but you never see \u2019em.\u201d Next summer, the 57-year-old actor can be seen in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, his fifth movie with Tarantino, this one set during the Manson Family murders, and stuffed with stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Al Pacino and Margot Robbie. \u201cI think there\u2019s 100-odd characters in it,\u201d says Roth, though he will not be drawn into discussing details. In the meantime, there\u2019s Tin Star, a kind of contemporary western set in the Canadian Rockies, and returning to Sky this month for a second season. Roth plays British cop Jim Worth with the kind of shuffling weariness of those who know that bad guys usually win \u2013 and reeling from the brutal murder of his son, all while going head-to-head with a mendacious oil company that has sent an executive (Christina Hendricks) to cajole and persuade (and maybe dispatch) troublemaking naysayers. After so many American roles, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear Roth using his real accent, still unchanged by the decades of California living. Although the city is crawling with Brits now, he says it was different in 1990. \u201cAt the time that I came out here there were no English actors, except for Gary [Oldman]. He put the bridge out for me, made it seem possible.\u201d Roth rarely misses an opportunity to give credit where it\u2019s due, and his heroes and mentors materialise throughout our conversation, like old friends passing through: fellow actors such as Ray Winstone and John Hurt, former teachers, and the writers and directors \u2013 Alan Clarke, Ken Loach and Barrie Keeffe \u2013 who he credits for giving him a career. Roth is grateful to have grown up in 70s London, when a generation of writers were responding to Britain\u2019s post-industrial decline with visceral social realism. It was a world he was familiar with. Cast as a racist skinhead in Made in Britain he was able to nail the nihilism, anger and violence of white working-class men because he\u2019d had a masterclass in how bullies behave at his Lambeth high school. He recalls daily riots, kids charging in through windows, street battles. \u201cI hated it because I used to get beaten up every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to fight.\u201d The bullying grew so bad Roth\u2019s mum moved him to Croydon Tech. \u201cI messed that up, so they sent me back to school,\u201d he says. In the end, he just bunked off altogether. \u201cWe\u2019d put on our uniform, throw a change of clothes in our bag, and head up to the West End, which was a dangerous place to be at that age,\u201d he says. \u201cA couple of my mates got lost into that sex trade shit.\u201d Roth managed to avoid that fate, and spent much of his time at the ICA on the Mall. \u201cAt that time, it was run by three gay guys, and it was very underfunded, very scruffy, but very, very cool,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey gave us safety, and they talked to us as equals, and they gave us some kind of artistic credibility in our sort of small minds.\u201d Invigorated, he returned to school and flourished. The bullies had left and the atmosphere had changed. \u201cWe got to have real conversations about stuff we cared about.\u201d Punk was on the horizon, mutiny was in the air. Roth organised Rock Against Racism benefits and joined Students Against the Nazis. He dodged rocks on protest marches with his dad. Most importantly, he found his calling, collaborating with a friend on scripts based on a mash-up of the Marx Brothers and Samuel Beckett. \u201cWe fell in love with Waiting for Godot,\u201d he says, sheepishly. \u201cI was going through an utterly obnoxious phase.\u201d He abandoned a place at art college to focus on his acting; there was a lot of angry-young-man stuff by Steven Berkoff and Keeffe in cramped rooms above pubs. Then came Trevor, the swastika-tattooed delinquent in Made in Britain. Watching it now you are aware of Roth\u2019s alert and restless eyes, the insolent smile, the simmering intimation of violence. That it was put out on ITV seems extraordinary today, but perhaps no less so at the time. The screenwriter David Leland later recalled that the broadcast left people wondering whether their TVs were \u201cplugged in properly\u201d. When Trevor hurls bricks through the windows of Pakistani\u2019s home, yelling \u201cI\u2019m British\u201d, it unrolls like an origins story for the social disintegration that fuelled the referendum result in 2016. \u201cI understand why the Brexit thing happened because Trump happened in America \u2013 I get what\u2019s at the root of it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see the knee-jerk of racism which runs through the whole lot.\u201d He believes our only option is to accommodate immigration. \u201cAs a result of climate change, and of economic corruption, there\u2019s a migration system at work. People have got to move \u2013 and when the water levels rise they\u2019re going to move even quicker.\u201d Unusually, his father was the rare migrant who moved from New York to Liverpool. Roth is toying with making a movie based on his story. \u201cHe was from Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, which was really rough at that time, and he had a big and very nasty family,\u201d he says. \u201cThey did the reverse thing and got out of the States. When my father was 11, he was working in brick factories in Liverpool, but they persuaded his father to get them out of there so he moved to Kent and was put to work in the hop fields.\u201d By the age of 17, Roth senior was flying with bomber command in the Second World War. \u201cHe was a good man but he was a complete mess because of his life and the war,\u201d says Roth. \u201cOne of the last conversations I ever had with him, he asked: \u2018Did my dad ever fuck with you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah, me too.\u2019 The bottom falls out of your world, but it gives you a voice. As messy as your life can be, as completely complicated as anything is, there has to be a window you can climb through, and he gave me that.\u201d In the midst of the palms and the endless blue of the sky, Roth\u2019s unvarnished delivery of this father-son confessional lands like a sucker punch. Fuelled by his own abuse, Roth\u2019s directorial debut, The War Zone, a movie soggy with rain and despair, explores the impact of incest, its destructiveness, its poison. It\u2019s an astounding movie, shot through with poetic moments of tenderness that make the scenes of sexual violence all the more horrifying. We are not used to seeing monsters portrayed as humans. Roth wanted to show how abusers make their victims complicit in their abuse. \u201cThey are directors and you are the actor, you perform it for them, you keep their secret,\u201d he says. It\u2019s been 20 years since Roth made The War Zone. Has he thought of directing another movie? \u201cI wanted to make sure my kids [he has three sons, one by Lori Baker in 1984 and two by his wife, Nikki Butler] went to school without coming out with a mortgage hanging around their necks,\u201d he says. He has been sitting on a script for King Lear that Harold Pinter wrote for him, and may direct a movie in Mexico based on a novel by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. \u201cThe family has given it their blessing,\u201d he says. And, of course, there\u2019s Tin Star, in which the episodes allow for a lot of collaboration, just the way Roth likes it. \u201cWe spent a lot of time, myself and the producer Alison Jackson, working on improvising the dialogue and changing the nature of the story.\u201d Was he worried that a class act like Tin Star would be lost in the crowd of so many other great shows? He was not \u2013 that was an old person\u2019s way of thinking of TV. \u201cI track it through my kids and their generation,\u201d says Roth, before giving me a short tutorial on binge-watching. \u201cIt\u2019s not television any more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something completely different.\u201d Roth does not expect to live in the UK again, but it\u2019s clear the contours of his working-class childhood still shape his career choices. He plays rich arseholes sparingly. Even his Oscar-nominated turn as the aristo-rapist Archibald Cunningham in Rob Roy operated as a vehicle to illuminate injustice. He says Tarantino gets a kick from writing \u201cfake posh\u201d roles for him, because he can sense his antagonistic relationship to class, a clue perhaps to the kind of character he may play in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. His relationship to Tarantino has defined his life in the US in more ways than one. He was in Sundance for the premiere of Reservoir Dogs in 1992 when he met Nikki Butler. A year later, the two were in Belize where Roth was filming Heart of Darkness with Nicolas Roeg. \u201cThat\u2019s when we got married, in the jungle by the river there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe decided to run away and do it on a film set.\u201d Who proposed? \u201cI did. I went and got a tattoo of her initials on my arm and then I went and had a beer with my mate, and went, \u2018Right then, we\u2019re off\u2019, and I got back and did the deed. It\u2019s a private story, but she thought I was going to break up with her.\u201d He chuckles fondly. \u201cIt was a good one.\u201d As Roth departs to meet the woman he still calls the \u201cmissus\u201d, a group of friends sit beside us and proceed to order margaritas. It\u2019s shortly after 1pm, and the sun is bright and high. The atmosphere is festive. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird world,\u201d Roth says in his gruff London accent, but despite this he seems, as always, perfectly placed. Series 2 of Tin Star begins on Sky Atlantic on 24 January",

This supermoon will be a \u201cblood\u201d moon \u2013 because of the reddish hue the moon takes during the eclipse \u2013 caused by the effect of Earth\u2019s atmosphere on different wavelengths of light.

      "body": "<h2>Film: Harry Wootliff</h2> \n<p>Leeds-born writer and director Harry Wootliff\u2019s journey into film-making came via a stint as a performer: she trained as a dancer and actor before turning her attention to writing. Things clicked into place when she made her first short, <em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/44565663\" title=\"\">Nits</a></em>, a multi-award winning heart-tug of a film that earned a prestigious slot in Cannes.</p> \n<p>\u201cI remember standing on set, looking at the actress and thinking, this is perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI get to act through someone else. I don\u2019t have to be the focus. It was a revelation really.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps because of her experience as an actor that Wootliff brings such an acute emotional intelligence to her work with her stars.</p> \n<p>We meet in London\u2019s Soho, around the corner from the post-production studio where Wootliff is editing two episodes of the ITV series <em><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/cast-announced-itvs-new-emotional-thriller-deep-water\" title=\"\">Deep Water</a></em>. Warm and funny, with a ready laugh, she says the idea behind her feature debut, <em><a href=\"http://film.britishcouncil.org/only-you\" title=\"\">Only You</a></em> (due out in the summer), was to tell \u201ca contemporary relationship story, where you really see what goes on behind closed doors. I wanted the problem between them to be that they couldn\u2019t conceive a child. At the time, I was trying to get pregnant. At the beginning of development, I didn\u2019t have a baby; by the time we shot, I had a two-year-old. So partly I was tapping into how I felt.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"79045c55-a785-444f-b548-3d2b708931fd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Toby MacDonald</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The director\u2019s charming debut feature,&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOoYkJMzLi0\">Old Boys</a></i>, starring Alex Lawther, is released in February.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Marcus Rutherford</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The actor made a strong film debut with London riots drama&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKEzST2U7o\">Obey</a></i>; his next feature,&nbsp;<i>County Lines</i>, is in production.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Ella Smith</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stars in artist Richard Billingham\u2019s directorial debut,&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9kSbxwIiUg\">Ray &amp; Liz</a></i>, based on his memories of growing up in a Black Country council flat.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s an intimate, stingingly honest film driven by two extraordinary performances. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/laia-costa-victoria-one-take-thriller-interview\" title=\"\">Laia Costa</a>, fresh from carrying the German single-shot thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/03/victoria-sebastian-schipper-observer-review\" title=\"\">Victoria</a></em>, plays Elena, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s, living and working in Glasgow. She meets postgrad student Jake (Josh O\u2019Connor, who dazzled in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/03/gods-own-country-review\" title=\"\">God\u2019s Own Country</a></em>) by chance, when they argue over a taxi on New Year\u2019s Eve. The connection is instant. And despite a 10-year age gap, they start a relationship that feels just right. But their happy-ever-after story involves a wish for children.</p> \n<p>For Wootliff, representation is a key issue \u2013 it\u2019s not good enough just to see more women\u2019s stories in cinema. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a new wave of feminism. But I sometimes think it\u2019s all about showing women to be very strong. I like my character because she\u2019s a lot of things: she\u2019s vulnerable, irrational, funny. That\u2019s a woman. We have qualities that are deemed as less admirable \u2013 perhaps because we are in a male-dominated society \u2013 so why shouldn\u2019t we see them?\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-ide\" title=\"\">Wendy Ide</a></strong></p> \n<h2>Science: Anna Perdrix Rosell</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b58d98b5b4dd5647ed9814a404468b28b7662a4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b58d98b5b4dd5647ed9814a404468b28b7662a4/549_0_4912_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Perdrix Rosell photographed at Imperial College\u2019s White City Incubator, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Perdrix Rosell photographed at Imperial College\u2019s White City Incubator, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Anna Perdrix Rosell admits that she was always destined to become a scientist, ever since she first learned to operate a microscope at the age of five.

She recalls the time that her uncle and aunt were both diagnosed with cancer, when she was 15. \u201cShe\u2019s still with us, but he died soon after he was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been determined to pursue cancer research.\u201d</p> \n<p>With Sixfold, she is hoping to change the way we treat different cancer types. Instead of defining tumours by their location in the body, Perdrix Rosell believes we should characterise them based on the receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, and use this to deliver drugs exclusively to cancer cells, without affecting healthy cells. Along with Sixfold\u2019s co-founders George Foot and Zuzanna Brzosko, she has started to test her theories on lab mice. Sixfold\u2019s tiny nanoparticles are used to deliver high doses of medication directly to various tumours \u2013 ranging from colorectal cancer to forms of brain and lung cancer \u2013 all of which have a common surface receptor.</p> \n<p>If this succeeds during 2019, she hopes to fast-track her treatments into human trials. Her ideas have already captured the imagination of several Silicon Valley and UK investors, and Perdrix Rosell aims to raise more financial backing during the next funding round. In the meantime, there is the small matter of finishing her PhD, and perhaps squeezing in a rare moment to chill out. \u201cI basically have two full-time jobs at the moment, and I simply have no time,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhen I do have free time, I sleep!\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-cox\" title=\"\">David Cox</a></strong></p> \n<h2>Food: Rachel Ama</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b35c6c1a2fb760d0137b09d2ecae9225449cb2e6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b35c6c1a2fb760d0137b09d2ecae9225449cb2e6/718_0_3634_3634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s not just kale and celery\u2019: food blogger Rachel Ama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s not just kale and celery\u2019: food blogger Rachel Ama.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Four years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.rachelama.com/\" title=\"\">Rachel Ama</a> gave up meat, fish, eggs and dairy more or less overnight after watching online documentaries exposing cruelty in animal agriculture, she received a lot of raised eyebrows from her friends and family. \u201cNo one around me was vegan,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand everyone was constantly asking me, \u2018Rachel, what are you eating?

Later chapters explore hair in relation to African mathematics, mapping and coding, and include fascinating stories of how slaves used braiding to communicate. The book, to be published in May, is likely to shift many stale conversations, and prove that black people\u2019s concerns around hair are anything but superficial. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlie-brinkhurst-cuff\" title=\"\">Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff</a></strong></p> \n<h2>Pop: Yellow Days</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"738311da93b0d4eb8b8cc84004544dbad4528c99\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/738311da93b0d4eb8b8cc84004544dbad4528c99/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George van den Broek, AKA Yellow Days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George van den Broek, AKA Yellow Days.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t switch off from music,\u201d says George van den Broek, the 19-year-old multi-instrumentalist from Haslemere in Surrey who records as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/09/yellow-days-review-\" title=\"\">Yellow Days</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s my life.

      "bodyText": "Film: Harry Wootliff Leeds-born writer and director Harry Wootliff\u2019s journey into film-making came via a stint as a performer: she trained as a dancer and actor before turning her attention to writing. Things clicked into place when she made her first short, Nits, a multi-award winning heart-tug of a film that earned a prestigious slot in Cannes. \u201cI remember standing on set, looking at the actress and thinking, this is perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI get to act through someone else. I don\u2019t have to be the focus. It was a revelation really.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps because of her experience as an actor that Wootliff brings such an acute emotional intelligence to her work with her stars. We meet in London\u2019s Soho, around the corner from the post-production studio where Wootliff is editing two episodes of the ITV series Deep Water. Warm and funny, with a ready laugh, she says the idea behind her feature debut, Only You (due out in the summer), was to tell \u201ca contemporary relationship story, where you really see what goes on behind closed doors. I wanted the problem between them to be that they couldn\u2019t conceive a child. At the time, I was trying to get pregnant. At the beginning of development, I didn\u2019t have a baby; by the time we shot, I had a two-year-old. So partly I was tapping into how I felt.\u201d It\u2019s an intimate, stingingly honest film driven by two extraordinary performances. Laia Costa, fresh from carrying the German single-shot thriller Victoria, plays Elena, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s, living and working in Glasgow. She meets postgrad student Jake (Josh O\u2019Connor, who dazzled in God\u2019s Own Country) by chance, when they argue over a taxi on New Year\u2019s Eve. The connection is instant. And despite a 10-year age gap, they start a relationship that feels just right. But their happy-ever-after story involves a wish for children. For Wootliff, representation is a key issue \u2013 it\u2019s not good enough just to see more women\u2019s stories in cinema. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a new wave of feminism. But I sometimes think it\u2019s all about showing women to be very strong. I like my character because she\u2019s a lot of things: she\u2019s vulnerable, irrational, funny. That\u2019s a woman. We have qualities that are deemed as less admirable \u2013 perhaps because we are in a male-dominated society \u2013 so why shouldn\u2019t we see them?\u201d Wendy Ide Science: Anna Perdrix Rosell Anna Perdrix Rosell admits that she was always destined to become a scientist, ever since she first learned to operate a microscope at the age of five. As a child growing up in northern Spain, Perdrix Rosell would spend many hours poring over everything from blood spots to bits of vegetables, fascinated by the intricate patterns of the tiny cells. \u201cMy dad and I would collect samples together,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe had his own company, developing forms of pest control for agriculture, but he was a frustrated biologist at heart.\u201d Two decades on, Perdrix Rosell is one of Europe\u2019s leading young scientists, having launched her own startup, Sixfold Bioscience \u2013 which aims to improve the way we deliver treatments to cancer patients \u2013 as well as undertaking a PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in London, all by the age of 26. But her journey to the frontiers of cancer medicine was initially fuelled by family tragedy. She recalls the time that her uncle and aunt were both diagnosed with cancer, when she was 15. \u201cShe\u2019s still with us, but he died soon after he was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been determined to pursue cancer research.\u201d With Sixfold, she is hoping to change the way we treat different cancer types. Instead of defining tumours by their location in the body, Perdrix Rosell believes we should characterise them based on the receptors on the surface of the cell membrane, and use this to deliver drugs exclusively to cancer cells, without affecting healthy cells. Along with Sixfold\u2019s co-founders George Foot and Zuzanna Brzosko, she has started to test her theories on lab mice. Sixfold\u2019s tiny nanoparticles are used to deliver high doses of medication directly to various tumours \u2013 ranging from colorectal cancer to forms of brain and lung cancer \u2013 all of which have a common surface receptor. If this succeeds during 2019, she hopes to fast-track her treatments into human trials. Her ideas have already captured the imagination of several Silicon Valley and UK investors, and Perdrix Rosell aims to raise more financial backing during the next funding round. In the meantime, there is the small matter of finishing her PhD, and perhaps squeezing in a rare moment to chill out. \u201cI basically have two full-time jobs at the moment, and I simply have no time,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhen I do have free time, I sleep!\u201d David Cox Food: Rachel Ama Four years ago, when Rachel Ama gave up meat, fish, eggs and dairy more or less overnight after watching online documentaries exposing cruelty in animal agriculture, she received a lot of raised eyebrows from her friends and family. \u201cNo one around me was vegan,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand everyone was constantly asking me, \u2018Rachel, what are you eating? I don\u2019t understand.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Guys, my food is good, I promise \u2013 it\u2019s not just kale and celery.\u2019\u201d The bemusement of her peers provided valuable fuel for what happened next. \u201cI wanted to get people in my social circles to see that what I was making was really tasty,\u201d Ama tells me when we meet at her family home in north London. \u201cSo I said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to go on YouTube and share it.\u2019\u201d She posted her first video in September 2017. Now Ama has 140,000 subscribers, a fact that didn\u2019t escape the publishers Ebury, who offered the 27-year-old a book deal last August. Ama\u2019s appeal is obvious. She is a natural on air, full of personality, spontaneity and a willingness to be, as she puts it, \u201ca bit weird\u201d (she does a lot of singing and dancing to camera). It also helps that her food is delicious. Sitting in the white-tiled kitchen where she films all her videos, we tuck into a west African peanut curry \u2013 one of her mum\u2019s favourites \u2013 with sweet potato instead of chicken and lashings of peanut butter for richness. Her take on Caribbean fritters, using jackfruit in place of salt fish, tastes uncannily like the original \u2013 she adds a bit of nori to give it a maritime kick. The meal is rounded off with a boozy rum cake that dispenses with the eggs but, gratifyingly, doesn\u2019t skimp on the rum. Ama\u2019s book, to be published in June, will feature veganised dishes from her London upbringing, such as lasagne and kebabs, but it\u2019s the Afro-Caribbean influences that give her food real colour and kick, setting her apart from the ever-growing crowd of vegan influencers, authors and broadcasters. \u201cMy dad\u2019s side is Caribbean, my mum is half-African, half-Welsh,\u201d she says, \u201cso there were always diverse cultures and food conversations at home. I grew up around different spices and exciting flavours. That\u2019s what I\u2019m used to. Now I\u2019m just doing it with vegetables and making it really tasty.\u201d Killian Fox Art: Sean Edwards In a suburban garden in Cardiff, past discarded toys and a blue plastic slide, is the studio of the artist representing Wales at the 2019 Venice Biennale. A DIY wooden structure full of random objects and scrawled notes (\u201cnot expecting much\u201d; \u201cdissapointing [sic] rather than specatcular [sic]\u201d), it suits Sean Edwards\u2019s aesthetic. A 38-year-old sculptor with a stunning CV (an MA from the Slade School of Fine Art, solo exhibitions behind him in London, Berlin and Bristol), Edwards is also a \u201cvery dyslexic\u201d father of two, brought up by a single mother on a Cardiff council estate in the 1980s. His work explores the sculptural possibilities of objects in ordinary people\u2019s lives, often by using multimedia. His breakthrough 2010 solo show, Maelfa, was about the brutalist shopping centre he lived near as a child, incorporating a silent film, photographs, prints, models and ephemera. Another project, on Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska, saw Edwards presenting his notebooks instead of anything grander, because this felt \u201cmore honest\u201d. \u201cI like closing in on small details,\u201d he says. \u201cThey often have the potential to tell us about bigger things on a wider scale.\u201d Sculpture shouldn\u2019t just be about \u201cchipping away at huge things with a hammer, anyway\u201d, he adds. \u201cIt should be about people experiencing objects in a space, and being drawn into them.\u201d Edwards\u2019s Biennale project broaches new territory, however: it includes a theatre piece, which involves him working with National Theatre Wales. He won\u2019t reveal more about his \u201cpoetic inquiry into place, politics and class, intertwined with personal histories\u201d that will open in Venice in May, but his ongoing interest in the topic of disappointment has a place, and a memory of being put into a different line for free school meals mirrors some sketches on the studio wall. \u201cI am a working artist because of university grants, Arts Council funding and money from the Welsh government,\u201d he smiles. Edwards also loves being an artist in Cardiff, having worked with the g39 artist-run space in the city; he also teaches at the Cardiff School of Art and Design, where he was an undergraduate. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting here. I see this in Birmingham and Liverpool as well \u2013 there are more opportunities in smaller cities, and the costs aren\u2019t astronomical. People forget that smaller places can be the most interesting, really.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a philosophy he lives by. Jude Rogers Theatre: Lynette Linton It looks like 2019 will be busy for Lynette Linton. Having just opened Lynn Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse in London to five-star reviews, the director and writer is set to take over from Madani Younis as artistic director of west London\u2019s Bush theatre. She\u2019s also curating Passages at the Royal Court in April, a day celebrating the Windrush generation; it\u2019s a subject close to her heart, as her father came to Britain from Guyana when he was 12. Not bad for a 28-year-old who only got into theatre about seven years ago. \u201cI\u2019m working class, I wasn\u2019t raised in theatre,\u201d Linton says. \u201cI grew up in a council house in Leytonstone. My dad would always say \u2018stay in your job at John Lewis, you\u2019ve got to have money coming in\u2019. I remember going, is theatre the right thing for me? Is there anyone else like me that\u2019s done this? There were, and there are \u2013 look at what\u2019s happening in the industry now.\u201d Linton is part of a wave of newly appointed artistic directors reflecting the industry\u2019s attempts to diversify, from Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic to Nadia Fall at Theatre Royal Stratford East \u2013 Linton\u2019s local, which staged her plays Step and Chicken Palace. Her mission is to widen theatre\u2019s appeal in terms of age, race and class. Linton laughs at how everyone says she\u2019s \u201cso young\u201d to run a building; this should be an asset when tackling why young audiences don\u2019t go to the theatre. \u201cEverybody goes to the cinema \u2013 and cinema\u2019s really expensive!\u201d she points out, adding that she does get why young, diverse audiences may feel unwelcome: the people sitting in the stalls are often overwhelmingly white and old. Sometimes, she says, she feels out of place even watching her own shows. With Sweat, particularly, it\u2019s important to her that \u201cit\u2019s not just seen by the same people that watch every Donmar show\u201d. The play tells the story of a group of friends pitted against one another when their jobs at a factory in Reading, Pennsylvania are threatened. Brexit parallels will, Linton says, be obvious. \u201cMy whole thing is unheard voices \u2013 that\u2019s why I got into theatre, because people like me aren\u2019t represented. When I heard about Lynn Nottage, that\u2019s what she does,\u201d she says. \u201cTheatre is a medium for everybody: we need to make sure all those stories are heard.\u201d Holly Williams Jazz: Steam Down Orchestra If 2018 was the year that the world\u2019s ears tuned to the UK jazz underground, a must-attend midweek jam session in Deptford, south London, is where its spirit was celebrated. At Steam Down, spiritual jazz and west African rhythms are twisted up with future soul, grime and Afrofuturist spoken word about utopias without Oyster cards. Entry is by donation so that anyone can afford to go. The musicians in the Steam Down Orchestra play on the floor at eye level, dissolving the barrier between band and fan, with whatever big-name guest rolls through that week. The superstar saxophonist Kamasi Washington loves it so much he\u2019s turned up and joined in twice. The first rule of Steam Down is \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to move your body\u201d, says saxophonist Wayne Francis, the collective\u2019s de facto spokesperson who goes by the stage name Ahnans\u00e9. Key to the night is the energy between performers and the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking part,\u201d says Francis. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about being a spectator.\u201d Since Steam Down took their live show to the Jazz Cafe in October, their flagship night in Deptford has been a roadblock every week and become a focal point for the UK jazz scene. The band totals 12 players, including Sons of Kemet members Eddie Hick and Theon Cross (four were away when we took our photograph). But despite these jazz credentials, Steam Down find the term too limiting. \u201cI don\u2019t feel UK jazz is a broad enough category for us,\u201d says Francis. \u201cWe were playing some trap last night!\u201d Musical fluidity is \u201cintegral\u201d to Steam Down, as is improvisation. \u201cNo song is fixed.\u201d Until now, Steam Down haven\u2019t had to release anything to get bookings. \u201cInstagram is our album,\u201d says Francis. \u201cYou go to #steamdown, check out the clips and catch the feeling.\u201d Or you can text their \u201chotline\u201d for details of shows and special guests, which has helped cultivate a dedicated community of more than 800 people (that\u2019s the total number in their phonebook). But they are finally going to record their music in January and it makes sense that it\u2019ll be during a three-hour live performance. A Mercury nomination \u201cwould be nice\u201d, but it\u2019s not a measure for Steam Down\u2019s success. \u201cIf someone said, \u2018Steam Down helped me go through grieving after I lost my dad\u2019,\u201d says Francis, \u201cit\u2019s at the top of the list of achievements.\u201d Kate Hutchinson Steam Down\u2019s weekly nights at Buster Mantis, Deptford, south London, will return in February TV: Niamh Algar Landing a lead role in the writer-director Shane Meadows\u2019s new TV series was a dream come true for Niamh Algar. \u201cI\u2019m a major fan of Shane\u2019s work,\u201d says the Irish actor from Mullingar. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest of five and when I was 15, one of the first DVDs I robbed off my older brothers was This Is England. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. It was a different beast to Dawson\u2019s Creek or the romcoms I\u2019d been watching. Shane\u2019s a genius, so to be auditioning for him, let alone get the part, was mindblowing.\u201d That part is opposite a Meadows regular \u2013 Stephen Graham \u2013 in the incendiary four-parter The Virtues. They play Dinah and Joseph, two lost souls whose paths cross when Joseph confronts the demons that haunt him from a childhood in care. Algar fulfilled another ambition in co-starring with Graham: \u201cWhen I studied drama at the Factory in Dublin, we used to workshop scenes between Combo and Lol from This Is England. So suddenly to be working opposite Steve was amazing. I didn\u2019t tell him that, obviously. Wouldn\u2019t want to give him a big head.\u201d Algar will be all over our TVs in 2019. Before The Virtues starts in late spring, later this month she\u2019ll star in Channel 4\u2019s Pure about an extreme form of OCD called \u201cpure O\u201d. After last year\u2019s role in Desiree Akhavan\u2019s The Bisexual, Pure is Algar\u2019s second gay character in a row. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Shane made me shave off half my hair and dye it bleached blond, so I look quite edgy. I\u2019m delighted if that\u2019s become my niche!\u201d Later this year, we\u2019ll see her play an army veteran in the BBC thriller MotherFatherSon, starring Richard Gere in his first major small-screen role. \u201cOn my first day, I got a scene with the back of his head,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI tell you what, that man has great hair.\u201d What does Algar do on her days off? \u201cA lot of boxing. I\u2019ve sparred since my teens. I\u2019d love to use it in a role. I text my agent pretty much daily going, \u2018Any boxing films?\u2019\u201d Algar doesn\u2019t get recognised yet. \u201cNo one has a clue who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s great. Except when I go home to Ireland and my family are like, \u2018Hmm, you look familiar. You\u2019re the youngest, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cI only moved away two years ago. Families, eh?\u201d Michael Hogan Books: Emma Dabiri When Emma Dabiri was seven, instead of attending her first holy communion with her classmates, she created a \u201cspiffy little anti-slavery pamphlet called Break the Chains\u201d and presented it to her teachers. \u201cAs soon as you start reading black history, it\u2019s difficult not to become politicised,\u201d she says, sipping a coffee in the Hoxton Holborn hotel. \u201cI started reading it very young. I experienced a lot of racism as a child, and reading about the global black struggle helped me contextualise what was happening to me.\u201d Growing up in 1980s Dublin to a white Trinidadian-born Irish mother and black Irish-Nigerian father, it\u2019s no surprise that the social historian, broadcaster, former model and soon-to-be published author has interests that span pop culture, race, feminism and Yoruba folklore. Thanks to her presenting work on programmes such as Channel 4\u2019s Is Love Racist? and BBC Two\u2019s Back in Time for Brixton, she has become known for straddling the line between academia and accessibility. Dabiri says she has been on this path for as long as she can remember, but her first significant step was leaving Ireland for a place at Soas University of London. She did a degree in African studies, followed by a master\u2019s in development. After a stint working in Ghana, Dabiri found herself back at Soas, teaching and working on a PhD. She started writing a blog, and in 2013 wrote a post for Media Diversified titled Who Stole All the Black Women from Britain? It\u2019s this piece that she cites as launching her into the public-facing world. Much like contemporary Afua Hirsch, Dabiri\u2019s voice has been a refreshing counterbalance in a country still struggling to acknowledge its racist past in a postcolonial world. Her forthcoming book Don\u2019t Touch My Hair is written \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d for those with afro hair: Dabiri, whose hair is more coiled than loosely curled, says: \u201cI think if I had the \u2018typical\u2019 [loose] hair that\u2019s associated with being mixed race, I would actually be a very different person.\u201d Situated wittily in Dabiri\u2019s own story, the book starts by tackling hair-texture discrimination, a phenomenon that goes hand in hand with colourism. Later chapters explore hair in relation to African mathematics, mapping and coding, and include fascinating stories of how slaves used braiding to communicate. The book, to be published in May, is likely to shift many stale conversations, and prove that black people\u2019s concerns around hair are anything but superficial. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff Pop: Yellow Days \u201cI can\u2019t switch off from music,\u201d says George van den Broek, the 19-year-old multi-instrumentalist from Haslemere in Surrey who records as Yellow Days. \u201cIt\u2019s my life. I\u2019ve been working in this capacity for three years now and I think I\u2019m becoming incredibly old-mannish.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s very slowly sucking the youth out of me.\u201d Van den Broek has a hefty back catalogue for a teenager, with an EP and an album, 2017\u2019s Is Everything OK in Your World?, already in circulation. In both, he mined a down-tempo indie-R&amp;B groove with low-key but compelling results, building up a youthful following on both sides of the Atlantic. (Donald Glover used a Yellow Days track in the season two trailer for his hit TV show Atlanta.) But now, in his first releases since signing to a major label, his music is taking a (relatively) upbeat turn. The mellow sweetness that ran through the earlier records is amplified on recent singles such as How Can I Love You? He says the album he is working on now will be his \u201cfunky record\u201d, moulded by deep immersion in \u201c70s crossover jazz-funk and artists like Leroy Hutson, Al Green, and the Originals\u201d. In person, Van den Broek is a genial presence who swans into a cafe in north London 30 minutes late wearing a big smile and a long-sleeved T-shirt inspired by The Simpsons. Contrary to what his music might have you believe, he grew up in what he describes as \u201ca very lovely, happy, supportive background\u201d. \u201cAll the strife and pain has come through my own stupid little life,\u201d he says, smiling ruefully. \u201cMy family are like a warm sofa that hugs you.\u201d They supported his musical ambitions, which took root at 14 when he started writing \u201cgood\u201d music (as opposed to the \u201cterrible Ed Sheeran stuff\u201d he\u2019d come up with in earlier years). As well as singing, playing guitar and producing, he\u2019s taught himself to play bass, keyboards, drums and a bit of sax. Making music is hard work, van den Broek insists, but he can\u2019t imagine doing anything else, even if it saps the youth out of him. \u201cI would have really struggled to let go of childish dreams,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo I\u2019m eternally grateful for the decisions I made to bring me to this point and I\u2019m going to keep giving it everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d Killian Fox Activism: Amatey Doku Amatey Doku\u2019s career in student representation had humble beginnings. As a member of his secondary school\u2019s student council, he campaigned for better food options in the canteen. \u201cMy understanding of politics in a broader sense wasn\u2019t very good at the time, but I\u2019ve always tried to make things better for people,\u201d he says. Since then, Doku has broadened his scope. Now 23, he is the vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS) and a member of For Our Future\u2019s Sake, a student campaign group calling for a people\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal. In October, he was one of the speakers at the 700,000-strong march for a new Brexit referendum in central London. \u201cFor me, standing on that stage, seeing those crowds of people and the passion behind the campaign was really moving,\u201d he says. His current role has also given him the opportunity to have his say within parliament \u2013 he has twice given evidence at committee meetings on funding for higher education. At Cambridge University, where Doku graduated with a degree in sociology in 2016, he was president of his college\u2019s union and later president of the university students\u2019 union. Among the issues he advocated for was a campaign to repatriate a statue at the university that had been looted from Africa in the 19th century. He came from an academic family \u2013 his grandfather is a professor at the University of Ghana and his father studied medicine in the UK \u2013 and so expectations were always high. \u201cMy parents put a lot of emphasis on being educated, especially being black,\u201d he says. But, after learning of the black attainment gap in education through his studies, he felt a strong obligation to clear the path for others. \u201cI understand the huge privilege I gained from going to Cambridge. You\u2019ve got to make sure you use that to make change.\u201d In the long term, Doku hasn\u2019t ruled out moving on to national politics: he is a staunch believer that our political system needs simplifying so it can be more easily understood by the public. But he won\u2019t be taking the plunge any time soon. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people going into politics have some experience of the real world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d much rather work in the third sector, at charities or organisations that are trying to effect change, before that.\u201d Amy Walker",

      "body": "<p>A new episode of Charlie Brooker\u2019s <em>Black Mirror</em><em> </em>debuted on Netflix just before the new year. Unlike most previous examples, <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO0PAt95OnY\" title=\"\">Bandersnatch</a></strong> is not a cautionary tale of how current technologies might evolve to further ruin our hearts, minds and communities. It is, rather, a period piece set in early-1980s Britain, when young video-game programmers were becoming millionaires selling their games in WH Smith. Unlike all previous <em>Black Mirror</em> episodes, Bandersnatch is a nonlinear film that allows the viewer to steer the plot using simple A/B choices at key moments in the drama.

      "bodyText": "A new episode of Charlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror debuted on Netflix just before the new year. Unlike most previous examples, Bandersnatch is not a cautionary tale of how current technologies might evolve to further ruin our hearts, minds and communities. It is, rather, a period piece set in early-1980s Britain, when young video-game programmers were becoming millionaires selling their games in WH Smith. Unlike all previous Black Mirror episodes, Bandersnatch is a nonlinear film that allows the viewer to steer the plot using simple A/B choices at key moments in the drama. Like the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the period, these choices range from the mundane (\u201cwhich cereal would you like for breakfast?\u201d) to the life-imperilling, and each path winds to one of a number of possible endings. That Netflix should choose to invest in the required technology, then use it with one of its prestige shows is, regardless of how you judge the results, thrilling, and demonstrates that games still have the capacity to enter new rooms of culture to woo those who might otherwise reject the form. Bandersnatch may even prove a tipping point for interactive fiction. This year also promises Telling Lies, a pseudo-sequel to Her Story, one of the best games of the genre to date, which also uses filmed footage (clips of police interview tapes) to reshuffle the narrative in beguiling ways. The opportunity to shape stories is one of the base appeals of video games, and 2019 promises a range of opportunities for the wannabe authors. Judgment is an atypical example from Japan, a narrative-led investigative game in which you play as a lawyer handling cases that range from murder to adultery and beyond. The Last of Us Part 2 is more familiar fare, a sequel to the developer Naughty Dog\u2019s luxuriously violent, occasionally po-faced cinematic study of post-apocalypse America. For something a little more saccharine, January marks the long-awaited arrival of Kingdom Hearts 3, a byzantine collaboration from Disney and Final Fantasy creator Square Enix (and surely an intellectual property lawyer\u2019s nightmare), whose mythology has become so complex that the games have become a punchline to many a meme. Years of delays suggest a chaotic gestation, but there\u2019s a slim chance Disney has wrangled director Tetsuya Nomura\u2019s creativity into something that honours the glittering characters, ranging from Mickey Mouse to Frozen\u2019s Olaf; creativity that he has, in games past, failed to place into a fitting context. Nomura\u2019s countryman Hidetaka Miyazaki has more favourable form; his Dark Souls games may require just as much work from a player to work out what precisely is going on, but his talent for world-building and atmosphere is unparalleled.

A battle erupted, heads were broken and for one of the last times, civic officials read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Act\" title=\"\">Riot Act</a>. A panic-stricken cabinet in London sent in troops and tanks, and for a moment revolution looked set to sweep western Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cThe Russian revolution had been an unambiguous demonstration that the forces of reaction could be defeated and the political establishment was very afraid that could happen here,\u201d says the Scottish historian Tom Devine. \u201cThey thought a Bolshevik uprising was about to begin in Glasgow.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the Battle of George Square was not so much an outburst of revolutionary fervour as the outcome of hostile policing and a loss of nerve by the cabinet. It did not trigger the downfall of UK capitalism \u2013 although it did have an impact on the British political landscape. The myth of the Red Clydesider was created that day, and its impact is still felt. So how did the authorities let that happen? What went wrong in George Square a century ago?</p> <p>Glasgow was at the time a centre for heavy goods manufacture, and demobbed soldiers were returning in search of work. Factory owners wanted to maintain the 47-hour working week, while workers wanted a 40-hour week so that everyone could get a job, says John Foster, an emeritus professor at the University of the West of Scotland. \u201cThe factory owners wanted them to do more work so there would be fewer jobs and they would have a permanent unemployed workforce at their beck and call.\u201d</p> <p>The workers, led by Willie Gallacher, Manny Shinwell, David Kirkwood and others, went on strike on 27 January and asked the city\u2019s lord provost to put their claim to the national government. On the 31st, around 60,000 gathered in George Square, outside the city chambers, to hear his response. The weather was cold and the atmosphere tense. Kirkwood led a delegation to see the lord provost. \u201cSuddenly, without warning, police made a savage, totally unexpected assault on the rear of the meeting, smashing right and left with their batons,\u201d says Gallacher in his autobiography <em>Revolt on the Clyde</em>. \u201cWomen and children were in the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>Gallacher raced into the melee, punched the chief constable and was then battered to the ground. Kirkwood was struck by batons from behind as he ran outside. The striking workers were pushed across the square but rallied. The police retreated \u2013 and the authorities decided to read the Riot Act, a formal process giving them rights to unleash martial law, says Devine. \u201cIt was an extraordinary development.\u201d</p> <p>A sheriff began to read the act but it was torn from his hands. A lorry carrying crates of aerated water was overturned and the bottles hurled at police, who scurried back to the city chambers dragging Gallacher and Kirkwood. Outside, there was pandemonium. Civic leaders appealed for peace but failed. In the end, Kirkwood and Gallacher were asked to intervene. Both were wounded, bloodied and under arrest but spoke to the crowd and asked them to leave and march to nearby Glasgow Green. Eventually they did so.</p> <p>In London, the war cabinet met at 3pm. The Scottish secretary, Robert Munro, claimed a Scottish Bolshevik revolution had begun and it was decided to send in troops from barracks in Scotland and northern England \u2013 but not from Glasgow\u2019s own Maryhill barracks because men there might have sided with their embattled neighbours.</p> <p>Meanwhile the battle continued to rage across Glasgow. \u201cViolence and disorder continued elsewhere in the city centre, as it would through the night. The George Square Riot turned into Bloody Friday,\u201d says Kenny MacAskill in his book <em>Glasgow 1919: The Rise of Red Clydeside</em>. After one skirmish, two policemen were stripped of their uniforms and let loose semi-naked. Trams were vandalised, windows were smashed and looting took place.</p> <p>Then the troops arrived. Machine gun nests were placed in George Square. Soldiers were sent to protect power stations, and six tanks were stationed in the city\u2019s Cattle Market. By Saturday, the city was under military control. \u201cThe city chambers is like an armed camp,\u201d the <em>Observer </em>reported that Sunday. \u201cThe quadrangle is full of troops and equipment, including machine guns.\u201d</p> <p>By Sunday, Glasgow was calm, a fact ruefully acknowledged by Siegfried Sassoon, who came to cover the battle for the <em>Nation</em> but could only report on the dismal weather and the way he had been derided by one woman for his lack of Marxist credentials, says his biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c86e651c6e36db77d19499d2c832165c1000c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c86e651c6e36db77d19499d2c832165c1000c55/0_254_4916_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer uses his baton on a striker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police officer uses his baton on a striker during the general strike in Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slowly the city returned to normal, and after a couple of weeks the troops departed. Amazingly, there had been no fatalities. The strike leaders were put on trial for inciting riot but were acquitted \u2013 except for Gallacher and Shinwell, who got three and five months in jail.

More importantly, at the next general election, in 1922, Red Clydesiders \u2013 in the personification of the Independent Labour Party \u2013 won 10 out of 15 Glasgow constituencies. The revolution may not have materialised but Clydeside became a powerful socialist base.</p> <p>\u201cThe experience of being harshly treated helps explain the election success of Red Clydesiders,\u201d says Devine. \u201cShinwell, Kirkwood and others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/labour-mp-manny-shinwell-slap-in-the-face-for-conservative-political-opponent\" title=\"\">became MPs</a>.

      "body": "<p>Among the myriad of decisions homebuyers and owners have to contend with is leasehold. The number of years left on a lease is crucial when it comes to remortgaging or selling your home, and any potential buyer will struggle to be accepted for a mortgage once the unexpired lease term falls below 70 years. As the government consultation on leasehold homes continues, the issue of extending a lease has become one of the central topics.</p> <p>The \u201cenfranchisement\u201d process covers both extending a lease and buying the freehold to your home \u2013 individually if it\u2019s a house, or collectively in a block of flats. The Law Commission has already put forward proposals to provide a better deal. It wants to see the process become cheaper and easier.</p> <p>So what does the future hold for this complex process? Leases on both flats and houses are normally for 99 or 125 years from when the property is built. In theory, the property is returned to the freeholder when the lease expires \u2013 leaving the person who\u2019s paid the mortgage empty-handed.</p> <p>That\u2019s a long way off for many people, but there are other more pressing issues. Firstly, the mortgage issue. Secondly, archaic rules mean lease extensions get much more expensive after the lease falls below 80 years.</p> <p>There\u2019s already a statutory process for extending a lease. The 1993 Leasehold Reform Act gives flat owners who have owned their property for at least two years the right to extend their lease by 90 years and have the ground rent reduced to zero. Flat dwellers also have the option to buy the freehold to their block, but they\u2019ll need to club together with neighbours to do so. The rules are different for houses \u2013 you\u2019ll only get an additional 50 years \u2013 and it might be better to buy the freehold instead.</p> <p>Extending a lease can be a long and tortuous process \u2013 and it comes at a cost. The premium to be paid is a matter of negotiation between the leaseholder\u2019s and freeholder\u2019s surveyors \u2013 they deal with complex calculations around the current length of the lease, the location, the ground rent, the value of the flat with the lease as it is, and the value when it is extended.</p> <p>Both sides also need a solicitor. Currently, the leaseholder pays for everything \u2013 the premium, their own surveyor and solicitor, and the freeholder\u2019s, too.</p> <p>The consultation and possibility of a new formula for lease extensions puts existing leaseholders in a dilemma. Every year they wait to extend their lease, the more expensive it gets.</p> <p>So should you hold on and see what the government decides? \u201cIf you have a physical need to extend your lease, say your lease is approaching the 80-year mark or you need to sell, then you should consider taking action now,\u201d says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions, a firm which helps leaseholders. \u201cIf not, our advice is that it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the Law Commission\u2019s proposals.\u201d</p> <p>Leaseholders may be tempted to negotiate an \u201cinformal\u201d lease extension with the freeholder. This can be quicker \u2013 the statutory process can take up to a year \u2013 and, on the face of it, cheaper. For starters, you\u2019ll only need to pay your own legal and surveyor\u2019s costs, not the freeholder\u2019s, too.</p> <p>But if ever the phrase \u201cfalse economy\u201d applies, it\u2019s here. When you extend your lease via the statutory process, your ground rent is reduced to nothing. But an informal extension could see it increase.</p> <p>As Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, says: \u201cWith an informal lease extension you have none of the security or protection provided by the lease extension legislation. The freeholder can set the terms of the lease however they want, including hiking ground rents.\u201d</p> <p>An informal lease extension also doesn\u2019t necessarily give you an additional 90 years \u2013 some unscrupulous freeholders might just extend it back up to 90 or 99 years. This means you, or a future owner, will have to go through the whole lease extension process again.</p> <p>Burns also warns: \u201cYou have no legal right or protection when you enter into an informal lease extension with your freeholder. It\u2019s a take-it-or-leave-it deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour flat could easily become unsalable after the deal is concluded. Our advice is to always use the statutory route when extending your lease.\u201d</p>",

The freeholder can set the terms of the lease however they want, including hiking ground rents.\u201d An informal lease extension also doesn\u2019t necessarily give you an additional 90 years \u2013 some unscrupulous freeholders might just extend it back up to 90 or 99 years. This means you, or a future owner, will have to go through the whole lease extension process again. Burns also warns: \u201cYou have no legal right or protection when you enter into an informal lease extension with your freeholder. It\u2019s a take-it-or-leave-it deal.\u201d \u201cYour flat could easily become unsalable after the deal is concluded. Our advice is to always use the statutory route when extending your lease.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Trump White House has frequently been called chaotic, wild, undisciplined, disorderly. But a better word might be \u201cunruly,\u201d because if there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump can\u2019t abide, it\u2019s rules. Not only has the Trump administration signally failed to follow the rules, it\u2019s not clear it ever bothered to learn them. But as the Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/democrats-government-shutdown-congress-legislation\" title=\"\">took control of the House of Representatives last week</a>, that abruptly changed. Trump is about to get schooled in the rules of the game.</p> \n<p>For two years, thanks to a Republican Congress that chose not to honor its constitutional duty to maintain oversight of the executive branch, the American political drama has centred on special counsel\u2019s Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. But that focus is about to widen, as Nancy Pelosi, the once and future Speaker of the House, reclaimed the gavel, promising to show Americans its power: the picture of her smiling as she wielded it went viral, for good reason.</p> \n<p>That the game has changed, significantly, was clear in the many stories and images circulating last week: as the first two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/congress-new-members-republicans-democrats-diversity\" title=\"\">Native American women sworn into Congress tearfully embraced</a>; as Ilhan Omar became the first woman to wear the hijab in Congress and Rashida Tlaib was sworn in on her own Quran; as Kyrsten Sinema became the first openly bisexual woman to join Congress, and swore her oath of office on the Constitutions of the United States and her home state of Arizona, rather than on a religious text; and as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to a failed attempt to shame her for once having danced on a rooftop in a tribute to <em>The Breakfast Club</em> by dancing into her congressional office.</p> \n<p>Pelosi began by sending the president a brief letter, instructing him to deliver a State of the Union address on 29 January. It opened by reminding Trump of the rules that are about to be enforced: \u201cThe constitution established the legislative, executive, and judicial branches as co-equal branches of government.\u201d Some commentators called this sentence gratuitous and for any other president it would have been. But this one has more than earned a civics lesson, given that he notoriously claimed as he entered office that Congress works for him. Certainly, the Congress he\u2019s enjoyed until now, under Senator Mitch McConnell and former Speaker Paul Ryan (who just left office with a dismal 12% approval rating), gave him reason to think so, and McConnell continues to do so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c4ae2d61-810a-4364-8e08-6f959a5cee09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oY28uyu3Y1Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pelosi\u2019s first action was to summon Trump to Congress at her behest. The message was clear: this is her territory, and she\u2019s in charge now. Refusing to fund Trump\u2019s signature promise of a wall on the southern border, Pelosi called it a barrier not \u201cbetween America and Mexico, but between reality and his constituents, his supporters\u201d. Pelosi will reintroduce the Trump White House to reality, putting serious brakes on what is increasingly a runaway train. One way to do that is through non-partisan strengthening of the electoral process and Democrats introduced a bill that calls for automatic voter registration, nationwide early voting, ending congressional gerrymandering and the release of presidential tax returns.</p> \n<p>But Pelosi is also asserting the power of her office, going so far as to claim in one interview that the constitution makes her office equal to the president\u2019s. This is untrue: Congress in its entirety equals the presidency, while she only leads one of its two chambers. That said, Pelosi has just, not incidentally, become third in line to the Oval Office; should something occur that occasioned the removal of both the president and the vice president from office before 2020, Nancy Pelosi would by law assume the presidency.</p> \n<p>But what might such a something be? Many Americans think Congress, which can remove the president, is spoiled for justifications. One freshman member of the 116th House, the most diverse in American history, lost no time in saying so. Palestinian-American Tlaib caused uproar when she celebrated her accession to Congress by telling advocacy group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/05/house-democrats-rashida-tlaib-trump-impeach\" title=\"\">MoveOn that the House would \u201cimpeach the motherfucker</a>.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Many Americans think that Congress, which can remove the President, is spoiled for justifications.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That is not currently the position of senior members of the House; Pelosi has made clear that she awaits the outcome of the Mueller investigation before deciding whether to bring impeachment proceedings. Nor would impeachment guarantee Trump\u2019s removal: the House votes whether to impeach, but the Senate votes whether to expel and it\u2019s hard to imagine McConnell\u2019s Senate doing any such thing. Certainly not as matters stand.</p> \n<p>But that\u2019s also where things get interesting. The Democrats now control oversight and investigations, with subpoena power. On her second day, Pelosi denounced the \u201cculture of cronyism, corruption and incompetence\u201d in the Trump administration, including, she specified, the personal enrichment of individual cabinet members. For two years, numerous ethics scandals have passed by a Congress that barely exerted itself to shrug; now, Democrats chair the committees of jurisdiction and have the power to jail those who defy subpoenas. That power has not been exercised in almost a century, but every weapon in the congressional arsenal may be needed to stop a president who weaponises reality itself.</p> \n<p>House Democrats\u2019 oversight and investigatory powers are much broader than Mueller\u2019s very specific investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia. They have announced their intention to follow the money and can rigorously investigate not only Russian electoral interference, but also the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign governments, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the possibility that those financial interests are influencing the administration\u2019s policy; money laundering; ethics violations; abuses of power, including profiting from the presidency; and obstruction of justice. They can investigate Trump\u2019s personal finances, and demand his tax returns; if he refuses, they can take it to the courts. In addition, they have promised to scrutinise the legality of some of the administration\u2019s more controversial policies, including the separation of immigrant families at the border. Should the president fire Mueller, they can reappoint him as independent counsel. Any of these investigations might seriously change the picture regarding impeachment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ccb57830fc5d903bc022a87dd029fa8725683c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccb57830fc5d903bc022a87dd029fa8725683c9/0_83_3230_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Democrats at the Capitol last week.

The DOJ is obeying a directive \u2013 not a law, but an internal procedural memo \u2013 stating that, in general, a sitting president should not be indicted, for the simple (and good) reason that this could usurp congressional oversight. According to the directive\u2019s logic, if a president breaks the law, Congress should impeach and remove and then the Justice Department can decide whether to indict an ordinary citizen. But these investigations raise significant questions about whether Trump became president illegally or thanks to criminal activity; in such circumstances, according to many legal experts, including the former US Solicitor General Neal Katyal, the Justice Department is not bound to follow this \u201cgeneral\u201d directive.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has long believed that the rules don\u2019t apply to him, but that\u2019s only because they haven\u2019t been applied to him. The likes of Omar, Tlaib, Sinema, Ocasio-Cortez, and their male freshmen colleagues, will hold Pelosi to account, as well as Donald Trump \u2013 about whom we can finally stop asking when the game will be on and start asking when the game will be up. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The Trump White House has frequently been called chaotic, wild, undisciplined, disorderly. But a better word might be \u201cunruly,\u201d because if there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump can\u2019t abide, it\u2019s rules. Not only has the Trump administration signally failed to follow the rules, it\u2019s not clear it ever bothered to learn them. But as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last week, that abruptly changed. Trump is about to get schooled in the rules of the game. For two years, thanks to a Republican Congress that chose not to honor its constitutional duty to maintain oversight of the executive branch, the American political drama has centred on special counsel\u2019s Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. But that focus is about to widen, as Nancy Pelosi, the once and future Speaker of the House, reclaimed the gavel, promising to show Americans its power: the picture of her smiling as she wielded it went viral, for good reason. That the game has changed, significantly, was clear in the many stories and images circulating last week: as the first two Native American women sworn into Congress tearfully embraced; as Ilhan Omar became the first woman to wear the hijab in Congress and Rashida Tlaib was sworn in on her own Quran; as Kyrsten Sinema became the first openly bisexual woman to join Congress, and swore her oath of office on the Constitutions of the United States and her home state of Arizona, rather than on a religious text; and as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to a failed attempt to shame her for once having danced on a rooftop in a tribute to The Breakfast Club by dancing into her congressional office. Pelosi began by sending the president a brief letter, instructing him to deliver a State of the Union address on 29 January. It opened by reminding Trump of the rules that are about to be enforced: \u201cThe constitution established the legislative, executive, and judicial branches as co-equal branches of government.\u201d Some commentators called this sentence gratuitous and for any other president it would have been. But this one has more than earned a civics lesson, given that he notoriously claimed as he entered office that Congress works for him. Certainly, the Congress he\u2019s enjoyed until now, under Senator Mitch McConnell and former Speaker Paul Ryan (who just left office with a dismal 12% approval rating), gave him reason to think so, and McConnell continues to do so. Pelosi\u2019s first action was to summon Trump to Congress at her behest. The message was clear: this is her territory, and she\u2019s in charge now. Refusing to fund Trump\u2019s signature promise of a wall on the southern border, Pelosi called it a barrier not \u201cbetween America and Mexico, but between reality and his constituents, his supporters\u201d. Pelosi will reintroduce the Trump White House to reality, putting serious brakes on what is increasingly a runaway train. One way to do that is through non-partisan strengthening of the electoral process and Democrats introduced a bill that calls for automatic voter registration, nationwide early voting, ending congressional gerrymandering and the release of presidential tax returns. But Pelosi is also asserting the power of her office, going so far as to claim in one interview that the constitution makes her office equal to the president\u2019s. This is untrue: Congress in its entirety equals the presidency, while she only leads one of its two chambers. That said, Pelosi has just, not incidentally, become third in line to the Oval Office; should something occur that occasioned the removal of both the president and the vice president from office before 2020, Nancy Pelosi would by law assume the presidency. But what might such a something be? Many Americans think Congress, which can remove the president, is spoiled for justifications. One freshman member of the 116th House, the most diverse in American history, lost no time in saying so. Palestinian-American Tlaib caused uproar when she celebrated her accession to Congress by telling advocacy group MoveOn that the House would \u201cimpeach the motherfucker.\u201d That is not currently the position of senior members of the House; Pelosi has made clear that she awaits the outcome of the Mueller investigation before deciding whether to bring impeachment proceedings. Nor would impeachment guarantee Trump\u2019s removal: the House votes whether to impeach, but the Senate votes whether to expel and it\u2019s hard to imagine McConnell\u2019s Senate doing any such thing. Certainly not as matters stand. But that\u2019s also where things get interesting. The Democrats now control oversight and investigations, with subpoena power. On her second day, Pelosi denounced the \u201cculture of cronyism, corruption and incompetence\u201d in the Trump administration, including, she specified, the personal enrichment of individual cabinet members. For two years, numerous ethics scandals have passed by a Congress that barely exerted itself to shrug; now, Democrats chair the committees of jurisdiction and have the power to jail those who defy subpoenas. That power has not been exercised in almost a century, but every weapon in the congressional arsenal may be needed to stop a president who weaponises reality itself. House Democrats\u2019 oversight and investigatory powers are much broader than Mueller\u2019s very specific investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia. They have announced their intention to follow the money and can rigorously investigate not only Russian electoral interference, but also the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign governments, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the possibility that those financial interests are influencing the administration\u2019s policy; money laundering; ethics violations; abuses of power, including profiting from the presidency; and obstruction of justice. They can investigate Trump\u2019s personal finances, and demand his tax returns; if he refuses, they can take it to the courts. In addition, they have promised to scrutinise the legality of some of the administration\u2019s more controversial policies, including the separation of immigrant families at the border. Should the president fire Mueller, they can reappoint him as independent counsel. Any of these investigations might seriously change the picture regarding impeachment. The House committees can also turn over evidence they uncover to the Department of Justice for prosecution, which may change the DOJ\u2019s position on whether to indict a sitting president. The DOJ is obeying a directive \u2013 not a law, but an internal procedural memo \u2013 stating that, in general, a sitting president should not be indicted, for the simple (and good) reason that this could usurp congressional oversight. According to the directive\u2019s logic, if a president breaks the law, Congress should impeach and remove and then the Justice Department can decide whether to indict an ordinary citizen. But these investigations raise significant questions about whether Trump became president illegally or thanks to criminal activity; in such circumstances, according to many legal experts, including the former US Solicitor General Neal Katyal, the Justice Department is not bound to follow this \u201cgeneral\u201d directive. Donald Trump has long believed that the rules don\u2019t apply to him, but that\u2019s only because they haven\u2019t been applied to him. The likes of Omar, Tlaib, Sinema, Ocasio-Cortez, and their male freshmen colleagues, will hold Pelosi to account, as well as Donald Trump \u2013 about whom we can finally stop asking when the game will be on and start asking when the game will be up.",

Ammar, whose name has been changed to protect family members still in Syria, arrived in Montreal in the autumn of 2014. A native of Latakia, a coastal city on the glittering Mediterranean, he had never faced harsh winters, certainly nothing close to the blanket of snow that often adorns his new home city. Having to get used to the Canadian cold, and quickly, he took to developing his culinary skills, cooking Syrian dishes after work. Now he regularly makes kibbeh labanieh, meatballs made with bulgur and cooked in a yoghurt stew, the quintessential comfort food, and a lentil soup that reminds him of the version he used to order at a specific restaurant every time he drove from Latakia to Aleppo. He also serves up traditional knafeh pastry, served warm with piping-hot sugar syrup, alongside a glass of salep, a creamy Ottoman drink made with orchid flour, milk and cinnamon. \u201cSitting around a table of food with family in the cold makes you feel warm,\u201d said Ammar, who has been reunited with his wife in Montreal. \u201cHere, you can have that same feeling of warmth because of the memories.\u201d Over the past three years, Canada has accepted more than 50,000 Syrian refugees as part of government- and privately-sponsored resettlement programmes. In an initiative that ran counter to the global mood of growing xenophobia and rightwing populism, its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, welcomed the first group of Syrians arriving as part of the government\u2019s campaign in late 2015. Many who came after enduring war and displacement, and the misery of refugee camps in the Middle East, set about rebuilding their lives in Canada. Added to the usual challenges of integration \u2013 finding work, accommodation and acquiring the language \u2013 learning to love the Canadian winter has proved a formidable task. In Montreal this weekend temperatures are expected to plunge to -20C with occasional snow flurries. The city launched a partial snow-clearing effort on Friday morning but freezing temperatures have made it extremely difficult for municipal workers to de-ice pavements. Horror stories \u2013 such as one from 1 January in which a couple driving on a highway in Quebec had their windshield shattered by flying ice \u2013 make it tempting to stay at home. Yesterday the weather in Damascus, by contrast, was bright and sunny, with a high temperature of 14C. Syrians in Canada have countless stories about their first winter in the country \u2013 hibernating for weeks on end; the first few times they slipped on ice and broke a limb; miscalculating how long they would have to wait in -20C for the bus; shopping for proper winter coats and boots; or splashing hands with hot water after a walk in freezing weather. For many new arrivals, the shock of the whole thing can drive them indoors. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tiny bit of snow, they won\u2019t come,\u201d said Joulnar El Husseini-McCormick, an estate agent who volunteers to translate for newly arrived refugees at government departments, and who is originally from Homs herself. \u201cYou call them and they say, \u2018It\u2019s cold\u2019. I remember one of them asked to postpone the appointment until March. I told her that in March there is snow,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThey\u2019d ask us if they can keep the kids at home when it snows,\u201d she added. \u201cWe told them, \u2018You can\u2019t keep them at home for six months!\u2019\u201d In Montreal the shopping districts, cafes and restaurants were bustling and alive ahead of the holidays. The city also boasts an extensive underground network of pedestrian tunnels to avoid the worst of the weather. But as the Christmas lights came down and local markets with mulled wine and were dismantled, winter really began to set in. Charming festive vistas are giving way to brutal icy streets and freezing rain. Rather than conjuring up scenes of familial gatherings and comforting childhood memories, winter, for some new arrivals, symbolises a greater estrangement: a reminder of the warmth of communities they left behind, however torn apart by war they may have become. It can become a powerful sign of how different their new home is from the one they fled. \u201cI was alone when I arrived in Canada in January and had no idea how cold it was,\u201d said Dina Haddad, who is also from Latakia and arrived in Canada a year ago. \u201cWhen I would take the bus, I didn\u2019t know it arrived at specific times, so I\u2019d freeze and my hands would turn white from the cold until they were numb, and I would cry and say, \u2018I wish I never came to this cold\u2019. People would gather around me and ask me, \u2018Are you OK, ma\u2019am?\u2019 because of how much I was crying. Eventually, things worked out.\u201d For those who remain inconsolable, there is always the promise of spring. \u201cI do regret it when I\u2019m waiting for a bus, it\u2019s -20C, windy, and the bus is late,\u201d said El Husseini-McCormick, who moved to Montreal in 2014 with her Canadian husband. \u201cThat\u2019s the peak of regret. I think to myself, what brought me here?\u201d \u201cBut when it\u2019s 10 degrees and people are smiling, and you realise it\u2019s spring, you\u2019ll see it,\u201d she added. \u201cSpring is the best feeling in the world.\u201d",

Not quite a history book or a guide, it\u2019s more an immersion into every aspect of Venetian living. Siberia by Colin Thubron (published in 1999) Thubron charts his 15,000-mile journey into Siberia after the fall of communism. He depicts a land of strange, often bleak physical extremes, from the ice-bound graves of ancient Scythians to the world\u2019s deepest lake, Baikal, which reaches depths of a mile.",

Is this a turning point? </strong><br>This year has hit home how climate change loads the dice against us by taking naturally occurring weather events and amplifying them. We now have attribution studies that show how much more likely or stronger extreme weather events have become as a result of human emissions. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/sep/20/why-are-california-wildfires-so-bad-interactive\" title=\"\">wildfires</a> in the western US now burn nearly twice the area they would without climate change, and almost 40% more rain fell during Hurricane Harvey than would have otherwise. So we are really feeling the impacts and know how much humanity is responsible.</p> <p><strong>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</strong><strong> released its <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" title=\"\">1.5C report</a> in October. A month later, the US </strong><strong>federal government\u2019s climate assessment \u2013 to which you </strong><strong>contribut</strong><strong>ed \u2013 came out. How did these two massive studies</strong><strong> move our understanding along? </strong><br>These assessments are important because there is a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat element to studying climate impacts. The act of observing affects the outcome. If people aren\u2019t aware of what is happening, why would anyone change? Assessments like these provide us with a vision of the future if we continue on our current pathway, and by doing so they address the most widespread and dangerous myth that the largest number of us have bought into: not that the science isn\u2019t real, but rather that climate change doesn\u2019t matter to me personally.</p> <p><strong>Compared to past studies, how much media attention did these reports receive?</strong><br>There was significant coverage but a lot of media survive by generating controversy so they bring on opposing voices rather than explaining the scientific facts.

But there has been a change. Ten years ago, few people felt personally affected by climate change. It seemed very distant. Today, most people can point to a specific way climate affects their daily lives. This is important because the three key steps to action are accepting that climate change is real, recognising it affects us, and being motivated to do something to fix it. Opinion polls in the US show <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/climate/news/yale-university-climate-change-maps\" title=\"\">70% of people agree the climate is changing</a>, but a majority still say it won\u2019t affect them.</p> <p><strong>Trump was dismissive of these reports and has repeatedly tried to deny any link between climate change and extreme weather. </strong><strong>What are the politics behind this denial?</strong><strong> </strong><br>It\u2019s a vicious cycle. The more doom-filled reports the scientists release, the stronger the pushback from politicians whose power, ideology and funding depends on maintaining the status quo, and who are supported by those who fear the solutions to climate change more than they fear its impacts. Opposition to climate change is a symptom of a society that is politically polarised between those who cling to the past and those who recognise the need for a better future. Fossil fuels have brought us many benefits \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful for their contribution to my life \u2013 but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That change can be scary, especially for those with most to lose financially from this shift. If you feel threatened, the instinctive reaction is to push back.</p> <p><strong>Progress of sorts was made at the </strong><strong>UN climate talks in Poland, though many scientists say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/cutting-emissions-proves-a-sticking-point-at-poland-climate-conference\" title=\"\">global society is not moving fast enough</a>. What is your take? </strong><br>Progress was made in Poland as the world agreed on a rule book to implement the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">Paris agreement</a>. The agreement is like a global pot luck in which every nation brings something different to the party. For some it\u2019s soil conservation, for another wind power or carbon pricing. Poland gave us an agreed common standard on how to measure these contributions. That was progress. As scientists, we are like physicians for the planet who have been monitoring its rising fever for 80 years. We know that our lifestyle, specifically our dependence on fossil fuels is the cause of a problem that is rapidly becoming serious and in some cases even dangerous. So when we see the world dragging its heels and carbon emissions continuing to grow, we become concerned, anxious, and even frustrated.

At that point, I would hope the world would suddenly ramp up its carbon reduction to the scale of a Manhattan Project or a moon race and we would finally be able to make serious progress. The multitrillion-dollar question is simply when that tipping point in opinion will come, and whether it will be too late for civilisation as we know it.

It would be like giving an experimental drug to every human on the planet before it had been tested. I\u2019m more hopeful about smaller scale, less risky geoengineering projects that suck carbon dioxide out of the air, such as those being trialled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/sep/14/entrepreneurs-turn-carbon-dioxide-into-fuels-artificial-photosynthesis\" title=\"\">Climeworks</a> to turn carbon into stone or fuel: or even massive tree-planting efforts, as in Bhutan. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the role of global finance</strong><strong>? Can money managers, shareholders and multinationals exert pressure and take positive action in ways that short-termist, vote-hungry politicians seem unable to do? </strong><br>Yes! In the world we live in, money speaks loudly. Thanks to the growing divestment movement, we have seen cities, universities and entire countries, in the case of Ireland, withdrawing investments from fossil fuel assets.

The company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, laid the blame for a shock cut in sales forecasts \u2013 and the subsequent share price tumble \u2013 on the economic downturn in China.

Top bosses, it found, earn 133 times more than their staff. To achieve this, the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid \u00a31,020 per hour, or \u00a33.9m a year \u2013 and needs only three working days to reach the average annual worker\u2019s pay of \u00a329,574.

Indeed, such glaring pay inequality could be viewed as demotivating for staff and thus damaging to worker output. A culture of teamwork brings more sustainable profits, not a maverick boss riding the waves of economic boom and bust. Even online retailers will find it hard to survive The Christmas trading news from John Lewis and Next last week showed that a final dash for presents by shoppers helped deliver a festive season that was not as bad as feared for two of the high street\u2019s biggest names. The relatively good news for those two high street stalwarts and the absence of a profit warning from Debenhams or other under-pressure chains like M&amp;S have lifted hopes as more than 20 retailers prepare to report on festive trading in the coming week. But hold the party poppers. Next\u2019s high-street stores had a dismal time and the group\u2019s profitability is being gradually squeezed by the shift to servicing online shoppers. John Lewis\u2019s profits are similarly under pressure as it battles to maintain its service culture and its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price promise amid huge discounting by ailing rivals and rising costs. Investment in web operations has never been so crucial to the survival of clothing, homewares and beauty retailers, where the shift from the high street has stepped up. Nearly a quarter of all fashion is now bought online. Brexit uncertainty will keep a dampener on non-essential spending so traditional retailers face a high-wire walk between investing to survive and finding cost savings that will protect profits. But even new online brands are not finding life easy. According to accounts filed on Friday, young fashion website Missguided crashed to a \u00a346m pretax loss in the year to last April \u2013 up from just \u00a31.6m a year before \u2013 as it admitted it had got products wrong. Trendy web-slipper seller Mahabis called in administrators last week. Even Asos, the banner carrier of the new retail economy, shocked the City with a profits warning before Christmas.

So far we are still mainly engaged in Valjean\u2019s story \u2013 a bitter, big, savagely bearded Dominic West, his eyes windows on to a soul cheated all through life, struggling to engage with the first tenderness ever shown to him, by an impossibly kind priest who he instinctively robs and then angsts about. And we surely know it\u2019s not going to be his first mistake, even those few thousand of us left in the UK who haven\u2019t seen the musical.</p> <p>As ever, Davies reaches into the pages to find the secret kernel that makes characters tick for the novelist, be it Tolstoy or Hugo, rather than being at all awed by the scope or heft of the book (similarly, Zola\u2019s bog-blocker <em>Germinal</em> can be read simply as a soap opera). Anyway, West is so far terrific, and we\u2019ve got five more episodes to properly inhabit Fantine, and then Javert in turn, and pretty much happy new year then, at least on Sunday nights.</p> <p>I wonder, then, whether it wasn\u2019t a little mistake to blow <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bxbh6p/luther-series-5-episode-1\" title=\"\">Luther</a></strong> all in one week. So much violence, for four days! With one\u2019s stomach still unsettled by exotically uncommon food (dry oatcakes). And that was before we got on to pincushion boy, and head-wired-to-explode-boy, and the frankly daft plot. But DCI John Luther swept, battered, bludgeoned all before him, and even hammer-fisted the plot back into some semblance of shape. Idris Elba\u2019s scowls still fill any screen, even when he\u2019s a tiny figure on CCTV, and he was immensely aided by such as Hermione Norris, Ruth Wilson, Patrick Malahide and Wunmi Mosaku. Yet what a shame the last had to die. She would have made a sharp addition to Luther\u2019s arsenal, a scalpel amid the fists. See, and now I\u2019ve gone and spoiler-ed it, when if this was on until late Jan I wouldn\u2019t. Pretty damned good though, even if you would have been speed-chewing the Gaviscon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960b47d0b9b3d17c0b969e3ab3aff18abbf4c7a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960b47d0b9b3d17c0b969e3ab3aff18abbf4c7a6/0_0_4300_2862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Idris Elba and Wunmi Mosaku in Luther.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idris Elba and Wunmi Mosaku in Luther.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t yet furnish you with information on why we are to have precisely no <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bx2rj3/doctor-who-resolution\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a></strong> in 2019, though that won\u2019t stop the rumours about backstage disagreements, toys out of pram, etc. Viewing figures have fallen from a high of more than 8 million on Jodie Whittaker\u2019s debut to nestle, relatively limply, somewhere around 5 million. Some of that effect is doubtless down to fans from slightly older generations getting mildly fed up at some episodes\u2019 worthiness, to the extent of preachiness. Although, for a series that is taking pelters for being \u201ctoo PC\u201d, I do wonder why they insist on making so many characters oddly\u2026 thick. \u201cNever that good at history or geography, me!\u201d from a trained archeologist?

      "bodyText": "Les Mis\u00e9rables (BBC One) | iPlayer Luther (BBC One) | iPlayer Doctor Who (BBC One) | iPlayer The Last Leg (Channel 4) | All4 Raymond Briggs: Snowmen, Bogeymen &amp; Milkmen (BBC Two) | iPlayer Escape at Dannemora (Sky Atlantic) This should by rights be the week for the bairn of the new year to replace the wizened, crooked haunches of the old and damp-eyed and dribbling, but instead turned out something of a celebration of the aged: one 82, one 84. The first was Andrew Davies, who has given us an utterly first-class, absorbing adaptation of Les Mis\u00e9rables, but without \u2013 and the hosanna! has echoed in my flat since I first read the news \u2013 the bloody music. So far we are still mainly engaged in Valjean\u2019s story \u2013 a bitter, big, savagely bearded Dominic West, his eyes windows on to a soul cheated all through life, struggling to engage with the first tenderness ever shown to him, by an impossibly kind priest who he instinctively robs and then angsts about. And we surely know it\u2019s not going to be his first mistake, even those few thousand of us left in the UK who haven\u2019t seen the musical. As ever, Davies reaches into the pages to find the secret kernel that makes characters tick for the novelist, be it Tolstoy or Hugo, rather than being at all awed by the scope or heft of the book (similarly, Zola\u2019s bog-blocker Germinal can be read simply as a soap opera). Anyway, West is so far terrific, and we\u2019ve got five more episodes to properly inhabit Fantine, and then Javert in turn, and pretty much happy new year then, at least on Sunday nights. I wonder, then, whether it wasn\u2019t a little mistake to blow Luther all in one week. So much violence, for four days! With one\u2019s stomach still unsettled by exotically uncommon food (dry oatcakes). And that was before we got on to pincushion boy, and head-wired-to-explode-boy, and the frankly daft plot. But DCI John Luther swept, battered, bludgeoned all before him, and even hammer-fisted the plot back into some semblance of shape. Idris Elba\u2019s scowls still fill any screen, even when he\u2019s a tiny figure on CCTV, and he was immensely aided by such as Hermione Norris, Ruth Wilson, Patrick Malahide and Wunmi Mosaku. Yet what a shame the last had to die. She would have made a sharp addition to Luther\u2019s arsenal, a scalpel amid the fists. See, and now I\u2019ve gone and spoiler-ed it, when if this was on until late Jan I wouldn\u2019t. Pretty damned good though, even if you would have been speed-chewing the Gaviscon. I can\u2019t yet furnish you with information on why we are to have precisely no Doctor Who in 2019, though that won\u2019t stop the rumours about backstage disagreements, toys out of pram, etc. Viewing figures have fallen from a high of more than 8 million on Jodie Whittaker\u2019s debut to nestle, relatively limply, somewhere around 5 million. Some of that effect is doubtless down to fans from slightly older generations getting mildly fed up at some episodes\u2019 worthiness, to the extent of preachiness. Although, for a series that is taking pelters for being \u201ctoo PC\u201d, I do wonder why they insist on making so many characters oddly\u2026 thick. \u201cNever that good at history or geography, me!\u201d from a trained archeologist? Or perhaps that\u2019s just more \u201cmessage\u201d, in a \u201chey-it\u2019s-okay-to-fail, kids! Skool is for Loo-sers!\u201d kind of way, in which case the BBC needs to have a word with itself. That said, I\u2019ve enjoyed the whole series; the first I\u2019ve watched all the way through. I suspect the slide in viewing is far more to do with the general feebleness, or even absence, of proper alien monsters \u2013 remedied in huge part by the New Year\u2019s Day special, which featured a Dalek!

I suspect that the memo is already whizzing round desks that come 2020, if there\u2019s still a BBC, and if Chris Chibnall\u2019s still showrunning, There Will Be More and Better Monsters.

      "bodyText": "In the dusty squatter settlement where she spent her short life, Victoria Mart\u00ednez is remembered as a vivacious, dance-loving child who showered \u201cbuenos d\u00edas\u201d on all those she met. \u201cWherever she went this girl was an explosion of love,\u201d says her father, Misael. In August, just a few days short of her fourth birthday, her life was brought to a sudden and premature end. \u201cPapi, get me out of here,\u201d Misael recalls his daughter begging as she was rushed to intensive care, vomiting blood, having contracted what would prove a deadly bacterial infection. Hours later, Victoria had died: yet another victim of the political and economic tsunami engulfing what was once one of Latin America\u2019s most developed nations. \u201cAs parents we still haven\u2019t overcome this,\u201d admits her 28-year-old father, who believes she was infected while being treated for leukemia at the paediatric hospital in Barquisimeto, Venezuela\u2019s fourth largest city. \u201cIt was devastating for us.\u201d Victoria is one of at least 25 children who activists say have died since late 2016 because of the serratia marcescens bacterium \u2013 fatalities they blame on a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of unhygienic, resource-starved hospitals that lack even soap to clean their wards, malnourished patients who are susceptible to infection, and chronic shortages of antibiotics. Her death provides a chilling snapshot of a healthcare system experts warn is heading for total collapse. \u201cWe want the whole world to hear us,\u201d said Carmen Padilla, a haemodialysis patient and campaigner for chronic patients in Barquisimeto. \u201cVenezuela is not suffering a humanitarian crisis. Venezuela is in a complete humanitarian emergency.\u201d Even as Venezuela disintegrates, state media continue to paint a rosy picture of the country\u2019s health service. Officials take to the airwaves each day to wax lyrical about Socialist party support schemes for expectant mothers and the poor. One recent propaganda video boasted: \u201cIf there is one area where you feel and live the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution, it\u2019s precisely in the field of healthcare, from which Venezuelan men and women were excluded for so many decades.\u201d President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed earlier this year: \u201cThe people\u2019s health is our priority.\u201d A visit to the hospital where Victoria Mart\u00ednez spent her final days suggests otherwise. The burns unit is filled with bandaged toddlers who have stumbled into wood fires or been burned by kerosene lamps \u2013 increasingly common sources of fuel and light. In the paediatric ward upstairs, mothers nurse emaciated babies \u2013 socks dangling from their tiny ankles, bones protruding through their flesh \u2013 who cannot be hydrated because the hospital cannot even provide a catheter. One doctor asked: \u201cWhat blame do these children have for having been born into the wrong era?\u201d Misael Mart\u00ednez said he did not fault the hospital\u2019s overstretched doctors for his daughter\u2019s premature death: they had treated her \u201clike a princess\u201d. But he described hospital conditions so precarious that his family had been asked to provide not only their own medicines, latex gloves and syringes, but also the cleaning products and water used to scrub down Victoria\u2019s ward. Experts say Venezuela\u2019s health service improved in the first decade of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution, which started 20 years ago this month. Life expectancy rose and infant mortality rates fell as high oil prices allowed the country with the world\u2019s greatest crude reserves to hurl resources at public healthcare, the Lancet medical journal noted earlier this year. Tens of thousands of Cuban doctors arrived to staff community \u201cmissions\u201d that the government said were bringing free healthcare to the masses. But that flagship programme has reportedly been brought to its knees by Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse, placing even greater strain on the country\u2019s already buckling hospital network. In November Human Rights Watch warned of Venezuela\u2019s \u201cdevastating health crisis\u201d, pointing to increasing rates of maternal and infant mortality and a spike in cases of measles, diphtheria, tuberculosis and malaria. Another recent report noted that 53% of Venezuelan operating theatres were now closed, 71% of emergency rooms could not provide regular services and 79% of hospitals lacked a reliable water supply. Meanwhile, medical professionals were joining a historic exodus overseas: at least 22,000 Venezuelan doctors \u2013 55% of the total \u2013 reportedly abandoned the country between 2012 and 2017. Lesbia Cortez, a healthcare worker at the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas, said: \u201cThere are virtually no specialists left.\u201d She estimated that 70% of those she studied with at medical school now practised in Colombia, Argentina or Chile. She said: \u201cYou can\u2019t find a endocrinologist because they\u2019ve gone; a dermatologist because they\u2019ve gone; an oncologist because they\u2019ve gone. The people who work in the dialysis units aren\u2019t there because they\u2019ve left the country too.\u201d Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor who recently returned to Venezuela from the United States to form a research group that studies the resurgence of vaccine-preventable and endemic diseases caused by the crisis, said: \u201cI predict there is a moment when you are just going to be left without healthcare personnel in this country. \u201cIf a medical school faculty member earns $20 a month, what can you expect?\u201d Padilla, the campaigner for chronic patients, said she believed Venezuela\u2019s leaders should be jailed \u201cfor the crimes against humanity being committed\u201d because of a breakdown critics blame partly on the chavista \u201cmissions\u201d that channeled resources away from public hospitals. Padilla, 45, whose kidneys failed from hypertension, said she had spent three years on a transplant list but was now waiting to die since a lack of doctors and equipment meant operations were not possible: \u201cMy life is in danger in Venezuela.\u201d Susana M\u00fajica, who also suffers from kidney disease, grew angry as she considered Maduro\u2019s cheery depiction of Venezuelan health. She said: \u201cHe says in his broadcasts that nothing\u2019s going on: that everything\u2019s fine; that there is medicine; that there are doctors; that I-don\u2019t-know-how-many-millions are being invested in healthcare. That this is [the result of] an economic war. \u201cWe know the reality. It is crystal clear to us because we are the ones living this reality every day \u2026 Whether we live or die isn\u2019t important to them. Their priority is staying in power.\u201d Mart\u00ednez, Victoria\u2019s grieving father, said he was still struggling to accept his daughter\u2019s death but was determined to speak out in the hope of avoiding more needless deaths. He said: \u201cI know that no one can bring back my daughter. But I know I have neighbours in this hospital, and cousins. I have friends who go to this hospital because they have nowhere else to go and so this is my struggle.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m going to fight because I believe justice will come.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes, journalists have been heard to wonder if the moniker under which the so-called <a href=\"https://angry-chef.com/\" title=\"\">Angry Chef</a> has blogged since 2015 is ironic. Before they meet Anthony Warner, they expect the character they encounter online: a choleric type whose white apron, metaphorically speaking, is liberally splattered with the blood of the charlatans and pseudo-scientists he spends his time so furiously pulling apart. But then in he walks, a quietly spoken, dorky-looking bloke with a neatly trimmed beard and distinctly non-architectural glasses, and disappointment rises inside them like a pan coming to the boil. Is he about to yell the F-word in their faces? No, he is not. He is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/18/angry-chef-debunking-detox-diets-wellness-nutrition-alternative-facts\" title=\"\">going to go on \u2013 and on</a> \u2013 about such things as genes and hormones and the difference between a simple problem and a complex one.</p> <p>Is his temperament really so placid? I\u2019m not at all sure it is. Warner, a former chef who went on to work as a development cook at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/premierfoods\" title=\"\">Premier Foods</a>, owner of brands such as Oxo and Mr Kipling, certainly has a careful, almost pedantic way of talking; his determination to avoid generalisations when it comes to talking about diet means he can be both somewhat verbose and a little humourless. He doesn\u2019t swear anything like as a much as his alter-ego. Nevertheless, it\u2019s pretty easy to wind him up. All sorts of things seem to make him irritated, including me. On the quiet \u2013 actually, not even on the quiet \u2013 he\u2019s a massive inverted snob, always on the look-out for perceived slights against processed food and takeaways. When, for instance, I tell a funny (ish) story about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/18/sp-marco-pierre-white-my-work-was-a-painkiller\" title=\"\">Marco Pierre White became furious</a> when I revealed to him in an interview that I often make my own stock \u2013 White, the original angry chef, was then the face of Knorr cubes \u2013 Warner seems to grow just a little taller in his seat. \u201cWell, I get equally upset when people demean others for using products,\u201d he says. Hang on! I didn\u2019t demean anyone. \u201cNo, but to have a society where people are made to feel guilty for making a pasta bake from a jar\u2026\u201d He picks up his knife and fork, and silently sets about attacking the food on his plate.</p> <p>Warner, who lives in Nottinghamshire, meets me for lunch at a restaurant in London where he has schnitzel with pommes aligot \u2013 a dish that is surely anathema to many, if not most, of the exasperatingly wrong-headed dietary \u201cexperts\u201d who first induced him to begin writing his blog, given that it combines mashed potato with cheese to such powerfully alluring effect. But alas, once his order arrives, he all but ignores it for 20 minutes or so. The trouble is that his new book, which we are here to discuss, is on such tricky, nuanced territory, talking about it demands his full attention. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-bogglingly complex,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started my research, even I wasn\u2019t sure where I was going. The only thing I knew for certain was people were over-simplifying, and this is a subject that completely defies simple explanation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Genetics accounts for around 70% of the reasons why someone might become fat</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Warner\u2019s first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/12/the-angry-chef-by-anthony-warner-review\" title=\"\">The Angry Chef: Bad Science and the Truth about Healthy Eating</a></em>, took apart every diet and food fad it\u2019s possible to imagine; on the receiving end of his rage were, among other things, detoxing and the kind of nutritional nonsense purveyed by the likes of the <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/\" title=\"\">Hemsley sisters</a>, \u201c<a href=\"https://deliciouslyella.com/\" title=\"\">Deliciously Ella</a>\u201d Mills and others who worship at the shrine of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/22/coconut-oil-is-pure-poison-says-harvard-professor\" title=\"\">coconut oil</a>. But these were, as he readily admits, pretty easy targets. His new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/truth-about-fat.html\" title=\"\">The Truth About Fat</a></em>, is altogether less focused in the sense that it is impossible to say, precisely, why levels of obesity may be rising, or what, if anything, can and should be done about this. Having waded through a lot of scientific papers and spoken to some of the world\u2019s leading experts in this field, all Warner knows for sure is that body weight should not be defined, as it is now, as a behaviour \u2013 like smoking.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the outcome of an enormously complicated set of circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cThis idea that willpower plays a part, that the overweight have some kind of personality deficit\u2026 Look at the evidence: that\u2019s a ridiculous position to take. It\u2019s just not true, and yet we\u2019re conditioned to believe it is.\u201d If his book has a message, then, it is that fat shaming, in all its various guises, must end. Calorie-reduction diets for weight loss do not, he writes in his book, work for the majority of people. Carbohydrates are not the enemy, and nor is sugar. Yet still we continue to regard those who are overweight as lazy and greedy (visibly overweight people are, among other things, less likely to be promoted at work, and more likely to be convicted of a crime by a jury) \u2013 cue even more misery for them as they embark on yet another regime that will inevitably fail. Why, he asks, are we not kinder? If we knew the facts, we surely would be. \u201cThe most shocking statistic I learned while I was writing the book was about binge-eating disorder in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/16/obesity-surgery-halves-risk-of-death-compared-to-lifestyle-changes-alone\" title=\"\">bariatric surgery</a> populations,\u201d he says. \u201cFifty per cent of those who have this surgery [a procedure that tackles obesity by reducing the size of the stomach] suffer from it, a condition that is very strongly associated with childhood trauma. It\u2019s an expression of complex mental health problems.\u201d Bariatric surgery, he believes, does help a great many people. But it still amazes him that the case against it isn\u2019t made more often:.\u201cIf this was a drug, one that killed one in 200 people who took it, it wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near being prescribed.\u201d</p> <p>Warner has trouble with current definitions of obesity. He thinks body mass index, a number calculated by dividing a person\u2019s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres, is too blunt a tool to be helpful (you tip from being overweight to being obese if your BMI is between 30 and 35). When, in 1997, the World Health Organisation moved the BMI of a person of normal weight from 27 to 25, millions of people woke up to find they had a health problem; he believes this change was based on questionable data. More significantly, he questions the notion of an \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d. Such language is unhelpful, not least because it suggests the race is on for a single \u201ccure\u201d when no such thing exists. Moreover, while populations may well be putting on weight, there is evidence to suggest that obesity, far from being an epidemic, has mostly affected only a small number of vulnerable individuals.</p> <p>The factors involved in weight gain are so multifarious, and interconnected in such complex and still elusive ways, it\u2019s all but impossible to summarise them (for all Warner\u2019s efforts to be as clear as possible for the lay reader, the 330 pages of his book are probably best described as chewy). Over lunch, I have a go at getting him to talk about some of these in a single sentence or so. Sometimes, he\u2019s able to do it. Sometimes, he simply can\u2019t. On the subject of genes, for instance, the evidence is (relatively) straightforward: \u201cBody weight is one of the most inherited characteristics ever studied,\u201d he says. \u201cGenetics accounts for around 70% of the reasons why someone might become fat.\u201d But when we move to hormones things get radically more complicated. \u201cHistorically, the biggest threat to human beings has been starvation. We have a system in place, and when our body thinks it\u2019s not getting enough food, that hormonal system kicks in. It is almost impossible to override. It\u2019s as powerful as the desire to breathe.\u201d If he talked me through this system now, we\u2019d probably still be here at dinnertime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0eb98d79f17b34cc8c99ebef747137b77ae1c6a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb98d79f17b34cc8c99ebef747137b77ae1c6a5/0_558_5674_7092/800.jpg\" alt=\"Observer Fat Magazine FAT Feature 06/01/19\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Lots of fried chicken joints still use hydrogenated vegetable oil.

If we exercised more, it would, he thinks, make a huge difference to our health \u2013 to our mental health, and to the composition of our bodies in terms of muscle \u2013 but not necessarily to our weight. Nor is he into the idea of, say, banning takeaways from operating in the vicinity of schools. \u201cIt would be better if we could work with businesses to improve their food. Lots of fried chicken joints are still using hydrogenated vegetable oil. It would be easy to ban that, without any impact on the quality of their food.\u201d His hunch is that those who are keen on takeaway bans simply find it \u201cdistasteful that young people like to hang out in them\u2026 It\u2019s a culturally driven thing.\u201d</p> <p>Warner, the son of a Hertfordshire accountant who fell into working as a chef having enjoyed the kitchen jobs he did as a biochemistry student in Manchester, famously believes that processed food can have the same value as any other kind of food; that we\u2019re wrong to think something made from scratch is \u201cbetter\u201d or healthier. So does he cook from scratch at home? (He and his partner have a young daughter.) \u201cSometimes. But I worry about talking about how I cook. What works in my life might not fit into someone else\u2019s.\u201d When, after 20 years as a chef, he began working at Premier Foods (now he\u2019s a writer, he still consults), it was fascinating to learn what \u201cchallenges\u201d people faced when cooking at home. \u201cI spent a lot of time doing focus groups and going to people\u2019s houses, and most people know more than we give them credit for. They do know how to roast a chicken \u2013 and even if they don\u2019t, the reasons for that won\u2019t change unless their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/12/more-than-a-million-uk-residents-live-in-food-deserts-says-study\" title=\"\">socio-economic conditions</a> change. The number of times I\u2019ve heard celebrity chefs tell people to buy a cheap cut of meat and slow cook it! Those recipes are written by someone who has no idea what it\u2019s like to have to watch your electricity.\u201d I have the impression he believes a special place in hell is reserved for those people \u2013 I\u2019m not sure who they are, but he certainly seems to think they do exist \u2013 who believe the problem of obesity would be solved virtually overnight if only everyone knew how \u201cto make their own hummus\u201d.</p> <p>Still, all this surely leaves us with a problem. If the message does eventually get through that diets and exercise don\u2019t work, and that a lot of our trouble lies with our genes, then why would anyone bother to do anything at all to change their lifestyle? Warner doesn\u2019t exactly have an answer to this, beyond telling me he hopes only to help people accept complexity in the matter of weight gain, that we need better information and fewer false prophets, and to insist that, no, he really doesn\u2019t wish to downplay the notion we do have a problem with obesity. \u201cI know this will be framed as: \u2018You don\u2019t care about the health of the nation, you only care about your pay masters at big food.\u2019 But I do think there are serious problems, even if they\u2019re not necessarily the ones people think.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not sure the message will ever get through. Just look at me: I\u2019ve read his book, yet still I\u2019m asking my naughty Protestant questions about self-control (not to mention telling him how I like to get off the bus a stop earlier, the better to try and shrink my bum). And he\u2019s just as bad, in a way. As he\u2019s perfectly willing to admit, if he ever began to get fat, he would almost certainly embark on a diet himself. (Warner has, incidentally, always been slim \u2013 something that, thanks to his genes, has never involved any effort on his part.) It is, he says, part of the human condition that we cling to ideas we know in our hearts to be worthless; to narratives that are little more than the result of a certain kind of brainwashing. In this sense, he\u2019s every bit as human as some of those he is apt to attack. \u201cWe want short cuts,\u201d he says. \u201cWe look at a diet, and we think: that looks OK. I only have to cut out this or that. And so we try it.\u201d He eats the last morsel of schnitzel. Unsurprisingly, given the turn of our conversation, it seems to give him no pleasure at all. </p> <p><em>The Truth About Fat (Oneworld, \u00a314.99) is published on 10 January.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, journalists have been heard to wonder if the moniker under which the so-called Angry Chef has blogged since 2015 is ironic. Before they meet Anthony Warner, they expect the character they encounter online: a choleric type whose white apron, metaphorically speaking, is liberally splattered with the blood of the charlatans and pseudo-scientists he spends his time so furiously pulling apart. But then in he walks, a quietly spoken, dorky-looking bloke with a neatly trimmed beard and distinctly non-architectural glasses, and disappointment rises inside them like a pan coming to the boil. Is he about to yell the F-word in their faces? No, he is not. He is just going to go on \u2013 and on \u2013 about such things as genes and hormones and the difference between a simple problem and a complex one. Is his temperament really so placid? I\u2019m not at all sure it is. Warner, a former chef who went on to work as a development cook at Premier Foods, owner of brands such as Oxo and Mr Kipling, certainly has a careful, almost pedantic way of talking; his determination to avoid generalisations when it comes to talking about diet means he can be both somewhat verbose and a little humourless. He doesn\u2019t swear anything like as a much as his alter-ego. Nevertheless, it\u2019s pretty easy to wind him up. All sorts of things seem to make him irritated, including me. On the quiet \u2013 actually, not even on the quiet \u2013 he\u2019s a massive inverted snob, always on the look-out for perceived slights against processed food and takeaways. When, for instance, I tell a funny (ish) story about how Marco Pierre White became furious when I revealed to him in an interview that I often make my own stock \u2013 White, the original angry chef, was then the face of Knorr cubes \u2013 Warner seems to grow just a little taller in his seat. \u201cWell, I get equally upset when people demean others for using products,\u201d he says. Hang on! I didn\u2019t demean anyone. \u201cNo, but to have a society where people are made to feel guilty for making a pasta bake from a jar\u2026\u201d He picks up his knife and fork, and silently sets about attacking the food on his plate. Warner, who lives in Nottinghamshire, meets me for lunch at a restaurant in London where he has schnitzel with pommes aligot \u2013 a dish that is surely anathema to many, if not most, of the exasperatingly wrong-headed dietary \u201cexperts\u201d who first induced him to begin writing his blog, given that it combines mashed potato with cheese to such powerfully alluring effect. But alas, once his order arrives, he all but ignores it for 20 minutes or so.

First, Cummins was bowled by Shami from one that stayed disproportionately low, and then Handscomb chopped on from Bumrah\u2019s bowling. Lyon was LBW after trying to sweep Kuldeep, his decision not to review earning the ire of many given Australia had two reviews and two wickets up their sleeves. </p> <p>It preceded the primary entertainment of this 30 over day - Starc and Hazlewood putting on 42 together, courtesy of a bit of old-fashioned swashbuckle for the last wicket. Kuldeep eventually produced another killer wrong\u2019un to bamboozle Hazlewood, which gave him five well-deserved wickets for the innings. </p> <p>It also left Australia with yet another batting examination, but one they ultimately didn\u2019t have to face, for today. Harris and Khawaja negotiated four overs before the light was taken, and there was always little chance play would resume thereon.</p> <p>And so to tomorrow, where India will achieve history, and Australia will try and salvage something. The former is a definite, while the latter is anything but. Tune in as our erstwhile Guardian troopers take you through it. A huge thanks to those who kept me company throughout the delay, especially those who wrote in. To those whose brilliant memories of their first Test didn\u2019t make it to air, I apologise.

We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. <a href=\"https://www.wisden.com/stories/my-golden-summer-adam-collins-australia\">I\u2019ve written about that summer (and day) for Wisden</a> in the past, my defining memory Damien Fleming bowling one of the most magical spells of swing bowling I\u2019ve seen, knocking over Gooch and Hick before the close. Oh, and DC Boon\u2019s 20th ton. <br></p> <p>So yes, I missed out on Warne\u2019s hatty and have done so ever since - yet to witness one in Tests. I\u2019ve caught a few in ODIs - on radio calling for James Faulkner\u2019s in Sri Lanka a few years back - but not in the creams. Nor a triple ton, Ross Taylor coming closest (291) in 2015 at the WACA. Thanks to the Australian sub-fielder for taking that fine catch. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c316827e4b0cebe76180ca9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T02:30:16.670Z\">2.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">PLAY TO RESUME AT 1:50pm!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Giddy up!

Their first-class system is so broad and well populated, with players getting a serious diet of months of cricket to hone their skills. There\u2019s a range of conditions now, with plenty of tracks conducive to fast bowling as well as the traditional spinners\u2019 wickets. So India now has a good bunch of fast bowlers, but equally has batsman who can face good fast bowling. When the IPL arrives, it comes after months of competitive four-day cricket.

Former players, broadcasters, supporters, everyone is trying to figure it out. The only people we\u2019re not hearing much from are those at the top, in terms of why the current malaise is as it is. </p> <p>There is a publicly mutiny brewing about selections, with people entirely fed up with having players picked or ignored with no adequate public explanation. That\u2019s fair enough: the members of the panel mostly hide, rarely offer anything bar brief statements, and leave the coach Justin Langer to be the public face of most of their decisions. But it\u2019s not just about who to pick. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a production line of great options to bring in.</p> <p>More broadly, a lot of people in cricket who I\u2019ve been speaking to recently think that the production line is broken. They see a system where cricket clubs are struggling to feel relevant, when \u2018talent\u2019 is identified in early teen years and plucked out of clubs to go into high-performance training pathways. And talented kids get a rails run into age-group teams and so on without necessarily earning it through performance.</p> <p>These sort of factors, plus the gutting of state second XI teams that then entered the Futures League era, one of Greg Chappell\u2019s galaxy-brain revelations, where most of the team had to be under 23. That pushed good developed cricketers out of the system and lowered the standard in general. <br></p> <p>And we\u2019ve seen that same approach come into national selection since Chappell joined that panel, picking young prospects on hunches rather than performance, while other players who had performed missed out. Sam Heazlett, Hilton Cartwright, Marnus Labuschagne, even Mitchell Marsh to a fair degree.</p> <p>Some of these problems are pretty obvious, but they\u2019re not even being acknowledged as problems by the current custodians. Those advocating for solutions are saying that even if they start fixing the system now, it\u2019ll take five to ten years for that to reflect in the calibre of players available in state cricket and to reflect in national performances on the field.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T00:38:35.032Z\">at 12.38am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c314ad3e4b0cebe76180c24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-06T00:25:26.792Z\">12.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/balagere60/status/1081705875755028480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GeoffLemonSport</a> Will the rains help Australian team?</p>&mdash; B.N.N.Prasad (@balagere60) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balagere60/status/1081705875755028480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>My word it will.

Curran can\u2019t be kept out, he\u2019s just the sort of player who could take an Ashes series by the scruff.</p> <p>As for Australia, well. The obvious questions are around the batting. Top four, yes, but England could gobble up Handscomb with his approach, and Head has been so loose and unreliable that I don\u2019t think he can go. Glenn Maxwell is the obvious option who\u2019s played a lot of county cricket. Joe Burns is known as an opener but made his Test debut at six. He\u2019s better equipped than most against the moving ball.</p> <p>So is Matt Renshaw, who is the player I think is best equipped to survive against England. He\u2019s the one I\u2019d like to have opening the batting, but recent circumstances with his poor returns have made that difficult. If he can get his head together and have a strong second half of his Shield season, he might pose a dilemma. Or he should come in against Sri Lanka and try to make his way back.</p> <p>But it\u2019s Australia\u2019s bowling that doesn\u2019t get questioned so much. In England, is there much value in using Mitchell Starc? He\u2019s been out of sorts for almost a year. He\u2019s not bowling penetrative spells. And in England, pure pace doesn\u2019t usually do the job. You want bowlers who can seam or swing the ball, less glamorous and less fast options like Peter Siddle or Chadd Sayers. That\u2019s where I\u2019d be looking.<br> </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3142c0e4b02fb91ff0ef8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-05T23:50:57.360Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I spoke too soon.

We thought it might be hammering down in Sydney until mid-afternoon, but the morning so far is dry. Dry enough. Definitely moist in a fairly armpit sort of way, but nothing literally falling from the sky. If that remains clear, we\u2019ll be on track for an early start, 10am local time, to make up for the early finish on day three. Pat Cummins and Peter Handscomb will be at the crease, trying to provide some more resistance to India\u2019s bowling attack. That batting pair did well last night, Handscomb batting a long time for 28 not out, Cummins taking a more attacking approach but looking safe all the while on his way to 25 not out. The Aussies have 236 on the board with six wickets down, and, they\u2019re still 186 short of avoiding the follow-on. This time, with two spinners in India\u2019s attack and more rain around, you\u2019d have to imagine Kohli would enforce it no matter how long it takes to become available.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, so a rain and light-interrupted day eventually leads to abandonment, with Australia trailing India by 316 runs after Virat Kohli enforced the follow on. Kohli\u2019s call came after India wrapped up Australia\u2019s final four wickets midway through the day, which itself was delayed due to light, persistent rain. First, Cummins was bowled by Shami from one that stayed disproportionately low, and then Handscomb chopped on from Bumrah\u2019s bowling. Lyon was LBW after trying to sweep Kuldeep, his decision not to review earning the ire of many given Australia had two reviews and two wickets up their sleeves. It preceded the primary entertainment of this 30 over day - Starc and Hazlewood putting on 42 together, courtesy of a bit of old-fashioned swashbuckle for the last wicket. Kuldeep eventually produced another killer wrong\u2019un to bamboozle Hazlewood, which gave him five well-deserved wickets for the innings. It also left Australia with yet another batting examination, but one they ultimately didn\u2019t have to face, for today. Harris and Khawaja negotiated four overs before the light was taken, and there was always little chance play would resume thereon. And so to tomorrow, where India will achieve history, and Australia will try and salvage something. The former is a definite, while the latter is anything but. Tune in as our erstwhile Guardian troopers take you through it. A huge thanks to those who kept me company throughout the delay, especially those who wrote in. To those whose brilliant memories of their first Test didn\u2019t make it to air, I apologise. It was a privilege to read them all. We have news Must say, there\u2019s a strong level of consternation around the traps about this. It seems a little counterintuitive to some in the ground, who maintain the light is decent enough. But is it Bumrah-at-140km decent enough? Or Kuldeep-rotation-identification decent enough? It\u2019s hard to say. Even so, what a spell. A question from Rowan It follows from my facetious interest in How Bad Great Batsmen Were When They Retired. If last test innings is used as a metric to assess great batsmen, does that make Jason Gillespie the greatest of all time? Very good. Though my research tells me the highest score in a batsman\u2019s final Test innings remains 258, by West Indies\u2019 Seymour Nurse against New Zealand in Christchurch in 1968-69. This is taken from ESPN Cricinfo: Two others have signed off with a double-century in their final innings: Aravinda de Silva scored 206 for Sri Lanka against Bangladesh in Colombo in 2002, while Australia\u2019s Jason Gillespie made 201 not out, also against Bangladesh, in Chittagong in 2005-06. Andy Sandham (325 for England against West Indies in Kingston in 1929-20) and Bill Ponsford (266 for Australia v England at The Oval in 1934) both passed 200 in the first innings of their final Test. Being There But Not Being There... Respect to Ian Forth for having the courage to share the following: \u201c\u2018Being there but not being there\u2019 for Tugga\u2019s ton reminds me of an early gig going experience of mine (circa 1979). I could not interest anyone else in seeing The Dead Kennedys at Lanchester Polytechnic so went on my own. I saw them and thought they were OK but was disappointed they didn\u2019t play either Holiday in Cambodia or California Uber Alles. Only going home on the bus did the penny drop - that was the support band I\u2019d just seen (UK Decay) and I\u2019d missed seeing the main band entirely. Was too embarrassed to own up to this until now.\u201d My Dad took me to the Michael Bevan last-ball-four game at the SCG in 1996. It rained, and in his view there\u2019d be no more play. \u201cWill you be coming back?\u201d asked the ticket attendant as we left. \u201cNope, no need,\u201d replied The Old Man. Play resumed as we were in the car home. It retrospect he may have played this card to get me - 11 years old - out of the ground. As the match appeared to be petering toward a comfortable Windies win, I was sent to bed. I protested. I lost. I still remember going into Mum and Dad\u2019s room in the morning to ask what had happened in the cricket. \u201cWell, I have to apologise to you, Sam...\u201d started my Dad. So yeah, I was at the Bevan match. But not there. Here\u2019s some Dead Kennedys: A nice follow up to my Falls Festival story from Greg, including The Bees\u2019 best known track (at least in Australia). \u201cThanks for all the great banter as usual,\u201d he writes. \u201cLiked the Warne and Lorne Festival memories.Perhaps you could start a thread on animal, insects, birds, whatever that have halted play? \u201cMeanwhile here\u2019s The Bees-great track and video.\u201d Thommo Rips Through A sterling entry from David here: \u201cFirst test was 1977 Australia vs. India at Perth, notable for being the first season of World Series Cricket and an Australian team made up of a re-called veteran captain (Bob Simpson), a host of uncapped and junior players. And Jeff Thomson. \u201cHot day in Perth. India made it to 2-223 against a lagging attack. Thomson fielding down at fine leg was partaking of the occasional rum and coke being offered from the crowd. Came back for a blistering, late afternoon, dare I say it Cummins-esque spell and ripped out the Indian middle order. Doesn\u2019t get much more alpha.\u201d Ha, alpha indeed. First Tests, continued... This, from Richard, is excellent: \u201cMy first test was as a 16 year old, and was the Lord\u2019s test of in 1975, which Wikipedia tells me was David Steele\u2019s debut match, though I was convinced in my own mind until checking that it had been Graham Gooch\u2019s first game. \u201cI had been to watch Northamptonshire vs Essex in the cigarette sponsored 40 over tournament in the early days of one day cricket in England on the day Gooch\u2019s selection had been announced. He hit a six early on before getting out for 7, and I suppose i had conflated the two events. Anyway, it was a lovely day and the Australian fielders signed lots of autographs for me and others. in those days HM the Queen rocked up to Lord\u2019s tests to meet the teams, so that was all part of the memory, even if the years have clouded other details a bit. I didn\u2019t get her autograph, mind. Seems to be growing irritability in relation to the light situation here. More images from the SCG A pic from 13 minutes ago Looks light enough? Again, no news on the light There is this, though. Nice. I was there for Warne\u2019s 700th too. Had travelled down to Melbourne from Sydney on an overnight sleeper with my Dad, drinking Cognac I\u2019d been gifted for my 21st. It tasted like fuel. We went to the cricket, then I continued to Falls Festival in Lorne. Here was the lineup that year: MODEST MOUSE / THE BEES / BASEMENT JAXX / WOLFMOTHER /HILLTOP HOODS / YOU AM I / SCRIBE / THE AUDREYS / THE SLEEPY JACKSON / WOLFMOTHER / YOUTH GROUP / THE MOUNTAIN GOATS / JOSH PYKE / LITTLE BIRDY / BLUE KING BROWN / THE EXPLODERS / JOHN BUTLER TRIO / JAMIE LIDELL / HILLTOP HOODS / DAN SULTAN / THE BLACK SEEDS / ESKIMO JOE / MATT COSTA / THE VASCO ERA / DEXTER / CUSTOM KINGS / THE EMBERS / DAN KELLY &amp; THE ALPHA MALES / THE FUMES / MIDNIGHT JUGGERNAUTS AND MANY MORE. The guy from The Bees had lost his voice but sung anyway. The vast majority of his songs were in an extremely high register. He struggled. India v Pakistan at Madras, in 1961 Wow, a great memory here, this time shared by Murali Murti, who\u2019s just written in: \u201cFirst Test I ever watched was India vs Pakistan at Madras 1961. Fourth in the series. I remember without effort that Pakistan won the toss and declared at 448-8 after two full days. India batted almost three days to reply with 539-9 declared. Four centuries Saeed, Imtiaz, Umrigar, Borde. Match drawn. That was the only series ever, I think, in which ALL the Tests and ALL the three-day first class fixtures were DRAWN. I like to think that 50 over ODIs and T-20s were invented in someone\u2019s mind during that series.\u201d Fantastic, and a memory all the more special for the sad dearth of Test Matches between these two of late. Twelve years between drinks now. The highest of bars, I daresay. Sounds like you married well, too! Bad light remains, play still suspended... More word on whether we\u2019re likely to get play, or whether stumps will be called, when I have it. More first Tests This from Noel Sheppard: \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend my future living in the past,\u201d writes Noel (a noble idea, not one I\u2019ll be able to achieve) \u201cbut am beguiled by this thread, and so, here goes. \u201cFirst test match memory? Australia vs Pakistan 1964 in a one off Test. I remember being entranced by the names on the MCG scoreboard; Abid Ali, Nasim-ul- Ghani, and wondering why Barry Shepherd\u2019s surname was misspelled! But what about too first Sheffield Shield memory? NSW vs Victoria Xmas 1965; yes, no Boxing Day Test match, but watching Graham Thomas score a double century at almost a run a ball, bowlers like Alan Connolly and John Grant; Stackpole and Cowper, Redpath and Sheahan. O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!\u201d Shield on Christmas Day! How secular! What brilliant memories. I\u2019m of a later vintage, but have great memories of Dad taking me to a cavernous SCG after work during the week (he worked in the city, I went to school in the city), and watching guys like Greg Matthews, Phil Alley and Richard Chee Quee go about their business for the Blues. Love it. This tweet inadvertently stumbles upon one of my favourite sub-categories of obscure interest: How Bad Great Batsmen Were When They Retired. If he could last a session at Test level, looks as though Ian Chappell remained pretty decent to the last. If anyone has any views on this, I\u2019d love to hear them. Further correspondence from Collo\u2019s fans This came in just prior to my stint, from Brian Withington: \u201cHi Adam,\u201d writes Brian. \u201cI see Bob Wilson\u2019s \u2018girl\u2019s blouse\u2019 trip to see Allan Border debut for Essex at Fenners in the mid 80s springtime and raise him Valentine\u2019s Park Ilford in the late 60s watching Keith Fletcher padding away the spinners in the distance. \u201cProper outstation cricket at a time when the counties often played at various club grounds away from HQ. Anyone still doubting the merits of DRS should be transported back to the \u2018good old days\u2019 when canny batsmen neutered offspin by just shoving a pad out ahead of a token trailing bat. Fletcher aka \u2018The Gnome\u2019 was a true master of the black art.\u201d I reply without an enormous amount of context here, but I\u2019m very inclined to agree with Brian. I find this argument for DRS \u2013 that is, it compels batsmen to use their bat \u2013 more compelling than others. Enjoyed the inherent darkness of this tweet, especially the smile emoji. It\u2019s 4.03pm, there\u2019s no news, and the light remains poor Also, Channel 7 are showing their new fishing/cricket hybrid show, which I have on mute. Geoff Lawson is the special guest, and he is catching fish with a burly Australian male, while pictures switch from the \u201889 Ashes tickertape parade in Sydney, and Lawson reeling in a snapper of some description. I also have no idea whether or not it\u2019s a snapper, it just rolled nicely off the tongue. More news on the light when I have it. Let\u2019s continue talking about first Tests This came into Collo before I swapped in, from Paul M: \u201cWhile my first Test was that of Steve Waugh\u2019s last-ball hundred, I have the distinction of having not witnessed a single run from the innings. We had to leave early that day for reasons I\u2019ve since forgotten. Was lucky enough to attend day 3 as well, though there was no addition to his overnight score. Remember him walking out to the middle on day 2 and that feeling like a big deal, but I doubt many thought history was about to be made. So I was sort of there but not quite. Ah well. Got Border\u2019s autograph. And Gilchrist was brilliant both days \u2013 kid me was mesmerised by the live sound of the ball rattling off his bat.\u201d This is a fantastic first note to start on, personally speaking. Steve Waugh\u2019s last ball hundred coincided with the day my then-long term girlfriend and highschool sweetheart left for the UK on a gap year. We\u2019d been together two years. I saw her off at the airport. I was in tears (she wasn\u2019t). I returned home, punched the air at Waugh\u2019s heroics, while drying my damp eyes. Needless to say our relationship ended soon after, though she tried to get back with me upon her return to Australia. I had none of it. But I always think of her when Tugger punches that ball through cover point for four. Play will recommence at 4.03pm, if the light improves (According to CA) Hello all, Well here we are \u2013 India one final push from a comprehensive series win, and history, while Australia have one more shot in the search for a sliver of batting light. Speaking of electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, the light in Sydney is not good. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s gloomy, and the players are off for tea eight minutes early owing to the dimness. It\u2019s heading toward 4pm in Sydney, and it\u2019s pretty tough to see how things will improve. It\u2019s grey as far as the eye can see, the lights are on, ergo if light is the issue now, it will remain the issue into the evening. Let\u2019s hope otherwise, as there\u2019s still a couple of interesting mini-narratives to mine before the day\u2019s out. I see there\u2019s been some great chat with Collo on the subject of first Tests. Will prepare my own story in due course \u2013 looks like we\u2019ll have some time on our hands. If you want to get in touch, it\u2019s sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk, or @sjjperry on the Twitter machine. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks for the lovely notes about your first visits to a Test Match (or a First Class fixture, in Paris Bob\u2019s case). They were excellent. I\u2019m handing the baton to Sam Perry in Melbourne, who will take you through to the close, which might be sooner rather than later if the light doesn\u2019t improve. I\u2019ll pass on the emails I didn\u2019t get to through to him as well. Talk tomorrow. Bye for now! 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Khawaja 4, Harris 2) Nice clip from Harris to begin to get himself off the mark, taking two to midwicket. Bumrah goes upstairs later in the set and hits him on the glove. Had he not got his hand in the way, that would have been his third whack to the helmet this series. The exchange prompts a conversation between the umpires and they elect to take an early tea. 3rd over: Australia 4-0 (Khawaja 4, Harris 0) Back to back Maidens, Khawaja watching Shami carefully. The job for Australia today is to get the Indian quicks tiring. The last time that Australia were asked to follow-on was at Trent Bridge in 2005, Lawrie Colliver reveals on Fox Sports. As it happens, they nearly won that, with Ash Giles and Matthew Hoggard helping England limp over the line. Blimey, what a series. \u201cFirst test attended was 1993 Ashes contest at Edgbaston,\u201d emails Iain Bannatyne. \u201cAussie optimism should have been crushed by the rocks of Atherton, Smith, Hussain, Thorpe and Stewart. But a bowling attack of Bicknell, Such and Illott was bound to undermine even the fiercest batting talents and Australia cruised home.\u201d Was that the Test with the crazy Brendon Julian caught and bowled? If it is, I\u2019ll dig the footage out at tea and pass it over to Sam Perry, who is taking over from me then. 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Khawaja 4, Harris 0) Bumrah beats Harris immediately! The opener probably didn\u2019t need to offer a shot at it but the Indian quick has a habit of confusing players early in an innings - see Harris at Perth and Jennings at Southampton. \u201cFeeling rather ancient to recall that my first Test was in 1968 at the Oval vs Australia,\u201d contributes Brian Withington. \u201cIt was day four (Monday) and I recall my Dad only decided to go when it looked likely that Australia would avoid the follow on (Edrich and D\u2019Oliveira had made big hundreds in the first innings). As a result we got to see a pell mell innings from England with the likes of Colin Milburn and Ted Dexter chasing quick runs. (I was shocked to see on Cricinfo that it took nearly 59 overs to score 181 all out.) Two quick Aus wickets before close rounded off a great day\u2019s introduction to the joys of live cricket. The following day was almost washed out, but a desperate drying operation allowed \u201cdeadly\u201d Derek Underwood to polish them off for a famous victory. Of course the match achieved lasting fame as the D\u2019Oliveira Test after he was initially (shamefully) dropped and then later reinstated for the SA winter tour that never was. The rest is history.\u201d What a Test to claim as your debut! Dolly and Deadly, the mopping up effort, Milburn at his biggest. Yup. A fantastic nomination. Any older than that? Surrrrely we have one? 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Khawaja 4, Harris 0) Khawaja is playing with soft hands early, which is helpful when his outside edge is located by Shami with the third ball. Australia\u2019s most important player is much happier with a full ball on leg stump to finish, clipping it with ease to the rope to get himself, and his side, off the mark. \u201cGood afternoon Adam.\u201d G\u2019day Michael Brown. \u201cThis may not be the most antique reference but it\u2019s a nice opportunity to mention that the 50th anniversary of my first live Test experience is only a couple of weeks away. I saw a day\u2019s play between Australia and the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval in late January 1969. I was 10 years of age.\u201d An achievement worth celebrating! I hope there is a game you can visit on that date. The players are back on the field! Marcus Harris and Usman Khawaja are in the middle, Australia with a 322-run deficit to deal with Or a better way of looking at it: about 130 overs, or something like that, to surirve. They lasted longer in Dubai, I\u2019ll have you remember. Okay, ready to roll, Shami to start from the Randwick End. PLAY! Some fantastic content for the break. Channel Seven got Jim Maxwell and Tim Lane together some 16 years after their final Test together on the ABC. I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with Jim over the last handful of years - he\u2019s a wonderful man. If you\u2019re part of the UK audience that adores him on BBC Test Match Special, I loved writing this in 2017 for The Nightwatchman special on the programme\u2019s 60th birthday. That final wicket. I\u2019m thrilled for the young man. He\u2019s a ripper. Kuldeep gets his fifth! 5/99 to be precise, for his first Test stint in Australia. He gets the final wicket with a lovely wrong\u2019un, the third time that delivery has brought him a reward. \u201cIt is a boyhood dream walking off the SCG in front of your teammate with a five-for,\u201d says Kerry O\u2019Keeffe. \u201cA terrific display of slow bowling.\u201d Just fantastic. The decision was reviewed but confirmed by DRS as touching the very top of leg stump. It is also confirmed as they are walking off that India have enforced the follow-on. 104th over: Australia 299-9 (Starc 28, Hazlewood 21) Shami is back; not at what Kohli wanted at all ahead of a potential follow-on shift. And Starc responds by slapping him over midwicket for three! What a lovely time these two are having. The quick hits Hazlewood on the arm guard later in the set, which he would have enjoyed a lot more. 103rd over: Australia 296-9 (Starc 25, Hazlewood 21) \u201cThis is turning into a very irrtating partnership for India,\u201d says Harsha Bhogle on Fox Cricket, Starc driving one and Hazlewood two, then lofting a couple more over Kuldeep\u2019s head. Into the 20s! \u201cYour first flesh-life Test Match is all very well but the real story is one\u2019s First Class debut,\u201d begins Bob Wilson. This should be good. \u201cForget the bimbo glamour of internationals and reach back for that disturbing moment when a child\u2019s love of the bright, busy televised square of cricketing excitement is squashed by the existential injury of watching an invisibly distant group of players in mystifying activity amongst the tiny huddle of wretching tramps, permanent virgins and astounding weirdoes that makes up the usual terrifying dozen or so watching the average game.\u201d It\u2019s a very reasonable point. Continue, my friend. \u201cI win. Mine was watching Allan Border\u2019s Essex debut in an April blizzard at Fenners. Wrapped in about 17 jumpers, Border knocked out a tidy 80 or so before the despair swallowed him up, poor lamb. Not sure he was ever the same again but it definitely ****ing hardened him.\u201d Well then. How do I say this? My first Shield game I have a diary entry about. I found it a few years ago and popped it on instragram. It was the day Matt Elliott made his first Shield double and Ian Harvey his maiden First Class ton! COP THAT, M80! 102nd over: Australia 291-9 (Starc 24, Hazlewood 17) Bosh! Hazlewood slaps Jaedja and slaps him well, over midwicket for four. Dare I say it: both players are now in. 101st over: Australia 287-9 (Starc 24, Hazlewood 13) Kuldeep has been swung around for a second time this session, back to the Randwick End where he claimed the fourth of his wickets earlier. There is nothing going on for him here though, Starc striking a nice straight drive for two then pushing another to cover. The runs don\u2019t mean an awful lot - Australia aren\u2019t making India bat again in this Test, let\u2019s not be silly - but this is valuable time they are taking out of the game. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Brian Withington, my old OBO comrade. What say you? \u201cYour 93rd over reference to Shane Warne and the Dalai Llama prompts thoughts of a series on great conversations in history, featuring one cricketer and an improbable alter ego. First up I nominate Merv Hughes and Gandhi - surely they would find plenty of common ground, if only in a shared ambivalence about the merits of English colonial rule?\u201d I\u2019m going to dig into my memory during the innings break to try and come up with the least likely pairing that I happened upon during my political days. I suspect Hulk Hogan is going to feature from the day he visited Parliament House. What a day that was. 100th over: Australia 283-9 (Starc 21, Hazlewood 12) Vihari, who has a bit of a golden arm, is on to try and finish this off with Kuldeep taken off. The Australian pair exchange singles, Starc finding the sweeper at deep point to keep the strike. \u201cI feel like all of you are old as heck,\u201d emails Seventh Horcrux. It\u2019s all relative, I say! \u201cMy first memory of *watching* cricket is the \u201803 World Cup, me just a kid. Things that you guys talk about seeing live are things I\u2019ve only read about. I plan on tormenting the generations to come similarly. If Test Cricket endures the test of time.\u201d I\u2019m including this because you are a kind and informed emailer, but remember, I\u2019m after the first Tests that you went along to rather than cricket you saw on the telly. Danke! 99th over: Australia 281-9 (Starc 20, Hazlewood 11) Hazlewood\u2019s turn, sweeping the first ball of the new Jadeja over behind square for four! That was right out of the middle. He then gives the strike back to Starc with one to mid-off, who plays out the rest. Drinks! Australia lost 3/45 across the belated opening hour of day four, this pair adding 23 so far for the final wicket. Hazlewood should have been caught not long after arriving to give Kuldeep his fifth, but Vihari put down the easy chance at midwicket. Even so, Australia trail by 341 runs so they will be almost certainly be following on soon. 98th over: Australia 276-9 (Starc 20, Hazlewood 6) Nice work Mitchell Starc, getting well down the track to smother Kuldeep\u2019s spin then leaning well back to cut him to the rope. It\u2019s easy to forget that Starc was a very handy No8 a couple of years ago, before he turned into a far less dependable No9. But he\u2019s been much better this summer. 97th over: Australia 272-9 (Starc 16, Hazlewood 6) Jadeja through one of those impossible-to-OBO 60-second maidens at Hazlewood. It happened and that\u2019s all I know. 96th over: Australia 272-9 (Starc 16, Hazlewood 6) Yes, Kuldeep does get another go, now from the Paddington End. Hazlewood is playing the spinner well though, driving him down the ground for a couple then deflecting one with soft hands behind point for one. Meanwhile, on twitter there is a bit of a stir about Lyon not reviewing his lbw, bouncing just before hitting his toe (I gather), which suggests he would have been saved with it pitching outside off. This is Ponting\u2019s take on the Seven call. 95th over: Australia 269-9 (Starc 16, Hazlewood 3) Kuldeep taken off? Get out of it, Virat! Hopefully, hopefully he is being swung around to Bumrah\u2019s end. Not a lot going on between Jadeja and Starc until the latter picks up two off the back foot to midwicket. Australia trail by 353 runs, so the follow-on is still very much on. 94th over: Australia 267-9 (Starc 14, Hazlewood 3) Bumrah is bowling quick and short then quick and full. Hazlewood won\u2019t be enjoying this at all. But he does manage to pick up a couple off leg stump with a well-timed tuck. Starc\u2019s turn against Kuldeep. 93rd over: Australia 265-9 (Starc 14, Hazlewood 1) \u201cI\u2019d love to catch up,\u201d Warne says of the Dalai Lama (!), in a discussion about Dharamsala, where Kuldeep took four wickets against Australia in the first innings on debut in 2017. Loving those areas, Shane. Oh, a dropped catch denies the spinner a fifth here, Vihari under a skied Hazlewood top-edge but putting it down - badly. It was another lovely bit of bowling, deploying the wrong\u2019un at the ideal time with the No11 hitting across the line. 92nd over: Australia 264-9 (Starc 14, Hazlewood 0) Starc takes the two on offer early in the over to midwicket, keen not to expose Hazlewood to Bumrah. Ooooh, the slower ball yorker again! Shaun Marsh wasn\u2019t able to keep it out last week at Melbourne but Starc keeps does this well, driving the next delivery lavishly through cover for four! But he can\u2019t get off strike from the final ball, so Kuldeep will get a pop at Hazlewood. 91st over: Australia 258-9 (Starc 8, Hazlewood 0) Josh Hazlewood has bagged three ducks in the first innings in this series, Fox Sports shows us as he takes guard. But he gets through the one remaining Kuldeep ball here, defending into the off-side. I\u2019ll come to your First Test emails in the innings break, which will be with us quite soon. Lyon sweeps at a straight one and misses, the finger of Ian Gould straight up. There is no review required on that, hitting him on the toe. He\u2019s been set up wonderfully, Kuldeep sending down two wrong\u2019uns before the fatal quicker one. What a fantastic bowler. 90th over: Australia 257-8 (Starc 7, Lyon 0) Lyon is beaten immediately from the one that doesn\u2019t jag back. That\u2019s super bowling first up from Bumrah to the new man. Bumrah is through him off an inside edge! Handscomb was caught on the crease by the Indian quick, the delivery coming back off the seam, kissing the inside edge and deflecting off the back pad before crashing into the Victorian\u2019s woodwork. \u201cBeaten for pace,\u201d says Adam Gilchrist on TV. 89th over: Australia 257-7 (Handscomb 37, Starc 7) Handscomb off the mark for the day, sweeping the Kuldeep expertly then tucking him just as nicely, earning two boundaries for his efforts. I\u2019m surprised that Kohli has turned to spin so quickly with the second new ball behaving weirdly for Shami only a few overs ago. 88th over: Australia 248-7 (Handscomb 28, Starc 7) Bumrah cramps Starc up, finding a leading edge that nearly gets back to him in his follow through. Close. But the big quick does well to the next, taking two off his hip before defending and leaving the rest. \u201cA very historic game,\u201d says John Catchlove. \u201cI went to each day of the 3rd ashes test 1970/71. It was historic because not a ball was bowled and the match abandoned after 3 days of rain. The 5th day was set aside as the first ODI which Australia won. I was there for all of that game as well. Also historic.\u201d You\u2019re right - a truly historic week at Melbourne Brilliant. I remember reading that Tim Lane (from memory!) was also there that day, sitting behind Peter Hudson. Of course, Huddo went on to kick 150 goals in 1971 (equalling Bob Pratt\u2019s record) in the magnificent Hawthorn season. So they say, the most brutal Grand Final of them all. 87th over: Australia 246-7 (Handscomb 28, Starc 5) Shami to Handscomb, defending into the off-side from the first half of the over, leaving when Shami tempts him outside the off-stump. Another shoots low later in the set, but Handscomb was on the front foot and had enough time to adjust his shot. Good batting from the Victorian skipper. \u201cMust have been 1971, England vs. the West Indies at The Oval,\u201d Ben Carter says of the first Test Match that he saw in the flesh. \u201cMy only memory is Rohan Kanhai hitting someone into the crowd for six, and then Clive Lloyd doing the same thing. I was eight at the time.\u201d Wonderful - my favourite ground. If I had a time machine, one of the journeys I would make would be to visit a Test Match from before colour television. 86th over: Australia 246-7 (Handscomb 28, Starc 5) Lovely shot from Starc from the first ball of Bumrah\u2019s spell, lashing a straight drive past the bowler and down to the rope. His batting hasn\u2019t been bad in this series but has been trending down for the last couple of years on the whole. They really need him to get stuck in for an hour or two here. More runs later in the over - five of them - when Bumrah\u2019s bouncer clears both Starc and Pant, smashing into the advertising boards. They all count. \u201cHow\u2019s the Bash Brothers go?\u201d Warne asks of Brisbane\u2019s BBL game last night. \u201cBashed it, probably.\u201d Updated session times from CA: Middle 13:50 - 15:50 (drinks 1450), Final 1610-1800 Then we can play up to an additional 30min in order to achieve minimum overs. 85th over: Australia 237-7 (Handscomb 28, Starc 1) Gosh, watching a couple of replays that has really kept low. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything about that,\u201d says Warne on the TV. Starc, the new man, is off the mark with a clip behind square. Remember, Australia still has to find 186 further runs to avoid the follow-on. Phwoaaaar! Off-stump out of the ground! Cummins was caught on the crease, beaten almost under the bat with the delivery keeping low. The new ball has taken three balls to earn a breakthrough for the visitors, ending the 42-run partnership. 84th over: Australia 236-6 (Handscomb 28, Cummins 25) Jadeja immediately finds his range, Handscomb well forward in defence. At the end of the over, Kohli signals to the umpires that he will take the second new ball. The players are on the field! Jadeja will complete his over from last night; he has three balls to come. Handscomb (28) is on strike with Cummins (25) down the other end, Australia resuming on 236-6, still 386 behind India\u2019s first innings of 622-6 (dec). PLAY! \u201cYou said a few days ago this was your 109th Test,\u201d emails Andrew Benton. \u201cGive us a potted history of your test appearances while the rain falls, would you? I\u2019m going to guess, your first was.....2nd in 1998 Aus vs Ind (?). When you was still a lad.\u201d Close! 1994-95 was the first time that I was taken along to the \u2018G for a Test, on day four of that Ashes match - the day before Warne\u2019s hat-trick. We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. I\u2019ve written about that summer (and day) for Wisden in the past, my defining memory Damien Fleming bowling one of the most magical spells of swing bowling I\u2019ve seen, knocking over Gooch and Hick before the close. Oh, and DC Boon\u2019s 20th ton. So yes, I missed out on Warne\u2019s hatty and have done so ever since - yet to witness one in Tests. I\u2019ve caught a few in ODIs - on radio calling for James Faulkner\u2019s in Sri Lanka a few years back - but not in the creams. Nor a triple ton, Ross Taylor coming closest (291) in 2015 at the WACA. Thanks to the Australian sub-fielder for taking that fine catch. Giddy up! The covers are off and the officials are satisfied that the field will be ready to go in 20 minutes from now. With one big caveat: \u201cif no further rain.\u201d Thanks, Geoff. Hello everyone. I\u2019ll level with you: the strong likelihood is that I\u2019ll be OBOing the rain for a few hours as well. It\u2019s not heavy but they can\u2019t get enough of a break to get the covers off even for a moment. Sigh. I\u2019m actually in the SCG Trust lunch at the moment, an unorthodox place for this product to be invited with former Prime Ministers and whatnot floating around, but here we are and we\u2019re grateful for it. The chairman, Tony Shepherd, just presented an award to a member who has been signed up here for 70 years. He told a story about watching Bradman and Barnes batting together here in 1947, the latter giving his wicket away on 234 so he would be dismissed on the same score as the former. Priceless. Oh - GOOD NEWS! The umpires are on the field are they have been followed by the ground staff, suggesting that the rain might have stopped. So we might see some cricketer sooner rather than later after all. For now, I\u2019m keen to find out who our oldest reader is today. Measured not by age, but rather, the first memory you have of attending a Test Match in the flesh. Tell me on the email or the tweet. The more obscure the better. I\u2019ll be back with an update soon. Such as it is. We haven\u2019t had any play. I haven\u2019t had any lunch. I\u2019m going to do that, and Adam Collins will describe rain to you for the couple of hours from here. Or perhaps we\u2019ll get some action at some stage. Though in a perverse way, doing the OBO during the rain is one of my favourite things. It\u2019s just nice to spend some time with you all, sitting down together like a family for once. Till tomorrow. \u201cIs having a retractable roof at a cricket ground a possible solution to this problem of rain delays? I thought Headingley was going to do this a few years ago? Just wondering if it can be done in Australia?\u201d Aditya, it has been done in Australia \u2013 we first played some ODIs against... South Africa, I think? Shaun Pollock\u2019s team? Back in 2003 or 2004 or similiar. The Docklands stadium in Melbourne has a roof, and that\u2019s where the Renegades play in the Big Bash. There\u2019s a drop-in pitch, obviously, which isn\u2019t\u2019 great, but those are getting better. The main problem is that an indoor ground can only operate under lights, so it can only host games with a white ball or a pink ball. Unless they can come up with a transparent roof, so we could all laugh at the impotent rain as it splatted up against a marvel of human engineering. Hubris in the face of nature never goes wrong. Tough question. Nominations anyone? About 20 Pakistan teams that I can think of would give it a nudge. Also Bangladesh before the last three or four years, when they played the raft of left-arm spinners. That\u2019s the million dollar question... I like your maverick move throwing Harris into the middle order. Why not? Renshaw of course had a poor Shield half-season in November, but he\u2019s also the most likely viable long-term option. So he needs to be brought back through eventually, and built back up to his best. Which is in 13 minutes time. Which seems daft. Why not take it now and hope we can get the ground ready? The covers are still on, but a good ground staff can get things sorted in 30 to 40 minutes if the rain stops. If it\u2019s even still raining, it doesn\u2019t look like it is. Thomas Hopkins emails in from England\u2019s north. \u201cAs a Yorkist, I was surprised that Jason Gillespie didn\u2019t get the Aussie coach gig. Did a grand job with the Tykes, all round good egg and (to be blunt) more of a break with some of the more tedious practices than Langer. Did his face not fit, or maybe he just didn\u2019t fancy it?\u201d I\u2019m not sure he really wanted it \u2013 I think he would have taken it, but he\u2019s got a young family and probably would rather do that job a bit later in life. But mostly it was that Langer was already perceived by CA to be the next in line, and had been for years. His appointment was a formality. You might as well follow Tyrone\u2019s advice, given there\u2019s not much happening here. We\u2019ll have an early lunch called any moment, surely, meaning you\u2019ll have the 40 minutes necessary to hear this chat. Harsha Bhogle was very open with us about his life and career with its downs as well as some remarkable ups. The podcast is here. Quality content, Dylan. An older and wiser James Sherry is now the ground MC for Cricket Australia now, so it\u2019s relevant. I think that he thinks he\u2019s taken plenty already. To some degree, maybe there\u2019s only so much you can do with players who aren\u2019t equipped for the rigours of Test cricket. You can drill it into Travis Head that he shouldn\u2019t play massive swipes at the ball when he\u2019s trying to bat out time in a Test, but if he keeps doing it anyway, is that the coach\u2019s fault? I think we need a bigger sample size. What is notable is that the cohesive feel of all those Perth Scorchers and WA sides, where everyone knew his role and was confident in fulfilling it, is missing from this side at the moment. And the endless backing of players on personality rather than progress is definitely part of the Langer method. Covers are still on, and none of the groundstaff are hanging about anymore. A general sense of funk has settled over the ground, and not in the George Clinton sense. \u201cWasn\u2019t Greg Chappell a selector last time Australia lost an Ashes at home, and probably responsible for such masterstrokes as Michael Beer?\u201d asks Aditya on email. \u201cNot to mention ruining Indian cricket 2005-2007? Why is he being allowed to ruin Australian cricket again?\u201d I\u2019ll take that as a comment. As for India \u2013 well, they\u2019re really just getting going. Their first-class system is so broad and well populated, with players getting a serious diet of months of cricket to hone their skills. There\u2019s a range of conditions now, with plenty of tracks conducive to fast bowling as well as the traditional spinners\u2019 wickets. So India now has a good bunch of fast bowlers, but equally has batsman who can face good fast bowling. When the IPL arrives, it comes after months of competitive four-day cricket. So players known from the IPL, like Agarwal or Bumrah or Pant, can come into Test cricket and still get it right. Gosh, there has been a lot of searching of the souls in Australian cricket in the past 12 months. Former players, broadcasters, supporters, everyone is trying to figure it out. The only people we\u2019re not hearing much from are those at the top, in terms of why the current malaise is as it is. There is a publicly mutiny brewing about selections, with people entirely fed up with having players picked or ignored with no adequate public explanation. That\u2019s fair enough: the members of the panel mostly hide, rarely offer anything bar brief statements, and leave the coach Justin Langer to be the public face of most of their decisions. But it\u2019s not just about who to pick. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a production line of great options to bring in. More broadly, a lot of people in cricket who I\u2019ve been speaking to recently think that the production line is broken. They see a system where cricket clubs are struggling to feel relevant, when \u2018talent\u2019 is identified in early teen years and plucked out of clubs to go into high-performance training pathways. And talented kids get a rails run into age-group teams and so on without necessarily earning it through performance. These sort of factors, plus the gutting of state second XI teams that then entered the Futures League era, one of Greg Chappell\u2019s galaxy-brain revelations, where most of the team had to be under 23. That pushed good developed cricketers out of the system and lowered the standard in general. And we\u2019ve seen that same approach come into national selection since Chappell joined that panel, picking young prospects on hunches rather than performance, while other players who had performed missed out. Sam Heazlett, Hilton Cartwright, Marnus Labuschagne, even Mitchell Marsh to a fair degree. Some of these problems are pretty obvious, but they\u2019re not even being acknowledged as problems by the current custodians. Those advocating for solutions are saying that even if they start fixing the system now, it\u2019ll take five to ten years for that to reflect in the calibre of players available in state cricket and to reflect in national performances on the field. My word it will. If it lasts another two days. The whole square\u2019s covers are now down again. I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s raining from up in the stand, or if the windows are just a bit filmy. It must be very light if it is. No one\u2019s bothering with an umbrella except for the fourth umpire. \u201cRe your recent update which included the line \u2018The tractors are still out in the middle\u2019: that\u2019s really no way to speak of Australia\u2019s middle order.\u201d Olly, please. Pat Cummins is an Aston Martin. (Peter Handscomb might be one of those funny three-wheeled cars that looks totally impractical but somehow continues to function.) There\u2019s this. But also if the ball gets damp, it might ruin any chance of swing or seam, and make it hard to grip for the spinners. So it might aid Australia for the time being by neutering the bowling. Umpires Gould and Kettleborough have just walked to the middle, hat-less (shocking I know), and walked off again. No movement in the middle, where one small cover remains over the pitch, but the covers for the square remain rolled up on a trailer. Ian Forth is prognosticating. \u201cI know there are matches against Sri Lanka to go, which might confuse things considerably, but was musing on what the opening line ups for The Ashes might be. \u201cAustralia: Warner, Harris, Khawaja, Smith, Handscomb, Head, Paine, Cummins, Lyon, Starc, Hazlewood. \u201cEngland: Jennings, Burns, Bairstow, Root, Buttler, Stokes, Foakes, Ali, Woakes, S. Curran, Anderson. \u201cAustralia\u2019s 7 and 8 better then their 5 and 6. But England\u2019s 9 and 10 better than their 1 and 2. Any thoughts yourself?\u201d As it has been for England for a while, a weak opening partnership doesn\u2019t necessarily cripple their chances, because they have such a versatile middle and lower order. Interesting that Broad would miss in Ian\u2019s team, when he\u2019s monstered the Australians on three consecutive visits. I\u2019d think that spectre alone might keep him in the side, though of course Woakes offers more with the bat. Curran can\u2019t be kept out, he\u2019s just the sort of player who could take an Ashes series by the scruff. As for Australia, well. The obvious questions are around the batting. Top four, yes, but England could gobble up Handscomb with his approach, and Head has been so loose and unreliable that I don\u2019t think he can go. Glenn Maxwell is the obvious option who\u2019s played a lot of county cricket. Joe Burns is known as an opener but made his Test debut at six. He\u2019s better equipped than most against the moving ball. So is Matt Renshaw, who is the player I think is best equipped to survive against England. He\u2019s the one I\u2019d like to have opening the batting, but recent circumstances with his poor returns have made that difficult. If he can get his head together and have a strong second half of his Shield season, he might pose a dilemma. Or he should come in against Sri Lanka and try to make his way back. But it\u2019s Australia\u2019s bowling that doesn\u2019t get questioned so much. In England, is there much value in using Mitchell Starc? He\u2019s been out of sorts for almost a year. He\u2019s not bowling penetrative spells. And in England, pure pace doesn\u2019t usually do the job. You want bowlers who can seam or swing the ball, less glamorous and less fast options like Peter Siddle or Chadd Sayers. That\u2019s where I\u2019d be looking. I spoke too soon. The hessian has just gone back down with a tiny bit of mizzle drifting across the ground. As we know, umpires can\u2019t restart play until the atmosphere is completely dry. That\u2019s 12 minutes from now. The sky is still cloudy but has lightened a bit. The rain is holding off. The tractors are still out in the middle. A few Bronxies around the ground as the big covers come off. At last, at last. And now the hessian is being rolled up. Stand by. \u201cGood morning Geoff.\u201d Good morning, Ruth Purdue, up and at \u2018em as always. \u201cPredictions on Australia\u2019s first innings total?\u201d If they ever get on, you mean? I\u2019m going to be optimistic and go for 280. Just had a wander around the internal roads around the ground, and there are good numbers of people milling about and coming in for a day\u2019s cricket. Sadly their shorts and shirtsleeves look a bit thin up against a fairly cold wind and the persistent drizzle. There are no clouds on the radar, so it\u2019s coming from imaginary clouds that only we can see. A collective mass delusion at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In years to come I can say that I was there. And you can say that you read some live text updates from someone who was there. GET ON THE RAIN TRAIN! (It\u2019s raining.) There\u2019s a conference ongoing in the middle of the ground between umpires, match referee, ground staff. But no movement. \u201cThis is where Test cricket shoots itself in the foot,\u201d says Dirk Nannes on ABC radio. I tend to agree. New word: there\u2019ll be an inspection at 10:15. And now there\u2019s misty drizzle falling around the SCG, a few beads on the glass. Yes, that\u2019s right. At 9:56am the umpires have decided the light is insufficient to start play. It is pretty gloomy. Is it gloomier than last night? Not sure about that, but I don\u2019t have the light meter. There are thick clouds overhead, and they might clear soon. Or empty themselves. If you\u2019re not in the geo-blocked zones (apologies there) this might be of interest: what Peter Handscomb did differently. One thing we noticed was meeting the seamers further down the wicket: his point of impact was half a metre further down than it was in Perth before he got dropped. A cracker of a one-day game over the Ditch overnight: Sri Lanka were 128-7 at one stage chasing 320, but they ended up getting bowled out by New Zealand for 298. Thisara Perera went to town and made 140 off about 70 balls. Find the highlights of that one, I suggest. In other good news for women\u2019s cricket: this. Well done to Brisbane. The Australian Cricket Media Association had its annual dinner last night. Congratulations are in order for the recipients of the two annual awards: Emerging Women\u2019s Player of the Year going to Sophie Molineux, and Emerging Men\u2019s Player of the Year to Marcus Harris. Interestingly both play for the Melbourne Renegades, Victoria, and Australia (despite being a consensus award and most of the ACMA members coming from New South Wales). Oops, they did it again. The Australian top order, that is. Had the chance to make a statement and instead mumbled into their shirt collars. If you\u2019d like to catch up with yesterday, here\u2019s my piece. Ahoy sailors. We thought it might be hammering down in Sydney until mid-afternoon, but the morning so far is dry. Dry enough. Definitely moist in a fairly armpit sort of way, but nothing literally falling from the sky. If that remains clear, we\u2019ll be on track for an early start, 10am local time, to make up for the early finish on day three. Pat Cummins and Peter Handscomb will be at the crease, trying to provide some more resistance to India\u2019s bowling attack. That batting pair did well last night, Handscomb batting a long time for 28 not out, Cummins taking a more attacking approach but looking safe all the while on his way to 25 not out. The Aussies have 236 on the board with six wickets down, and, they\u2019re still 186 short of avoiding the follow-on. This time, with two spinners in India\u2019s attack and more rain around, you\u2019d have to imagine Kohli would enforce it no matter how long it takes to become available.",

      "body": "<p>David Bowie, who died three years ago this week, was interviewed in the <em>Observer Magazine </em>shortly after he turned \u2018a remarkable 40\u2019 for the 12 April 1987 issue. \u2018After all these years of playing a role,\u2019 the piece proclaimed, \u2018the latest Bowie to emerge might be the real one.\u2019</p> <p>Bowie was promoting his latest album, <em>Never Let Me Down</em>, \u2018a harsh, intense batch of songs, driven by screeching guitars and full of lyrics about sex, drugs and images of nuclear meltdown\u2019. Years later, Bowie felt it was his nadir: \u2018It was such an awful album.\u2019</p> <p>Is Bowie burnt out at this advanced age for a pop star, wondered the interviewer. \u2018If you\u2019re a painter, you don\u2019t say: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve had enough of me now.\u2019 Well, I think like that. I\u2019m doing it for me, and I enjoy what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 He is asked, rather cheekily, if Prince has replaced him, but Bowie is magnanimous rather than defensive. \u2018In terms of the more exhibitionist forms of theatricality and musicianship, yeah. Absolutely. He\u2019s sort of the 80s version. I\u2019ve moved on to a different area now, and I don\u2019t think anybody else could handle the job better.\u2019</p> <p>Bowie spoke defiantly about the video for the single Day In Day Out being banned from American TV (it features homelessness and prostitution). \u2018We\u2019re not changing a thing. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s never shown. The song has some tough things to say and I wanted the video to have the same weight.\u2019</p> <p>Referring to his Live Aid appearance in 1985, Bowie agreed that it was \u2018a wonderful experience\u2019, before changing tack. \u2018Financially it doesn\u2019t mean shit \u2013 whatever amount you raise it\u2019s gonna be nothing. It\u2019s only going to be a token gesture. But I\u2019m a great believer that of all the art forms, rock is the living art form. It\u2019s the living culture, it\u2019s the one thing that can actually move and change society.\u2019 Something he managed to do right the way through to his remarkable final album, <em>Blackstar</em>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Bowie, who died three years ago this week, was interviewed in the Observer Magazine shortly after he turned \u2018a remarkable 40\u2019 for the 12 April 1987 issue. \u2018After all these years of playing a role,\u2019 the piece proclaimed, \u2018the latest Bowie to emerge might be the real one.\u2019 Bowie was promoting his latest album, Never Let Me Down, \u2018a harsh, intense batch of songs, driven by screeching guitars and full of lyrics about sex, drugs and images of nuclear meltdown\u2019. Years later, Bowie felt it was his nadir: \u2018It was such an awful album.\u2019 Is Bowie burnt out at this advanced age for a pop star, wondered the interviewer. \u2018If you\u2019re a painter, you don\u2019t say: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve had enough of me now.\u2019 Well, I think like that. I\u2019m doing it for me, and I enjoy what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 He is asked, rather cheekily, if Prince has replaced him, but Bowie is magnanimous rather than defensive. \u2018In terms of the more exhibitionist forms of theatricality and musicianship, yeah. Absolutely. He\u2019s sort of the 80s version. I\u2019ve moved on to a different area now, and I don\u2019t think anybody else could handle the job better.\u2019 Bowie spoke defiantly about the video for the single Day In Day Out being banned from American TV (it features homelessness and prostitution). \u2018We\u2019re not changing a thing. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s never shown. The song has some tough things to say and I wanted the video to have the same weight.\u2019 Referring to his Live Aid appearance in 1985, Bowie agreed that it was \u2018a wonderful experience\u2019, before changing tack. \u2018Financially it doesn\u2019t mean shit \u2013 whatever amount you raise it\u2019s gonna be nothing. It\u2019s only going to be a token gesture. But I\u2019m a great believer that of all the art forms, rock is the living art form. It\u2019s the living culture, it\u2019s the one thing that can actually move and change society.\u2019 Something he managed to do right the way through to his remarkable final album, Blackstar.",

Both the people who run them and those who eat in them have to pretend it\u2019s a real place with its own robust identity, not just that space to the right of reception which, in another life, could have been a function room booked out for presentations by moist-lipped salespeople with timeshares to flog.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gridironlondon.com/\" title=\"\">Gridiron</a> at the blunt white box of a hotel that is the Metropolitan on London\u2019s Park Lane has worked hard at the illusion. Serious people have been hired. The consultant chef, Richard Turner, has intimate knowledge of dead cow. At <a href=\"https://thehawksmoor.com/\" title=\"\">Hawksmoor</a>, he gave the steak house a profoundly British accent. He set up the classy butcher\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.turnerandgeorge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Turner &amp; George</a>. Head chef Colin McSherry has worked at the Fat Duck and Ledbury and mastered the subtleties of the live fire cooking that gives the place its name, courtesy of the \u201cgridiron\u201d cooking grill that dominates the open kitchen.

I loved the sound of \u201cWood roast scallop bone marrow XO\u201d. I was sure it wanted to be my friend. The menu also mentioned porcini bread sauce, which surely had the potential to be fun, and mashed potato with Tunworth cheese, braised trotter and crackling. That\u2019s a whole new verse of My Favourite Things, written just for me; a side dish which could have been devised specifically to dismay those who don\u2019t do dairy, hate carbs, avoid meat in general, pig in particular, and think fat is evil. I am meant to respect dietary choices, but the best I can manage is a grudging tolerance. I wanted to be eating that mash, ideally in front of someone who disapproved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea18ca703ff3a3b3ed1c1ac6796f3130348c27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea18ca703ff3a3b3ed1c1ac6796f3130348c27e/0_0_5418_3249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gridiron, Como Metropolitan Hotel, Old Park Lane, Mayfair, for Jay Rayner\u2019s restaurant review, OM, 18/12/2018.

It really is all but impossible to disguise the hotel side-room location. It\u2019s not helped by the route to the loo down a gloomy, winter-cold stairwell. There\u2019s also the punchy pricing which seems to be the words \u201cWhat did you expect on Park Lane?\u201d in numerals. The wine list has jolly section headings, such as \u201clush whites\u201d, \u201cbig gorgeous reds\u201d and \u201cpinot and friends\u201d but nothing under \u00a329. I immediately know my choice will be governed less by taste than by what my newspaper expense account will stretch to. Hello Marchesi Migliorati from Abruzzo from the \u201cracy whites\u201d section, yours for \u00a335. You\u2019ll do.</p> <p>The scallop dish on the specimen menu has, sadly, been replaced by a scallop with smoked roe and paprika butter. It\u2019s odd and underwhelming. What looks like one cat paw-sized scallop, sliced into four for \u00a312, seems to have been steamed to flaccid. The orange-coloured butter sauce is underpowered. I throw enough salt at it to distress a cardiologist, and the whole thing improves markedly. Even so it\u2019s bested by a single leek which has been burnt whole over the flames. Those singed outer leaves have been opened up to reveal the soft, sweet, green innards, which have been dressed with pistachios and a lightly acidic beurre blanc. There\u2019s also a grating of summer truffle which, while bland as ever, perhaps is meant to justify another \u00a312 price tag. That\u2019s a lot of anyone\u2019s money for a leek, however thrilling it might be. A snack of a big meaty \u201cduck sausage\u201d with crisp shavings of dried black olive and tiny cubes of plum, weirdly feels better value at \u00a38.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f375b200738b3667d1b44a21de3df462e82c0590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f375b200738b3667d1b44a21de3df462e82c0590/707_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gridiron, Como Metropolitan Hotel, Old Park Lane, Mayfair, for Jay Rayner\u2019s restaurant review, OM, 18/12/2018.

XO is meant to be a highly savoury seafood sauce, often made using dried shrimp or scallop. When I get hold of some, I try not to spoon it neat from the jar, or at the very least I try not to be seen doing so. Apparently, the XO element here is in the batter, but we can\u2019t locate it. Which means it\u2019s a nice-enough cylinder of battered fish, but slightly less than was claimed.</p> <p>A grilled pork chop is done with all the skill, care and attention I would expect of a kitchen with this pedigree, and is well rested. I\u2019m not entirely convinced by porcini bread sauce. Porcini are noble mushrooms. Bread sauce deserves our respect, whatever Philomena Cunk thinks it looks like. I\u2019m not sure the two elements ever needed to be introduced to each other. Happily, Tunworth mash with trotter and crackling really is all kinds of everything. It reminds me of aligot, the mash sodden with the likes of gruy\u00e8re or raclette until it goes stringy when spooned. This is aligot with added outrageousness and intent. I dredge at the potato with shards of crackling, scooping up mash with cubes of long-braised trotter in a lip-smacking jus. It is one edible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-greenaway\" title=\"\">Peter Greenaway</a> movie: rich, deep and intense.

I look around the room, at the tables crowded with young, well-heeled couples who wouldn\u2019t miss an opening, and the bloggers on freebies. Most of them have gone for one of the flamed cuts of beef with the multi-layered blocks of potato galette deep fried to golden in beef dripping. So basically, that\u2019s steak and chips. Perhaps this is what I should have gone for, too. Perhaps I should have been less determined to explore the menu.</p> <p>Dessert continues the uneven theme. A sticky toffee pudding with an Armagnac caramel sauce is workmanlike and has an end-of-dinner alcoholic kick. However, an English honey mincemeat tart \u2013 I am eating just before Christmas \u2013 is a majestic thing. It has the shortest of sweet crumbly pastry both top and bottom and the filling is dragged back from cloying by huge citrus notes.</p> <p>But even that luscious end can\u2019t quite stop me squinting at a bill of \u00a3180, especially one which has both an added service charge of 12.5% and an opportunity for hotel guests to write in a tip. The service is deft and friendly, but it really doesn\u2019t need rewarding twice. The restaurant management tells me that they hadn\u2019t noticed this, that they will get it sorted. I almost feel their pain. Perhaps it\u2019s simply what happens when restaurants open in ultra-cool hotels on Park Lane, while trying to pretend they\u2019re not located in the hotel at all.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>I mentioned the <strong>Holborn Dining Room </strong>just last week in my review of the year, for its magnificent pie love, but it deserves another mention because it manages to be a hotel restaurant without feeling like one. Officially it\u2019s part of the Rosewood Hotel but, courtesy of a separate entrance and distinct decor \u2013 lots of brass rail and leather - it has its own identity. What should you eat there?

      "bodyText": "Gridiron, Como Metropolitan Hotel, 19 Old Park Lane, London W1K 1LB (020 7447 1080). Snacks, starters \u00a37-\u00a325; mains \u00a320-\u00a340; desserts \u00a38-\u00a39; wines from \u00a329 Standalone restaurants in hotels are an act of shared illusion. Both the people who run them and those who eat in them have to pretend it\u2019s a real place with its own robust identity, not just that space to the right of reception which, in another life, could have been a function room booked out for presentations by moist-lipped salespeople with timeshares to flog. Gridiron at the blunt white box of a hotel that is the Metropolitan on London\u2019s Park Lane has worked hard at the illusion. Serious people have been hired. The consultant chef, Richard Turner, has intimate knowledge of dead cow. At Hawksmoor, he gave the steak house a profoundly British accent. He set up the classy butcher\u2019s Turner &amp; George. Head chef Colin McSherry has worked at the Fat Duck and Ledbury and mastered the subtleties of the live fire cooking that gives the place its name, courtesy of the \u201cgridiron\u201d cooking grill that dominates the open kitchen. The wine list is by the sagacious Fiona Beckett, the Guardian\u2019s wine writer. When the menu appeared online, pre-opening, I sat at my desk, pawing my mouse and trying not to dribble. I loved the sound of \u201cWood roast scallop bone marrow XO\u201d. I was sure it wanted to be my friend. The menu also mentioned porcini bread sauce, which surely had the potential to be fun, and mashed potato with Tunworth cheese, braised trotter and crackling. That\u2019s a whole new verse of My Favourite Things, written just for me; a side dish which could have been devised specifically to dismay those who don\u2019t do dairy, hate carbs, avoid meat in general, pig in particular, and think fat is evil. I am meant to respect dietary choices, but the best I can manage is a grudging tolerance. I wanted to be eating that mash, ideally in front of someone who disapproved. And now here I am at Gridiron, and it\u2019s a case of so nearly but not quite. It really is all but impossible to disguise the hotel side-room location. It\u2019s not helped by the route to the loo down a gloomy, winter-cold stairwell. There\u2019s also the punchy pricing which seems to be the words \u201cWhat did you expect on Park Lane?\u201d in numerals. The wine list has jolly section headings, such as \u201clush whites\u201d, \u201cbig gorgeous reds\u201d and \u201cpinot and friends\u201d but nothing under \u00a329. I immediately know my choice will be governed less by taste than by what my newspaper expense account will stretch to. Hello Marchesi Migliorati from Abruzzo from the \u201cracy whites\u201d section, yours for \u00a335. You\u2019ll do. The scallop dish on the specimen menu has, sadly, been replaced by a scallop with smoked roe and paprika butter. It\u2019s odd and underwhelming. What looks like one cat paw-sized scallop, sliced into four for \u00a312, seems to have been steamed to flaccid. The orange-coloured butter sauce is underpowered. I throw enough salt at it to distress a cardiologist, and the whole thing improves markedly. Even so it\u2019s bested by a single leek which has been burnt whole over the flames. Those singed outer leaves have been opened up to reveal the soft, sweet, green innards, which have been dressed with pistachios and a lightly acidic beurre blanc. There\u2019s also a grating of summer truffle which, while bland as ever, perhaps is meant to justify another \u00a312 price tag. That\u2019s a lot of anyone\u2019s money for a leek, however thrilling it might be. A snack of a big meaty \u201cduck sausage\u201d with crisp shavings of dried black olive and tiny cubes of plum, weirdly feels better value at \u00a38. With the mains we are back in the land of classy menu writing. \u201cXO tempura monkfish\u201d comes with warm tartare sauce and kale. XO is meant to be a highly savoury seafood sauce, often made using dried shrimp or scallop. When I get hold of some, I try not to spoon it neat from the jar, or at the very least I try not to be seen doing so. Apparently, the XO element here is in the batter, but we can\u2019t locate it. Which means it\u2019s a nice-enough cylinder of battered fish, but slightly less than was claimed. A grilled pork chop is done with all the skill, care and attention I would expect of a kitchen with this pedigree, and is well rested. I\u2019m not entirely convinced by porcini bread sauce. Porcini are noble mushrooms. Bread sauce deserves our respect, whatever Philomena Cunk thinks it looks like. I\u2019m not sure the two elements ever needed to be introduced to each other. Happily, Tunworth mash with trotter and crackling really is all kinds of everything. It reminds me of aligot, the mash sodden with the likes of gruy\u00e8re or raclette until it goes stringy when spooned. This is aligot with added outrageousness and intent. I dredge at the potato with shards of crackling, scooping up mash with cubes of long-braised trotter in a lip-smacking jus. It is one edible Peter Greenaway movie: rich, deep and intense. This is what I came here for. I had hoped for more moments like this. I look around the room, at the tables crowded with young, well-heeled couples who wouldn\u2019t miss an opening, and the bloggers on freebies. Most of them have gone for one of the flamed cuts of beef with the multi-layered blocks of potato galette deep fried to golden in beef dripping. So basically, that\u2019s steak and chips. Perhaps this is what I should have gone for, too. Perhaps I should have been less determined to explore the menu. Dessert continues the uneven theme. A sticky toffee pudding with an Armagnac caramel sauce is workmanlike and has an end-of-dinner alcoholic kick. However, an English honey mincemeat tart \u2013 I am eating just before Christmas \u2013 is a majestic thing. It has the shortest of sweet crumbly pastry both top and bottom and the filling is dragged back from cloying by huge citrus notes. But even that luscious end can\u2019t quite stop me squinting at a bill of \u00a3180, especially one which has both an added service charge of 12.5% and an opportunity for hotel guests to write in a tip. The service is deft and friendly, but it really doesn\u2019t need rewarding twice. The restaurant management tells me that they hadn\u2019t noticed this, that they will get it sorted. I almost feel their pain. Perhaps it\u2019s simply what happens when restaurants open in ultra-cool hotels on Park Lane, while trying to pretend they\u2019re not located in the hotel at all. News bites I mentioned the Holborn Dining Room just last week in my review of the year, for its magnificent pie love, but it deserves another mention because it manages to be a hotel restaurant without feeling like one. Officially it\u2019s part of the Rosewood Hotel but, courtesy of a separate entrance and distinct decor \u2013 lots of brass rail and leather - it has its own identity. What should you eat there? Pie, of course (holborndiningroom.com). The opening of London\u2019s first branch of the Taiwanese Din Tai Fung, famed for their soupy dumplings, has produced massive queues in Covent Garden. If you crave soupy dumplings, but don\u2019t fancy queueing, go to the humble Beijing Dumpling on Lisle Street. I don\u2019t know if they match Din Tai Fung\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve not queued \u2013 but I think they\u2019re great. A study by Barclaycard has found that a third of people aged 18-24 would be put off a restaurant that had no online or social media presence. If you\u2019re a restaurateur who wishes to avoid that demographic you know what to do. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

      "bodyText": "Manhunt 9pm, ITV More compelling than most fictional crime shows, this suspenseful drama is based on real events and stars Martin Clunes as DCI Colin Sutton, the man who tracked down serial killer Levi Bellfield. When Sutton is made senior investigating officer on the case of French student Am\u00e9lie Delagrange, found murdered on Twickenham Green in 2004, not everyone on the force thinks he\u2019s up to the job. But after some impressive police work, the murder is linked to the deaths of Marsha McDonnell and Milly Dowler. Continues over the next two nights. Mike Bradley Dancing on Ice 6pm, ITV The slippery talent format returns for 2019 with 12 more brave celebs strapping blades to their feet before being judged by Torvill and Dean. The cast list includes Towie\u2019s Gemma Collins, comedian Richard Blackwood and actor Didi Conn (AKA Frenchie from Grease), so expect gags about chills multiplying. Graeme Virtue Les Mis\u00e9rables 9pm, BBC One Having completed the introductions, Andrew Davies\u2019s cleverly constructed adaptation of the Victor Hugo epic really starts to progress the plot tonight. Seen through the prism of Fantine\u2019s fateful experiences, the story leads us to the town of Montreuil, where a surprise awaits in the form of \u201cMonsieur Madeleine\u201d. MB Cities: Nature\u2019s New Wild 9pm, BBC Two Next time you\u2019re stuck on a train platform, spare a thought for the animal commuters overcoming even greater odds as they visit cities in search of food, from endangered African penguins seeking shelter in Cape Town and hungry hippos in St Lucia to bears breaking into houses in Colorado to purloin some scran. Ali Catterall SAS: Who Dares Wins 9pm, Channel 4 As a fourth season of the punishing recruitment show launches, we learn that the MoD has announced that SAS selection will be open to women for the first time in 2019. Cue: 25 men and women heading into the Chilean Andes for a dramatic opener. Who will make it through to the end of stage one? MB Semi-Detached 10pm, BBC Two Lee Mack leads a curious sitcom pilot. In real time, his feckless suburbanite deals with a torrent of mishaps that deter him from escorting his in-labour girlfriend to hospital. The cast is tremendous (Patrick Baladi, Ellie White, Samantha Spiro, Geoff McGivern), but the script keeps reaching too hungrily for zany bad taste. Jack Seale Film choice Girlhood 1.30am, Film4 Marieme (Karidja Tour\u00e9) is a teenager going nowhere in the Paris banlieue. When her school shamefully rejects her, she embraces gang life, joining three similarly disadvantaged black girls in tough but sometimes joyful scrapes involving shoplifting, drug dealing and fights, in a vibrantly physical coming-of-age tale.

Unlike those who prefer to restrict the word to its negative connotations and use \u201cpatriotism\u201d for positive references to love of country, Judis writes that nationalism underwrites both xenophobia and helping fellow citizens in need. He quotes psychologist Joshua Searle-White: \u201cNationalism provides us with a way \u2026 [sic] to feel moral, right, and just. It gives us a way to join with others in a heroic struggle. It gives a sense of purpose and meaning to our lives, and even our deaths.\u201d</p> <p>Judis contends that we are all paying a price for the failure of recent political leaders, Bill Clinton above all, to take the depths of nationalist passion into sufficient account while promoting globalization, which he deftly summarizes as being for free trade, mobile capital, floating exchange rates and unskilled immigration. Judis shows how policy errors and economic pressures combined to elicit reactionary movements in western democracies; he is particularly good on nationalist surges in Germany, Hungary and Poland. In those countries and the US, nationalist leaders have fanned popular feelings of economic abandonment, cultural degradation and abject terror through rhetoric that also stresses love of and pride in country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hopkins and Judis share a shortcoming: each underplays the inflammatory ingredient of racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Daniel Hopkins is a rising-star political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Increasingly-United-States-Political-Nationalized-ebook/dp/B07CVCT5Q8\">The Increasingly United States: How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized</a>, he shows how and why the politics of the US has been nationalized in two ways. First, the electoral relevance of state and local issues has receded in voters\u2019 minds. Second, voter (and, crucially, donor) participation has been spurred mainly through the promulgation of nationwide party agendas. American voters have told pollsters they believe more gets done that affects their lives at the sub-national levels of government \u2013 yet they remain fixated on who the president is and what he says and does with respect to Congress and the supreme court.</p> <p>This is a political science text, but Hopkins keeps the jargon to a minimum and has a knack for literary quotations. He shows how votes for president and governor have become more aligned since the 1970s, and how local contexts have minimal impact on voters and poll respondents on issue after issue. For example, people living near nuclear power plants have not voted all that differently on funding new ones from those who live far away. The same goes for military spending and living near military bases. The book does not look at immigration, although the author has done so in <a href=\"http://web.sas.upenn.edu/danhop/research/\">a previous article</a> and found that \u201cnative-born white and black Americans adopt more anti-immigration views in response to an influx of immigrants only when immigration is a nationally salient issue\u201d \u2013 ie, when the president and media are talking about it.</p> <p>The Hopkins and Judis books share a shortcoming: each underplays the inflammatory ingredient of racism. Judis notes how the election of Barack Obama challenged the \u201cEuro-American prototype\u201d at the core of many Americans\u2019 conception of their personal-partisan-national identity. Yet he limited his interviews to six white working-class men in Ohio who voted for Donald Trump.

It is a superb interpretation of American cultural and political history. Gerstle, who teaches at Princeton, depicts a central tension between two traditional conceptions of the US as a nation. \u201cCivic nationalists\u201d have seen America as unified by an aspirational and foundational creed that people from around the world should embrace and, once melted into the pot, uphold in their politics. \u201cRacial nationalists\u201d have regarded the founders as Wasps, and strive to preserve a code and ethos to which immigrants must pledge allegiance.</p> <p>As Gerstle tells it, Clinton and George W Bush professed a hybrid \u201csoft multiculturalism\u201d that Obama embodied in his lineage.

A former Democrat with few ideological positions, Trump hijacked the primaries in 2016 as the ultimate outsider, tearing into the Bush family, House speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain and Romney himself. Trump defeated 16 more conventional candidates with a mix of nationalism, populism, xenophobia and celebrity, then repeated the trick to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/how-did-donald-trump-win-analysis\">beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency.</a></p> <p>He has arguably given Republicans bangs for their buck: two conservative justices on the supreme court, huge tax cuts for the rich, business regulations slashed. In return, many have turned a blind eye to his contempt for the free market, his willingness to run up the national debt and his embrace of foreign despots at the expense of allies.</p> <p>This week, for example, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/02/trumps-bizarre-history-lesson-soviet-union-russia-afghanistan/?utm_term=.5286249a05da\">Trump randomly declared:</a> \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia.

They just have to await the fate of the voting gods, otherwise known as citizens, who will cast the final judgment.\u201d</p> <p>Ever fearful of the noisy Trump base, Republican opposition in the Senate has withered. McCain, a keeper of the flame of America\u2019s postwar global leadership, died from brain cancer in August. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both scathing critics who nevertheless generally voted for Trump\u2019s legislation, have retired. That leaves only Romney and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/13/them-review-ben-sasse-trump\">Ben Sasse,</a> a young senator from Nebraska who has proved willing to call out the president.</p> <p>There is then a second tier of senators, such as <a href=\"http://time.com/5413785/donald-trump-christine-blasey-ford-mocking-susan-collins/\">Susan Collins of Maine,</a> Cory Gardner of Colorado and James Lankford of Oklahoma, who have been known to make their displeasure clear, though none appears likely to lead an uprising.</p> <p>Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once bitter opponents of Trump, are now among his most ardent cheerleaders, although Graham <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/us/politics/lindsey-graham-syria-trump.html\">savaged the recent decision</a> to withdraw troops from Syria. Majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed dismay at the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, yet was careful to avoid directly rebuking the president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://eppc.org/author/henry_olsen/\">Henry Olsen,</a> a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank in Washington, said: \u201cA lot of people do the game of \u2018I disapprove of his tweets\u2019 but, when push comes to shove, they don\u2019t openly disagree with him.

But Trump will lose 'bigly' on immigration | Art Cullen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump virus has spread to conservative media. Fox News not only lionises him and asks him soft questions but, in football terms, has become a feeder club for the White House. Rightwing broadcasters such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have been influential in persuading Trump to keep the government partially shut down unless he gets money for a border wall. Conversely, the Weekly Standard, a neoconservative magazine that was a rallying point for Never Trumpers, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/who-killed-the-weekly-standard\">closed down last month.</a></p> <p>That is why Romney\u2019s column in the Post was seen by some as a candle flickering in the dark. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio and arch Trump critic, tweeted: \u201cWelcome to the fray, Mitt Romney.\u201d Bill Kristol, former editor of the Weekly Standard, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1080295089082118144\">wrote:</a> \u201cFor now at least Mitt Romney has become the leader of the Republican Resistance to Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Steele said: \u201cI thought it was more than just a shot across the president\u2019s political bow. Essentially it created a crack in the wall that many inside the party have been creating around Trump that prevented members who would like to sidestep some of his crazy from doing it. He\u2019s provided a possible way forward in drawing some clear line distinctions between the character of the man and the policies of the administration.\u201d</p> <p>But Steele cautioned against unrealistic expectations that Romney\u2019s conscience will spearhead a Republican rebellion any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cI think Ben Sasse will probably hold down that space largely by himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate Mitt Romney really being that vocal out of the box against the president. His problem, because he led off with this op-ed, is going to be when the president says something and \u2013 God help us \u2013 tweets something he\u2019s going to be the first one the press goes to for response. That\u2019s going to get old for him very quickly. He\u2019ll be mobbed in the corridors.\u201d</p> <p>Others suggest that Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and business executive, is a flawed messenger. He launched a memorably stinging attack on Trump during the 2016 election but was subsequently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/from-enemies-to-potential-allies-how-the-trump-romney-divide-began-to-heal/2016/11/29/fb787850-b674-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html?utm_term=.8697a447ae25\">photographed dining with him</a> when in contention for the job of secretary of state.

He\u2019s moved back and forth. When he was up for secretary of state, Trump\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem to matter so much.\u201d</p> <p>Romney is also out of touch with Republican voters, Olsen argued. \u201cThe Republican party on policy is largely behind or significantly open to the kind of innovations Trump has proposed. Mitt Romney tried to put himself on the broad Trump-suspicious track, but anyone who wants to lead the Republican party can\u2019t pretend we live in 2005. Romney fell into that trap.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Somebody does need to challenge the president\u2019</h2> <p>Trump claimed this week that he is \u201cthe most popular president in the history of the Republican party\u201d. Eighty-nine percent of Republicans approve of his job performance, according to a Gallup survey last month, although just 39% of all Americans do, which is lower than any president in either party at this point in his presidency since at least 1954.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s grip on the 164-year-old party could be loosened in the coming year as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/pelosi-remains-defiant-on-wall-funding-as-trump-seeks-fresh-talks\">partial government shutdown drags on</a> and he faces investigations and possible impeachment from a Democratic-controlled House, turbulence in the markets and the likely conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia.</p> <p>The president might face a challenge in the 2020 primaries, potentially from Flake, Kasich, Sasse or even Romney.

      "bodyText": "At this week\u2019s solemn swearing in of the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence worked his way along a line that included Mitt Romney, a Republican stalwart, Bernie Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, and Kyrsten Sinema, the first openly bisexual senator. Just this once, Pence may have felt more at ease with Sanders or Sinema than with his fellow conservative. A day earlier, Romney had fired a broadside at the boss to whom Pence remains unswervingly loyal. \u201cThe Trump presidency made a deep descent in December,\u201d the incoming Utah senator wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cHis conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, added: \u201cThe world is also watching. America has long been looked to for leadership \u2026 Trump\u2019s words and actions have caused dismay around the world.\u201d Much was striking about the column, not least the way in which Romney bluntly made reference to \u201cTrump\u201d rather than \u201cPresident Trump\u201d. It was a rare stirring of rebellion in a party that has all but reshaped itself in Trump\u2019s image. The voice of dissent raised the question of whether the president will face a challenge in the Republican primaries ahead of the 2020 election. Romney\u2019s timing was a surprise, said strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to and spokesman for his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. \u201cThe big question is, is this part of larger plan he has to build a broader coalition of voices that are going to confront the president on policies and rhetoric?\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the backlash was a testament to the fact that there is a fight in the party, but right now Trump is winning it.\u201d The party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan is now the party of Trump. A former Democrat with few ideological positions, Trump hijacked the primaries in 2016 as the ultimate outsider, tearing into the Bush family, House speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain and Romney himself. Trump defeated 16 more conventional candidates with a mix of nationalism, populism, xenophobia and celebrity, then repeated the trick to beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency. He has arguably given Republicans bangs for their buck: two conservative justices on the supreme court, huge tax cuts for the rich, business regulations slashed. In return, many have turned a blind eye to his contempt for the free market, his willingness to run up the national debt and his embrace of foreign despots at the expense of allies. This week, for example, Trump randomly declared: \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.\u201d The statement would have shaken Reagan to the core but there was barely a murmur from a party that has something approaching Stockholm syndrome. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cDonald Trump is the manifestation of this era of Republicanism and, by and large, Republicans have bought into that narrative, that storyline, that style of leadership. They just have to await the fate of the voting gods, otherwise known as citizens, who will cast the final judgment.\u201d Ever fearful of the noisy Trump base, Republican opposition in the Senate has withered. McCain, a keeper of the flame of America\u2019s postwar global leadership, died from brain cancer in August. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both scathing critics who nevertheless generally voted for Trump\u2019s legislation, have retired. That leaves only Romney and Ben Sasse, a young senator from Nebraska who has proved willing to call out the president. There is then a second tier of senators, such as Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and James Lankford of Oklahoma, who have been known to make their displeasure clear, though none appears likely to lead an uprising. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once bitter opponents of Trump, are now among his most ardent cheerleaders, although Graham savaged the recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed dismay at the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, yet was careful to avoid directly rebuking the president. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank in Washington, said: \u201cA lot of people do the game of \u2018I disapprove of his tweets\u2019 but, when push comes to shove, they don\u2019t openly disagree with him. Mitt Romney has now put himself in the Ben Sasse camp rather than the Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz camp.\u201d \u2018He\u2019s provided a possible way forward\u2019 In the House of Representatives, Republicans are now in the minority but probably even more conservative and pro-Trump than before. Many moderates from suburban-heavy districts lost their seats in the midterms. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy has positioned himself as one of the president\u2019s closest lieutenants. The Trump virus has spread to conservative media. Fox News not only lionises him and asks him soft questions but, in football terms, has become a feeder club for the White House. Rightwing broadcasters such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have been influential in persuading Trump to keep the government partially shut down unless he gets money for a border wall. Conversely, the Weekly Standard, a neoconservative magazine that was a rallying point for Never Trumpers, closed down last month. That is why Romney\u2019s column in the Post was seen by some as a candle flickering in the dark. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio and arch Trump critic, tweeted: \u201cWelcome to the fray, Mitt Romney.\u201d Bill Kristol, former editor of the Weekly Standard, wrote: \u201cFor now at least Mitt Romney has become the leader of the Republican Resistance to Trump.\u201d Steele said: \u201cI thought it was more than just a shot across the president\u2019s political bow. Essentially it created a crack in the wall that many inside the party have been creating around Trump that prevented members who would like to sidestep some of his crazy from doing it. He\u2019s provided a possible way forward in drawing some clear line distinctions between the character of the man and the policies of the administration.\u201d But Steele cautioned against unrealistic expectations that Romney\u2019s conscience will spearhead a Republican rebellion any time soon. \u201cI think Ben Sasse will probably hold down that space largely by himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate Mitt Romney really being that vocal out of the box against the president. His problem, because he led off with this op-ed, is going to be when the president says something and \u2013 God help us \u2013 tweets something he\u2019s going to be the first one the press goes to for response. That\u2019s going to get old for him very quickly. He\u2019ll be mobbed in the corridors.\u201d Others suggest that Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and business executive, is a flawed messenger. He launched a memorably stinging attack on Trump during the 2016 election but was subsequently photographed dining with him when in contention for the job of secretary of state. He was also content to accept Trump\u2019s support for his recent Senate run. Olsen said: \u201cIt damages his credibility among people he would need to persuade. He\u2019s moved back and forth. When he was up for secretary of state, Trump\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem to matter so much.\u201d Romney is also out of touch with Republican voters, Olsen argued. \u201cThe Republican party on policy is largely behind or significantly open to the kind of innovations Trump has proposed. Mitt Romney tried to put himself on the broad Trump-suspicious track, but anyone who wants to lead the Republican party can\u2019t pretend we live in 2005. Romney fell into that trap.\u201d \u2018Somebody does need to challenge the president\u2019 Trump claimed this week that he is \u201cthe most popular president in the history of the Republican party\u201d. Eighty-nine percent of Republicans approve of his job performance, according to a Gallup survey last month, although just 39% of all Americans do, which is lower than any president in either party at this point in his presidency since at least 1954. Trump\u2019s grip on the 164-year-old party could be loosened in the coming year as a partial government shutdown drags on and he faces investigations and possible impeachment from a Democratic-controlled House, turbulence in the markets and the likely conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia. The president might face a challenge in the 2020 primaries, potentially from Flake, Kasich, Sasse or even Romney. Flake told CNN last week: \u201cSomebody does need to challenge the president. I\u2019m a long way from there, but somebody needs to and I think that the country needs to be reminded of what it means to be conservative, certainly on the Republican side, and what it means to be decent as well.\u201d Olsen said: \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if the president didn\u2019t have a primary challenge; he\u2019s too controversial. The only question is, is it moderately serious or purely quixotic? \u201cIf Trump were to die today, Republicans would still want a candidate who says many of the things he does and is willing to fight. The majority of the Republican party is broadly nationalistic and moderately populist. If Trump says, \u2018I\u2019ve achieved everything and I\u2019m not going to run again,\u2019 Republicans would want someone with the same positions, not a Sasse or a Romney.\u201d As things stand, Trump would almost certainly win the primaries but could be mortally wounded. Primary challengers in 1980 and 1992 helped weaken incumbent presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, both of whom went on to lose. Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cRight now it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s party but it would not be surprising if he did face a challenge from Republicans who are not drinking the Kool-Aid. It would be a tremendously difficult uphill climb. Trump would be overwhelmingly the favourite for the nomination. But that does not mean the case should not be made.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I am not afraid to admit that this flexitarian malarkey \u2013 eliminating meat or dairy for part of the week \u2013 has me thoroughly confused. On the one hand, we have a report that suggests that the consumption of game at top-end restaurants such as Bibendum and Ottolenghi is being fuelled by \u201cflexitarian millennials\u201d demanding quail and venison. Supermarkets are also getting in on the game (sorry), with Waitrose reporting a sevenfold increase in demand for its game casserole. On the other hand, another report says that Sainsbury\u2019s is recreating vegan versions of longstanding favourites such as smoked salmon and chorizo. According to Rachael Matthews, product developer for plant-based food at the supermarket: \u201cWith more than seven million vegetarians in Britain, and the rise of the flexitarian lifestyle, Britain has certainly got the taste for meat alternatives at mealtimes.\u201d But why try to pass off konjac root, the basis for ersatz salmon, as salmon? What exactly is a \u201csizzling beefless strip\u201d or a \u201cfishless fillet\u201d? Couldn\u2019t these clever types devise new recipes and names, rather than attempting to mimic meat dishes that in their true state would be anathema to those wishing to go vegetarian or vegan? Anyway, a new year and a new phrase from my favourite hyperbolic economic analyst \u2013 \u201ctechnocrat caesaropapism\u201d.

It\u2019s also little known that the UK is the only European country to recruit soldiers at 16. The UN committee on child rights is among organisations to challenge the UK about this. Perhaps this is recruitment\u2019s true dark side \u2013 not some bungled campaign aimed at personality types who wouldn\u2019t consider joining up even if you offered them a spliff and free latte every time they drove a tank in the right direction. Rather, that it has been known to target very young hotheads, who may not fully comprehend what they\u2019re signing up for. When it comes to deriding army recruitment techniques, let\u2019s focus on that. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Behold the handmaid (#2) of the Kardashians. Or at least, that of Kim, the celebrity, and Kanye, artist and Trump loyalist. The couple have just <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6556911/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West-welcome-fourth-child-May.html\" title=\"\">announced the commissioning</a> of their fourth child, using the womb of a gestational carrier who will, since this is the US, be paid for the rental.</p> <p>In details shared after their previous carrier delivered, last year, Kim Kardashian explained to her millions of fans that she was the first person to have \u201cskin on skin\u201d contact with her baby and that the experience, from carrier vetting to the carrier\u2019s organic diet to delivery, had gone so brilliantly she \u201cwould recommend surrogacy to anybody\u201d (presumably as the purchaser rather than the provider). One of the few problems was <a href=\"https://people.com/parents/kim-kardashian-west-everything-she-has-said-baby-pregnancy/\" title=\"\">remembering she was having a baby</a>: \u201cI\u2019m totally gonna forget and then a month before I\u2019m gonna be like holy shit, we need to get a nursery.\u201d For the surrogacy industry, then, this ongoing Kimye promotion may be the most valuable publicity since Elton John and his partner acquired two delightful sons via a similar route \u2013 far more so, in fact, since Kardashian, though it could be risky for her to give birth again, at least had the not entirely tragic alternative to gestational assistance of remaining a mother of two healthy children. Conventionally, the attribution of desperation to infertile or gay would-be parents has been critical in eclipsing the other sorts of desperation that might make impoverished Indian, Greek or Ukrainian women consider becoming incubators for rich couples they are unlikely, post baby handover, to see again.</p> <p>At the same time that the supposed agonies of infertility have for years been critical to burying ethical issues or concern for the surrogates\u2019 wellbeing \u2013 as they were in addressing squeamishness about other forms of assisted reproduction \u2013 this narrative has also, plainly, restricted take-up of a service that, given the supply, could work for anyone with the money. Who says you have to be childless, in films, or tragic, to employ a willing human incubator?

      "bodyText": "Behold the handmaid (#2) of the Kardashians. Or at least, that of Kim, the celebrity, and Kanye, artist and Trump loyalist. The couple have just announced the commissioning of their fourth child, using the womb of a gestational carrier who will, since this is the US, be paid for the rental. In details shared after their previous carrier delivered, last year, Kim Kardashian explained to her millions of fans that she was the first person to have \u201cskin on skin\u201d contact with her baby and that the experience, from carrier vetting to the carrier\u2019s organic diet to delivery, had gone so brilliantly she \u201cwould recommend surrogacy to anybody\u201d (presumably as the purchaser rather than the provider). One of the few problems was remembering she was having a baby: \u201cI\u2019m totally gonna forget and then a month before I\u2019m gonna be like holy shit, we need to get a nursery.\u201d For the surrogacy industry, then, this ongoing Kimye promotion may be the most valuable publicity since Elton John and his partner acquired two delightful sons via a similar route \u2013 far more so, in fact, since Kardashian, though it could be risky for her to give birth again, at least had the not entirely tragic alternative to gestational assistance of remaining a mother of two healthy children. Conventionally, the attribution of desperation to infertile or gay would-be parents has been critical in eclipsing the other sorts of desperation that might make impoverished Indian, Greek or Ukrainian women consider becoming incubators for rich couples they are unlikely, post baby handover, to see again. At the same time that the supposed agonies of infertility have for years been critical to burying ethical issues or concern for the surrogates\u2019 wellbeing \u2013 as they were in addressing squeamishness about other forms of assisted reproduction \u2013 this narrative has also, plainly, restricted take-up of a service that, given the supply, could work for anyone with the money. Who says you have to be childless, in films, or tragic, to employ a willing human incubator? Especially when evidence from women who have done so often suggests that carriers have a super-rewarding time helping out sad, richer ladies, so much so that it\u2019s a wonder that gestation, even with its restrictive contracts and limited long-term rewards, has yet to take off as popular career choice. But perhaps that could change? To have Kardashian now break off from marketing meal replacements to help normalise, say, the invasive scrutiny of surrogates by their hirers, as if it were no different from inspecting a horse\u2019s teeth, or going back, those of a sturdy household servant, is a precious endorsement for an industry now facing organised international threats to its profits (at least $2.3bn annually). For local gestation facilitators, her intervention could hardly be better timed. After decades in which the UK reproductive industry has lost out, thanks to the insistence on expenses-only carrier altruism, to less regulated overseas gestators \u2013 with resulting legal struggles for parents \u2013 the Law Commission has been asked by the Department of Health to consult on surrogacy law. Already, for any would-be clients and reproductive entrepreneurs who fear that the commission might be influenced by Sweden\u2019s recent decision to ban surrogacy, the discussion looks likely to proceed along more pragmatic lines.

Our home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/people-crossing-channel-not-genuine-asylum-seekers-javid\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, is certain he would not. At least, that was the implication of the question he posed on a visit to Dover last week. \u201cIf you are a genuine asylum seeker why have you not sought asylum in the first safe country that you arrived in,\u201d he asked.</p> <p>And with that, Javid laid bare his utter lack of humanity and compassion. Asylum seekers deserve nothing more than the removal of an immediate threat to their life. Who cares about their human needs and desires for family, for work, for hope? Who cares if they are forced to live in a French camp in perilous conditions for months on end, or spend years unable to work, subsisting on a pitiful allowance in the UK? They should be grateful to be alive, and expect no more.</p> <p>Perhaps this is why Javid felt justified in labelling those who\u2019ve attempted crossing the English Channel in perilous rubber dinghies \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d, although it is perfectly legal for anyone fleeing conflict to find a way to Britain and claim asylum. Indeed, around three-quarters of Iranian asylum claims \u2013 the nationality of many of those on the boats \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/are-refugees-obliged-to-claim-asylum-in-the-first-safe-country-they-reach/\" title=\"\">have been successful</a>. Or why he appeared to threaten to do \u201ceverything we can\u201d to ensure people crossing the Channel are not successful in their asylum claims, which experts warned would be in breach of international law. Or why he felt it necessary to cut short a family holiday, declare a \u201cmajor incident\u201d and mount a cross-Whitehall fight for a <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/revealed-1-million-bill-for-navy-warship-to-patrol-channel-amid-migrant-crisis-a4030516.html\" title=\"\">navy warship to patrol the Channel</a>, which the chair of the public accounts committee called \u201can incredibly expensive sledgehammer to crack a nut\u201d. His moves appear less motivated by saving lives in the Channel \u2013 numbers attempting the crossing were ticking upwards weeks before Javid went on holiday \u2013 and more by his Tory leadership ambitions.</p> <p>Of course, one life lost in the Channel would be a desperate tragedy. But Javid has blown the relatively small numbers crossing the Channel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.fr/20190104/what-france-plans-to-do-to-prevent-migrant-boat-crossings-to-uk\" title=\"\">fewer than 300 people</a> made it to Britain via this route last year, compared with over 55,000 people who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/what-current-scale-migration-crisis-europe-future-outlook\" title=\"\">reached Spain</a> by crossing the Mediterranean \u2013 into an existential crisis for the UK, for his own political ends. It is just the latest episode in which a long line of ministers \u2013 Labour and Conservative \u2013 have proved all too willing to make vulnerable asylum seekers the poster children for their tough approach on immigration, playing politics with vulnerable people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>The result is that Britain\u2019s asylum system is nothing short of disgraceful, imposing enforced destitution on people fleeing war. Asylum claims can take up to 15 years to process, and <a href=\"http://politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2019/01/04/all-at-sea-an-open-letter-to-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">a quarter of decisions are overturned on appeal</a>. But while their claims are under consideration, asylum seekers are not allowed to work and pay taxes; they are forced to subsist on an allowance of less than \u00a35.50 a day. They are housed in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46282158\" title=\"\">terrible accommodation</a> often riddled with damp and vermin, operated by outsourcing giants such as Serco and G4S, isolated from any support services and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/28/tefl.immigration\" title=\"\">denied the English language lessons</a> that would help them integrate. Yes, they may be alive but years of living in these conditions can profoundly affect the physical and mental health of adults and children who have already suffered significant trauma. Britain receives <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01403\" title=\"\">far fewer asylum applications</a> relative to its population than most other European countries.</p> <p>The government has failed to do enough to provide safe routes to Britain for refugees in line with our moral obligations as one of the richest countries of the world. The scheme to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over four years, announced in 2015, was welcome. But why not more, and why not refugees from other conflict-ridden countries? As this scheme draws to a close, ministers are yet to announce what will come next, leaving councils in limbo. The rules on family reunion for refugees in the UK are inhumanely restrictive: unaccompanied refugee children are not even allowed to <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7511\" title=\"\">sponsor their parents to come to the UK</a>. Just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/03/uk-admits-only-20-unaccompanied-child-refugees-in-two-years\" title=\"\">20 unaccompanied children</a> have been resettled in the UK from the rest of Europe under the Dubs scheme \u2013 despite the hope of campaigners that it would lead to 3,000 unaccompanied children being welcomed to Britain, and despite more than 20,000 unaccompanied children arriving in Europe in 2017.</p> <p>There are also massive failings across Europe. How things have shifted since 2015, when Angela Merkel flung open Germany\u2019s doors to refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq for six months, declaring \u201cWir schaffen das\u201d \u2013 \u201cwe can do this\u201d. No other country followed: the rest of Europe simply free rode on Germany\u2019s openness.</p> <p>The approach has evolved from one of saving lives in the Mediterranean to stopping people from making the crossing altogether. The death rate for people attempting the crossing has risen dramatically from one in 42 to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/03/migrant-death-rate-mediterranean-rises-despite-fewer-crossings/\" title=\"\">one in 18</a> in just a year, even as the numbers crossing have fallen. And as the result of unsavoury pacts with countries with terrible human rights records themselves \u2013 Turkey, and even Libya \u2013 the price Europe has paid to prevent crossings is more people being exploited, raped and tortured just across its borders.</p> <p>A pan-European approach based on all member states pulling their weight has never looked more distant. Greece, Spain and Italy are processing many more asylum claims than their richer northern neighbours under the Dublin regulation, which stipulates that refugees should be processed by the first EU country they set foot in. Some countries in eastern and central Europe refuse to accept any refugees.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Europe is being put to shame by the much poorer countries that neighbour conflict regions. Out of 6 million Syrian refugees, more than 5 million are resident in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Almost nine in 10 displaced people around the world are hosted by <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/are-refugees-obliged-to-claim-asylum-in-the-first-safe-country-they-reach/\" title=\"\">developing countries</a>. And some of these countries are taking far more humane and generous approaches. Uganda, home to more than a million refugees, allows them the right to work and freedom of movement. Research has shown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/26/europe-learn-africa-refugees-solutions\" title=\"\">both refugees and host communities have benefited</a>.</p> <p>So, enough of cabinet battles for navy ships, of talk of existential crises, of trying to make Britain as hostile as possible for people traumatised by war. As a nation, we may have different views on immigration, but surely we can all agree that Britain has a moral duty to provide safe harbour to more people fleeing conflicts. Surely our leaders can forge a kinder asylum system that reflects the values of Britain, not the values of the far right?</p>",

And some of these countries are taking far more humane and generous approaches. Uganda, home to more than a million refugees, allows them the right to work and freedom of movement. Research has shown both refugees and host communities have benefited. So, enough of cabinet battles for navy ships, of talk of existential crises, of trying to make Britain as hostile as possible for people traumatised by war. As a nation, we may have different views on immigration, but surely we can all agree that Britain has a moral duty to provide safe harbour to more people fleeing conflicts. Surely our leaders can forge a kinder asylum system that reflects the values of Britain, not the values of the far right?",

It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. \u201cWhen we think of the Alps,\u201d said Stibbon, \u201cwe think of iconic white peaks.

She saID: \u201cIt\u2019s unrecognisable.\u201d Her commission forms part of the Ruskin, Turner &amp; the Storm Cloud, exhibition opening at the York Art Gallery in March and Abbot Hall, Kendal, in July. It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. \u201cWhen we think of the Alps,\u201d said Stibbon, \u201cwe think of iconic white peaks. By the end of this century, there probably won\u2019t be any snow.\u201d She added that Ruskin was ahead of his time in realising \u201cthe Industrial Revolution was affecting air quality and that air pollution was linked to the use of coal. He could see that glaciers move and I think he suspected that there was some [ice] recession, which would have been starting around that period in the 1850s.\u201d Suzanne Fagence Cooper, research curator at York Art Gallery and author of a new book, To See Clearly: Why Ruskin Matters, said Stibbon\u2019s images show the glacier retreat \u201cvery clearly\u201d, and capture a \u201csense of real loss\u201d. While Ruskin events extend to Japan and America, in the UK there is a cinema screening, from 22 February, of Effie Gray \u2013 the 2014 film written by Emma Thompson \u2013 and the exhibition, John Ruskin: The Power of Seeing, from 26 January at Two Temple Place, London. It features more than 190 exhibits revealing how Ruskin\u2019s influence is still felt. Robert Hewison, author of the recently published Ruskin and His Contemporaries, said: \u201cRuskin was, by the end of his life, treated as a kind of prophet \u2013 although not in his own country \u2013 for predicting both economic and ecological deterioration. Climate change appears to show that he was right.\u201d",

I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d he said.</p> <p>Newport Ccity Ccouncil said it was reviewing its procedures as a result of Dan\u2019s case. It said it should have supported him sooner than it did. \u201cHowever, given the demands on suitable accommodation for individuals and families with young children who present as homeless, it is unlikely that the outcomes for Daniel in that emergency period after he came to the council for help would have been any different,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <h2>Samantha, Darlington</h2> <h2>\u2018It was dog-rotten and filthy.

The facilities had to be shared. The shower was black with muck and limescale. I used the toilet one morning and there wasn\u2019t even a lock on the toilet door. It made me feel unsafe.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even sleep on the bed. I\u2019d stay awake most of the time because the sheets were filthy dirty. They had been burnt with cigarettes. I \u2018d rather have slept on a park bench.</p> <p>\u201cIt was full of alcoholics and drug-users. They were much older than me. They were drinking outside the premises. They\u2019d be smoking joints and that. You would hear them arguing. There was a fight outside. Four cop cars turned up and it was broken up.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use to return until late because I didn\u2019t want to be around them. I had to get myself to college. I had to do everything on my own. I didn\u2019t have any support from social services.</p> <p>\u201cIf my mum hadn\u2019t of been there, I would probably be in prison or I would have got in with the wrong crowd and gone down the addiction route.\u201d</p> <p>Darlington council said her case was concerning: \u201cWe no longer use B&amp;Bs as accommodation for young people in our care and have not done so for a number of years.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More and more children as young as 16 are being housed alone in bed and breakfast rooms, bedsits and even caravans by local authorities that are struggling to cope with rising numbers of youngsters in the care system. An investigation by the Observer and BBC 5 Live has established that there has been a 28% increase in the number of under-18s placed by councils in so-called independent living accommodation, which lacks live-in staff support and includes unsupervised B&amp;Bs, over the past eight years. Figures \u2013 partly obtained from the Department for Education under Freedom of Information Act rules \u2013 reveal that the number of looked-after children placed in independent living arrangements by English local authorities rose from 2,420 in 2010 to 3,090 in 2018. In Wales, the figure went from 75 to 130 in the same period, a rise of 73%. While some independent living arrangements with dedicated social-work support are appropriate for those aged under 18, other types, such as B&amp;Bs, are prohibited by statutory guidance because they are deemed too risky. In October, the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman found that Cornwall council had failed to provide appropriate accommodation to a 17-year-old boy, who was placed in a tent, a static caravan and B&amp;Bs in 2016. FOI requests reveal that four local authorities have placed up to 14 children in caravan parks and 17 councils have placed up to 133 children in B&amp;Bs over the past two years. \u201cDaisy\u201d was only 16 when a social worker gave her \u00a34 for her dinner and took her to a dingy B&amp;B around the corner from Plymouth town hall. \u201cI was only meant to be there for the weekend and I actually didn\u2019t come out for 19 weeks,\u201d she said. She had to share the B&amp;B\u2019s often filthy toilets with a group of young men, a couple and a much older man. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to the toilets at night because I was in a house full of boys,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cOne of the blokes grabbed my ass as I walked up the stairs. He was like, \u2018All right, sexy\u2019. I\u2019m just 16. I\u2019ve only just moved in. I ran up to my room.\u201d Daisy, who is now 19, started drinking and taking drugs to fit in. \u201cI was taking legal highs every single day. I was drinking. I was around men who were 28 and I was only 16. That\u2019s not normal,\u201d she said. \u201cI came out in an awful way, a very damaged girl.\u201d Her only contact with social services came when she picked up her weekly allowance from the town hall: \u201cWe\u2019d get to social at eight, pick up the money, leave and not hear anything.\u201d Louise King from the Children\u2019s Rights Alliance for England, who has worked closely with Daisy, says she was left at risk of sexual exploitation as well as of drug and alcohol abuse. \u201cA lot of young people are too vulnerable to be left in independent accommodation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are coming across worse conditions in more and more concerning types of accommodation, such as B&amp;Bs and caravan parks.\u201d Plymouth city council said it was hard to find suitable placements for older teenagers: \u201cSadly, there is a national shortage of foster placements willing to take 16- to 18-year-old young people, which limits the options available to local authorities.\u201d Although social services are meant to assess and, in most cases, care for homeless teenagers, some authorities are placing under-18s in B&amp;Bs and adult hostels without any checks or support. The Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said she would be investigating the housing of vulnerable children this year. \u201cNone of us would choose for our own children to live alone in caravan parks, B&amp;Bs or adult hostels, yet I often hear from young people in care who have been dumped into substandard housing under the guise of \u2018independent living\u2019,\u201d she said. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: \u201cThe law is clear that local authorities must provide accommodation that meets children\u2019s needs. This includes making sure the child has appropriate supervision while in that accommodation.\u201d Dan, Newport \u2018There were needles everywhere, noise, violence, police\u2019 Dan became homeless at 16 and went to Newport council for help. He was placed in a \u201cscary and intense\u201d B&amp;B in the Welsh city for two nights before being moved to a large adult hostel for six weeks, where he was surrounded by drug and alcohol users. \u201cIt was awful. Very dingy. The bathroom was disgusting, there were needles all over the place, drug-user needles,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of noise, violence, police coming back and forth constantly.\u201d He had nowhere to wash his clothes or to shower, \u201cI would have to just fold the dirty clothes away, wear some new ones, put them back on,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even use the showers. I had to go to the leisure centre every weekend to use the showers.\u201d No one from the council or social services, he said, came to see him while he was at the hostel. \u201cI was just scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d he said. Newport Ccity Ccouncil said it was reviewing its procedures as a result of Dan\u2019s case. It said it should have supported him sooner than it did. \u201cHowever, given the demands on suitable accommodation for individuals and families with young children who present as homeless, it is unlikely that the outcomes for Daniel in that emergency period after he came to the council for help would have been any different,\u201d said a spokesperson. Samantha, Darlington \u2018It was dog-rotten and filthy. I felt unsafe there\u2019 Samantha, now 22, says she was placed in a B&amp;B by Darlington council when she was 16. \u201cI was there about a month before my mum broke the rules and made me return home. \u201cIt was absolutely dog-rotten. The facilities had to be shared. The shower was black with muck and limescale. I used the toilet one morning and there wasn\u2019t even a lock on the toilet door. It made me feel unsafe. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even sleep on the bed. I\u2019d stay awake most of the time because the sheets were filthy dirty. They had been burnt with cigarettes. I \u2018d rather have slept on a park bench. \u201cIt was full of alcoholics and drug-users. They were much older than me. They were drinking outside the premises. They\u2019d be smoking joints and that. You would hear them arguing. There was a fight outside. Four cop cars turned up and it was broken up. \u201cI didn\u2019t use to return until late because I didn\u2019t want to be around them. I had to get myself to college. I had to do everything on my own. I didn\u2019t have any support from social services. \u201cIf my mum hadn\u2019t of been there, I would probably be in prison or I would have got in with the wrong crowd and gone down the addiction route.\u201d Darlington council said her case was concerning: \u201cWe no longer use B&amp;Bs as accommodation for young people in our care and have not done so for a number of years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Senate\u2019s decisions to stop Tony Abbott abolishing clean energy agencies helped create renewable energy projects worth $23.4bn, a new report says. The Australia Institute says decisions taken by Labor and the crossbench between 2013 and 2015 to save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) have now secured $7.8bn in public funding and investment for clean energy. Together with the renewable energy target \u2013 which was retained but reduced to 33,000GWh by 2020 \u2013 these measures will cut greenhouse gases by 334m tonnes over their lifetime, compared with 192m tonnes through the Coalition\u2019s emissions reduction fund. The Australia Institute released the Saved by the Bench report alongside polling that showed Australians supported the Senate\u2019s role as a check on government power but were split on whether it blocked government legislation too often. Climate change will be a central issue in this year\u2019s federal election \u2013 Labor is promising more ambitious emissions reduction targets and conservative Coalition figures want to wind back support for renewables. After its election in 2013, the Abbott government successfully repealed Labor\u2019s emissions trading scheme and interim carbon price but was thwarted in its attempts to abolish key environmental agencies. The report found that Australia\u2019s investment in renewables dropped 46% in the three years after 2013, but \u201chas since rebounded dramatically, to a record high of US$8.5bn in 2017\u201d. The report credits decisions by Labor, the Greens, Palmer United party and other crossbenchers for ensuring \u201cinvestment in renewable energy has continued through a time of great uncertainty for the energy sector\u201d. It said that between 2013 and 2018, the CEFC gave loans worth $6.6bn to clean energy projects, encouraging a further $12.3bn of private sector investment. During that time, Arena gave $864m in grants and has committed to a total of $1.2bn by 2022. \u201cIn total, those projects are worth $4.4bn, meaning that each dollar of Arena support leverages about 2.7 dollars of private funding,\u201d it said. Small-scale renewable certificates issued under the renewable energy target have helped more than 805,000 Australian homes install solar panels and supported the connection of 225,000 solar hot water systems by households. In the year to June 2018, renewable energy supplied a record 15.7% of power in the national energy market, and this is tipped to reach 37% by 2030, thanks to the renewable energy target and state targets in Queensland and Victoria. The Australia Institute executive director, Ben Oquist, said that despite earlier plans to axe Arena and the CEFC, \u201cthe Coalition has reversed its position \u2026 as a result of their strong performance\u201d. \u201cThere are few examples that show just how crucial the role of the Senate crossbench is than renewable energy investment post 2013.\u201d Labor has promised an emissions reduction target of 45% in the electricity sector but the Coalition has been left without a policy since Malcolm Turnbull ditched the emissions reduction component of the national energy guarantee. As the New South Wales Liberal party positions itself in favour of taking stronger action on climate change, Abbott and the influential backbench MP Craig Kelly have called for an end to renewables subsidies. The Greens have asked for voters to elect Greens senators in an election expected to deliver government to Labor by promising to push Labor \u201cto be as ambitious as it possibly can be\u201d on emissions reductions. The Australia Institute\u2019s poll of 1,449 respondents found voters were split on the performance of the Senate, with 38% agreeing that it blocked government legislation too often and 34% disagreeing. Voters registered strong support for statements that: the Senate should pass legislation on its merits (73% to 12% opposed); negotiation leads to better laws (66% to 20%); and it is bad for the country when the government also controls the Senate (63% to 24%). They disagreed with the statements that Australia would be better off without the Senate (55% opposed, 22% in favour) and that the Senate should generally pass government legislation (66% opposed, 20% in favour). In December, the Australian Energy Markets Commission estimated that increased wind and solar generation would help drive power prices down by 2.1% on average in the next two years, with the typical household saving $55 a year in wholesale power costs.",
