In comments confirmed by two sources to the Guardian, he told the group that anyone who didn\u2019t like his management style could \u201cfuck off\u201d. The Guardian understands that Javid demanded the meeting in support of his adviser and he will not let the matter drop. But there are increasing suggestions that he is becoming isolated from the core of Johnson\u2019s team.

      "bodyText": "Cross-party rebel MPs said they had new optimism that measures to stop a no-deal Brexit could pass both the Commons and the Lords before parliament is prorogued, as Labour\u2019s Tom Watson confirmed a potential bill had been drafted. Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the leading Conservative architects of plans to stop no deal, has said MPs do have time to pass legislation on it. However, MPs from different parties are believed to be still at odds over how to stop Boris Johnson from circumventing any new law \u2013 and crucially what the aim of any extension to article 50 should be, whether that be extra time for negotiations, a second referendum or a general election. Watson, who announced on Friday he was joining a legal challenge to stop the prorogation of parliament, said concrete plans were now in place. \u201cI have taken advice on legislative solutions to challenge the prime minister\u2019s action to stop us crashing out of the EU without a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in discussion with colleagues in other parties and a bill to achieve this outcome has been drafted.\u201d Letwin, who led efforts to stop no-deal Brexit this year by passing a bill with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said \u201cthere probably is time\u201d to get a measure to block a no-deal Brexit through parliament, involving MPs seizing control of the order paper to pass the bill in a matter of days. Opposition peers expect Tories in the Lords to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which must have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. The Labour leader in the upper house, Angela Smith, has been taking advice on procedural mechanisms for ensuring the government cannot prevent peers from sitting for as long as it takes to get the bill through. Labour peers have been put on a three-line whip for Wednesday to Friday next week. A Labour source in the Lords said: \u201cIf the Commons does pass the bill, the government should be in no doubt that the Lords will do all it can to protect the will of the elected house.\u201d In the Commons, a number of prominent Conservative MPs, including the former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart, have indicated they will back the efforts next week but Letwin said he was not complacent about numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s a foolhardy person who predicts the number of MPs who will vote either way on an issue of this kind and we will just have to see whether we can acquire a majority of the required kind,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI know that there are a number of my colleagues who feel \u2013 as I do \u2013 that a disorderly no-deal exit is a very bad idea, and they have in the past been willing to come and support efforts to prevent that happening and I very much hope that will happen again.\u201d A senior MP close to the rebels\u2019 discussions said all efforts would be focused on passing a bill forcing the government to request an extension, but there were still question marks over how long an extension should be and for what purpose. \u201cLabour and the frontbench want a general election, soft-Brexit Tories like Letwin don\u2019t want either a people\u2019s vote or a general election and a significant number of the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] won\u2019t vote for a referendum either,\u201d the MP said. \u201cIf the legislation is vague, as it was in the Cooper bill in April \u2013 where the extension length was unspecified \u2013 Boris could simply ask for another six hours\u2019 extension and satisfy the legal requirement.\u201d Letwin denied reports that the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, had broken off his family holiday to discuss \u201ccooking up plans\u201d with him to stop parliament being prorogued but said the pair had been in contact. \u201cThere\u2019s no question of any MP cooking up any deal with the Speaker. You cannot do that. The Speaker has to follow the rules,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. But he added: \u201cI have talked to the Speaker and the clerks on many occasions and will continue to do so.\u201d On Friday, Johnson told MPs that efforts to stop no-deal in parliament were detrimental to his attempts to secure concessions from the EU. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think at the back of their minds that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in, by parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and to get ready for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and that\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d EU officials remain concerned that the UK has so far presented no concrete proposals for replacing the backstop \u2013 the insurance policy for avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which Johnson has described as undemocratic. Johnson hopes to strike a deal at a key meeting of the European council on 17 October, and will then give MPs the chance to vote on it the following week, just days before the Halloween Brexit deadline. He insisted they would have \u201ca lot of time\u201d to debate the issues. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October, and in that period, parliament is going to have a lot of time, still \u2013 and they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way, without actually getting it over the line,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a lot of time for consideration, and what I want to do now, which I think is what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway.\u201d",

Gordon Brown\u2019s claim that the European Union will offer to withdraw 31 October for leaving the bloc, to \u201cpull the rug\u201d from under hardline Brexiteers.</p> \n  <p>Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday morning, Brown said he had been speaking to EU leaders and understood that President Emmanuel Macron of France no longer insisted the UK should be held to that date. Brown claimed Macron had originally insisted on it chiefly to \u201csound tough\u201d during the European election campaign.</p> \n  <p>Speaking at the launch of a new think tank Our Scottish Future, Brown said he accepted EU leaders could not unilaterally withdraw the deadline but were poised to say they would extend it if asked, adding to pressure on Boris Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. I believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d</p> \n  <p> His remarks were met with incredulity in Brussels, since there has been no discussion of that strategy at all; it was not on the radar. One official there described them as \u201cbizarre\u201d. The EU requires unanimity of all 27 member states on such a change \u2013 a process which involves heads of government involvement, and the UK\u2019s agreement to it.</p> \n  <p>During a question and answer session, Brown went further: \u201cMy information is that Macron no longer holds to that deadline. It was really introduced for his campaign in the European elections to make him sound tough.</p> \n  <p> \u201cAnd none of the other European commissioners, including the new president of the European Commission [Ursula von der Leyen], I believe will hold to that October 31st deadline.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo really the government has two arguments that they want to get across - that it\u2019s a sovereign people against a non-sovereign parliament, and it\u2019s Britain against Europe. Pull the rug from under that argument by saying it\u2019s not Europe that\u2019s being inflexible, it\u2019s up to Britain now, the October 31st deadline can be removed.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d691cd48f08a5e74d6984e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T12:59:57.579Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The writer and leftwing campaigner, Paul Mason, has thanked Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings for galvanising opponents of a no-deal Brexit. </p> \n  <p>In his latest video message he calls for street demonstrations on Saturday against the suspension of Parliament. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/1167419932654440448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a single week Boris Johnson has created a mass democracy and totally deflated the Hard Brexit brigade's claim to insurgency.

So the weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cSo the best thing now is for use get on and make our points to our European friends with clarity and vigour and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6909358f082209d3224620\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T12:00:15.239Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Johnson: 'We have a way to get Brexit done'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has defended his decision to prorogue parliament suggesting it has helped the UK negotiating stance with the EU. </p> \n  <p>Asked by Sky News how the decision squared with the promise of leave campaigners to allow Parliament to take back control, he said: \u201cParliament voted to allow the people to have say. Parliamentarians said to the people \u2018we will respect the result\u2019. And then they triggered article 50 and time and time again they promised that they would deliver on the mandate of the people and they would get Brexit done. And I hope that they will.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Johnson again insisted that Parliament would have time to debate Brexit: \u201cWe are coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October and in that period, Parliament is going to have a lot to time - they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way without actually getting it over the line. They are going to have a lot of time for further consideration.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He suggested the move to prorogue parliament was part of the government\u2019s attempts to show the EU that was serious about leaving with or without a deal on 31 October.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWhat I want to do now, which is I think what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd it is by getting ready to come out anyway that we have greatly strengthened our position with our friends and partners in the EU, because they see that we are serious. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in by Parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need. That\u2019s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and get ready for a no deal Brexit. That\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked what he would tell people who have been protesting against the suspension of Parliament, Johnson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My message to them is that the worst thing for democracy now would be to cancel the referendum, which is what some people are now suggesting, to annul that result, to tell the people that they are going to be ignored, after all the promises that have been made. Because everybody can see what the risk is now. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIf we frustrate that mandate, if we stop the UK from leaving on October 31st, if that\u2019s what parliamentarians end up doing, it will do lasting damage to people\u2019s trust in politics. It will do catastrophic damage to the major parties in this country. This political generation won\u2019t be forgiven for failing to honour that promise. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWe told the people we would get it done. We have a way to get it done, we are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway. But the best way to succeed in that negotiation is for everybody to be united in the objective and for the UK negotiations to have the strongest possible hand, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the next few weeks. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T21:30:20.712Z\">at 10.30pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d690a688f082209d3224641\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T11:37:43.665Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1167399957776752640\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAK: Lawyer in prorogation case says Belfast court has \"allowed Raymond McCord to file papers to seek an injunction to compel the PM to reverse his advice to prorogue Parliament by close of business on Monday 2 Sept 2019\".

And there are examples over history of that taking place.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if the House of Lords could block attempts in the Commons to stop a no-deal Brexit, Lisvane said: \u201cI think the Lords would be very cautious about seeking to kill a bill which would actually been passed by the elected house.\u201d</p> \n  <p>And he expressed alarm about a report by <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/boris-johnson-brexit-extreme-measures\">Buzzfeed that the government was considering advising the Queen not to give royal assent </a>to any legislation passed by Parliament delaying Brexit.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cI would hope we get nowhere near that. I think that would be very, very difficult set of circumstances. I think her ministers will be incredibly ill advised to take a step of that sort.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d68d23e8f08a5e74d6981bf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-30T07:48:22.018Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Letwin confirms talks with Bercow</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Oliver Letwin</strong>, a leading Tory opponent of a no-deal Brexit, has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. </p> \n  <p>He denied that he \u201ccooking up a deal with the speaker\u201d.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up this live blog for today. Here are the key takeaways from Friday\u2019s politics: Boris Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block a no-deal Brexit makes that outcome more likely. Defending his decision to prorogue parliament he said: \u201cThe weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d Johnson also claimed the government had found a way to get Brexit done. He said: \u201cWe are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway.\u201d A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson and Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson have joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the high court on Thursday 5 September. A lawyer in a separate appeal against prorogation, in the Belfast high court, says a full hearing will take place no later than next Friday. Victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who is making the appeal, has been allowed to file papers in the case, his lawyer said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, is joining the High Court action by Gina Miller, together with John Major and Tom Watson. She said: \u201cThe attempt to shut down Parliament is an anti-democratic, authoritarian power grab by Boris Johnson, who wants to silence the people and their representatives. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are doing all we can, both in the courts and in Parliament, to prevent both the shutdown of our democracy and a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll be joining the High Court judicial review launched by Gina Miller.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue Parliament hasn\u2019t harmed his election chances a YouGov poll suggests. The poll conducted on Wednesday (the day he announced the move) and Thursday puts the Tories on 33%, 11% above Labour. And the poll puts the LibDems on 21% only 1% behind Labour. But Prof John Curtice, the respected polling expert at Strathclyde University, says calling a general election before Brexit would be risky for Johnson. Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cThe Conservatives probably need an eight point lead over Labour to have 50% chance of getting an overall majority. And that\u2019s the point that we are at [in the average of polls]. So I think at the moment an early general election looks like a relatively risky prospect rather than a certainty.\u201d He added: \u201cHe might want to hold an election after he\u2019s delivered Brexit. There is some polling evidence to suggest it is not an unreasonable calculation that at that point more of the Brexit party voters would switch to the Conservative Party, and that would open up the kind of lead that might give the Conservatives a secure position inside the House of Commons.\u201d \u201cBut that might mean that Boris Johnson still has to solve that riddle of how to get Brexit through the current House of Commons rather than using a general election to make the task rather easier.\u201d Interviewed before the latest poll was released, Prof Curtice added: \u201cIt is certainly true that across all of the polls, that the leave vote, is gradually proving to be more concentrated than that of the remain vote. \u201cYouGov in particular tend to have the Liberal Democrats relatively higher than most other polls and Labour rather lower, because they are suggesting that if anything, maybe the Liberal Democrats, have slightly more remain voters than Labour. \u201cBut across the piece it looks as though, if you take the average of the polls, that something like 50% or just short or those who voted leave in 2016 currently say they would vote for the Conservatives. Whereas only a quarter of them say they\u2019d vote for the Brexit party. \u201cThe question is whether the squeeze on the Brexit party vote is going to any further.\u201d A hearing at the High Court in London relating to a bid to challenge the suspension of Parliament will take place on Thursday 5 September, a spokesman for the judiciary has confirmed. The spokesman told PA: \u201cA hearing into an application for judicial review received from Gina Miller with the Prime Minister as defendant has been fixed for Thursday 5 September 5 2019 at the Divisional Court in Court 4 at the Royal Courts of Justice, with the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett presiding. \u201cThe court will first consider the request for the case to be heard and, if it agrees, a full hearing will follow the same day. Further information will be given early next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: Boris Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block a no-deal Brexit makes that outcome more likely. Defending his decision to prorogue parliament he said: \u201cThe weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d Johnson also claimed the government had found a way to get Brexit done. He said: \u201cWe are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway.\u201d A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson have joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the High Court on Thursday 5 September. A lawyer in a separate appeal against prorogation, in the Belfast High Court, says a full hearing will take place no later than next Friday. The victims campaigner, Raymond McCord, who is making the appeal, has been allowed to file papers in the case, his lawyer said. Gordon Brown has claimed the EU is prepared to withdraw the current 31 October deadline. Speaking in Edinburgh he said: \u201cI believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing.\u201d The idea is being greeted with scepticism in Brussels. Oliver Letwin has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has condenmed the prorogation of parliament as a \u201cprofound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d He also defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d Severin Carrell has more on Gordon Brown\u2019s claim that the European Union will offer to withdraw 31 October for leaving the bloc, to \u201cpull the rug\u201d from under hardline Brexiteers. Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday morning, Brown said he had been speaking to EU leaders and understood that President Emmanuel Macron of France no longer insisted the UK should be held to that date. Brown claimed Macron had originally insisted on it chiefly to \u201csound tough\u201d during the European election campaign. Speaking at the launch of a new think tank Our Scottish Future, Brown said he accepted EU leaders could not unilaterally withdraw the deadline but were poised to say they would extend it if asked, adding to pressure on Boris Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. I believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has, and the claim that he\u2019s making, that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d His remarks were met with incredulity in Brussels, since there has been no discussion of that strategy at all; it was not on the radar. One official there described them as \u201cbizarre\u201d. The EU requires unanimity of all 27 member states on such a change \u2013 a process which involves heads of government involvement, and the UK\u2019s agreement to it. During a question and answer session, Brown went further: \u201cMy information is that Macron no longer holds to that deadline. It was really introduced for his campaign in the European elections to make him sound tough. \u201cAnd none of the other European commissioners, including the new president of the European Commission [Ursula von der Leyen], I believe will hold to that October 31st deadline. \u201cSo really the government has two arguments that they want to get across - that it\u2019s a sovereign people against a non-sovereign parliament, and it\u2019s Britain against Europe. Pull the rug from under that argument by saying it\u2019s not Europe that\u2019s being inflexible, it\u2019s up to Britain now, the October 31st deadline can be removed.\u201d The writer and leftwing campaigner, Paul Mason, has thanked Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings for galvanising opponents of a no-deal Brexit. In his latest video message he calls for street demonstrations on Saturday against the suspension of Parliament. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was not informed in advance about the sacking of one of his senior advisers by Boris Johnson\u2019s strategist Dominic Cummings, it has emerged. Sonia Khan, Javid\u2019s media adviser, was escorted from No 10 by a police officer after being accused of misleading Cummings over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who has been trying to block a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street rebuffed speculation that she had leaked the government\u2019s no-deal planning report, Operation Yellowhammer, to the press. Khan was the second adviser working for Javid to be sacked by No 10, leading to suggestions that Javid is becoming increasingly isolated from the core of the Johnson regime. A suggestion by Gordon Brown that the EU is prepared to withdraw the current 31 October deadline, is being greeted with scepticism in Brussels. Speaking at a seminar in Edinburgh Brown said: \u201cI have actually been talking to some European leaders this week. \u201cI believe that next week the European Union will withdraw the October 31st deadline and remove the excuse that Boris Johnson has and the claim that he\u2019s making that it\u2019s the European Union being inflexible in their timing, and make it possible for MPs to vote [against] no-deal Brexit.\u201d But after putting the idea to EU officials, Mutjaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, says its nonsense. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson says he will also be joining Gina Miller\u2019s legal action against the suspension of Parliament. In a statement he said: \u201cProroguing Parliament is an unprecedented affront to democracy. The rights and freedoms of our citizens have been vandalised. This is an abuse of power that can and should be stopped.\u201d He added: \u201cI have taken advice on legislative solutions to challenge the prime minister\u2019s action to stop us crashing out of the EU without a deal. I am in discussions with colleagues in other parties and a Bill to achieve this outcome has been drafted. \u201cI will be joining the judicial review launched in the High Court by Gina Miller and supported by John Major as a claimant. \u201cI will be represented by Mishcon de Reya, Tom Hickman and David Pannick QC. \u201cI intend to assist the court from the perspective of an active legislator to ensure that there is sufficient time for members of all parties to consider and vote on the Bill.\u201d Interesting thread from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, on how Johnson\u2019s tactics are going down in Brussels and Berlin. In a separate interview with the BBC, Johnson has warned MPs that trying to block no-deal makes that outcome more likely. He said: \u201cAs long as they think in the EU that parliament might try to block Brexit, the less likely they are to give us the deal we want. So the weird thing is, that the more the parliamentarians try to block the no-deal Brexit, the more likely it is that we\u2019ll end up in that situation.\u201d He added: \u201cSo the best thing now is for use get on and make our points to our European friends with clarity and vigour and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d Boris Johnson has defended his decision to prorogue parliament suggesting it has helped the UK negotiating stance with the EU. Asked by Sky News how the decision squared with the promise of leave campaigners to allow Parliament to take back control, he said: \u201cParliament voted to allow the people to have say. Parliamentarians said to the people \u2018we will respect the result\u2019. And then they triggered article 50 and time and time again they promised that they would deliver on the mandate of the people and they would get Brexit done. And I hope that they will.\u201d Johnson again insisted that Parliament would have time to debate Brexit: \u201cWe are coming up to the last period before we leave on 31 October and in that period, Parliament is going to have a lot to time - they\u2019ve spent three years debating Brexit by the way without actually getting it over the line. They are going to have a lot of time for further consideration.\u201d He suggested the move to prorogue parliament was part of the government\u2019s attempts to show the EU that was serious about leaving with or without a deal on 31 October. He said: \u201cWhat I want to do now, which is I think what most people in the country want the government to do, is get on and try and get an agreement, but if we can\u2019t get an agreement, get ready to come out anyway. \u201cAnd it is by getting ready to come out anyway that we have greatly strengthened our position with our friends and partners in the EU, because they see that we are serious. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the more our friends and partners think that Brexit could be stopped, that the UK could be kept in by Parliament, the less likely they are to give us the deal that we need. That\u2019s why I really hope that MPs will allow the UK to do a deal and get ready for a no deal Brexit. That\u2019s the best way forward for our country.\u201d Asked what he would tell people who have been protesting against the suspension of Parliament, Johnson said: My message to them is that the worst thing for democracy now would be to cancel the referendum, which is what some people are now suggesting, to annul that result, to tell the people that they are going to be ignored, after all the promises that have been made. Because everybody can see what the risk is now. \u201cIf we frustrate that mandate, if we stop the UK from leaving on October 31st, if that\u2019s what parliamentarians end up doing, it will do lasting damage to people\u2019s trust in politics. It will do catastrophic damage to the major parties in this country. This political generation won\u2019t be forgiven for failing to honour that promise. \u201cWe told the people we would get it done. We have a way to get it done, we are in the last stages now of negotiating with our friends about a way to get it done. If we can\u2019t succeed in that negotiation we must come out anyway. But the best way to succeed in that negotiation is for everybody to be united in the objective and for the UK negotiations to have the strongest possible hand, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the next few weeks. Boris Johnson has given a defiant sounding interview with Sky News. We\u2019ll have more details after it is broadcast. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva rhas epeated Brussels\u2019 request for Boris Johnson to produce \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d following his call to increase the tempo of talks. She said: \u201cIndeed (the PM\u2019s Europe adviser) David Frost has asked to meet the Commission twice a week to discuss the UK\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cWe have always said from our side that our doors remain open and we have demonstrated, in fact, our willingness to work 24/7 throughout this long process.\u201d She added: \u201cOur position remains that we will need to first see proposals, concrete proposals, from the UK government that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement before we can take these discussions further. \u201cWe have also communicated yesterday that our teams will indeed resume discussions next week.\u201d Gina Miller sets out her objections to the suspension of Parliament here: Here\u2019s a summary of another eventful morning on the Brexit front: A Scottish judge has temporarily rejected calls to block Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament. But Lord Doherty brought forward a full hearing on the case to next Tuesday. A request was also made by the petitioners that Johnson issue a legally binding statement to the court over his reasons for the suspension. If granted the prime minister could potentially be called to face cross-examination. Former prime minister, John Major, has joined Gina Miller\u2019s judicial review against the suspension of parliament. It will be heard in the High Court on Thursday 5 September. An application in Belfast High Court for an injunction against the suspension of Parliament will now not be heard on Friday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan told victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who made the legal bid, that if he wanted to pursue the matter a judge would decide on 3 September if the case should be heard later that week. Oliver Letwin has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has condenmed the prorogation of parliament as a \u201cprofound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d He also defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d The second legal attempt to injunct the prorogation of parliament appears to be going the same way as the first. PA reports: An application in Belfast High Court for an injunction against the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament will not be heard on Friday. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan told victims campaigner Raymond McCord, who made the legal bid, that if he wanted to pursue the matter a judge would decide on 3 September if the case should be heard later that week. McCord is already taking judicial review proceedings to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The hearing on that wider issue is still listed to take place on 16 September. Sir Declan questioned the merits of hearing the case to injunct proroguing until it became clear what Parliament\u2019s response to Boris Johnson\u2019s move might be. \u201cEvery morning you wake up and there\u2019s something new that has occurred here,\u201d he said during Friday\u2019s short hearing in Belfast High Court. A Scottish government said it has noted the court\u2019s decision. He said: \u201cWe will continue to monitor this case, and to press for Scotland and the UK to remain in the European Union. \u201cThe Scottish Government will be bringing a debate to the Scottish Parliament next week calling for a no deal Brexit to be ruled out under all circumstances.\u201d The cabinet secretary for constitutional relations, Michael Russell, said: \u201cI pay tribute to the MPs and Peers, led by parliamentarians from Scotland, who brought this action to assert their right to hold the UK Government to account. \u201cThe impact of leaving the EU, and particularly leaving without a deal, will be grave, profound and damaging. \u201cAttempting to deprive the Westminster Parliament of the opportunity to scrutinise the UK government\u2019s plans, and preventing it from being able to legislate in respect of the UK government\u2019s plans, is undemocratic and unconstitutional. \u201cAll MPs and all citizens, regardless of their position on leaving the EU, should be alarmed by the prime minister\u2019s plan to avoid debate and prevent the legislative action necessary to avert a catastrophic no deal exit.\u201d Litigation partner at Pinsent Masons, Jim Cormack QC, said the Court of Session\u2019s decision to refuse an interim interdict on the basis that a full hearing can be brought forward is quite common. He added: \u201cGiven the nature and potential effects of the orders the court is being asked to grant, it is understandable why the court prefers to bring forward a full hearing in this case. \u201cThe petitioners may take some comfort from the fact that in refusing interim orders, the judge has focused on the practicalities rather than delving too far at this stage into the substantive strengths and weaknesses of the arguments. That is now a matter which will come before the court on Tuesday.\u201d The government has welcomed the Court of Session\u2019s decision to refuse an emergency order to block prorogation. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cAs we have set out, the government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda, and MPs are not prevented from scrutinising our withdrawal from the EU. \u201cWe are glad the court found against the interdict - there was no good reason to seek one, given the full hearing is due to take place next week, and the process of bringing the session to an end will not start until the week commencing 9 September.\u201d The Labour MP, Ian Murray, who is also backing the legal action in Scotland, said: \u201cThis verdict means a full hearing has been fast-tracked to next week, which is now the most important week in modern British history. \u201cIt is disappointing that we have to go to the courts to protect British democracy, but Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to silence the people\u2019s representatives cannot go unchallenged. \u201cAs well as this legal battle in the Court of Session, the campaign against a no-deal Brexit will also take place in the House of Commons. \u201cWe must work tirelessly, across all parties and none, to fight against the devastation of a no-deal Brexit, fight for our democracy, and fight for the people to have a final say on Brexit.\u201d Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s justice and home affairs spokeswoman and one of those who brought the case against prorogation, said the decision to bring forward the full hearing to next Tuesday was a vindication of the action. Speaking outside Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session, she confirmed the judge had refused to grant an emergency order against prorogation. She said: \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t made any ruling on the merits of our arguments that prorogation should be stopped. He wants to hear further and full argument on Tuesday morning hear the Court of Session before making a decision. I see that as a victory for us. \u201cAidan O\u2019Neill, QC, who is instructed by myself and my fellow petitioners, pointed out to the court that the court ordered that affidavits should be lodged at an earlier stage. \u201cThe prime minster should lodge a sworn affidavit setting out his reasons for the prorogation and make himself available for cross examination before the court if necessary. \u201cThis is an interesting suggestion, particularly in the light of the comments that were caught off camera from the defence minister [Ben Wallace] indicating that the reason for the prorogation was, as I and others have always argued to frustrate the democratic ability of parliament to stop a no-deal where we all know there is a majority against no deal. \u201cSo I see this as a vindication of our decision to take this action.\u201d You can read Wallace\u2019s comments here. More on the Scottish challenge: Aiden O\u2019Neill QC, representing those for the action, argued for the substantive hearing to be moved forward. He said: \u201cThere is an urgency to this - any delay is prejudicial - not just to the prejudice of the petitioners, but to the country as a whole.\u201d The hearing was then changed from Friday September 6 to Tuesday in the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d. Lord Doherty said: \u201cI\u2019m going to move the substantive hearing forward to Tuesday. \u201cWeighing consideration in the balance, it\u2019s in the interest of justice that it proceeds sooner rather than later.\u201d It\u2019s going to be busy week in the courts. A separate challenge to the suspension of Parliament by Gina Miller and John Major\u2019s will be heard next Thursday, Miller says. Lord Doherty has brought forward the full hearing on the legality of prorogation from Friday next week to Tuesday. It will held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Judge Lord Doherty said: \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied that it has been demonstrated that there\u2019s a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage. \u201cA substantive hearing is set to place for Friday September 6, before the first possible date parliament could be prorogued.\u201d Judge Lord Doherty dismissed the action ahead of a full hearing originally set for 6 September. Aidan O\u2019Neill the barrister for those making the challenge demanded Johnson explained on oath why he needed to prorogue parliament. Opponents of Boris Johnson\u2019s bid to suspend parliament have been denied an interim interdict at the court of session in Edinburgh. Some initial reaction to John Major\u2019s legal intervention: On Wednesday Major warned that said he was seeking legal advice on whether he can challenge Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a statement read out on BBC News, Major said: \u201cI have no doubt that the prime minister\u2019s motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign parliament that opposes his policy. As events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this and other matters, but will be making no further comment.\u201d Last month Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. In June he said this: In his statement Major said: I promised that, if the prime minister prorogued Parliament in order to prevent members from opposing Brexit plans, I would seek judicial review of his action. In view of the imminence of the prorogation \u2013 and to avoid duplication of effort, and taking up the Court\u2019s time through repetition \u2013 I intend to seek the court\u2019s permission to intervene in the claim already initiated by Gina Miller, rather then to commence separate proceedings. If granted permission to intervene, I intend to seek to assist the Court from the perspective of having served in government as a minister and prime minister. John Major says he will seek to join Gina Miller in her court bid to block the suspension of parliament. In a statement to lobby journalists he said he will be represented in court by Edward Garnier, a former minister and barrister. Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti said she believed opponents of Boris Johnson had the numbers in Parliament to force through a change in the law to block a no-deal Brexit, PA reports. She suggested people should \u201ctake to the streets\u201d if the government continues its approach. \u201cMy own soundings and those of colleagues in discussions over the last couple of days, in particular since the constitutional outrage, give me greater comfort that minds are now focused, especially on the Conservative side,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today. She said she believed the measure could also get through the Lords: \u201cI know that all sorts of high jinks have been discussed, filibusters and so on, but I believe that there are means of preventing any sort of public school dirty tricks working, even in the House of Lords.\u201d In response to suggestions the government could seek to delay royal assent to any legislation to block no-deal, Chakrabarti said: \u201cWe do know that we are dealing with a bunch of people who have no respect for our precious constitution. \u201cIf they try any more of this stuff we will use any means necessary to prevent this undemocratic behaviour - that includes people taking to the streets, that includes people taking to the airwaves, that includes people going to court. \u201cBecause they are behaving in a way that is unworthy of a UK government.\u201d Update on the three legal challenges: A decision is expected some time after 10am by a judge hearing the case at the Court of Session in Edinburgh brought by a cross-party group of 70 MPs and peers seeking to stop the Prime Minister from suspending Parliament. From 10.30am at the High Court in Belfast, victims campaigner Raymond McCord, will try to secure an injunction preventing prorogation. A third legal challenge brought by campaigner Gina Miller at the High Court in London \u201cis being considered\u201d, according to a judiciary spokeswoman. Ken Clarke has said he \u201cprobably would\u201d back Jeremy Corbyn to be caretaker prime minister in order to block a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News, the former chancellor and father of the House, said: \u201cSo long as it were absolutely certain we could keep Jeremy under control and he wouldn\u2019t have the slightest chance of implementing any bits of his Labour manifesto, I hate to tell you but I probably would.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, because I must be one of a tiny number of Tories prepared to contemplate that.\u201d Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the House of Commons, has joined those criticising the prorogation of Parliament and defended John Bercow\u2019s outspoken attack against the move. He told Today: \u201cI think if you prevent Parliament from taking a decision or expressing a view because you think it won\u2019t be to your taste, that\u2019s a pretty profound subversion of the relationship between government and Parliament.\u201d \u201cI think it would be bad for the government\u2019s reputation in the long term as well as the short term. I think there\u2019s an element of fair play involved. If for some people, that doesn\u2019t matter, then I think the effects will be far reaching.\u201d After Bercow described the move as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said such remarks were unconstitutional. Lisvane said Rees-Mogg was \u201cwrong\u201d. He said: \u201cThe house\u2019s presiding officer is also the representative of its interests. And if he sees those interests being damaged or threatened, I think it\u2019s reasonable for him to say something about it. And there are examples over history of that taking place.\u201d Asked if the House of Lords could block attempts in the Commons to stop a no-deal Brexit, Lisvane said: \u201cI think the Lords would be very cautious about seeking to kill a bill which would actually been passed by the elected house.\u201d And he expressed alarm about a report by Buzzfeed that the government was considering advising the Queen not to give royal assent to any legislation passed by Parliament delaying Brexit. He said: \u201cI would hope we get nowhere near that. I think that would be very, very difficult set of circumstances. I think her ministers will be incredibly ill advised to take a step of that sort.\u201d Oliver Letwin, a leading Tory opponent of a no-deal Brexit, has confirmed he been in talks with the speaker, John Bercow on the parliamentary procedures for stopping UK leaving the UK without a deal. He denied that he \u201ccooking up a deal with the speaker\u201d. But asked about a report in the Telegraph he had talked to Bercow while the speaker was on holiday in Turkey, Letwin said: \u201cIt is perfectly true that for many months I\u2019ve been talking both to the clarks and the speaker and that\u2019s the appropriate thing to do if they want to establish what the procedures are, and we\u2019ll go on doing that. Letwin also insisted there was an opportunity next week in Parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about how we can ensure that Britain doesn\u2019t make a sudden, disorderly, undemocratic, no-deal exit on 31 October. I believe that there probably is time. Whether we can get the required majorities in the House of Commons is altogether another matter. \u201cI know there are a number of my colleagues who feel that a disorderly, no-deal exit is a very bad idea and they have in the past been willing to support efforts to prevent that happening. \u201cI hope that Parliament will take a series of actions that by the end of the week mean that Boris Johnson knows that as prime minister that if doesn\u2019t get a deal he is going to have seek an extension.\u201d He said he disagreed with former cabinet minister David Lidington, who suggested on Thursday that the time for Parliament to act was after the October EU summit. Letwin said: \u201cI hope that we can take action this coming week so that if the prime minister hasn\u2019t got a deal in place then he needs to seek an extension.\u201d Ireland\u2019s deputy premier Simon Coveney insisted that any Brexit deal with the UK must be based on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May. He said: \u201cWe want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship. \u201cBut that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, and if the UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.\u201d \u201cWe have always said if there are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let\u2019s hear them, and if we can work out a deal on that basis so be it. \u201cBut what we will not do in Ireland - and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this - we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed - i.e. the backstop, which solves a difficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis - and for that to be replaced with something that doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we\u2019ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how. \u201cThat is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.\u201d On Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Coveney said: \u201cI\u2019m sure if he wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be OK with that. \u201cMichel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that\u2019s ready to go. \u201cWe all want to get a deal.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem from a European Union perspective in terms of making time available for negotiations.\u201d \u201cWe all want to try to resolve these issues, we want to find a way of getting a deal that the UK are happy with and that the EU is happy with and can accept too. There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.\u201d The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has been sent out to the broadcast media to defend the suspension of parliament. He repeated the government\u2019s claim that there is nothing unusual or improper in what the government is doing. Speaking to Sky News: \u201cTo allow four days in October so that the Queen can come and open Parliament again is perfectly normal, constitutional and is the right thing to do.\u201d He also claimed there was \u201cnothing new\u201d to discuss on Brexit. He said: \u201cThis idea that Parliament won\u2019t get the chance to debate Brexit again is completely untrue. And it not like this hasn\u2019t been discussed. In fact there is nothing new to discuss on the Brexit front until we get to that October European summit.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must leave in order to ensure that people have faith in democracy\u201d. Earlier speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: \u201cThe next big thing to happen will be around the next European summit and that\u2019s not until the middle of October anyway and that is the time at which there may be something new to discuss.\u201d Shapps also announced \u00a330m for minor ports to help them prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Raab, the only contender in the Tory leadership race to back proroguing parliament in the campaign, has dismissed the furore over move as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The foreign secretary insisted only around four days of Commons sitting time would be lost by suspending parliament for up to five weeks before a Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October \u2013 a calculation based on MPs leaving Westminster for the party conferences. He told reporters at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Helsinki: \u201cThe idea this is some kind of constitutional outrage is nonsense. It\u2019s actually lawful, it\u2019s perfectly proper, there is precedent for it and actually, fundamentally, for the people watching this, they want to see that we are leaving the EU but also talking about all the other things they expect us to be addressing.\u201d Welcome to a Friday edition of Politics Live. Boris Johnson says he was wants to step up the tempo of talks on a Brexit deal as a judge prepares to rule on a legal challenge aimed at stopping him suspending parliament. Downing Street said the UK\u2019s team of Brexit negotiators will sit down with their EU counterparts twice a week during September \u201cwith the possibility of additional technical meetings, to discuss a way forward on securing a new deal\u201d. It is being seen as an attempt to calm the concerns of rebel Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit, some of whom are threatening to join opposition efforts to tie the PM\u2019s hands by legislating against the UK leaving the EU with an agreement. Meanwhile, a judge in Scotland will rule on Friday on a legal bid to block Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament for over a month during the Brexit countdown. A court in Northern Ireland will also hear from lawyers representing anti-no-deal campaigners challenging the move and attempt to do the same at the high court in London is also under way. Judge Lord Doherty heard arguments from a lawyer for the campaigners and a legal representative for the UK government at a hearing at the court of session in Edinburgh on Thursday and he is due at the same court on Friday morning to make a decision on the case. Northern Ireland\u2019s Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, who sat for the short hearing at Belfast high court on Thursday, will hold a substantive hearing on Friday morning. A third legal challenge brought by campaigner Gina Miller at the high court in London \u201cis being considered\u201d, according to a judiciary spokeswoman.",

      "body": "<p>In less than two months, Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal. Those who voted to leave in 2016 were promised a negotiated deal by the Vote Leave campaign. The prime minister has now announced that he will prorogue parliament in an attempt to get a no-deal Brexit through. Such an unconstitutional coup risks compromising people\u2019s jobs, security and living standards, as well as the Good Friday agreement. Now Boris Johnson is jeopardising all this for the sake of his own personal polling.

      "bodyText": "In less than two months, Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal. Those who voted to leave in 2016 were promised a negotiated deal by the Vote Leave campaign. The prime minister has now announced that he will prorogue parliament in an attempt to get a no-deal Brexit through. Such an unconstitutional coup risks compromising people\u2019s jobs, security and living standards, as well as the Good Friday agreement. Now Boris Johnson is jeopardising all this for the sake of his own personal polling. It is clear that this has been done to stop MPs debating Brexit at our country\u2019s most constitutionally charged time in recent history. We cannot allow the government to avoid scrutiny at this time of national crisis.

The campaign group Momentum has urged members of the public to block roads and bridges in protest at the move, which has sparked a ferocious backlash from across the political spectrum. The anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe Is Possible has organised 32 #StopTheCoup demonstrations to take place in England, Scotland and Wales on Saturday. Johnson announced on Friday that negotiations with the EU27 were being stepped up, with Brussels agreeing to meet the PM\u2019s chief negotiator twice a week. But EU officials remain concerned that the UK has so far presented no concrete proposals for replacing the backstop \u2013 the insurance policy for avoiding a hard border in Ireland, which Johnson has described as undemocratic. Johnson hopes to strike a deal at a key meeting of the European council on 17 October, and will then give MPs the chance to vote on it the following week, just days before the Halloween Brexit deadline.
