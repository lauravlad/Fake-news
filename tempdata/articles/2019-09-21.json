With delegates already reeling from a failed attempt by Corbyn supporters to oust Tom Watson and abolish his role as deputy leader, anger erupted amid accusations that the leadership was trying to block democratic debate and fudge a decision about where Labour stands on the issue of leaving the EU.

      "bodyText": "Former cabinet minister Lord Charlie Falconer has said the decision by Labour to axe its youth wing is legally invalid and breaks party rules as it emerged the group has been stripped of its voting rights at the party\u2019s autumn conference. The peer wrote to the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to say the motion to shut it down passed on 17 September was based on false information and the group remains affiliated to the party. Labour Students, founded 40 years ago, was seen as a centrist group within the party, and has been effectively axed by Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) over allegations that fees had not been paid. The Momentum chief, Jon Lansman, who brought the motion, said the group should be reformed. Lord Falconer, a barrister who was secretary of state for constitutional affairs under Tony Blair, wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian: \u201cThat motion is invalid and of no effect because it is based explicitly on a series of false factual premises, and fails to pay any regard to the current rules of the Labour party. The legal position is Labour Students remain an affiliate and the motion has no effect.\u201d Labour Students representatives found out when they arrived at party conference in Brighton on Saturday that their delegates passes had been withdrawn, which means they can no longer take part in votes. As an affiliate of the party they were allocated two voting members per conference. Chair of the group, Rania Ramli, said they were fighting the decision and would continue to hold their annual conference events including their disco \u2013 which is a major fixture on the conference calendar and will be attended by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Deputy leader Tom Watson is a former chair of Labour Students and the organisation has been praised by MPs in the past week for their significant campaigning presence during general elections. Ramli told the Guardian: \u201cWe wrote to Jennie \u2026 explaining that the motion has no legal standing and that we therefore planned on continuing operating as the official affiliated student wing. We got no response \u2026 and haven\u2019t received anything from the party telling us that Labour Students has been disaffiliated. \u201cWe arrived at party conference to be told that our delegate passes have been revoked so we no longer have voting rights like all affiliated societies do. The motion has been acted upon with no response to the legal questions.\u201d Lord Falconer has been a vocal critic of the way the party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership has handled complaints of antisemitism. He had been due to lead an independent review into antisemitism in the party but stepped back when the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced it would carry out an investigation. In his letter to Formby about Labour Students Falconer explained the group had their constitution signed off in 2015 by former general secretary Iain McNichol and checked again by Katy Clark who was carrying out a review into party democracy. He wrote: \u201cTherefore the claim that \u2018Labour Students appears not to have submitted its political rules to the NEC\u2019 is inaccurate.\u201d Falconer said that the claim in the motion that Labour Students had not paid its affiliation fee of \u00a31.25 per member was \u201cfalse\u201d as the NEC had been sent a copy of the invoice and proof of payment made on 12 July. He added: \u201cDespite this, I understand there was no opportunity to debate the motion at the NEC meeting and it was passed without discussion.\u201d It is understood that up to half of all university Labour clubs, including those at the University of Bristol and Oxford University, disaffiliated from Labour Students this year in a major dispute over voting in its internal elections in May. The implementation of a one-member, one-vote system agreed in 2016 has been fraught with difficulties, with accusations that it left many people unable to cast a vote. Some claim that, of a possible 30,000 student members of the Labour party, only 507 took part in the last election with allegations that it had been poorly run with a complex registration process. Since the NEC ruled it should be disaffiliated from the party many university branches have welcomed the decision. Momentum has said reforming Labour Students is long overdue and a \u201cvictory for democracy\u201d. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThere are tens of thousands of students in the Labour party and their energy and campaigning enthusiasm is invaluable, and will be in the coming general election. Only 500 are members of Labour Students. \u201cWe will be drawing up proposals for a reformed student organisation that fully represents them and complies with the rules.\u201d Labour said they received the letter from Lord Falconer and will reply in due course.",

Jeremy Corbyn has already pledged that a Labour government would abolish Sats for seven- and 11-year-olds, as well as plans for baseline assessments for reception classes. It is also understood that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, could announce that care for over-65s should be free. The move, similar to measures already in place in Scotland, would spare millions of people from high care costs. However, it would require billions in funding, potentially through higher tax. Labour refused to confirm that the policy would be announced, but said: \u201cLabour in government is committed to creating a national care service to ensure people are able to access the services so desperately needed.\u201d",

Lansman tweeted that he agreed with Corbyn\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe need to make sure the deputy leader role is properly accountable to the membership while also unifying the party at conference,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, this review is absolutely the best way of doing that.\u201d Asked on Saturday morning whether he had known about the plan to oust Watson, Corbyn said: \u201cThe NEC agreed this morning that we are going to consult on the future of diversifying the deputy leadership position to reflect the diversity of our society. And the conference will move on to defeating austerity, to the green industrial revolution, green new deal that we are putting forward and giving the people a final say on Brexit. Our NEC left this morning in a happy and united mood. \u201cOur conference will be totally united on defeating this Tory government and the austerity and poverty they have brought to the British people, and the way in which the prime minister has shut down parliament to prevent accountability and debate. That\u2019s not the Labour way. We\u2019ll do things very differently.\u201d The attempt to remove Watson, who was unable to defend himself at the meeting, immediately reopened the debate among MPs about what they should do if the ambush succeeded. Talk of splits and defections immediately returned, with several Labour sources saying that more departures were now more likely. The leaders of Unison and the GMB, two of the three big unions affiliated to Labour, immediately attacked the attempt to remove Watson. However, while Corbyn managed to postpone a row over Watson\u2019s position, he was immediately facing pressure over Brexit as it emerged the party was planning to decide its final position on the issue after the next election. A draft motion, circulated among the NEC on Saturday but not finally agreed, called for a special conference to be called after the election to decide whether Labour should back a Brexit deal it had negotiated, or back staying in the EU. The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: \u201cWhy would the NEC call for a special conference on Brexit when we have the actual conference this week. We cannot support kicking the can down the road longer, we are at the cliff edge. Party democracy must be respected and conference must get a vote on campaigning to remain.\u201d Watson described the attempt to out him as a \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cI got a text message in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester to say that they were abolishing me. \u201cIt\u2019s a straight sectarian attack on a broad church party and it\u2019s moving us into a different kind of institution where pluralism isn\u2019t tolerated, where factional observance has to be adhered to completely and it kind of completely goes against the sort of traditions that the Labour party has had for 100 years.\u201d Senior Labour figures came to Watson\u2019s defence. The former prime minister Tony Blair said a decision to abolish the post of deputy leader would be \u201cundemocratic, damaging and politically dangerous\u201d. He added: \u201cTo suggest it at this time shows a quite extraordinary level of destructive sectarianism. The Labour party has always contained different views within it and the deputy leader\u2019s position has been one way of accommodating such views. \u201cGetting rid of it would be a signal that such pluralism of views was coming to an end despite being cherished throughout Labour\u2019s history.\u201d The former Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u201cThe move to abolish the deputy leader post without warning or debate is undemocratic, wrong and should not happen. Those who came up with the idea for the eve of Labour conference have taken leave of their senses.\u201d",
