In an article in the Guardian, Corbyn signalled that a Labour government would seek to negotiate its own Brexit deal, and put it to a public vote \u2013 and that he would implement the result. He declined to say whether he himself would support remain or leave. \u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU, a close single market relationship, and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.

But the Labour leadership fears that would render the negotiations moot \u2013 and see Corbyn swept out of Downing Street if the public voted leave, as David Cameron was in 2016. Asked by Sky News on Wednesday whether he would campaign for leave or remain, he said: \u201cMy job is to deliver the option chosen by the British people.\u201d Remain campaigners fear Corbyn\u2019s blunt restatement of Labour\u2019s position \u2013 including his insistence that voters be presented with a leave option \u2013 could be used to try to stifle debate in Brighton. More than 90 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) have submitted motions to next week\u2019s conference, with most calling for Labour to commit immediately to campaigning for remain in a referendum, whatever the result of negotiations with Brussels. Their representatives will hammer out a composite motion, which will then be put to the conference for a vote. They believe they could win but some are wary about being seen to be in direct conflict with Corbyn, whose position has the backing of the major Labour-supporting unions. Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, who has made no secret of his own reluctance to overturn the result of the Brexit referendum, has been urging Corbyn to set out his own stance, and encourage the party to fall in behind him. Some campaigners already appear to be backing away from a confrontation in Brighton.

Labour MPs on both sides of the Brexit divide are concerned about the idea of a general election campaign being dominated by Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, rather than the domestic issues on which Corbyn has strong arguments to make. The Leeds West MP Alex Sobel, another member of Love Socialism Hate Brexit, said: \u201cNinety per cent of the PLP want a referendum first \u2013 even some of those in leave constituencies who are not so exercised about a referendum \u2013 because a general election will become a proxy for the Brexit issue.\u201d On Corbyn\u2019s position, he said: \u201cThe fact that we are now firmly supporting a referendum in basically any circumstances is a huge move forward.

If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> \n<p>A deadline of 30 September would be highly problematic for the prime minister as it falls on the eve of the Conservative party conference, and it remains to be seen whether the EU will stick to the threat.</p> \n<p>Johnson would be wary of showing his hand at such a sensitive point given the potentially negative reaction by his party to any movement towards the EU\u2019s demands on the backstop.</p> \n<p>Rinne said that he intended to speak to the European council president, Donald Tusk, and Johnson to discuss the need for swift action from the UK.</p> \n<p>EU leaders want a clear run for negotiations before a summit on 17 October so that they need not engage in detailed talks on the issue and can nod through any deal.</p> \n<p>Johnson spoke to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, by phone on Wednesday afternoon.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been set a two-week deadline to table a plan for replacing the Irish backstop as further embarrassing details emerged of the prime minister\u2019s chaotic visit to Luxembourg. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Finland\u2019s prime minister, Antti Rinne, told reporters in Paris that they were both \u201cconcerned about what is happening in Britain\u201d. \u201cWe need to know what the UK is proposing,\u201d said Rinne, whose country currently holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency. \u201cLoose talk about proposals for negotiations is irresponsible \u2026 The UK should make its possible own proposals very soon if they would like them to be discussed.\u201d Rinne said: \u201cWe both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing \u2013 if they exist. If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it\u2019s over.\u201d A deadline of 30 September would be highly problematic for the prime minister as it falls on the eve of the Conservative party conference, and it remains to be seen whether the EU will stick to the threat. Johnson would be wary of showing his hand at such a sensitive point given the potentially negative reaction by his party to any movement towards the EU\u2019s demands on the backstop. Rinne said that he intended to speak to the European council president, Donald Tusk, and Johnson to discuss the need for swift action from the UK. EU leaders want a clear run for negotiations before a summit on 17 October so that they need not engage in detailed talks on the issue and can nod through any deal. Johnson spoke to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, by phone on Wednesday afternoon. A Downing Street spokesperson said they discussed their continued determination to reach a deal. They also discussed their lunch meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, which was described as \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d during the call. It emerged earlier in the day that during the lunch meeting Johnson had expressed surprise to his advisers when he was informed about the scale of checks that would still be needed on the island of Ireland under a plan the government has mooted for the Irish border. The two-hour lunch preceded Johnson\u2019s humiliation at the hands of Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, when he failed to attend a press conference due to anti-Brexit protests. EU officials said the advantage for them had been in being able to spell out the problems directly to the prime minister. \u201cIt seems to have helped the penny drop,\u201d said one diplomatic source. During talks with Juncker and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the prime minister was shown in detail how allowing Northern Ireland to stick to common EU rules on food and livestock, known as sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), would still fail to avoid checks on the vast majority of goods that cross the Irish border. Downing Street has described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a report in the Financial Times that Johnson turned to his chief negotiator, David Frost, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and said: \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me the SPS plan doesn\u2019t solve the customs problem?\u201d But senior EU sources confirmed that Johnson had expressed surprise during the lunch at the complexity of the situation, and that it appeared to have been a \u201cbit of a reality check to hear it from EU officials\u201d. Sources said it was not the case that Johnson had failed to understand the role of the shared customs territory in the Irish backstop but that it was the scale of checks that would still be necessary without such an arrangement that appeared to hit home. A second EU diplomat confirmed: \u201cWhen the commission explained the technical challenges and enduring need for customs checks under the UK proposals, Johnson expressed surprise in the direction of his advisers.\u201d In his address to the European parliament on Wednesday, Juncker hinted at the problems that remained. \u201cI have no emotional attachment to the backstop,\u201d he said of his talks with Johnson. \u201cBut I made clear that I do have an intimate commitment to its objectives.\u201d Given the wide gap between the two sides, Juncker also expressed doubts about the possibility that a mutually agreeable replacement for the Irish backstop would be agreed before 31 October when Johnson has said the UK will leave, \u201cdo or die\u201d. The UK said after the Juncker lunch that it would now move to negotiating daily with the EU rather than twice a week but a spokeswoman for the European commission told reporters on Wednesday that there had been no such request as yet. She said: \u201cWe have said and reconfirm that we are fully available to meet 24/7 seven days a week as soon as the UK would like to meet us. But for the moment I do not have any new announcements or scheduling to pass on to you today.\u201d Barnier had suggested that there was a lack of seriousness in the UK\u2019s approach during his own statement to the European parliament. \u201cAlmost three years after the British referendum, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not a question of pretending to negotiate,\u201d he told MEPs. Meanwhile, Johnson had his first conversation with the president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, on Wednesday. Sassoli is understood to have told the prime minister that any agreement would need to be agreed by both the Commons and the EU\u2019s parliament, and \u201crobust debate and parliamentary scrutiny is essential\u201d, in a thinly veiled criticism of the decision to prorogue Westminster.",

As well as accusing Johnson of lying, O\u2019Neill said Johnson and his government could not be trusted not to engage in \u201clow, dishonest, dirty tricks\u201d. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/18/brexit-latest-news-supreme-court-meps-debate-uks-departure-from-eu-live-news?page=with:block-5d823c3a8f08f30dc5bbdb46#block-5d823c3a8f08f30dc5bbdb46\"> 3.25pm.) </a>O\u2019Neill\u2019s speech was easily the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court in this case, although at times there were hints that some of the judges were finding him unduly histrionic. With just one day left of the hearing, it is hard to assess which side is likely to win. O\u2019Neill and his team do not seem to have persuaded the court that the five-week prorogation has fatally damaged the ability of parliament to scrutinise the Brexit process; the fact that MPs passed the Benn bill, supposedly stopping a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, during the September sitting seems to have worked as an effective argument against the claim that parliament has been silenced. But interventions from judges also suggest that they are open to the argument that the PM\u2019s power to prorogue parliament should be subject to some constraints.

These include the fact that authorisation to appropriate money from the consolidated fund, to charge income and corporation tax, and to maintain discipline over the armed forces must be authorised by parliament annually. No government could in practice continue in office without parliament sitting regularly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he also refers to paragraph 76, which also includes these two quotes from The Law of the Constitution, the seminal work by <strong>AV Dicey</strong>. Dicey wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Suppose that parliament were for more than a year not summoned for the despatch of business. This would be a course of proceeding of the most unconstitutional character. Yet there is no court in the land before which one could go with the complaint that parliament had not been assembled ...</p> \n   <p>No rule is better established than that parliament must assemble at least once a year. This maxim, as before pointed out, is certainly not derived from the common law, and is not based upon any statutory enactment. Now suppose that parliament were prorogued once and again for more than a year, so that for two years no parliament sat at Westminster.

Following the passage of the parliament bill by the House of Commons, it was then prorogued again on 25 October 1948.

On 16 October 1914, parliament was further prorogued by proclamation until 11 November 1914. In total, parliament was prorogued for a period of 53 calendar days during wartime. </p> \n   <p>(2) On 1 August 1930, parliament was prorogued until 28 October, a period of 87 days. This was during the onset of the great depression following the 1929 Wall Street Crash and when the then government of James Ramsay MacDonald did not command a majority in the House of Commons. </p> \n   <p>(3) Under s.2 of the Parliament Act 1911 as enacted, a non-money bill could only be enacted without the consent of the Lords if it was passed in three successive sessions by the Commons. As noted below, each session of parliament conventionally lasts for approximately a year. To facilitate the speedy passage of the Parliament Act 1949, the government arranged for a session of minimal length in 1948. Parliament was prorogued on 13 September 1948 to the following day. Following the passage of the parliament bill by the Commons, it was then prorogued again on 25 October 1948.

      "bodyText": "The supreme court has been told that \u201cthe mother of parliaments [is] being shut down by the father of lies\u201d. (See 4.12pm.) Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, counsel for the SNP MP Joanna Cherry and the other parliamentarians challenging the government\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks, delivered the jibe against Boris Johnson as he wound up his speech to the court this afternoon. As well as accusing Johnson of lying, O\u2019Neill said Johnson and his government could not be trusted not to engage in \u201clow, dishonest, dirty tricks\u201d. (See 3.25pm.) O\u2019Neill\u2019s speech was easily the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court in this case, although at times there were hints that some of the judges were finding him unduly histrionic. With just one day left of the hearing, it is hard to assess which side is likely to win. O\u2019Neill and his team do not seem to have persuaded the court that the five-week prorogation has fatally damaged the ability of parliament to scrutinise the Brexit process; the fact that MPs passed the Benn bill, supposedly stopping a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, during the September sitting seems to have worked as an effective argument against the claim that parliament has been silenced. But interventions from judges also suggest that they are open to the argument that the PM\u2019s power to prorogue parliament should be subject to some constraints. (See 11.02am and 11.12am.) This has fuelled speculation that the court may deliver an equivocal ruling that might effectively amount to a \u201cdon\u2019t do it again\u201d warning to the prime minister. (See 12.24pm.) But that is pure speculation. No one knows. Labour MPs and activists are gearing up for a battle over Brexit at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton next week, after Jeremy Corbyn made clear he is ready to take Britain out of the EU if a Labour deal is backed by the public in a second referendum. Northern Ireland\u2019s chief constable, Simon Byrne, has said his police officers could be killed if they had to patrol border checkpoints in the event of a hard Brexit. The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas has branded the Liberal Democrat revoke Brexit position as arrogant and says it risks inflaming further political tension. Salma Yaqoob, the former leader of the defunct Respect party, has announced her intention to stand as Labour\u2019s candidate for West Midlands mayor. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for the comments. Sinn Fein\u2019s deputy leader has voiced her opposition to a Stormont veto on the Irish backstop, the Press Association reports. Michelle O\u2019Neill said her party does not support such a veto because \u201ca backstop that can be vetoed is not a backstop\u201d. It comes after reports that the DUP might endorse the contingency plan aimed at preventing a hard border if the devolved institutions would have a veto on future EU rules applying in the region. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump have discussed the need for a \u201cunited diplomatic response\u201d to the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, Downing Street said. The two leaders spoke today. A Number 10 spokesman said: They condemned the attacks and discussed the need for a united diplomatic response from international partners. They also spoke about Iran and agreed that they must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. Here is Aidan O\u2019Neill\u2019s peroration. In his peroration, Aidan O\u2019Neill also included a reference to the Dred Scott case. I\u2019ve beefed up the post at 4.12pm to include that. You may need to refresh the page to get the update to appear. O\u2019Neill is winding up now. He finishes with a jibe at Boris Johnson as \u201cthe father of lies\u201d. I say to this court, don\u2019t let this case be your Dred Scott moment. Instead stand up for the truth, stand up for reason, stand up for unity in diversity, stand up for parliament, stand up for democracy by dismissing this government\u2019s appeal and uphold a constitution governed by laws and not the passing whims of men. We\u2019ve got here the mother of parliaments being shut down by the father of lies. Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful and an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government. This government is showing itself unworthy of our trust as it uses the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary representative democracy on which our union polity is founded. Enough is enough. Dismiss this appeal, and let them know that. That\u2019s what truth speaking to power sounds like. The Dred Scott reference is provocative too. The Dred Scott case was one heard by the US supreme court in 1857 in which the court ruled that black people could not be American citizens, even if they were free. The court adjourns until tomorrow. O\u2019Neill says you cannot say that, just because MPs did not pass legislation blocking prorogation in September, that means they consented to prorogation. O\u2019Neill says the traditional Scottish approach is that it does not matter how high you are, even if you are the king himself, you can be called before the courts. That is why James VI was so keen to leave Scotland, he says. O\u2019Neill says people knew that the government was planning a five-week prorogation \u201cbecause we read the Observer\u201d. He was referring to Toby Helm\u2019s splash about what the government intended to do. O\u2019Neill addresses the argument that prorogation is non-justiciable because of the Bill of Rights, which prevents the courts interfering with parliamentary process. He says that argument is a complete misunderstanding of the Bill of Rights, which was about protecting the rights of parliamentarians. As MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse points out, in his written submission to the supreme court (pdf), O\u2019Neill says the government was responsible for the leak that revealed Boris Johnson had called David Cameron a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in a line in a document originally retracted. O\u2019Neill also claims that the leak highlights Johnson\u2019s willingness to abuse power. O\u2019Neill said it would not be acceptable to have a situation where prorogation can be used for improper purposes. The length of the prorogation is not the issue, he says. What matters is its purpose. O\u2019Neill says the supreme court must intervene to rebalance the constitution. Earlier O\u2019Neill said the documents submitted by the government to the court - the memo to the prime minister on prorogation, dated 15 August, and the PM\u2019s handwritten response of the next day \u2013 showed that \u201cthe true dominant purpose of prorogation was, as the inner house [the senior part of Scotland\u2019s court of session], correctly observed, to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the executive regarding Brexit\u201d. He added: Lying (albeit wholly unconvincingly) about the true reasons for exercising the prorogation power in the manner, at the time and for the period it has been exercised in this case, calls into question the lawfulness of the executive\u2019s action. O\u2019Neill says the court should not treat the documents submitted to the court by the government about the reasons for prorogation as \u201cgospel\u201d or the \u201ccomplete truth\u201d. He also suggests that the document may have been written to provide \u201ccover\u201d, in the knowledge that a court might demand to see it. Lord Reed says he is \u201clooking sceptical about that suggestion\u201d. O\u2019Neill replies: There is no reason to look sceptical. You can look upset. The fact is: read the documentation, and it says: \u2018We know this will potentially cause us a challenge.\u2019 We have no affidavit that says this is true and complete. An affidavit would say this is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. One might not think that a government would engage solely in high politics as opposed to low, dishonest, dirty tricks. But I\u2019m not sure we can assume that of this government, given the attitude that has been taken publicly by its advisers and by the prime minister himself to the notion of rule of law. So look perturbed, look upset, but don\u2019t look sceptical. Look at the documentation. At this point O\u2019Neill bangs his hand on the table. O\u2019Neill is now talking about the memo sent to Boris Johnson by Nikki da Costa proposing the long prorogation. (Some of the text is here.) And he refers to Boris Johnson\u2019s reply. Johnson backed the plan, writing: 1. The whole September session is a rigmarole introduced by girly swot Cameron to show the public that MPs were earning their crust 2. So I don\u2019t see anything especially shocking about this prorogation 3. As Nikki notes, it is OVER THE CONFERENCE SEASON so that the sitting days lost are actually very few. O\u2019Neill says he cannot understand why the words \u201cby girly swot Cameron\u201d were redacted in the documents originally released to the court. He suggests there was no valid reason for this. O\u2019Neill is now talking about the government\u2019s failure to provide a witness statement. He cites the judgment in Das v home secretary. This is included in the Cherry team\u2019s legal submission (pdf). The Das judgment said: Where a secretary of state fails to put before the court witness statements to explain the decision-making process and the reasoning underlying a decision they take a substantial risk. In general litigation where a party elects not to call available witnesses to give evidence on a relevant matter, the court may draw inferences of fact against that party \u2026 The basis for drawing adverse inferences of fact against the secretary of state in judicial review proceedings will be particularly strong, because in such proceedings the secretary of state is subject to the stringent and well-known obligation owed to the court by a public authority facing a challenge to its decision, [in the words of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in Belize Alliance of Conservation Non-Governmental Organisations v Department of the Environment [2004] Env LR 761 [para 86] \u2018to cooperate and to make candid disclosure, by way of affidavit, of the relevant facts and (so far as they are not apparent from contemporaneous documents which have been disclosed) the reasoning behind the decision challenged in the judicial review proceedings\u2019. O\u2019Neill says there was a \u201ccunning\u201d change in what the government decided to do. Instead of proroguing parliament over 31 October, it decided to prorogue parliament earlier. He says the decision to prorogue parliament between 9 September and 14 October fits with the government seeking the longest possible prorogation consistent with the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, which included requirements for the government to report to parliament on developments in Northern Ireland. Here is O\u2019Neill on why the PM\u2019s lengthy prorogation of parliament was so serious. It appears that the prime minister\u2019s actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on our country. That fundamentally alters the balance of our constitution because it is using the power to allow the executive to govern ... at this crucial time and all without the proper constitutional accountability. O\u2019Neill says what matters is the principle of the PM being allowed to prorogue parliament in this way. The amount of time lost is not relevant. The government has argued that only seven days were lost to MPs. But O\u2019Neill says the Benn bill, designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, was passed in just three days. That shows how much might be achieved in seven days. Here is the lawyer and legal blogger Adam Wagner on what O\u2019Neill is up to. O\u2019Neill refers to the Sandiford case. This was a case where the supreme court rejected a challenge to the government\u2019s refusal to use prerogative powers to fund the legal costs to defend a British woman facing the death penalty in Indonesia on drugs charges. He says this was not the court\u2019s finest hour. Lady Hale says O\u2019Neill knows how to make friends. Sandiford is relevant to this case because it is about prerogative powers. As the legal submission from Joanna Cherry\u2019s team (pdf) explains, the court of appeal ruled in Sandiford that in some circumstances prerogative decisions are justiciable. The submission says: The court of appeal held that, although the Foreign Office\u2019s discretion as to exercise of its prerogative powers in such a case was \u2018a very wide one\u2019 and although \u2018the court cannot enter the forbidden areas, including decisions affecting foreign policy\u2019, there was \u2018no reason why its decision or inaction should not be reviewable if it can be shown that the same were irrational or contrary to legitimate expectation. O\u2019Neill is now turning to the legal issues at stake in the case. He says the term prerogative powers applies to a collection of random powers. He says simply by calling something prerogative, that does not give you any analytical heft. The powers exercised under the prerogative do not have much to do with each other. O\u2019Neill is now talking about Parliament Square, and what the various statues erected there say about history. And he is talking about the buildings too. From the BBC\u2019s Dominic Casciani O\u2019Neill says he will be talking about Scottish law. But he says he wanted to make the point about four nations because this is not a nation state. It is a state of nations. He turns to Macbeth. It is often described as the Scottish play. But it is the British play, written to explain what was happening when a new court, the court of King James (James VI of Scotland, but James I of England), was taking over. Here is the carpet on the floor of the supreme court that O\u2019Neill was referring to. (See 2.15pm.) Before getting into the meat of the legal argument, O\u2019Neill is giving a wonderful speech about history, and emblems. He points out that the decoration on the carpet of the supreme court includes the emblems of all four nations of the UK. It makes a point about how their traditions are combined, he says. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC has started addressing the supreme court. He will be speaking for the next two hours. He is representing Joanna Cherry and the other parliamentarians who took the case to the Scottish court of session, where they successfully argued that prorogation was unlawful. He starts by saying that he is the first lawyer to address the court in this case who does not have a title. We have already heard from Lord Pannick, Lord Keen and Sir James Eadie. O\u2019Neill is a Scot (and a \u201cdouble silk\u201d \u2013 a QC at the English and Scottish bar). He says that one of the advantages of the court of session in Edinburgh is that distance from London gives a sense of perspective. He says political machinations look very different 400 miles away from London. The supreme court has been told that it is \u201cuntenable\u201d to argue that Boris Johnson suspended parliament for five weeks to \u201cstymie\u201d MPs who might want to obstruct Brexit. This was the ruling made by the Scottish court of session. But, addressing the supreme court for the government, Sir James Eadie QC said: Both in the briefing to [Johnson], and in the statements to cabinet, it was absolutely clear that he well understood that parliament was going to have the opportunities that it in fact had. And indeed if he had tried to say that, knowing that parliament was going to come back on 3 September and do what it in fact did, it was entirely predictable, it was either going to be a motion of no confidence or it was going to be legislation. And so the idea that parliament would be deprived of the opportunity to take whatever steps it wished in that run-up, including in relation to the sittings of parliament, is simply untenable. Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the British government to table \u201coperable proposals in writing\u201d to resolve the Brexit deadlock, as he warned that no-deal was a \u201cpalpable\u201d risk. See 9.29am for a summary of his speech. Jeremy Corbyn has been strongly criticised by senior Labour figures after using a Guardian article to suggest he could remain neutral in any referendum on Brexit staged by a future Labour government. The first minister in Wales, Mark Drakeford, whose government is now arguing for the UK to abandon Brexit, said Welsh Labour \u201cmust and will campaign to remain in the EU\u201d in any future referendum. He said: Any type of Brexit \u2013 even the softest possible \u2013 will cause potentially irreparable damage to Wales and its economy. This is because Wales is heavily dependent on manufacturing and agri-food, and 60% of our exports go straight to the EU. We will support all the efforts our colleagues in Westminster are taking to prevent the no-deal Brexit, which the prime minister and the Tory government is hell-bent on pursuing. Alan Johnson, the former Labour home secretary who led the Labour In campaign in 2016, told the World at One the party would get \u201cslaughtered\u201d on the doorstep trying to defend Corbyn\u2019s position. In an interview with Sky News Corbyn repeatedly refused to clarify whether he would back remain or leave in a Brexit referendum he would call as prime minister. He said: My job as prime minister would be to deliver that option that\u2019s chosen by the British people. I will credibly present the options and say: \u2018This is the option, you can remain, possibly with some reforms to the European Union, or you can leave, but you will be leaving on these terms which would protect jobs and living standards and trade.\u2019 Pressed if he would remain neutral in the campaign, Corbyn said: As prime minister I\u2019m offering the people a choice \u2013 the only party that\u2019s doing so. The parent of a sick child claimed the NHS was being destroyed as he challenged Boris Johnson during a hospital visit. As the Press Association reports, Johnson was confronted by the angry parent, who claimed there were not enough doctors and nurses. In a conversation lasting around two minutes, the man said the situation was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. Johnson was visiting Whipps Cross university hospital in north-east London when he was challenged by the parent on a children\u2019s ward. The parent said the situation was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and told the prime minister: There are not enough people on this ward, there are not enough doctors, there\u2019s not enough nurses, it\u2019s not well organised enough. The NHS has been destroyed \u2026 and now you come here for a press opportunity.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cThere\u2019s no press here\u201d but the parent gestured to cameras filming the confrontation, and said: \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s no press here, who are these people?\u201d Poland\u2019s ambassador to the UK has written to 800,000 Poles advising them to \u201cseriously consider\u201d returning home and expressed concern about the application process for getting settled status in the UK after Brexit. A government minister has refused to confirm whether the new domestic abuse bill would ban the cross-examination of victims by alleged perpetrators in court, a key provision of the original bill, which stalled due to the prorogation of parliament. Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott\u2019s story about this morning\u2019s hearing. This is from the barrister and QC Matthew Ryder. Nicola Sturgeon has accused anti-independence campaigners of cowardice as she marked the fifth anniversary of the 2014 independence referendum with a trip to Berlin to promote Scotland\u2019s case for EU membership. The pro-UK campaign Scotland in Union boasted last night that its new Survation poll had found 59% of voters (excluding don\u2019t knows) would choose no in a second referendum, as both sides marked five years since the first vote on 18 September 2014. In that referendum, the no side won with 55.3% against 44.7% for yes. The Survation figure, based on a leading question which asked \u201cshould Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?\u201d, is an outlier. The latest polls put the yes/no divide at nearer 50:50. The first minister tweeted that if unionists really believed they would win, why not support her calls for a referendum next year. Sturgeon is preparing for a concerted push for a second vote, hoping the Brexit crisis will push the yes vote well above 50%. Her government has put draft legislation to Holyrood setting the ground rules for future referendums and earlier this month she indicated she would ask the UK government in December for the legal powers to stage an independence poll. This and the Brexit crisis will be the dominant themes at Scottish National party conference in October. Sturgeon is likely to double down there on her demands for a second independence vote next year; if Labour beats the Conservatives in a snap election, Corbyn may just grant her one, in exchange for SNP backing at Westminster. Sir James Eadie QC has finished. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, who represents Joanna Cherry and others who took the government to court in Scotland, goes next. He says he wants to make two points now. He will start making his main presentation after lunch. On \u201crelief\u201d (see 12.57pm), he says he would like to be consulted. And he says in Scotland ministers do give witness statements in cases like this. He refers to a case about prisoners slopping out, and another on public procurement. He says it was Boris Johnson who took the decision. He says a witness statement could mean the PM having to tell the truth, and the whole truth, under oath. And that\u2019s it for now. The court has adjourned until 2pm. Eadie says he wants to get something in writing as to what might be done in terms of \u201crelief\u201d (ie, what the government would have to do if the court found against it). He says the options available to the government would depend on the reasoning of the court. He says the government will make a suggestion in writing, if that is not inconvenient. Lady Hale, the president of the court, says it will be inconvenient if the court does not have it by tomorrow afternoon. Eadie says he wants to provide it overnight. Lord Reed says the issue of \u201crelief\u201d is a very difficult question. Any help Eadie can give the court as to what the options are would be appreciated, he says. Lord Kerr asks if it is accepted that there was a political advantage to the government from having a five-week prorogation. Eadie says he cannot answer that. But he says there is an advantage to the government from having a \u201cclear space\u201d ahead of the Queen\u2019s speech.] Q: But what about the argument that this reduced scrutiny by MPs. Eadie refers the judge to what is said in the government documents about the reasons for prorogation. The judge says those documents may not tell the whole story. Eadie says his case is that, even if there was a political advantage, that was not improper. Eadie says the government has, exceptionally, provided a cabinet minute explaining the prorogation decision. Lord Wilson points out that they do not have a witness statement (saying that the prorogation was not intended to limit the opportunities for MPs to frustrate Brexit). Eadie accepts the court does not have a witness statement of the kind it would accept. But he says the other documentation sets out the government\u2019s position. Another judge asks about the suggestion that the PM should have signed an affidavit, and submitted himself to cross-examination. Eadie says he has never encountered a case where that happened. He has never been involved in a judicial review where the minister involved gave a witness statement. Q: What about the cabinet secretary giving a witness statement and submitting to cross-examination? Eadie says, if that request had been made, it would have been resisted with fury. He says the suggestion that the PM was operating in a way designed to \u201cstymie\u201d parliament was untenable. He says the documents submitted by the government showed that the PM anticipated MPs being able to pass Brexit legislation in September, as they went on to do. Eadie says claim that PM prorogued parliament to \u201cstymie\u201d parliament is \u201cuntenable\u201d. \u201cStymie\u201d is the word used in the judgment from the Scottish court of session. Eadie says he now wants to turn to some issues that he summarises under the heading \u201clawful in any event\u201d. He says parliament has been considering Brexit for many months. And it passed the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act, which contained provisions to ensure that parliament did sit periodically during the autumn. Eadie addresses the question of whether the executive might want a very long prorogation. (See 11.12am.) He says this prorogation only lasts for five weeks. But, in any event, if a government tried to prorogue parliament for a long period of time, it would run into other problems, he says. For example, it needs parliament to approve spending decisions. He refers to paragraph 92 of the government submission (pdf) which says: There are, in any event, for the reasons given by Dicey (pp.297-299) real practical impediments to the government proroguing parliament in the extreme circumstances relied on by the appellant. These include the fact that authorisation to appropriate money from the consolidated fund, to charge income and corporation tax, and to maintain discipline over the armed forces must be authorised by parliament annually. No government could in practice continue in office without parliament sitting regularly. And he also refers to paragraph 76, which also includes these two quotes from The Law of the Constitution, the seminal work by AV Dicey. Dicey wrote: Suppose that parliament were for more than a year not summoned for the despatch of business. This would be a course of proceeding of the most unconstitutional character. Yet there is no court in the land before which one could go with the complaint that parliament had not been assembled ... No rule is better established than that parliament must assemble at least once a year. This maxim, as before pointed out, is certainly not derived from the common law, and is not based upon any statutory enactment. Now suppose that parliament were prorogued once and again for more than a year, so that for two years no parliament sat at Westminster. Here we have a distinct breach of a constitutional practice or understanding, but we have no violation of law. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. This assumption from Number 10 as to how the case may unfold seems highly plausible. In fact, I was speculating along these lines BTL just a couple of hours ago. This was in response to a question from Shoobedydedoop about whether the supreme court\u2019s decision might end up being equivocal. Eadie says even Lord Pannick, who represents Gina Miller, accepts that it can be legitimate for the executive to obtain political advantage from prorogation. If this is the case, how can a court decide what level of political advantage is acceptable, and what level is not. He refers again to the judgment from the English high court (pdf), which he wants the supreme court to uphold. He refers to paragraph 55 which says: Prorogation has been used by the government to gain a legislative and so political advantage. One of the most notable examples of that was its use to facilitate the speedy passage of what became the Parliament Act 1949. Under section 2 of the Parliament Act 1911 a non-money bill could only be enacted without the consent of the House of Lords if it was passed in three successive sessions by the House of Commons. In order to procure the speedy enactment of the 1949 Act the government arranged for a session of minimal length in 1948. Parliament was prorogued on 13 September 1948 to the following day. Following the passage of the parliament bill by the House of Commons, it was then prorogued again on 25 October 1948. Accordingly, even if the prorogation under consideration in the present case was, as the claimant and the interveners contend, designed to advance the government\u2019s political agenda regarding withdrawal from the European Union rather than preparations for the Queen\u2019s speech, that is not territory in which a court can enter with judicial review. (This reference rather supports David Allen Green\u2019s analysis. See 11.59am.) This is from the FT\u2019s legal commentator, David Allen Green. Eadie asks how a court could be expected to judge what length of prorogation might be reasonable or unreasonable. He cites approvingly paragraph 54 of the English high court judgment (pdf) on this. It says: All of these arguments face the insuperable difficulty that it is impossible for the court to make a legal assessment of whether the duration of the prorogation was excessive by reference to any measure. There is no legal measure of the length of time between parliamentary sessions. There is not even a constitutional convention which governs the matter, albeit that constitutional conventions are not justiciable: see Miller No 1 at [136] and following. The skeleton argument for the prime minister notes that there have been a number of occasions in modern times during which parliament was prorogued for a lengthy period. It was, for example, prorogued on 1 August 1930 until 28 October 1930; on 18 September 1914 until 27 October 1914 and then further prorogued until 11 November 1914; and on 17 August 1901 until 5 November 1901. From the Daily Telegraph\u2019s political editor, Gordon Rayner A judge asks Eadie if he accepts that five Brexit bills have fallen as a result of the decision to prorogue parliament. Eadie says he does not have a complete answer on this. But his main point is that, if parliament needs to pass these bills in a hurry, it can act accordingly. Eadie is now on to his final reason as to why a decision to prorogue parliament should be seen as a non-justiciable matter. He says this is not a matter of individual rights, as in some other legal cases relating to prerogative powers. He says any decision to prorogue will reduce the time available for debate in parliament. He says Lord Pannick is not criticising the right of the government to prorogue parliament in all circumstances. He is just objecting to how the decision was taken in this case. He says this means Pannick cannot object to the consequences of prorogation, on improper motive grounds, if he is not objecting to the fact of prorogation. A judge asks if it is the government\u2019s position that the Queen has the discretion to refuse a request from the prime minister to prorogue parliament. Eadie refers to comments from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons. This was cited yesterday. Rees-Mogg told the BBC that the Queen had no option but to do what the PM requested. Eadie says he is not making submissions on this point. When pressed, he says there is some uncertainty as to quite what the Queen\u2019s powers are in this case. The government says more on this in its submission (pdf), at paragraph 35. It says: Contrary to the suggestion at \u00a78 of the appellant\u2019s written case, it is not (and never has been) asserted that Her Majesty enjoys no personal prerogative in this context or that she is obliged to accept the advice of the prime minister. However, this is not an issue which arises for determination on the present appeal. Nor is it a matter for the court. Whether Her Majesty enjoys a personal prerogative in any particular case is a question of constitutional convention, not law. For the reasons given below, the courts have no jurisdiction to determine the scope of, or to enforce constitutional conventions. Eadie is now making other arguments as to why a decision to prorogue parliament should be seen as a non-justiciable matter. He says prorogation is a decision about the business of parliament, when it sits. And he says prorogation is also very similar to dissolution \u2013 a decision that is non-justiciable. (Prorogation is what happens when parliament gets suspended before a new Queen\u2019s speech. It normally happens once a year. Dissolution is what happens when parliament gets suspended before a general election. In theory that should only happen every five years.) Here is the passage from the government\u2019s submission giving other examples of prorogation being used for political purposes. This is the paragraph Eadie referred to a moment ago. The history of the power to prorogue parliament supports the fact that it has been used for political purposes, including for the purpose of restricting the time otherwise available to debate legislation, and for prolonged periods, including at moments of political importance and when the government of the day lacked a majority in the House of Commons: (1) On 18 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the first world war, parliament was prorogued until 27 October, with the King\u2019s speech on prorogation noting that the circumstances \u201ccall for action not speech\u201d. On 16 October 1914, parliament was further prorogued by proclamation until 11 November 1914. In total, parliament was prorogued for a period of 53 calendar days during wartime. (2) On 1 August 1930, parliament was prorogued until 28 October, a period of 87 days. This was during the onset of the great depression following the 1929 Wall Street Crash and when the then government of James Ramsay MacDonald did not command a majority in the House of Commons. (3) Under s.2 of the Parliament Act 1911 as enacted, a non-money bill could only be enacted without the consent of the Lords if it was passed in three successive sessions by the Commons. As noted below, each session of parliament conventionally lasts for approximately a year. To facilitate the speedy passage of the Parliament Act 1949, the government arranged for a session of minimal length in 1948. Parliament was prorogued on 13 September 1948 to the following day. Following the passage of the parliament bill by the Commons, it was then prorogued again on 25 October 1948. The King\u2019s speech which closed the session expressly noted that \u201cThe two houses have again failed to agree on the bill to amend the Parliament Act, 1911.\u201d Eadie says a decision to prorogue parliament is \u201cfundamentally political\u201d. He says the government has given examples, in paragraph 71 of its submission (pdf). Lord Wilson asks if the court is being asked to intervene in a political decision, or to decide if it clashes with a precious legal principle. Eadie says sometimes precious principles of public law need to give way when the prerogative is being exercised. Q [From Wilson]: I was thinking of a bigger purpose. If anyone is well placed to defend parliamentary sovereignty, it is us here. Does the use of the prerogative here collide with a principle that we are obliged to uphold? Eadie says of course parliamentary sovereignty is important. But it depends on what it means. \u201cParadigmatically\u201d it can make and unmake its own laws, he says. He says he will argue that the phrase \u201cparliamentary sovereignty\u201d should not be too widely bandied about without people saying what it means. Lord Kerr asks what would happen if a PM did want to stifle debate. If he decided to prorogue for one year, would that be appropriate? Eadie says this was the question Lord Pannick raised yesterday. He says he will come back to this. But part of the answer is to remind the court of what the Canadian supreme court said about how you should be very careful about testing principles against extreme cases. Kerr says this is not an unreasonable question. Eadie says there are political controls in place. Ultimately it is for parliament to exercise controls The lawyer and legal commentator Schona Jolly thinks the Lord Kerr questioning (see 10.55am) was significant. Lord Kerr asks Eadie if he accepts that it is up to the court to decide the limits of prerogative powers. Eadie says he does. Q [From Kerr]: And do you accept that prerogative powers can be limited by fundamental rights? Eadie does accept that. He says it is for the court to decide all sorts of issues relating to the prerogative, including its limits. Q [From Kerr]: Do you accept that the exercise of the prerogative to prorogue parliament can limit the ability of parliament to scrutinise the effective? Eadie says prorogation \u201chas the effects that it has\u201d. But he would argue this is a \u201cwell-established constitutional function\u201d, exercised and to be exercised by the executive. My submission will be that, despite those features, this is a well-established constitutional function, exercisable and to be exercised by the executive ... [The issue is] whether it is appropriate for those controls to be exercised by the courts as opposed to ... parliament. My submission is that these are political judgments. He says he wants to analyse whether it is possible to apply standards to the way prorogation is used, and whether it is proper for the courts to intervene. Q [From Kerr]: So you do not accept the argument that the prorogation in this case went beyond the proper use of this power. Eadie says he does not accept that. He says it was a political judgment. Eadie cites approvingly paragraph 47 in the judgment (pdf) from the high court in London, which ruled that the prorogation decision was non-justiciable. He says he particularly recommends the second sentence (which I\u2019ve marked in bold). Almost all important decisions made by the executive have a political hue to them. In the present context of non-justiciability, the essential characteristic of a \u201cpolitical\u201d issue is the absence of judicial or legal standards by which to assess the legality of the executive\u2019s decision or action. That is reflected in the last sentence of the passage from Lord Bingham\u2019s speech in A v Secretary of State just quoted. It was stated more directly in the joint judgment of Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge in Shergill v Khaira [2015] AC 359 at [40]: \u201cThe issue was non-justiciable because it was political. It was political for two reasons. One was that it trespassed on the proper province of the executive, as the organ of the state charged with the conduct of foreign relations. The lack of judicial or manageable standards was the other reason why it was political.\u201d Lady Hale, the president of the court, intervenes. She says her computer isn\u2019t working. So, she tells Eadie, if he starts citing documents, she may be in trouble. From the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg Eadie is running through some of the cases cited in the government\u2019s written submission (pdf) about how certain decisions are not justiciable. He has just quoted from a judgment by Lord Bingham cited in paragraph 66. Bingham wrote. It would no doubt be possible, in theory at least, to devise a constitution in which all political contingencies would be the subject of predetermined mechanistic rules to be applied as and when the particular contingency arose. But such an approach would not be consistent with ordinary constitutional practice in Britain. Sir James Eadie QC has started making his case. He will be running through arguments set out in the government\u2019s written submission (pdf). Sir James Eadie, who is representing the government, is addressing the court this morning. He will be arguing that the courts do not have the right to rule the suspension (prorogation) of parliament unlawful because Boris Johnson was using a prerogative power that is not justiciable (subject to adjudication by the courts). Turning back to the European parliament for a moment, here is the text of the Brexit motion that MEPs will be voting on. And here is an extract from what it says about a no-deal Brexit. The European parliament ... Notes that there can be no transition period in the absence of the withdrawal agreement nor any \u2018mini-deals\u2019 put in place to help mitigate the disruption of a disorderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU; Stresses that further negotiations between the EU and the UK after the UK has withdrawn from the EU without a deal can only take place on condition that the UK honours its obligations and commitments in respect of citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Good Friday agreement in all its parts; Notes that in the case of a \u2018no-deal exit\u2019, the UK\u2019s financial and other obligations will still exist; affirms that in such a case it will refuse to give consent to any agreement or agreements between the EU and the UK unless and until the UK honours its commitments; Recalls that, once such commitments are met, future EU-UK relations negotiations will require strong safeguards and level playing field provisions with a view to safeguarding the EU\u2019s internal market and avoiding placing EU firms at a potential unfair competitive disadvantage; reiterates in that respect the conditions set out in its resolution of 14 March 2018 not least as regards ensuring high levels of environmental, employment and consumer protection; notes that any free trade agreement that fails to respect such levels of protection would not be ratified by the European parliament. I posted a version of this yesterday. But I will use it again, because it contains links that you may find useful if you are following the supreme court hearing in detail. Judgments from the lower courts Courts in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already ruled on prorogation and Brexit. Last week the Scottish court of session ruled that prorogation was unlawful. What is really at issue today is whether the supreme court backs this decision or overturns it. Here is a summary of the Scottish judgment. And here is the 68-page full judgment (pdf). But the high court in London rejected a very similar claim, on the grounds that prorogation was a political matter and that it was not for the courts to decide whether or not it was proper. Here is a summary of that high court judgment (pdf). And here is the full judgment (pdf). On Thursday, the high court in Belfast also found in favour of the government, but on a challenge claiming a no-deal Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement. You can read that judgment here (pdf), but it is not central to the supreme court case. Timetable Here is the timetable for hearings on the court sittings page on the supreme court\u2019s website. Written submissions The supreme court has also published the written submissions from the parties. Here is the 25-page one from Gina Miller (pdf). Here is the 93-page one from Joanna Cherry (pdf). Here is the 46-page one for the prime minister and the advocate general for Scotland (pdf). And here are some more extracts from what Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told MEPs in his speech. Some of the extracts I have translated using DeepL. Barnier said that, even if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, the problems at the heart of the Brexit talks would still have to be addressed. He said: We want this agreement to protect the rights of the 4.5 million European citizens in the United Kingdom and British people in the 27 member states. We want to secure the future for all project leaders who benefit from European funds in the territories. That is why we have decided with the United Kingdom that everything that was decided at 28 should be well paid, to the end, at 28. We want to ensure peace and stability in Ireland. And at the end of the day, we want to create the conditions of trust necessary to build our future relationship, as outlined in the political declaration. If the United Kingdom leaves without agreement, all these issues will not disappear. We will have to resolve them in any event, prior to a future partnership with the United Kingdom. He said the EU\u2019s commitment to the backstop was \u201cnot ideological\u201d but \u201ctotally pragmatic\u201d. He said it was designed to achieve three things. We do not want a physical border to return to the island of Ireland. We want to protect the Good Friday agreement in all its dimensions. We must preserve the integrity of the single market. We want to maintain the \u201call-island economy\u201d and North-South cooperation provided for in the Good Friday agreement. Our mapping exercise with the British authorities shows how much this north-south cooperation is governed by law, supported by European policies and budgets from the beginning. He said that UK government had said what it did not like about the backstop, but that that on its own was not enough. The EU needed \u201clegally operational solution\u201d, he said. He urged people not to underestimate the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. He said: I would recommend nobody underestimates the consequences of no-deal for UK first and foremost, but for us as well ... The consequences of Brexit are not theoretical. They are considerable. The European commission has just released the texts of the speeches by Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier. They are in the original French. English versions should be available later. Here is a fuller account of what Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told the European parliament in his speech earlier. (See 8.17am.) Juncker said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was palpable. He said that there was \u201cvery little time remaining\u201d and that he was not sure the UK and the EU could reach a deal. Referring to his meeting with Boris Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday, he said: The prime minister assured us that he continues to want an agreement. But, whatever happens, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on 31 October with or without an agreement. That is why the risk of a no deal is palpable ... The commission is prepared to work day in day out, morning until night - with a few breaks - to try to find the technical and political solutions we need but I am not sure that we will get there. There is very little time remaining but what I do know is that we have to keep trying. He said whether or not there was a deal would come down to decisions taken by the UK. He confirmed that he was open to an alternative to the backstop. But he said that no real progress had been made in the talks with the UK, because they had not tabled an alternative plan. He said: I said to to Prime Minister Johnson that I had no emotional attachment the safety net, to the backstop, but I stated that I stand by the objectives that it is designed to achieve. That is why I called on the prime minister to come forward with operational proposals, in writing, for practical steps which would allow us to achieve those objectives. Now, until such time as those proposals have been presented, I will not be able to tell you, looking your straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved. But he also described his talks with Johnson as \u201cin part positive\u201d. He said: What I can tell you [about the lunch with Johnson] is - and this perhaps runs counter to many press articles that have appeared in the UK - I can tell you that the talks we had were friendly, constructive and in part positive. He signalled that the EU would not abandon Ireland as the talks continued. He said: The EU has shown great unity of purpose, with solidarity with the member states most affected. This unity is our most precious resource and our greatest asset. It will continue to guide me over the next weeks and I\u2019m sure it will continue to guide this house also in the future. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking in the debate now. He says Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s \u201cemollient\u201d tone suggests the UK and the EU are \u201cvery close\u201d to agreeing a deal at next month\u2019s EU summit. But, even without the backstop, this is a very bad deal, he says. He says the UK cannot now rely on the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the EU. That was illustrated by the behaviour of the \u201cpipsqueak prime minister of Luxembourg\u201d, he says. He says Xavier Bettel, the PM of Luxembourg, set out to \u201chumiliate\u201d Boris Johnson on Monday. And yet Xavier was \u201cgreeted like a hero\u201d when he visited President Macron in Paris the following day, Farage says. He says the only solution is a clean-break Brexit. Then the two sides can have a grown-up conversation about the future, he says. The only way forward now is to deliver on the referendum is for a clean break Brexit. Once we have done that we will have a grown-up conversation about trade and about the way forward. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. The European parliament debate was opened by the Finnish European affairs minister Tytti Tuppurainen. She was there to represent the European council, because Finland holds the EU presidency. She said the EU was facing a \u201crather bleak situation\u201d. She went on: In July the UK got a new government and a new prime minister. Unfortunately it is increasingly clear that it has not helped to clarify the situation or the UK\u2019s negotiating position. When it comes to the most difficult questions - such as the Irish border - the UK has not tabled any new concrete proposals yet. She said the UK parliament remained divided and the UK government was still insisting on its negotiating red lines. We are faced with more, rather than less, uncertainty. And she also said a no-deal Brexit remained \u201ca quite likely outcome\u201d. Geoffrey Van Orden, the leader of the British Conservatives in the European parliament and a member of the European Conservatives and Reformist Group, is speaking now. He says the UK government wants a deal, but it must leave on 31 October. He criticises the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, which is headed by Guy Verhofstadt. He says it is not representative of the parliament. Marco Zanni, the Italian League MEP leader of the far-right Identity and Democracy group in the European parliament, defends Brexit. He says the EU should respect the decision taken by Britain, which has one of the oldest democratic parliaments in the world. Philippe Lamberts, co-leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance in the European parliament, told MEPs that if the UK requested a Brexit extension, the EU should be willing to grant it. Guy Verhofstadt, from the liberal Renew group in the European parliament, says Brexit has led to support for the EU going up. He criticises the way the UK is handling the rights of EU nationals in Britain. There are examples of EU nationals being refused settled status even though they have been living in the country for one or two decades. He says Boris Johnson likes to compare himself to movie characters, like the Incredible Hulk. But he should choose another role model, Verhofstadt says. He says Johnson should act like the nanny in Mrs Doubtfire. He says he knows the British worry about the backstop. But if they don\u2019t like it, perhaps they should give it a different name - like the safety net. He says it would not work if one side could leave unilaterally. He says some in the UK think that the EU will back down at the last moment. But that We are not stupid. It means we will not kill our own companies. We will defend our own companies ... We will never accept what people call a Singapore by the North Sea. Verhofstadt says that Brexit has caused deep divisions in the UK. But the EU will not let itself be divided in the same way, he says. In the debate Iratxe Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, the head of the socialist group in the European parliament, said that MEPs would be open to the UK holding a second referendum. And she criticised the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, for saying that free movement would end immediately after 31 October. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament, said in his speech that Brexiters claimed that Brexit would weaken the EU. But three years on, the EU remains strong, he said. He said it was the UK that was losing out, because jobs were leaving. This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Nikos Chrysoloras. Barnier says no one should underestimate the costs of a no-deal Brexit. He says he wants to create the conditions necessary to build a future relationship. If the UK leaves without a deal, these questions do not disappear. They still remain - issues like peace in Ireland, citizens\u2019 rights, budgetary issues. They would all need to be settled before the UK and the EU could agree a future relationship. He says, three years after the EU referendum, we should not be \u201cpretending to negotiate\u201d. We need to move forward, he says. Turning to the future relationship, Barnier says the political declaration opens up a path towards a future relationship of broad cooperation. He says it currently points towards a free trade agreement. But the text would also allow a closer relationship, he says. He says the UK wishes to revist the commitments made by Theresa May about maintaining a level playing field after Brexit (ie, remaining aligned to EU regulations.) Barnier says the level of ambition reached by the EU will depend on the guarantees it gets from the UK, referring to things like social, environmental and competition law. Barnier says the EU is willing to work \u201cday and night\u201d to get a deal with the UK. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking in the debate now. He says Ireland is the big problem in the Brexit talks, because that is where Brexit could do most harm. He says the UK has said what it does not like about the backstop. But is has not proposed an operable alternative. He gives an example of the problem. Any cattle, or other animals, entering Ireland through Northern Ireland enter the whole of the EU single market. He says the EU has a long memory of potential safety problem (a reference to BSE, presumably). That is why health checks are so important. Good morning. It is day two of the supreme court hearing to decide if Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension (prorogation) of parliament was lawful, and I\u2019ll be covering the hearing in detail when it starts at 10.30am. Here is our overnight story about yesterday\u2019s hearing. The UK parliament is not sitting at the moment, but the European parliament is and this morning it has just started a debate on Brexit. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has just finished his speech. He said that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was \u201cpalpable\u201d but that his talks with Boris Johnson on Monday were constructive. He said: I can tell you that the talks we had were friendly, constructive and, in part, positive. I will post more from his speech soon. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on the supreme court hearing. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>It was a joy to read Polly Toynbee\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/16/jo-swinson-liberal-democrats-remain-extremism-labour-opportunity-brexit\" title=\"\">Swinson\u2019s move to revoke hands Labour a golden opportunity</a>, Journal, 17 September). With the Lib Dems and Tories adopting extreme Brexit positions, Labour is indeed the \u201cthoughtful\u201d party. Some of us have known this all along. Jeremy Corbyn has been the only one to recognise that the only way to chart a course for a steadier future is to bring our people together. The temptation of these populist times is to serve up simple soundbites when what the nation needs is a lasting, credible settlement.</p> <p>The unanimous joint trade union position (the Tulo group, representing some 4 million workers) offers this. Labour would negotiate the best possible deal and then put it to the people for a vote on the deal versus remain. If that deal is the best for the people, then let it stand on its merits \u2013 let the voters speak. This is surely the only way to ensure that both leavers and remainers have a stake in the vote.</p> <p>Polly, you cannot have it both ways, praising Labour for following the responsible road to unity, and then denouncing its stance as \u201cabsurd\u201d. On the contrary, it is the grownup thing to do in these divided, uncertain times. It deserves the wholehearted support not just of our movement but of democrats everywhere.<br><strong>Len McCluskey</strong><br><em>General secretary, Unite the Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was impressed with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s column (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/labour-final-say-brexit-boris-johnson-britain-eu\" title=\"\">Only Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit</a>, Journal, 18 September), and maybe his party\u2019s tortured Brexit policy is now bearing fruit. For so long it has been unclear what Labour\u2019s strategy was, but at last we can see the wood for the trees. Although, it has been a masterclass of equivocation and misleading messages.</p> <p>He is right to wait until no deal is off the table for a general election and then renegotiate, and finally present his deal to the ultimate beneficiaries in a referendum. Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems have made a serious error in their latest approach, and this may come back to bite them because they have always been so resolute about the necessity for a people\u2019s vote.<br><strong>Judith </strong><strong>Daniels</strong><br><em>Great Yarmouth, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Corbyn will never become prime minister if he fails to be re-elected as MP. I am standing against him to defeat his so-called sensible position, because it is in direct contrast to the huge support for remain among Islington North voters. They voted 78.4% for remain in 2016 \u2013 the fourth-highest remain vote in the country.</p> <p>In 2017 these voters gave him the benefit of the doubt on Brexit, but since then he has continued to take them for granted. As a result, the people of Islington North increasingly see his position on Brexit as frustrating, not sensible. They have been let down for too long and have had enough. We saw this when the Liberal Democrats swept in to beat Labour and win Islington with a clear \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message in the EU elections earlier this year.</p> <p>In failing to accept that the best deal is to remain and only begrudgingly backing a people\u2019s vote, he is again set for a massive upset. Unless he starts to listen to his local voters and back remain wholeheartedly, after the next election he may just find himself spending more time on his allotment. Part of me wonders if, deep down, he wouldn\u2019t really mind.<br><strong>Nick Wakeling</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat prospective MP candidate for Islington North</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tom Watson (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/tom-watson-to-break-labours-uneasy-truce-over-brexit\" title=\"\">Back remain to attract lost Labour voters, says Watson</a>, 11 September), and others who share his view (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/nick-brown-joins-senior-labour-figures-vowing-back-remain\" title=\"\">Chief whip joins calls for party to back remain</a>, 14 September), seem not to grasp the electoral arithmetic. Of course Labour\u2019s strategy has lost remain votes to the Lib Dems, as well as leave votes to the Tories and the Brexit party. But many of the lost remain votes don\u2019t matter: they are in seats like Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, which Labour will win anyway; or in constituencies like North Cornwall, which Labour will never win \u2013 and losing votes to the Lib Dems in North Cornwall will have the added benefit of helping unseat a Tory. By contrast, losing more leave votes to the Tories, or to the Brexit party, endangers Labour\u2019s hold on dozens of its marginal seats, and reduces its chances of winning in dozens more marginals held by Tories, especially where the Lib Dems are a distant third. If you want to remove this (or any future) Tory government, you have to vote intelligently, constituency by constituency, and Watson is allowing his ideological preferences to muddy the necessary calculations.<br><strong>Jon Griffith</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is all very well for Jeremy Corbyn to say he would let the people decide on Brexit, but which people? Will he agree that this time around those of us very directly affected, European citizens in Britain and British citizens on the continent, will also get a vote, or do we have to sit back again while others decide our fate?<br><strong>Marianne Gemmeke</strong><br><em>Eastleigh, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Labour neutrality in any public vote on Brexit will guarantee that Brexit will succeed \u2013 which is, no doubt, what Jeremy Corbyn has wanted all along.<br><strong>David Melvin</strong><br><em>Mossley, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Maybe we are nearly all partly right \u2013 Labour, Lib Dem, Green et al, including some honest Tories. Maybe the mistake is the notion that a non-binary problem can be solved by a binary vote. However, as Pliny the Younger pointed out in 105AD, in a multi-option debate, if there is no majority for any one thing, there is a majority against every single thing.</p> <p>So, on complex issues, votes in parliament, referendums, party conferences etc should be multi-optional and, ideally, preferential.<br><strong>Peter Emerson</strong><br><em>The de Borda Institute</em></p> <p>\u2022 The fourth letter above was amended on 19 September 2019.

      "bodyText": "It was a joy to read Polly Toynbee\u2019s article (Swinson\u2019s move to revoke hands Labour a golden opportunity, Journal, 17 September). With the Lib Dems and Tories adopting extreme Brexit positions, Labour is indeed the \u201cthoughtful\u201d party. Some of us have known this all along. Jeremy Corbyn has been the only one to recognise that the only way to chart a course for a steadier future is to bring our people together. The temptation of these populist times is to serve up simple soundbites when what the nation needs is a lasting, credible settlement. The unanimous joint trade union position (the Tulo group, representing some 4 million workers) offers this. Labour would negotiate the best possible deal and then put it to the people for a vote on the deal versus remain. If that deal is the best for the people, then let it stand on its merits \u2013 let the voters speak. This is surely the only way to ensure that both leavers and remainers have a stake in the vote. Polly, you cannot have it both ways, praising Labour for following the responsible road to unity, and then denouncing its stance as \u201cabsurd\u201d. On the contrary, it is the grownup thing to do in these divided, uncertain times. It deserves the wholehearted support not just of our movement but of democrats everywhere. Len McCluskey General secretary, Unite the Union \u2022 I was impressed with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s column (Only Labour will give the people a final say on Brexit, Journal, 18 September), and maybe his party\u2019s tortured Brexit policy is now bearing fruit. For so long it has been unclear what Labour\u2019s strategy was, but at last we can see the wood for the trees. Although, it has been a masterclass of equivocation and misleading messages. He is right to wait until no deal is off the table for a general election and then renegotiate, and finally present his deal to the ultimate beneficiaries in a referendum. Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems have made a serious error in their latest approach, and this may come back to bite them because they have always been so resolute about the necessity for a people\u2019s vote. Judith Daniels Great Yarmouth, Norfolk \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn will never become prime minister if he fails to be re-elected as MP. I am standing against him to defeat his so-called sensible position, because it is in direct contrast to the huge support for remain among Islington North voters. They voted 78.4% for remain in 2016 \u2013 the fourth-highest remain vote in the country. In 2017 these voters gave him the benefit of the doubt on Brexit, but since then he has continued to take them for granted. As a result, the people of Islington North increasingly see his position on Brexit as frustrating, not sensible. They have been let down for too long and have had enough. We saw this when the Liberal Democrats swept in to beat Labour and win Islington with a clear \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message in the EU elections earlier this year. In failing to accept that the best deal is to remain and only begrudgingly backing a people\u2019s vote, he is again set for a massive upset. Unless he starts to listen to his local voters and back remain wholeheartedly, after the next election he may just find himself spending more time on his allotment. Part of me wonders if, deep down, he wouldn\u2019t really mind. Nick Wakeling Liberal Democrat prospective MP candidate for Islington North \u2022 Tom Watson (Back remain to attract lost Labour voters, says Watson, 11 September), and others who share his view (Chief whip joins calls for party to back remain, 14 September), seem not to grasp the electoral arithmetic. Of course Labour\u2019s strategy has lost remain votes to the Lib Dems, as well as leave votes to the Tories and the Brexit party. But many of the lost remain votes don\u2019t matter: they are in seats like Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, which Labour will win anyway; or in constituencies like North Cornwall, which Labour will never win \u2013 and losing votes to the Lib Dems in North Cornwall will have the added benefit of helping unseat a Tory. By contrast, losing more leave votes to the Tories, or to the Brexit party, endangers Labour\u2019s hold on dozens of its marginal seats, and reduces its chances of winning in dozens more marginals held by Tories, especially where the Lib Dems are a distant third. If you want to remove this (or any future) Tory government, you have to vote intelligently, constituency by constituency, and Watson is allowing his ideological preferences to muddy the necessary calculations. Jon Griffith Hastings, East Sussex \u2022 It is all very well for Jeremy Corbyn to say he would let the people decide on Brexit, but which people? Will he agree that this time around those of us very directly affected, European citizens in Britain and British citizens on the continent, will also get a vote, or do we have to sit back again while others decide our fate? Marianne Gemmeke Eastleigh, Hampshire \u2022 Labour neutrality in any public vote on Brexit will guarantee that Brexit will succeed \u2013 which is, no doubt, what Jeremy Corbyn has wanted all along. David Melvin Mossley, Greater Manchester \u2022 Maybe we are nearly all partly right \u2013 Labour, Lib Dem, Green et al, including some honest Tories. Maybe the mistake is the notion that a non-binary problem can be solved by a binary vote. However, as Pliny the Younger pointed out in 105AD, in a multi-option debate, if there is no majority for any one thing, there is a majority against every single thing. So, on complex issues, votes in parliament, referendums, party conferences etc should be multi-optional and, ideally, preferential. Peter Emerson The de Borda Institute \u2022 The fourth letter above was amended on 19 September 2019. An earlier version referred to Eastbourne where North Cornwall was intended; the letter writer had submitted a corrected version of the letter before it was published, but this was not noticed until after publication.",

While New Labour championed wars abroad and privatisation at home, I could not support the party. I was never a member before and had no reason to join it.</p> <p>\u201cBut with its unambiguous policies on equality, justice and peace it is offering a once in a generation opportunity to be a force for positive change for millions who have been ignored and left behind.</p> <p>\u201cThe huge growth in party membership \u2013 making the Labour party the biggest political party in Europe \u2013 reflects that change and hope. And I\u2019m proud to be part of that and champion it wholeheartedly.\u201d</p> <p>Yaqoob said her campaign would focus on improving public transport, reducing the impact of austerity cuts, bolstering affordable housing, and a bold new green deal.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to the green agenda we need a major transformation. It does not have to be either or,\u201d she said. \u201cUnder the new green deal I am proposing that we are at the forefront of the debate with new green technology and creating new jobs in the sector.</p> <p>\u201cI will use the strategic powers of the mayor to finally deliver for the many, not just the few.\u201d</p> <p>Yaqoob\u2019s nomination is likely to ruffle a few feathers within Birmingham\u2019s local Labour movement. Over the years, the Birmingham city councillor has come under fire from all sides. She has received death threats from extremist Islamist groups for engaging in western political life, and was pressured to apologise after refusing to stand in honour of a soldier injured in Afghanistan. She was also criticised for comments she made about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/july7\">7/7 bombings in London</a>, which she says were taken out of context.</p> <p>Yaqoob, named by Harper\u2019s Bazaar as one of Britain\u2019s most influential women, attributed the criticism to a sustained \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her because of her gender, race and outspoken political commentary.</p> <p>\u201cI have never, and will never, condone the actions of terrorists. There have been many occasions where my actions and comments have been deliberately misinterpreted for political gain by the opposition,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI did not want the war and at the same time I condemn the actions of all terrorists.

She also received overtures from the Labour party. In the run-up to the 2010 general election Yaqoob was offered a choice of two traditional Labour strongholds, in Birmingham and the Black Country. She rejected the bid, saying at the time: \u201cI do not like mainstream politics which do not accurately reflect the concerns of many of the residents of inner-city Birmingham.\u201d But Yaqoob told the Guardian she had now found a home in the mainstream party as she believed it was finally standing for the \u201cvalues it was created to uphold\u201d. She added: \u201cI have stood for those values all my political life \u2013 equality, justice and peace. While New Labour championed wars abroad and privatisation at home, I could not support the party. I was never a member before and had no reason to join it. \u201cBut with its unambiguous policies on equality, justice and peace it is offering a once in a generation opportunity to be a force for positive change for millions who have been ignored and left behind. \u201cThe huge growth in party membership \u2013 making the Labour party the biggest political party in Europe \u2013 reflects that change and hope. And I\u2019m proud to be part of that and champion it wholeheartedly.\u201d Yaqoob said her campaign would focus on improving public transport, reducing the impact of austerity cuts, bolstering affordable housing, and a bold new green deal. \u201cWhen it comes to the green agenda we need a major transformation. It does not have to be either or,\u201d she said. \u201cUnder the new green deal I am proposing that we are at the forefront of the debate with new green technology and creating new jobs in the sector. \u201cI will use the strategic powers of the mayor to finally deliver for the many, not just the few.\u201d Yaqoob\u2019s nomination is likely to ruffle a few feathers within Birmingham\u2019s local Labour movement. Over the years, the Birmingham city councillor has come under fire from all sides. She has received death threats from extremist Islamist groups for engaging in western political life, and was pressured to apologise after refusing to stand in honour of a soldier injured in Afghanistan. She was also criticised for comments she made about the 7/7 bombings in London, which she says were taken out of context. Yaqoob, named by Harper\u2019s Bazaar as one of Britain\u2019s most influential women, attributed the criticism to a sustained \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her because of her gender, race and outspoken political commentary. \u201cI have never, and will never, condone the actions of terrorists. There have been many occasions where my actions and comments have been deliberately misinterpreted for political gain by the opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not want the war and at the same time I condemn the actions of all terrorists. During these divided times we need a strong voice but sometimes there are forces at work who want to silence that voice.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas has branded the Liberal Democrat revoke Brexit position as arrogant and says it risks inflaming further political tension. In a video for the Guardian the MP warned against revocation \u2013 which in effect cancels Brexit \u2013 suggesting it was \u201cvery dangerous\u201d for the country. \u201cI certainly think that the Lib Dem way out is arrogant, self-indulgent, cynical and very dangerous. I think that will put fuel on the fire,\u201d she said. The Lib Dems\u2019 new policy, announced by the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, is to back a second referendum but in the case of their party winning a majority at a general election they would implement the cancellation of article 50. This has led to criticism from party members, such as long-standing Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who warned it would widen the gap between leave and remain voters. The Greens want a public vote on the government\u2019s proposed Brexit deal and want to avoid leaving without a deal. Not implementing the referendum result altogether though could risk stoking tension even more, she suggested. She said: \u201cI can see from a polling point of view why the Lib Dems might have adopted their latest policy of ignoring the referendum and just saying: \u2018No we\u2019re going to completely pretend it didn\u2019t happen and turn the clock back.\u2019 \u201cBut that I think is massively dangerous too, to add that into the mix.

However, as investigations are now carried out by party staff, the power to expel can be restored to the NEC.</p> <p>A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposals to fast-track expulsions in serious cases, the NEC has agreed detailed rule changes, which will be put to a vote at conference.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of Labour members are motivated by equality, justice and fairness. The party has taken decisive and robust disciplinary action following complaints about a small minority of party members.

      "bodyText": "Labour has been criticised for failing to consult Jewish members over its new disciplinary procedures for expelling members, and allowing the revised rules to be debated at conference on the Jewish Sabbath. The Jewish Labour Movement, which is affiliated to the party, accused Labour of more \u201cinstitutional failings\u201d after it failed to discuss with it Labour\u2019s proposed changes to the process for dealing with serious misdemeanours including antisemitism and other racism. Under the new rules, panels of the national executive committee would have the power to expel members, which the party believes will significantly speed up expulsion processes. This would apply in serious cases, where there is clear documentary evidence such as social media posts or videos. Currently, the national constitutional committee (NCC) is the only body with the power to expel in disciplinary cases, having been created following a high court injunction against expulsions by the NEC in the 1980s. The court ruled that the NEC could not both investigate complaints and make a final ruling on complaints. However, as investigations are now carried out by party staff, the power to expel can be restored to the NEC. A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposals to fast-track expulsions in serious cases, the NEC has agreed detailed rule changes, which will be put to a vote at conference. \u201cThe vast majority of Labour members are motivated by equality, justice and fairness. The party has taken decisive and robust disciplinary action following complaints about a small minority of party members. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reforms, supported by the NEC, would further speed up these processes.\u201d However, the Jewish Labour Movement released a statement saying the proposed reforms were insufficient and criticised the plan to debate them on the Sabbath, which would stop Orthodox members taking part. \u201cTime and again, the party leadership and the NEC have demonstrated a complete failure in both judgment and commitment to tackle antisemitism. With a statutory investigation by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission well under way, this is the latest example of institutional failing. \u201cWe have learned tonight from press reports that the party wishes to make sweeping changes to the disciplinary rules on antisemitism, without consulting us, its only Jewish affiliate, or any communal organisation.

There have been countless examples of NEC members either engaging in antisemitism or turning a blind eye to it. It will simply streamline the process of letting antisemites off the hook.\u201d The row is just one of several controversial decisions to come out of Tuesday\u2019s marathon NEC meeting. The body also decided to move to in effect abolish Labour Students, the party\u2019s student wing, which is seen as being on the more centrist side of the party, provoking frustration from Labour MPs who said they relied on its volunteers in election campaigns. The motion was brought by Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and an ally of Corbyn. Labour Students is challenging the decision, saying it has paid its fees. There is also a controversy over processes to select candidates as MPs. Some in Welsh Labour are unhappy that the NEC decided not to devolve the process for reselections, which will mean the central party retains control. A decision was also taken for the party to change the process for selections in key seats, which have been paused while the party concentrated on reselections and trigger ballots for sitting MPs.

      "bodyText": "The shadow chancellor is to throw his weight behind an \u201cAbolish Eton\u201d debate at the Labour party conference this weekend, as he declares that \u201cprivate schools don\u2019t need to exist\u201d in an equal society. John McDonnell said he supported a motion put forward by the campaign group Labour Against Private Schools calling for independent schools in England to be stripped of their charitable status, to have limits placed on their pupils\u2019 entry to universities, and for their assets to be used by the state education sector. \u201cWe know that our society is grotesquely unequal, and part of the reason for that is because of the inequalities in education, particularly in private schools, where large amounts of money are spent on a privileged few,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I support the campaign now for us to talk about how we ensure an integrated education system, where private schools don\u2019t need to exist and should not exist where we have equality of education.\u201d Holly Rigby, a state school teacher and one of the organisers of the motion, said the campaign was delighted to have McDonnell\u2019s support. \u201cThis is an historic opportunity to dismantle the private school system that confers unfair privileges and perpetuates inequality,\u201d she said. The campaign, which uses the Twitter handle @AbolishEton, has received a surge of support since its launch two months ago, including public backing from the Labour party chair, Ian Lavery, and the party\u2019s former leader Ed Miliband. \u201cI hope this campaign will pick up support and eventually become Labour party policy,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cI think we can gain a large number of votes on this issue, because I believe people think that everyone should have a fair start in life, and that starts by making sure that we all have the same access to education facilities.\u201d The motion is likely to be debated at the party conference in Brighton on Sunday, if it survives the selection procedures. It calls for an election commitment to \u201cintegrate all private schools into the state sector\u201d, including withdrawal of their charitable status. It also wants to limit university admissions for private school students to the same proportion as that of the wider population. Last week the Daily Telegraph reported that Labour was looking at ending discounted business rates for independent schools, as well as imposing VAT on independent school fees, a policy Labour previously adopted in its 2017 election manifesto. According to a leaked document it estimated that applying VAT to school fees alone would raise about \u00a31.6bn. Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference (HMC), which represents the most prominent independent schools, said any proposals to abolish private schools \u201cwould tear apart the fabric of education\u201d in the UK. \u201cIndependent schools have played a vital role in the education system for generations and they are recognised around the world as beacons of excellence. We want to see all pupils getting the same opportunities by pushing up standards everywhere, not by destroying some of the best,\u201d he said.",
