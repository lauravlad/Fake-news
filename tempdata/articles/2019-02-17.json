The report will again focus attention on the massive expansion of irrigated cotton farming in northern New South Wales, and the state\u2019s commitment to the Murray-Darling basin plan. The panel has called for an immediate effort over the next six months to restore flows, combined with a Menindee Lakes restoration plan focused on restoring its ecology, not saving water, as NSW hopes to do with its Menindee Lakes water saving plan.

The report, under the auspices of the Australian Academy of Science, was commissioned by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and released on Monday morning. \u201cI promised Australians I would get them answers on how this ecological disaster took place, and that\u2019s what this report does, Shorten said. \u201cThere is simply not enough environmental water held in the Darling River to meet critical environmental needs in times of drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Murray Darling Basin Plan was well designed by Labor, but its implementation has been mismanaged by the Liberals.

As noted in the AAS report, this is especially challenging during drought,\u201d it said. It did not address the recommendation that the 70GL cut should be reversed. The academy scientists agreed with the NSW Department of Primary Industries finding that the immediate cause of the fish deaths was stratification of the water column in the weir near Menindee, which led to blue green algae outbreaks in the warm surface water during a run of very hot days over 40C, and deoxygenated water below. When the temperature dropped during a cool change, the algae died and the water column mixed, depleting the river of oxygen and causing the mass fish deaths.

It also cited a report to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office which identified that low flows have reduced by 70% across most sections of the Barwon-Darling since 1990. Decisions by the NSW government to drain the lakes meant there was no local reserves of water available. The scientists said regular, low flows in the Darling were important in ensuring that native fish and invertebrate populations survived during dry periods, and upstream and downstream connectivity were maintained. The panel was particularly critical of NSW and its 2012 water sharing plan. \u201cThe NSW Barwon-Darling Water Sharing Plan, and changes to it in 2012, contributed directly to the decline of low flows, independent of rainfall, and hence to the recent fish kills,\u201d it said. The scientists also warned that the implementation of the NSW floodplain harvesting policy would potentially legitimise growth in diversions. They said the take of groundwater was also likely to be contributing to the problem. NSW said it was studying the report but immediately rejected two recommendations: that the cap on buybacks should be lifted as well as the assertion that the Northern Basin review should be repealed. The Australian Conservation Foundation called for immediate action on the academy\u2019s recommendation. \u201cThe Australian Academy of Science has sounded a warning that the management and implementation of water recovery across the Murray-Darling Basin is deeply flawed, finding that excess diversion of water for irrigation was a root cause of this summer\u2019s mass fish kills. \u201cMore than a million dead fish floating in our rivers is a clear sign something must change. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick also called for action. \u201cThe findings of the academy\u2019s expert panel are absolutely clear, and absolutely consistent with the findings of the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission - too much water is being taken for irrigation and not enough is being allowed to flow down the Darling River.\u201d The scientists were also asked to comment on whether climate change was contributing to the problems of the river system. \u201cThe Murray-Darling Basin has increased in temperature by ~1 \u00b0C since 1910 and there is high confidence that the Northern Basin will continue to warm, towards a further 1\u20132 \u00b0C increase over the coming one to three decades.

But, as the team embark on a pivotal nine-day period which could define their season, he denied the notion that his compatriot has been too stubborn to adapt his game-plan for life in England. \u201cHow do you know we are not making changes?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are adjusting a few things, understanding that this is the Premier League, but without changing where we want to go. The direction is always the same.</p> <p>\u201cI know there are questions about what we\u2019re doing, a lot of doubts, but we are adapting to the league. But we don\u2019t change what we believe is good for this club because, otherwise, we are nothing. What we\u2019re trying to do is ambitious in a competitive league, and it\u2019s not easy. But we believe it\u2019s the right way and we carry on. Two years ago people were probably asking the same questions of Pep Guardiola. Asking if he\u2019d keep playing out from the back all the time. He said that was not under discussion and was just part of his game, even in difficult moments. Maybe he adapted. He has improved a lot in that respect because he got his team defending, pressing and attacking better. He has adjusted something, but not the way he saw football. You have to admire what Pep has done. Certainly he\u2019s a good inspiration: not everything comes together straight away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guardiola was granted considerable funds to smooth progression after a relatively underwhelming first season in the Premier League, and spent heavily to recruit the attack-minded full-backs who were key to last season\u2019s runaway success.

David Luiz stated last week that there have been no dissenting voices in the meetings, where Sarri has been promoting his philosophy to the group. Yet this team have tended to collapse at the first sign of adversity in games. They will be severely tested by United, Manchester City in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final and the visit of Tottenham Hotspur in the league the following Wednesday.</p> <p>Zola admitted there have been \u201cpainful\u201d moments while the squad attempt to take on board Sarri\u2019s demands. \u201cWhen you lose 6-0 you don\u2019t enjoy it, but we did when we were winning 5-0 against Huddersfield,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a stage when you are working on something that, when it\u2019s still not in place, you have to work harder. Sometimes it can be difficult. But we will continue. We believe in what we are doing. I think the players like what we are doing, even if I know there are moments when it is painful.\u201d</p>",

Zola, who was appointed to the coaching staff last summer following the dismissal of Antonio Conte, conceded Sarri\u2019s plans are \u201cambitious\u201d to implement in such a competitive environment while also maintaining immediate standards. But, as the team embark on a pivotal nine-day period which could define their season, he denied the notion that his compatriot has been too stubborn to adapt his game-plan for life in England. \u201cHow do you know we are not making changes?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe are adjusting a few things, understanding that this is the Premier League, but without changing where we want to go. The direction is always the same. \u201cI know there are questions about what we\u2019re doing, a lot of doubts, but we are adapting to the league. But we don\u2019t change what we believe is good for this club because, otherwise, we are nothing. What we\u2019re trying to do is ambitious in a competitive league, and it\u2019s not easy. But we believe it\u2019s the right way and we carry on. Two years ago people were probably asking the same questions of Pep Guardiola. Asking if he\u2019d keep playing out from the back all the time. He said that was not under discussion and was just part of his game, even in difficult moments. Maybe he adapted. He has improved a lot in that respect because he got his team defending, pressing and attacking better. He has adjusted something, but not the way he saw football. You have to admire what Pep has done. Certainly he\u2019s a good inspiration: not everything comes together straight away.\u201d Guardiola was granted considerable funds to smooth progression after a relatively underwhelming first season in the Premier League, and spent heavily to recruit the attack-minded full-backs who were key to last season\u2019s runaway success. It is doubtful Sarri will benefit from the same clout in the market in the summer, for all that the board backed his judgment to secure Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on loan last month. The Argentinian is expected to return to the starting lineup at Stamford Bridge having been rested for the Europa League win in Malm\u00f6. \u201cThere is a collaboration between Maurizio and Marina [Granovskaia, the club director] and they will come up with the right things,\u201d said Zola. \u201cBut we have players here who can do even more than they\u2019re doing, and we can go far as a team.\u201d The head coach conducted lengthy meetings with his players after the recent losses to root out what he claims have been a lack of determination. David Luiz stated last week that there have been no dissenting voices in the meetings, where Sarri has been promoting his philosophy to the group. Yet this team have tended to collapse at the first sign of adversity in games. They will be severely tested by United, Manchester City in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final and the visit of Tottenham Hotspur in the league the following Wednesday. Zola admitted there have been \u201cpainful\u201d moments while the squad attempt to take on board Sarri\u2019s demands. \u201cWhen you lose 6-0 you don\u2019t enjoy it, but we did when we were winning 5-0 against Huddersfield,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a stage when you are working on something that, when it\u2019s still not in place, you have to work harder. Sometimes it can be difficult. But we will continue. We believe in what we are doing. I think the players like what we are doing, even if I know there are moments when it is painful.\u201d",

It follows a tight path around the sun, completing a full orbit every 88 days. That means it never strays out of the twilight sky. This week offers about as good an opportunity as it ever gets to see the planet in the evening sky. To begin your vigil, find somewhere with a clear western horizon and start searching low down just after sunset. The chart shows the view in the western sky at 18:00 GMT on 22 February. Mercury will appear out of the glare as a tiny bright spot. As the darkness sets in, so the planet will appear to brighten. However, it also begins to set, so the race is on to spot it before it follows the sun beneath the horizon. A pair of binoculars could be useful in your search but do not look through them until the sun has disappeared below the horizon. The days following 22 February will also be good times to look. As an added bonus on these nights, Mars will also be visible higher in the sky. And you can watch the stars come out one by one as the sky darkens. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The inner planet Mercury is notoriously difficult to see with the naked eye. It follows a tight path around the sun, completing a full orbit every 88 days. That means it never strays out of the twilight sky. This week offers about as good an opportunity as it ever gets to see the planet in the evening sky. To begin your vigil, find somewhere with a clear western horizon and start searching low down just after sunset. The chart shows the view in the western sky at 18:00 GMT on 22 February. Mercury will appear out of the glare as a tiny bright spot. As the darkness sets in, so the planet will appear to brighten. However, it also begins to set, so the race is on to spot it before it follows the sun beneath the horizon. A pair of binoculars could be useful in your search but do not look through them until the sun has disappeared below the horizon. The days following 22 February will also be good times to look. As an added bonus on these nights, Mars will also be visible higher in the sky. And you can watch the stars come out one by one as the sky darkens.",

The poll conducted for Nine\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald and the Age has the opposition leading the Liberal-National Coalition 51-49 on the two-party-preferred measure, down from 54-46 in December. Labor\u2019s primary vote has fallen from 37% to 33% over two months, while the Coalition\u2019s rose from 36% to 38% in the poll of 1,200 voters. The poll also had the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, losing ground on his personal approval rating, with his net approval falling from minus nine to minus 12 percentage points. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, saw his net approval rating bump from eight to nine percentage points, within the poll\u2019s 2.9% margin of error. The poll comes after Morrison last week ramped up the rhetoric on border protection following a historic loss in parliament on legislation making it easier for refugees to get medical transfers to Australia. The bill \u2013 put forward by the independent MP Kerryn Phelps and supported by Labor \u2013 marked the first time a sitting government has lost a substantial vote on the floor of the House of Representatives since 1929. It prompted the government to begin a significant ramp-up in its rhetoric on border policy \u2013 Morrison announced the reopening of the Christmas Island detention centre. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, told a Sydney radio station the bill would allow people with \u201cserious allegations of sexual assault or being involved in sexual relationships with young girls\u201d to enter Australia \u2013 despite the bill containing provisions preventing asylum seekers with a substantial criminal record from entering the country. The latest poll contradicts the broader polling trend which has shown the Coalition trailing Labor by a wider margin in the lead-up to a likely May election. Earlier in February an Essential poll carried out for the Guardian showed the opposition holding a 55% to 45% lead over the government on the two-party-preferred measure. Meanwhile, a separate YouGov Galaxy poll of 810 Queenslanders has Labor ahead 52% to 48% in the state on a two-party-preferred basis, although 40% of those polled said they were less likely to vote for Labor because Shorten is the party\u2019s leader. Some 46% of respondents were against the opposition\u2019s policy to abolish franking credits for some retirees, while 36% said the plan would have no bearing on their vote. Despite this the Liberal National party\u2019s primary vote dropped three percentage points to 35% since the last poll in November, against Labor which was unchanged on 34%.",

Their suspicion was raised when they attended the world\u2019s largest gatherings of Flat Earthers at the movement\u2019s annual conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 2017, and then in Denver, Colorado, last year. Interviews with 30 attendees revealed a pattern in the stories people told about how they came to be convinced that the Earth was not a large round rock spinning through space but a large flat disc doing much the same thing. Of the 30, all but one said they had not considered the Earth to be flat two years ago but changed their minds after watching videos promoting conspiracy theories on YouTube. \u201cThe only person who didn\u2019t say this was there with his daughter and his son-in-law and they had seen it on YouTube and told him about it,\u201d said Asheley Landrum, who led the research at Texas Tech University. The interviews revealed that most had been watching videos about other conspiracies, with alternative takes on 9/11, the Sandy Hook school shooting and whether Nasa really went to the moon, when YouTube offered up Flat Earth videos for them to watch next. Some said they watched the videos only in order to debunk them but soon found themselves won over by the material. Landrum said one of the most popular Flat Earth videos, \u201c200 proofs Earth is not a spinning ball\u201d appears to be effective because it offers arguments that appeal to so many mindsets, from biblical literalists and conspiracy theorists to those of a more scientific bent. One way or another, the interviewees found themselves believers and before long were asking \u201cwhere is the curve?\u201d and \u201cwhy is the horizon always at eye level?\u201d Landrum, who presented her results at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC, said she did not think YouTube was doing anything overtly wrong, but said that if the site wanted to help it could tweak its algorithm to show more accurate information. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of helpful information on YouTube but also a lot of misinformation,\u201d Landrum said. \u201cTheir algorithms make it easy to end up going down the rabbit hole, by presenting information to people who are going to be more susceptible to it.\u201d \u201cBelieving the Earth is flat in of itself is not necessarily harmful, but it comes packaged with a distrust in institutions and authority more generally,\u201d she added. \u201cWe want people to be critical consumers of the information they are given, but there is a balance to be had.\u201d Landrum called on scientists and others to create their own YouTube videos to combat the proliferation of conspiracy videos. \u201cWe don\u2019t want YouTube to be full of videos saying here are all these reasons the Earth is flat.

Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, who have \u201cshared ticket\u201d flights with Flybmi.

Exeter-based Flybe put itself up for sale in November and has warned shareholders it will have to be wound up if they do not back a sale to a Virgin Atlantic-led consortium. John Strickland at JLS Consulting said Brexit had piled on the pressure for UK operators partly because such airlines were less able to fund the cost of securing separate licences to operate in both the UK and Europe \u2013 rather than one for both. He said Flybmi was also likely to have suffered as it had a large number of business travellers and struck special deals with business customers such as Airbus, for which it was shuttling staff between Toulouse and Bristol. \u201cMaybe some clients, with all the uncertainty around about Brexit will have been unwilling to extend or renew contracts,\u201d Strickland said.

      "bodyText": "Caroline Stewart, 29, and her husband are not only up to \u00a31,400 out of pocket, but face being cut off from their family, as Flybmi operated the only direct flights home to Aberdeen. The couple, who moved to Esbjerg in Denmark in November last year, have had numerous flights that they booked to family events, including a friend\u2019s wedding and a grandparent\u2019s birthday, cancelled after the airline abruptly ceased operations. Stewart said: \u201cWe are just really disappointed and still in shock. We haven\u2019t seen some family in so long \u2013 it\u2019s devastating. The only reason we [decided it was OK to] relocate here was because we could get direct flights back home. We would never have moved here if we had [not had] that option.\u201d She said their only alternative was to drive 45 minutes to another town, from where they could fly to Aberdeen via Amsterdam, a much longer trip. The Stewarts, who both work in the petrochemicals industry, were having dinner on Saturday with a group of fellow Scots who all use the Esbjerg to Aberdeen route when they received text messages telling them their flights had been cancelled. \u201cSo many oil industry workers travel back and forth from here,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIf they had said they were stopping the flights in June, it would not have been so bad \u2013 we could plan for it \u2013 but I was supposed to be back in Aberdeen in one month. I don\u2019t know if we are going to manage to get home now. \u201cMy mum\u2019s health is not great and I do need that lifeline to get home in case of an emergency.\u201d",

Michael Daley and Gladys Berejiklian remain locked in a tight race less than five weeks out from the NSW election, according to a new Essential poll which also indicates about one in four voters giving their first preference vote to minor parties or independents. Labor narrowly leads the Coalition 51 to 49 on a two-party-preferred basis, according to the survey, representing a swing of 5.3% since the 2015 election. The poll reaffirms the possibility the Coalition could be facing minority government after election day on 23 March, or be returned with only a wafer-thin majority. But the ABC election analyst, Antony Green, has warned this state election is particularly hard to predict given the number of tight, three-cornered contests around the state. Nearly one in 10 adults have taken nude photos or recorded footage of others without consent, an Australian-first study into imaged-based sexual abuse has found. RMIT researchers surveyed 4,200 people aged 16 to 49 and found more than 6% of respondents had shared the images or footage and close to 5% had made threats to do so. Nearly 9% of respondents had captured images or footage without consent. And one in five survey respondents had been victims. World Donald Trump has told the EU it must take back its 800 Isis fighters captured in Syria by US-backed forces, and put them on trial. The president\u2019s call comes as Britain debates how to respond to the case of the teenager Shamima Begum, who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015 and has said she is desperate to return to the UK after giving birth in a refugee camp. Separately, a US woman, Hoda Muthana, captured by Kurdish forces after fleeing the last pocket of land controlled by Islamic State says she \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d travelling to Syria to join the terrorist group and has pleaded to be allowed to return to her family in Alabama. Theresa May is facing a fresh showdown with Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, whose support she is likely to need to get approval for her withdrawal agreement, after a cabinet minister suggested she may put her Brexit deal to parliament again without having secured a change to the withdrawal text. Brazilian activists have taken to the streets in five major cities after the death of a young black man who was restrained by a supermarket security guard. The Arab world\u2019s first female interior minister has hailed her appointment as a \u201cpoint of pride for all women\u201d. Raya al-Hassan is one of four women to take cabinet jobs in the new Lebanese government, a record for the country and three more than in the last government. Hundreds of people have demanded refunds after a Fortnite festival was branded a shambles. The computer game-themed event near Norwich was underwhelming and understaffed, visitors say. Opinion and analysis The Canadian government has recruited Indigenous rangers from Arnhem Land as part of a $25m program to double the country\u2019s protected land and sea by 2020. The pilot program is inspired by Australia\u2019s Indigenous rangers and protected areas. Senior ranger Dean Yibarbuk, a traditional owner of Djinkarr, near Maningrida in Arnhem Land, and his fellow travellers swapped 40C temperatures at home for -36C temperatures in Yellowknife in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, meeting with the Dehcho, Sahtu and Lutsel K\u2019e First Nations, as well as the Canadian minister of environment and climate change, to advise them on how to care for country, and why it works. \u201cWhat I am sharing with Canadians is that your culture and your elders are your strength, your youth are your future,\u201d Yibarbuk says. \u201cCombine the two with your own responsibility to your traditional lands and sea, and that will give you power.\u201d Australia views Asia through the wrong end of the telescope, writes George Megalogenis. He argues that every prime minister since John Howard has placed domestic concerns above all else and assumed that \u201cour neighbours will forgive our insensitivity when we ask them to play along\u201d. From Julia Gillard indicating that asylum seekers would be sent to Timor-Leste for processing (she hadn\u2019t consulted the Timor-Leste government) to Scott Morrison\u2019s hasty Wentworth byelection call to move Australia\u2019s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the troubling episodes points to a wider systemic problem in our body politic, says Megalogenis. \u201cBut while Howard matured in the role of prime minister, none of his successors have held the job long enough to leave a positive legacy.\u201d Sport The AFLW season has started brightly with impressive skill levels and big crowds but, as Kasey Symons writes, the controversial conferences system is already undermining the fundamental fairness of the competition. Colin Kaepernick\u2019s lawyer says his client still wants to play in the NFL, and believes he would fit in well with the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. On Friday Kaepernick and his former teammate Eric Reid settled a complaint of collusion against the NFL. Thinking time: The voice of little England A quarter of a century after Coogan\u2019s clueless sports reporter turned broadcasting pariah, Alan Partridge, made his screen debut on The Day Today, he is returning to the BBC in This Time With Alan Partridge. The conceit is that the disgraced anchor has been invited to cover the absence of the regular presenter of a One Show-style magazine programme. Despite Partridge\u2019s deep-seated loathing for the \u201cBBC gravy train\u201d, he has been in the digital radio wilderness for years, and is desperate to get back in front of the cameras. Luckily, the BBC, wanting to reflect the voice of little England in these politically altered times, thinks Partridge is just what it needs. Coogan says they had some lively discussions about who Partridge now aligns himself with. Who has he heard talking about the big issues and agreed with lately? Coogan warms to this. \u201cThere is a quote in episode two where he says there is evidence that lower wages increase productivity.\u201d He goes on, more Partridge now than Coogan: \u201cAs Kirstie Allsopp says: \u2018A well-fed dog is a lazy dog.\u2019 The thing is, Allsopp never said that at all, but we have fun with things like that.\u201d Libelling Allsopp aside, Partridge is trying to keep his nose clean and make a good impression. This time, he\u2019s back, he says, to \u201cgive of my best\u201d. He\u2019ll cock it up, obviously, but he really is trying. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page reveals, in \u201can exclusive\u201d, that school pupils are being \u201cused as climate pawns\u201d, as \u201ctaxpayer-funded eco-worriers are coaching children to skip school again next month, giving them detailed instructions on how to play truant, make posters and organise \u2018marshals\u2019 for a climate change protest march.\u201d Scott Morrison is having a moment, the Australian reports: the PM is campaigning on border security in key migrant communities in Arabic, Mandarin and Korean, \u201cdrawing comparison to John Howard\u2019s Tampa moment\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald says foreign criminals who have had their visas cancelled are using an opaque process to get the mandatory cancellations overturned. Coming up More than 30 festival organisers will hold crisis meeting at NSW parliament over the government crackdown on music festivals.

But it\u2019s that hour before the game, when the coaches take the lads out to warm up, that you feel it. You\u2019re alone in the dressing room and you\u2019ve done everything you can. That\u2019s a lonely time. There\u2019s nothing left to do. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/16/arjen-robben-liverpool-bayern-munich-champions-league-preview\">Arjen Robben: \u2018If you ask what is the worst stadium for me, it\u2019s Liverpool\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We sit in a hotel room overlooking Old Trafford. Giggs won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League finals as a player for Manchester United, the club with whom he was associated for 29 years from a boy to an icon who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/25/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-player-manager-gareth-southgate\" title=\"\">took charge as a caretaker manager</a> for four matches in 2014. Giggs, who then became Louis van Gaal\u2019s assistant for two seasons, finally left United in July 2016. Eighteen months later, bruised by the even more intense loneliness of looking for work in football, Giggs was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/14/wales-manager-ryan-giggs-unveiled\" title=\"\">appointed as manager of Wales</a>.</p> <p>The 45-year-old, who still lives in Manchester, soon reflects on the rise of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, his former teammate, who has had such success in the Premier League since replacing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and becoming interim manager at United. But Giggs concentrates first on Wales.</p> <p>Last September, in his first home game, Wales produced a vibrant display of the attacking football Giggs epitomised as a player. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/06/wales-republic-of-ireland-nations-league-match-report\" title=\"\">swaggered past the Republic of Ireland</a>, winning 4-1 in an exhilarating and clinical performance. Yet, in their most recent match, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/20/albania-wales-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">Wales lost to Albania</a>, 42 places below them in the world rankings. Unlike a club manager Giggs has had to reflect on that loss for nearly three months.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult having such a long break. That\u2019s the tough part about international football. But I keep in contact with the players and yesterday I got the lads together for a little debrief in London and to make sure we\u2019re looking forward to the [Euro 2020] qualifiers in March. When it\u2019s September, October, November, you\u2019re on a roll. But this gap between games is big. You can see why some managers miss that day-to-day contact. The difference is that I was never a [permanent] club manager. I\u2019ve gone straight into international football.\u201d</p> <p>Statistics can be misleading but, under Giggs, Wales have lost five of nine games. \u201cIf we\u2019d have beaten Albania, I would have called it a successful year,\u201d Giggs says. \u201cBut we played Spain, Uruguay, Mexico. Denmark twice. Almost all in the world\u2019s top 10. We used experimental squads, experimental systems. So we\u2019ve used this first year to see what we\u2019ve got while looking forward to the Euros. Against Albania we actually played really well first half.

On 24 March Wales face Slovakia in Cardiff.

So this first game against Slovakia is a big one.\u201d</p> <p>Old Trafford does not cast any shadows on a rainy day. But it\u2019s hard to escape the club that has dominated Giggs\u2019s life. He joined United on his 14th birthday and played his last game aged 40. Giggs admits he shed tears in his car after his retirement was confirmed following the final match he was in charge of United as caretaker manager \u2013 against Southampton in May 2014. \u201cI\u2019d had three weeks in the job and I put myself under so much pressure.

When asked to name the best player he faced he helps the group feel as if they are in the tunnel next to an imposing Zinedine Zidane \u2013 and out on the pitch as he describes the Frenchman\u2019s strength and balletic skills.

It might have been different if I wasn\u2019t the Welsh coach. Ole\u2019s done a fantastic job.

When he was young he went to a different country. He had huge success but he was not always picked. He studied the game while he had a bad injury and then he coached at the club.

Planning is more important than the announcement. Look at Guardiola. He got in Man City players he wanted the year before he took over. So, if it is Ole, keep it amongst the club and start planning. Our problem the past few years is that we were always playing catch-up. We should identify the two or three players we need if we\u2019re going to win the Premier League and Champions League.\u201d</p> <p>Did the United hierarchy ever intimate to Giggs he would become the permanent manager? \u201cNo, it was more Louis [van Gaal] who said it.

There is also the culture where, three months into the season, a manager is fired. How do you appoint a young coach, who\u2019s not got any experience, to a struggling side? I understand but it\u2019s like young players \u2013 you never know what they\u2019re capable of until you give them the chance. I believe ex-players who have prepared themselves well should be given a chance.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went for the Swansea job it was difficult.

I remember going to the BBC Sports Personality award and it was a short walk, but a slow queue, from the hotel. I walked with Lawrie McMenemy [the former Southampton manager] and he said: \u2018The lower you go down, the more you coach. The higher you go up, the more you manage.\u2019 It was an interesting insight and I took it on board. Coaching is not a problem and I worked with the players every day as Louis\u2019 assistant.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI think every manager feels that loneliness,\u201d Ryan Giggs says as he identifies the usually unspoken difficulty at the core of his work. The manager of Wales since January 2018, Giggs has had nine games to get used to the isolation. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have great staff around me and, during the week, you\u2019re constantly in meetings and on the training ground. But it\u2019s that hour before the game, when the coaches take the lads out to warm up, that you feel it. You\u2019re alone in the dressing room and you\u2019ve done everything you can. That\u2019s a lonely time. There\u2019s nothing left to do. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d We sit in a hotel room overlooking Old Trafford. Giggs won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League finals as a player for Manchester United, the club with whom he was associated for 29 years from a boy to an icon who took charge as a caretaker manager for four matches in 2014. Giggs, who then became Louis van Gaal\u2019s assistant for two seasons, finally left United in July 2016. Eighteen months later, bruised by the even more intense loneliness of looking for work in football, Giggs was appointed as manager of Wales. The 45-year-old, who still lives in Manchester, soon reflects on the rise of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, his former teammate, who has had such success in the Premier League since replacing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and becoming interim manager at United. But Giggs concentrates first on Wales. Last September, in his first home game, Wales produced a vibrant display of the attacking football Giggs epitomised as a player. They swaggered past the Republic of Ireland, winning 4-1 in an exhilarating and clinical performance. Yet, in their most recent match, Wales lost to Albania, 42 places below them in the world rankings. Unlike a club manager Giggs has had to reflect on that loss for nearly three months. \u201cIt is difficult having such a long break. That\u2019s the tough part about international football. But I keep in contact with the players and yesterday I got the lads together for a little debrief in London and to make sure we\u2019re looking forward to the [Euro 2020] qualifiers in March. When it\u2019s September, October, November, you\u2019re on a roll. But this gap between games is big. You can see why some managers miss that day-to-day contact. The difference is that I was never a [permanent] club manager. I\u2019ve gone straight into international football.\u201d Statistics can be misleading but, under Giggs, Wales have lost five of nine games. \u201cIf we\u2019d have beaten Albania, I would have called it a successful year,\u201d Giggs says. \u201cBut we played Spain, Uruguay, Mexico. Denmark twice. Almost all in the world\u2019s top 10. We used experimental squads, experimental systems. So we\u2019ve used this first year to see what we\u2019ve got while looking forward to the Euros. Against Albania we actually played really well first half. We should have won 3-0 but missed easy chances. Then they get a penalty which may not have been one. But sometimes you learn a lot more from defeats.\u201d A crunch period is looming. On 24 March Wales face Slovakia in Cardiff. It is their opening match in a qualifying group that includes the World Cup finalists Croatia as well as Hungary, Belarus and Azerbaijan. \u201cWe need a good start against our main rivals because, after Croatia, I would say it could be between us and Slovakia. They have a new manager but they\u2019ve got talented players. Marek Hamsik stands out. He just broke the goalscoring record for Napoli, overtaking Diego Maradona. So this first game against Slovakia is a big one.\u201d Old Trafford does not cast any shadows on a rainy day. But it\u2019s hard to escape the club that has dominated Giggs\u2019s life. He joined United on his 14th birthday and played his last game aged 40. Giggs admits he shed tears in his car after his retirement was confirmed following the final match he was in charge of United as caretaker manager \u2013 against Southampton in May 2014. \u201cI\u2019d had three weeks in the job and I put myself under so much pressure. I felt the players had given a lot and my own playing career was over. It was also not knowing what was next. So when I got in the car all my emotion came out.\u201d He is much more relaxed now. During a morning in which he runs a session with young men from the Laureus-supported Street League programme, which uses football to help people get back into employment and education, Giggs is impressive. As a Laureus academy member he is an engaging communicator \u2013 whether encouraging the men to stay true to themselves or answering their questions. When asked to name the best player he faced he helps the group feel as if they are in the tunnel next to an imposing Zinedine Zidane \u2013 and out on the pitch as he describes the Frenchman\u2019s strength and balletic skills.

Campaigners said the protests are feeding a nascent Black Lives Matter movement in Brazil, where nearly three-quarters of all homicide victims are black. Outside the Extra supermarket in the upscale Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, demonstrators chanted the name of Pedro Gonzaga, who died of a heart attack in hospital on Thursday after being immobilised with a \u201csleep hold\u201d by a security guard. Protests were also reported in S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Fortaleza. Another took place on Saturday in Recife. Lyz Ramos, 19, a student painting placards in Rio, said: \u201cWe have to take a position against this to stay alive. It\u2019s a basic issue.\u201d Gonzaga, 19, was immobilised by Davi Am\u00e2ncio. Video footage showing the prone Gonzaga underneath Am\u00e2ncio while onlookers pleaded for him to be let go generated widespread anger. One woman can be heard saying: \u201cHe is suffocating him.\u201d He was taken unconscious to hospital, where he died. As the outcry grew, the hashtag #VidasNegrasImportam (Black Lives Matter) began circulating, and black Brazilians compared his death to that of Eric Garner, who died after police in New York immobilised him in 2014.

The deputy attorney general is Rod Rosenstein, who wrote the memo justifying Comey\u2019s firing, which said it was due to his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. In his book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, McCabe says Trump ordered Rosenstein to produce the memo, a claim the White House has denied. Shortly after the Comey firing, Trump told NBC he had acted because of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d, meaning Comey\u2019s involvement in the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump aides and Moscow. The 25th amendment to the constitution provides for the removal of a president deemed incapable of discharging his duties. It has never been used. Fox News reported on Saturday that James Baker, formerly a senior FBI lawyer, testified to two House committees last year that he was told Rosenstein said he had found two cabinet members who would support such an effort. The full McCabe interview was scheduled to air on 60 Minutes on Sunday night. The reporter who conducted it, Scott Pelley, said on Thursday McCabe also says Rosenstein offered to wear a wire to record incriminating conversations with Trump. Rosenstein has denied discussing the 25th amendment or offering to wear a wire. McCabe\u2019s book is out on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained an early copy, in which McCabe does not mention the discussions about the 25th amendment or, directly, any offer from Rosenstein to wear a wire.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is facing a fresh showdown with Eurosceptic Conservative MPs after a cabinet minister suggested she may put her Brexit deal to parliament again without having secured a change to the withdrawal text. Before talks between May and EU leaders, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said the prime minister\u2019s aim was to solve the Northern Ireland backstop issue but the \u201cmechanism\u201d of the change did not matter. His words caused alarm among some Eurosceptic Tory MPs, who have repeatedly made clear they would not vote for a deal that did not remove an indefinite Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 a clause that could bind the UK into a permanent customs union with the EU. May has written to every Tory MP reassuring them that she would attempt to eliminate any risk that the backstop is applied indefinitely and urging them to \u201cmove beyond what divides us and sacrifice personal preferences for the national interest\u201d. This week, she will speak to every EU leader and meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, in an attempt to break the stalemate over the agreement, which Brussels does not want to reopen. A No 10 source insisted that May would request a reopening of the withdrawal text. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will give a rare speech on Tuesday setting out how the government thinks the backstop problem can be legally solved. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will also meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday to discuss proposals to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. However, Wright, the former attorney general, suggested it may not be necessary to amend the withdrawal agreement, while calling on MPs to give the prime minister space to negotiate. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think what\u2019s obvious is that parliament, and I think probably people well beyond parliament, are concerned about the potential indefinite nature of the backstop \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do something about. \u201cIf this is the only way of doing it then that\u2019s the way we will pursue.

Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and an influential figure in the European Research Group (ERG), retweeted a message saying Brexiter Tories would not like the sound of Wright\u2019s suggestion. He has consistently emphasised that the ERG would rather support a no-deal Brexit than one that did not legally remove the backstop. In leaked WhatsApp messages, he told fellow Conservative MPs that failure to remove the Irish backstop completely could mean things would \u201cjust grind towards a party split\u201d and he expressed fears that the prime minister\u2019s negotiations were \u201ca complete waste of time\u201d. Sir Bill Cash, a veteran Eurosceptic, said No 10 would have to \u201cshow there has been a change in the substance \u2013 that requires a change in policy and there is no evidence yet to show there has been a change in policy\u201d.

The country has been waiting for this election since general Prayuth Chan-ocha took power five years ago, via the 13th successful coup since 1932, and promised an election within months. Despite the military\u2019s unpopularity \u2013 it pledged to \u201creturn happiness\u201d, tackle corruption and reconcile the country, and has failed on all counts \u2013 it has formed a party and its man is standing as a candidate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/thailand-king-signs-constitution-path-polls-election\" title=\"\">Rigged rules</a> introduced by the junta require a prime minister to have a majority of the combined houses of parliament: having appointed the 250-seat senate, it need only cobble together a coalition of 126 seats in the 500-seat elected lower house.</p> <p>The plan was thrown into doubt this month by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/17/week-shook-thai-politics-and-what-comes-next-princess\" title=\"\">seismic announcement</a> that a member of the revered royal family, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/08/thailands-princess-ubolratana-social-media-star-and-anti-drug-campaigner\" title=\"\">Princess Ubolratana Mahidol</a>, would stand as a potential prime minister, as the candidate for a party loathed by Thailand\u2019s royalist elites because it is aligned with its controversial exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The aftershock was equally powerful: within hours her brother the king announced that her decision was \u201cinappropriate\u201d since the monarchy is \u201cabove politics\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Thailand is due to go to the polls next month, but after a short-lived political earthquake it looks likelier than ever that the military will entrench its hold. The country has been waiting for this election since general Prayuth Chan-ocha took power five years ago, via the 13th successful coup since 1932, and promised an election within months. Despite the military\u2019s unpopularity \u2013 it pledged to \u201creturn happiness\u201d, tackle corruption and reconcile the country, and has failed on all counts \u2013 it has formed a party and its man is standing as a candidate. Rigged rules introduced by the junta require a prime minister to have a majority of the combined houses of parliament: having appointed the 250-seat senate, it need only cobble together a coalition of 126 seats in the 500-seat elected lower house. The plan was thrown into doubt this month by the seismic announcement that a member of the revered royal family, Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, would stand as a potential prime minister, as the candidate for a party loathed by Thailand\u2019s royalist elites because it is aligned with its controversial exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The aftershock was equally powerful: within hours her brother the king announced that her decision was \u201cinappropriate\u201d since the monarchy is \u201cabove politics\u201d. Although his sister relinquished her title when she married an American in 1972, she has been treated as a royal since returning to Thailand on her divorce. She is now out of the race. So too, it seems, is the Thai Raksa Chart party for which she was standing. Its allied Puea Thai party is further enfeebled. In the short term, the military is strengthened. But underlying all this is the fundamental political and social clash that has dominated Thailand for two decades, between the \u201cyellow shirts\u201d of the royalists, military and urban elites, and the poorer and more rural \u201cred shirts\u201d, especially in the north and north-east, aligned with Mr Thaksin. While opponents revile the billionaire for abuses of power and trampling over human rights, policies such as universal healthcare and his populist touch won him devotion. He or his proxies have won every election since 2001, and been ousted each time. Recent events have exposed the deep fissures that everyone understood existed within these broad and in many ways incoherent camps. These have become clearer on the elite side with the royal succession, as the new king has established a tighter grip on power.

A hundred MPs wrote to the BBC director-general,Tony Hall, calling for a rethink after the BBC One programme was broadcast on 3 February. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, Family Planning Association, Marie Stopes UK, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists were among the signatories to another letter that called on the BBC to rethink. They told the broadcaster \u201cabortion is not a contentious issue \u2013 it is a routine part of NHS-funded healthcare, provided by doctors, nurses and midwives every day in hospitals and clinics across the country\u201d. The BBC had said it could not refer viewers to help without sending them to organisations that \u201ctake a particular stance\u201d on abortion, something it could not do given the contentious nature of the issue. The pro-choice charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) claimed the BBC was mistakenly treating abortion as a fraught political matter, stigmatising medical professionals. The Action Line page now refers to information about abortion, with the BBC saying it was added to reflect different legal frameworks of abortion law in the UK. A spokesperson said: \u201cThere continues to be debate about abortion in the UK.

That match was settled by Elliot Daly\u2019s 75th-minute try while last year\u2019s defining moment was Sam Underhill\u2019s last-ditch tackle to deny Scott Williams in England\u2019s 12-6 triumph.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of internationals come down to one or two moments in the game,\u201d said Daly. \u201cIt is how you come through those moments. If it is a tackle in the corner, then you have got to make it. If it\u2019s an attacking opportunity that might not look like it\u2019s on, then it presents itself, you have got to take that opportunity as well. I was lucky enough to be on the end of two good passes. I just tried to get back as quickly as possible from the kick, and I realised George [Ford] was on his bike straight away, and I could see Owen [Farrell] there as well. So I knew a couple of passes were on the cards, and it was just nice that two pretty world-class passes were put in front of me.\u201d</p> \n<p>With Vunipola sidelined, Alec Hepburn has been called in as loosehead cover with either Ellis Genge or Ben Moon expected to start against Wales.

That match was settled by Elliot Daly\u2019s 75th-minute try while last year\u2019s defining moment was Sam Underhill\u2019s last-ditch tackle to deny Scott Williams in England\u2019s 12-6 triumph. \u201cA lot of internationals come down to one or two moments in the game,\u201d said Daly. \u201cIt is how you come through those moments. If it is a tackle in the corner, then you have got to make it. If it\u2019s an attacking opportunity that might not look like it\u2019s on, then it presents itself, you have got to take that opportunity as well. I was lucky enough to be on the end of two good passes. I just tried to get back as quickly as possible from the kick, and I realised George [Ford] was on his bike straight away, and I could see Owen [Farrell] there as well. So I knew a couple of passes were on the cards, and it was just nice that two pretty world-class passes were put in front of me.\u201d With Vunipola sidelined, Alec Hepburn has been called in as loosehead cover with either Ellis Genge or Ben Moon expected to start against Wales. Charlie Ewels is also added, taking the place of Nick Isiekwe, who was part of the wider squad for the France match.",

But if you were around back then, you might be able to remember the last time Doncaster Rovers were at this stage of the FA Cup. Simply by showing up Grant McCann\u2019s side have equalled their best ever performance in the old cup, last achieved back in a bygone era. That time they were a second tier team whereas now they\u2019re in the third, but just like 63 years ago they face a top division team. Today, it\u2019s Crystal Palace. Then, it was Tottenham, Danny Blanchflower and all, who would go on to lose in the semi-final to eventual winners Manchester City, in the Bert Trautmann final. </p> \n  <p><strong>Back then rotation wasn\u2019t really a thing,</strong> even the finest teams treating lower league sides with due caution. But now there are bigger, more financially onerous imperatives, so the Premier League\u2019s finest tend to stick shadow teams out when they have to lower themselves to the scruffy lot. </p> \n  <p><strong>And yet, this season they don\u2019t really have an excuse.</strong> Four of the big six Premier League teams will be out of the tournament by the time the quarter-finals come around, so there could be a clear path through to the semis, possibly even the final. Surely Mr Roy must put out his best and brightest (which admittedly this season is a relative term), rather than pratting around with the reserves? Surely?</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201cMy hope would be that we continue to cherish the FA Cup,</strong> we continue to value it and we don\u2019t consistently make comparisons because these competitions are what they are and they also have their importance,\u201d he said this week. We\u2019ll find out how much he cherishes it shortly.</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 16.00 GMT</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from the Keepmoat. Clinical job done by Palace: they scored their goals at key stages of the first-half, then spent the second holding Doncaster at arm\u2019s length. The League One side were game enough, but their propensity for shooting straight at the goalkeeper made what could have been a ticklish afternoon for Wayne Hennessey rather straightforward in the end. Palace into the hat for the quarter-final draw on Monday evening. Peeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +2: Again, for what must be at least the sixth time, Doncaster shoot - Sadlier this time - straight at Hennessey. 90 mins: Van Aanholt and Benteke play a neat one-two, but the return from the striker is just a bit too heavy. Three minutes of injury time to come. 89 mins: Sub for Doncaster: May is off, and the magnificently-named teenager Rieves Boocock comes on for a few minutes. 87 mins: Hennessey winds up and gives a clearance the big one: so big, in fact, that it goes straight through to Marosi in t\u2019other goal. 85 mins: Doncaster get a free-kick on the left, which Sadlier sends over dangerously, Hennessey starts to come for it then changes his mind, and is a bit lucky the ball was too strong for May at the far stick. 83 mins: Not saying the game is winding down, but the BBC have just shown us two lingering close-ups of the floodlights. 81 mins: Kouyate deliciously spins and leaves Whiteman as if he\u2019s a training cone, so Whiteman does the only thing he can think of: he cynically legs him up. He is, of course, booked. 79 mins: Change for Palace: Townsend is withdrawn, James McArthur comes on. 78 mins: Marquis neatly flicks the ball past Van Aanholt, considers a couple of options but tries to shoot low towards the near-post, but again it\u2019s an easy save for Hennessey. 77 mins: The first thing Benteke does is miscontrol a Milivojevic pass. Ach, poor old Christian. 75 mins: Muffing that chance is more or less Batshuayi\u2019s last involvement: he\u2019s off, and Benteke is on. 74 mins: Corner now from the left for Palace, Kouyate rises brilliantly at the back stick but the header skims off his bonce and out for a goal kick. He\u2019s irked: that was a big chance and he\u2019s lucky that it probably won\u2019t make a difference. 72 mins: For the first time in what feels like ages, Palace attack. Townsend threads a nicely-weighted pass through to Batshuayi, clean in on goal, but his first touch is terrible and means he can\u2019t get his shot in, going round the keeper but in the end lucky to get a corner. 68 mins: Andrew whips over a terrific cross from the left but, even with Kane lurking nearby, gets there first to head away. They\u2019re plugging away, but you get the feeling it\u2019s a bit like trying to knock a wall down with a rolling pin. 66 mins: Sadlier is straight on and down the left, and his cross results in yet another corner for Donny. Marquis can\u2019t quite reach the cross when it comes in and it\u2019s cleared: sums the game for the home side up a bit, in that they have got into another decent position but can\u2019t make it into anything. 64 mins: Double swap for Doncaster: Tommy Rowe and Kieran Sadlier replace Coppinger and Crawford. 63 mins: Doncaster keep the ball for a bit, eventually working the ball to Kane in enough space to line up a shot, but like many of their efforts today seem to have been, it\u2019s straight at Hennessey who saves easily. 61 mins: Kouyate\u2019s first task is to mop up a mess left by Van Aanholt, languidly chasing May down after he nips past the Palace left-back. 59 mins: Sub for Palace: Ayew is off, replaced by Cheikou Kouyate, back after a couple of weeks out with an ankle twang. 57 mins: More pressure from Doncaster: from a corner, Schlupp has to throw himself into a clearing header, which falls to Kane and his own header loops just over the bar. The good news is that goal on the stroke of half-time hasn\u2019t completely knocked Doncaster onto their collective bottom. 54 mins: Great run by Coppinger in from the left, he semi-nutmegs Milivojevic, collects the loose ball then shoots, but it\u2019s deflected wide. They\u2019re keeping at it, are Doncaster. 52 mins: Frustrated by that miss, May has a little kick at Van Aanholt then pushes his opponent away. The Dutchman looks thoroughly baffled by the whole affair, peering rather curiously at his cross combatant. 51 mins: Doncaster go close twice! Whiteman tries one of those wobble shots where he hits it straight from miles out, and Hennessey has to keep his wits to punch it out. From the corner, Downing wins a header to send the ball towards goal, where Marquis is waiting to nod home, but in ahead of him nips May to try scoring himself, but ht sends it over the bar. Oh me oh May! 48 mins: Palace on the attack, as Townsend pops up on the left and clips a cross to the back post. Batshuayi is there but it\u2019s headed behind for a corner, from which the ball breaks out to Van Aanholt on the edge of the box. The less said about his attempted volley the better, mind. 46 mins: The players are out, and we\u2019re back underway for the second-half. Let\u2019s see how much air that late first-half goal has taken out of the atmosphere. Looks like Doncaster are heading out, but at least they\u2019re having a better day than these guys. Game over, you\u2019d think. Bit of a shame really: Doncaster weren\u2019t exactly monstering their Premier League opponents but they were at least pressing pretty well and creating the odd chance, while Palace looked a little complacent. If the goal hadn\u2019t been scored we might have been in for a competitive second 45, but not really now. Peeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins +1: Nicely worked goal from Palace. Milivojevic clips a nice ball over the Doncaster defence to Townsend at the back post, he heads it across goal where Meyer is waiting in the six-yard box, and he nods into the open goal. Meyer was offside when Milivojevic played his initial ball, one of those curiosities of the law because he was obviously gaining some sort of advantage, but he wasn\u2019t off from Townsend\u2019s set-up so it\u2019s fine by the rules. Oh, a killer, that one. 45 mins: One minute of added time. Marquis chases a big ball over the top but it\u2019s too big, and goes through to Hennessey. 44 mins: The half is petering out just a little bit. Neither team have created much in the last few minutes. 42 mins: May tries to dance and trick his way past Dann out on the Doncaster right, but the grizzled veteran just stands there and watches the flicks and half-stepovers, and May duly loses the ball and puts it out for a throw. 40 mins: Interestingly poised at the moment, this game. Doncaster are attacking sporadically but not having much joy in punching through, while Palace have the air of a team who expect to score another one quite shortly. Which could be dangerous for them. 38 mins: Doncaster attack, the ball drops to Kane on the edge of the box but his toe-poked effort is more or less straight at Hennessey. A few moments later a cross finds Coppinger in the box, but his header goes wide. 36 mins: Palace should have a penalty. Van Aanholt speeds down the left on the counter, reaches the byline and cuts a low cross back. Downing slides to block, but leaves his left arm trailing which the ball hits. Knowing full well that he\u2019s in trouble, Downing holds his face as if he\u2019d been bopped on the nose by a championship middleweight, and it seems to work: no penalty is given, despite Mike Dean having a pretty good view of it. 35 mins: Blair\u2019s error sets Ayew free down the left, but the Doncaster full-back at least scampers his way back to tackle and pour a nice big bucket of water on the fire he started. Dann then has the ball in the Palace left-back slot, but once more the hefty pest that is Marquis presses and forces him into an awful backpass which Hennessey has little chance of keeping out for a corner. 33 mins: Yet another Palace corner, this time from the left. Milivojevic takes, skimmed at head height and Batshuayi finds himself free about ten yards out at the near-post, but his header is blocked. Slack marking from Donny though. 30 mins: Townsend wins a free-kick deepish on the right for Palace, which Meyer swings into the box for Dann again at the back stick, but his header goes wide. 28 mins: Plenty of rough-housing, grappling and jostling in the penalty area from these corners. Not a factor with that one though: Milivojevic curls it out of play. That Andrew deflection from the previous corner had a hint of handball about it, looking at the replays, but would have been exceedingly harsh to give it. 27 mins: Meyer tries a shot from a tight angle to the left of goal, but it\u2019s deflected behind. Milivojevic steps up and skims in the cross, Dann goes up for the header but it came off Andrew\u2019s chest and out for another corner. 26 mins: Batshuayi tries to keep an overhit pass in play at the byline by trying to backheel it, but completely misses and only succeeds in tripping himself up, then caps the slapstick by falling over the advertising boards. Would only have been more complete had he emerged with a custard pie on his mush. 24 mins: Van Aanholt plays a pass back to Hennessey which bobbles around all over the place and the keeper, perhaps put off by the sight of Marquis bearing down on him, completely miscontrols it and concedes a corner. Fortunately for him, said corner fails to beat the first man, again. 22 mins: Decent move by Doncaster is half-cleared by Kelly, it\u2019s spread to May on the left corner of the box and he shoots, but despite the effort swerving and dipping, it swerves and dips well wide of the far post. 21 mins: Ayew breaks into the area from the left, he has Batshuayi and Townsend waiting for a low cross in the middle but for reasons passing understanding he tries a shot from an absurd angle. It\u2019s easily saved, and Townsend is firmly vexed. 20 mins: Doncaster win a corner on the right which they deploy a training ground move from. In the end it\u2019s whipped into the middle and Ward does well to stoop and head behind. They\u2019re not breaking through but the hosts are showing some positive intent. 19 mins: Kane lollipops his way in from the left and spanks a shot towards goal, but it\u2019s blocked and flies behind for a corner. Crawford delivers it, but can\u2019t beat the first man and Ayew heads clear. 16 mins: Donny aim for Big Marquis up top but Dann beats him to the header. Then the wily ol\u2019 fox eases Marquis out of the way after a ball down the left side of the penalty area. He was pegged as Doncaster\u2019s big danger man, and with good reason considering he\u2019s scored 22 goals this season, but it could be a long afternoon for Marquis. 14 mins: Coppinger tries to make inroads from the left corner of the area, but doesn\u2019t quite have the pace/control to get past his marker and has to shift the ball back, from where it\u2019s intercepted. 12 mins: Marquis lumbers purposefully down the right and is knocked over by Schlupp. Doncaster at least not completely cowed by going a goal down. 11 mins: Disappointing goal for the contest, that. Doncaster were just showing signs of making this a spicy one for Palace. Big task to drag things back from here. 8 mins: Decent goal. Milivojevic intercepts a pass midway in Palace\u2019s half, then feeds Schlupp on the halfway line and he drives towards goal. He skips past one, shifts into space beyond another and fires a low shot across goal from the left, it takes a slight deflection and goes into the bottom corner. Clinical stuff. Ah. Sorry. 7 mins: Coppinger and Herbie Kane - who I believe produced a number of talkies for MGM in the 1920s - harass Ward into giving away a corner. Nothing comes of it, but this is a positive start from Doncaster. 5 mins: No sort of pattern or rhythm to the play just yet. Coppinger, playing his 609th game for Doncaster, is penalised for a late tackle of Milivojevic. 2 mins: Doncaster are pressing hard from the off, not letting the bigger boys settle on the ball. Sensible, but they shouldn\u2019t get giddy. 1 min: We\u2019re off. Will we finally have some sort of upset in this round of the FA Cup? There\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for Gordon Banks. If you missed it, here\u2019s his obituary from these pages, as written by Brian Glanville. Mike Dean has just given the respective captains - Milivojevic and Marquis - cool guy handshakes. Obviously. The players are out onto the pitch. There\u2019s a bit of a noise inside the Keepmoat, mainly from those excited Donny supporters but helped by that enthusiastic away following. All getting a bit giddy in Donny. Some pre-match reading: Louise Taylor went to speak to beponytailed big man up top John Marquis, about scoring goals with Doncaster and his previous career: The young Marquis diversified, briefly, into modelling, promoting Rio Ferdinand\u2019s clothing range. \u201cI did a couple of shoots, hats, T-shirts, stuff like that. It was fun, a good experience and I still speak to Rio now and then but it\u2019s behind me now, I prefer being on the pitch.\u201d Grant McCann speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a huge task. It\u2019s a great occasion for the fans: it\u2019s for them, really. We\u2019ll stick to our gameplan: if it\u2019s good enough, brilliant, but if not at least we\u2019ve had a go. The players will give everything they\u2019ve got and make their families proud.\u201d Roy Hodgson speaks: \u201cWe\u2019ve done well to get this far, and it will be another tough tie today. I think we\u2019ve chosen a strong team: there were a couple of injuries, a few players unavailable to me, but this is as strong a team as I was hoping I could put out.\u201d Big news from the Keepmoat. Bit of a shame Mallik Wilks isn\u2019t playing today because, as I believe people cooler than me say, he\u2019s been \u2018doing bits\u2019 for Donny on loan from Leeds this season. He nearly was named, mind: he had been booked twice in the competition which should trigger a ban, but according to the Doncaster Free Press the club were sent a list of suspended players and he wasn\u2019t on it. However, they had a rummage through the rule books and said \u201cErm, are you absolutely sure about that?\u201d, to which the authorities replied \u201coh yeah ur right he is banned soz lol.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing, but it would have been extremely interesting to see what would\u2019ve happened had they relied on the initial reassurance and picked him. Martin Brown sounds like he approves of the Palace line-up and, unless that\u2019s a typo, the Palace manager too. He writes: \u201cGodson has chosen Meyer which is a real fans choice. After the last game his link play with the forwards was ace. Good call. You should be aware big Palace Ultras turnout today. Palace allocation sold out btw. Good for the FA Cup.\u201d A pretty strong XI for Palace, then. A few changes, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Mamadou Sakho given the afternoon off, Wayne Hennessey back in nets while of course Wilf Zaha is suspended, but other than that it\u2019s more or less the best team Roy Hodgson could have picked, beyond some Benteke/Batshuayi-related hair-splitting. Doncaster Rovers Marosi; Blair, Downing, Anderson, Andrew; Whiteman, Kane, Crawford; May, Marquis, Coppinger. Subs: Jones, Wright, Butler, Rowe, Sadlier, Boocock, Lewis. Crystal Palace Hennessey; Ward, Kelly, Dann, Van Aanholt; Meyer, Milivojevic; Schlupp, Townsend, Ayew; Batshuayi. Subs: Guaita, Woods, Tomkins, Riedewald, MacArthur, Kouyate, Benteke. Referee: Michael Dean (Wirral) What were you doing in 1956? I would wager that for many of you, not only were you not alive, but perhaps your parents were still twinkles too. But if you were around back then, you might be able to remember the last time Doncaster Rovers were at this stage of the FA Cup. Simply by showing up Grant McCann\u2019s side have equalled their best ever performance in the old cup, last achieved back in a bygone era. That time they were a second tier team whereas now they\u2019re in the third, but just like 63 years ago they face a top division team. Today, it\u2019s Crystal Palace. Then, it was Tottenham, Danny Blanchflower and all, who would go on to lose in the semi-final to eventual winners Manchester City, in the Bert Trautmann final. Back then rotation wasn\u2019t really a thing, even the finest teams treating lower league sides with due caution. But now there are bigger, more financially onerous imperatives, so the Premier League\u2019s finest tend to stick shadow teams out when they have to lower themselves to the scruffy lot. And yet, this season they don\u2019t really have an excuse. Four of the big six Premier League teams will be out of the tournament by the time the quarter-finals come around, so there could be a clear path through to the semis, possibly even the final. Surely Mr Roy must put out his best and brightest (which admittedly this season is a relative term), rather than pratting around with the reserves? Surely? \u201cMy hope would be that we continue to cherish the FA Cup, we continue to value it and we don\u2019t consistently make comparisons because these competitions are what they are and they also have their importance,\u201d he said this week. We\u2019ll find out how much he cherishes it shortly. Kick-off: 16.00 GMT",

      "body": "<p>It will be remembered here as the day Dan James staked his claim to be part of Great Britain\u2019s sprinting team for the 2020 Olympics. The 21-year-old was unplayable as his breathtaking pace turned this FA Cup tie on its head and took Swansea into the quarter-finals for only the fifth time in their history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/doncaster-crystal-palace-fa-cup-match-report\">Jeff Schlupp sets Crystal Palace on path to last eight against Doncaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is incredible to think that Swansea were close to allowing James to join Leeds on loan on deadline day. Swansea pulled the plug on that deal at the last moment and, on this evidence, James will have plenty more suitors than Leeds come the summer and be commanding an eight-figure fee in the process.</p> <p>It was surreal to watch at times as the Welshman tormented Brentford with his lightning speed time and again, so much so that three yellow cards were awarded for bringing him down and Ezri Konsa received a straight red for a professional foul on him. James was also involved in three of the four goals, including an outstanding individual effort, when he ran 85 yards with the ball, leaving a trail of Brentford defenders in his wake, before coolly finishing.</p> <p>By the time he departed in injury-time, to a standing ovation from the home supporters, Swansea were 4-1 ahead and there was a tangible buzz around the stadium and a clear sense that the crowd had witnessed something special.</p> <p>\u201cDan was OK, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Graham Potter, smiling. \u201cIf you are talking about the ability to sprint repeatedly, it\u2019s as high a level as you will see. He\u2019s got lots to work on. But he had an end product as well today and I thought he was sensational. I was a full-back myself and I\u2019d have probably got a yellow and a red, to be fair. It is a concern [the fouling] but that\u2019s the referee\u2019s job to deal with that. Dan\u2019s courage is incredible, to not only have the ability to do it but to ride the challenges.\u201d</p> <p>It does seem extraordinary that Swansea almost let James move to Leeds for a deal that was unfathomable in so many ways. Leeds proposed paying a \u00a31.5m loan fee, with no payment until the summer, and \u00a37m to follow in three instalments if they won promotion. It was dangerously close to the transfer deadline when Swansea saw sense and walked away.</p> <p>Asked how James has handled that situation since, Potter replied: \u201cHe\u2019s been top. These things happen in transfer windows and ultimately the clubs didn\u2019t agree the fee and you can see why on that performance. The [financial] numbers were too low, that\u2019s the reality in my opinion. When that happens he just gets on with being a footballer and he\u2019s been incredible for us. We\u2019re looking forward to working with him in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Potter went on to make the point that, if James does move in the summer, it should be to the Premier League. There will certainly be more and more scouts in attendance after this display. \u201cThere were a few instances, not just the goal, and it\u2019s just off-your-seat stuff, like \u2018wow\u2019,\u201d said Potter, who is not the sort to get carried away.</p> <p>It was a strange game in many ways, not least because Brentford were totally in control up until half-time and by far the superior team. Ollie Watkins had put them in front with a lovely finish at the end of a terrific counterattack and it is a measure of how poorly Swansea played in that opening 45 minutes that there were boos from the crowd at half-time.</p> <p>The mood soon changed after the interval. Bersant Celina\u2019s free-kick, after James was brought down, struck the near upright, cannoned off the back of Luke Daniels, the Brentford goalkeeper, and rolled over the line. Four minutes later Swansea had a second after James blocked Neal Maupay\u2019s pass just outside the Swansea area, knocked the ball out of his feet and set off on that exhilarating goal-scoring run that took him from one end of the pitch to the other.</p> <p>By now Brentford had lost their way. Thomas Frank, their manager, was booked for trying to stop Oli McBurnie from taking a quick throw and Konsa was sent off for hauling down James in full flight. Celina made it 3-1 when he wriggled past a couple of half-hearted challenges before curling a shot beyond Daniels. Then George Byers, after a neat exchange between James and Celina, stroked home the fourth. \u201cWe made a few individual mistakes that got punished unbelievably hard,\u201d lamented Frank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c162a616c34c1e168b9c172c8bdd6ddf02315ab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c162a616c34c1e168b9c172c8bdd6ddf02315ab7/15_0_2070_1242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swansea City\u2019s Bersant Celina (right) celebrates scoring his side\u2019s third goal against Brentford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swansea City\u2019s Bersant Celina (right) celebrates scoring his side\u2019s third goal against Brentford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/17/bristol-city-wolves-fa-cup-match-report\">Wolves into FA Cup quarter-finals as Ivan Cavaleiro sinks Bristol City</a> </p> </aside>",

      "bodyText": "It will be remembered here as the day Dan James staked his claim to be part of Great Britain\u2019s sprinting team for the 2020 Olympics. The 21-year-old was unplayable as his breathtaking pace turned this FA Cup tie on its head and took Swansea into the quarter-finals for only the fifth time in their history. It is incredible to think that Swansea were close to allowing James to join Leeds on loan on deadline day. Swansea pulled the plug on that deal at the last moment and, on this evidence, James will have plenty more suitors than Leeds come the summer and be commanding an eight-figure fee in the process. It was surreal to watch at times as the Welshman tormented Brentford with his lightning speed time and again, so much so that three yellow cards were awarded for bringing him down and Ezri Konsa received a straight red for a professional foul on him. James was also involved in three of the four goals, including an outstanding individual effort, when he ran 85 yards with the ball, leaving a trail of Brentford defenders in his wake, before coolly finishing. By the time he departed in injury-time, to a standing ovation from the home supporters, Swansea were 4-1 ahead and there was a tangible buzz around the stadium and a clear sense that the crowd had witnessed something special. \u201cDan was OK, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Graham Potter, smiling. \u201cIf you are talking about the ability to sprint repeatedly, it\u2019s as high a level as you will see. He\u2019s got lots to work on. But he had an end product as well today and I thought he was sensational. I was a full-back myself and I\u2019d have probably got a yellow and a red, to be fair. It is a concern [the fouling] but that\u2019s the referee\u2019s job to deal with that. Dan\u2019s courage is incredible, to not only have the ability to do it but to ride the challenges.\u201d It does seem extraordinary that Swansea almost let James move to Leeds for a deal that was unfathomable in so many ways. Leeds proposed paying a \u00a31.5m loan fee, with no payment until the summer, and \u00a37m to follow in three instalments if they won promotion. It was dangerously close to the transfer deadline when Swansea saw sense and walked away. Asked how James has handled that situation since, Potter replied: \u201cHe\u2019s been top. These things happen in transfer windows and ultimately the clubs didn\u2019t agree the fee and you can see why on that performance. The [financial] numbers were too low, that\u2019s the reality in my opinion. When that happens he just gets on with being a footballer and he\u2019s been incredible for us. We\u2019re looking forward to working with him in the future.\u201d Potter went on to make the point that, if James does move in the summer, it should be to the Premier League. There will certainly be more and more scouts in attendance after this display. \u201cThere were a few instances, not just the goal, and it\u2019s just off-your-seat stuff, like \u2018wow\u2019,\u201d said Potter, who is not the sort to get carried away. It was a strange game in many ways, not least because Brentford were totally in control up until half-time and by far the superior team. Ollie Watkins had put them in front with a lovely finish at the end of a terrific counterattack and it is a measure of how poorly Swansea played in that opening 45 minutes that there were boos from the crowd at half-time. The mood soon changed after the interval. Bersant Celina\u2019s free-kick, after James was brought down, struck the near upright, cannoned off the back of Luke Daniels, the Brentford goalkeeper, and rolled over the line. Four minutes later Swansea had a second after James blocked Neal Maupay\u2019s pass just outside the Swansea area, knocked the ball out of his feet and set off on that exhilarating goal-scoring run that took him from one end of the pitch to the other. By now Brentford had lost their way. Thomas Frank, their manager, was booked for trying to stop Oli McBurnie from taking a quick throw and Konsa was sent off for hauling down James in full flight. Celina made it 3-1 when he wriggled past a couple of half-hearted challenges before curling a shot beyond Daniels. Then George Byers, after a neat exchange between James and Celina, stroked home the fourth. \u201cWe made a few individual mistakes that got punished unbelievably hard,\u201d lamented Frank.",

      "bodyText": "New York mayor Bill de Blasio, mulling a presidential run, sought on Sunday to burnish his progressive credentials by accusing Amazon of caring only about \u201ccorporate image\u201d when it abruptly decided to pull out of building its second headquarters, or HQ2, in Long Island City. The tech giant\u2019s decision, de Blasio said, was \u201carbitrary and unfair to working people\u201d. Speaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, the mayor said Amazon walked away from a \u201cgood, fair deal\u201d and committed an \u201cabuse of corporate power\u201d when it announced on Thursday it would cancel the project without further negotiation, informing city and state leaders in a post on its website. Opponents of the deal argued that HQ2 would not benefit existing residents, instead contributing to housing becoming unaffordable for those on low incomes. De Blasio said Amazon\u2019s termination of it agreement with the people of New York, which would have brought around 25,000 jobs as part of a plan for which a majority of New Yorkers expressed support, would serve to confirm people\u2019s worst fears about corporate America. \u201cHere\u2019s the 1% dictating to everyone else even though we gave them a fair deal,\u201d de Blasio said, predicting that Amazon\u2019s decision \u201cwould frustrate people all over this country to see a company treat a neighborhood and a city like that\u201d. \u201cThey said they wanted a partnership, but the minute there were criticisms they walked away. What does that say to working people that a company would leave them high and dry simply because some people raised criticisms, but they had a clear majority on their side? \u201cThat\u2019s what bothers me. They were more concerned about their corporate image \u2026 and they let a lot of people down in the bargain.\u201d The fallout from Amazon\u2019s decision continues to reverberate politically, centrist Democrats accusing leftwingers of failing to understand the importance of job creation as part of achieving income equality. Without naming Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Queens congresswoman who was at the forefront of pushback against Amazon, de Blasio told NBC progressives needed to be concerned with jobs while also giving back to working people. \u201cWe can do that in the context of a thriving economy,\u201d he said. He sought to give Amazon\u2019s critics a lesson in corporate tax incentives, saying the $3bn incentive Amazon was offered would only have kicked in after it had contributed $27bn to local and state tax coffers. In Democratic ranks, young progressives are seeking to challenge their centrist elders in a dispute some think could split the party in a manner akin to the Tea Party\u2019s challenge to centrist Republicans a decade ago. On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez called the Amazon decision a victory for working people. \u201cAnything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers &amp; their neighbors defeated Amazon\u2019s corporate greed, its worker exploitation and the power of the richest man in the world,\u201d she tweeted, referring to Amazon owner Jeff Bezos. Citing a Newsweek report from last year, Ocasio-Cortez later asserted that \u201cAmazon workers have to urinate in bottles &amp; work while on food stamps to meet \u2018targets\u2019.\u201d That prompted a response from Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice-president of worldwide operations, who extended an invitation to the congresswoman to tour Amazon facilities. \u201cThese claims simply aren\u2019t true,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cWe are proud of our jobs with excellent pay ($15 min), benefits from day 1, &amp; lots of other benefits like our Career Choice pre-paid educational programs. Why don\u2019t you come take a tour &amp; see for yourself \u2026 we\u2019d love to have you!\u201d De Blasio has not committed to a presidential run or said he will not mount one, but he has travelled to early voting states, usually a sign of ambition. Some observers have questioned whether the collapse of the Amazon deal will damage him. On Sunday, the mayor pitched the question beyond city limits. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything about the Amazon decision affects the bigger debate in this country about the fact that if we don\u2019t address this income inequality our country\u2019s security and stability is threatened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be talking about that all over this nation.\u201d",

If the UK is to continue to be a world leader after Brexit, foreign aid needs to remain at the forefront. It shows what we can be, and have been, in terms of generosity, integrity, and humanity. Girish Menon Chief executive at ActionAid UK \u2022 After hearing about it from your correspondent, I was eager to read the report Global Britain: A Twenty-First Century Vision to which the former foreign secretary has contributed an enthusiastic foreword. Part of its \u201ccreative thinking\u201d, which Johnson commends, involves reviving that old chestnut of forging closer links with Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2013 the \u201cAnglosphere\u201d, or what used to be known as the \u201cwhite dominions\u201d. According to the report (p30) this is an idea that has waxed and waned \u201cever since the Imperial Federation League in the late twentieth century\u201d. Those of us who remember the 1990s tend to associate it more with Blur and Oasis than with the Imperial Federation League, which was actually established in 1884. But like many adherents of \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d, Mr Johnson may simply have decided to draw a veil over the sad decades of decline that have followed the death of Queen Victoria. Professional historians live busy lives, and if we spent our time calling out every crass, reactionary, historically illiterate piece of nonsense put out by the Brexit camp, we\u2019d do little else. Just this once, however, I\u2019m happy to help. Professor Philip Murphy Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies \u2022 Few people would argue that there shouldn\u2019t be a discussion about how to make foreign aid more effective. However, the focus of this should be on how we obtain even better value for money and ensure that every pound spent delivers real change for the poorest and most vulnerable people. To question the efficacy of UK foreign aid, or the excellent work of an independent DfID, ignores the vital role that UK Aid plays in putting Britain at the forefront of tackling some of the world\u2019s greatest challenges \u2013 from reducing conflict, violence and disease to helping build more stable and prosperous communities and countries that offer opportunities for greater economic cooperation. A win-win for us all. This is the global influence of which the UK can be so proud, and with so many uncertainties about Britain\u2019s future, now is not the time to be turning inwards. To question our commitment to foreign aid, or to entertain focusing more narrowly on purely \u201ccommercial interests\u201d, would diminish the UK\u2019s global standing and be at odds with becoming a truly Global Britain.

But while European Athletics allows anyone who has run 6.78sec to compete, British Athletics decided to implement a far stricter selection requirement of 6.60sec \u2013 a time Kilty, who has run 6.63sec, is just outside.</p> <p>Strangely the 60m standard for men is far tougher than that for any other event \u2013 and would have won a medal during the last European Indoors \u2013 while the British Athletics women\u2019s standard of 7.25sec would not even have made the final. Black, however, insisted there was nothing wrong with it. \u201cWe had a very clear policy which says the qualification mark is 6.60sec,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the men\u2019s mark since 2013 for the European Indoors.

It\u2019s a large and competitive team, it includes five previous gold medallists and other previous medallists. It\u2019s a great team. There\u2019s just one thing that looks unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Black also predicted that Laura Muir, who will be looking to retain her 1500m and 3,000m titles, would be one of the stars of the championships when they begin on 1 March. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen Laura evolve as an athlete and as a performer and as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cI am incredibly impressed with how she deals with the different circumstances she finds herself in. She has a brilliant team around her with her coach Andy Young sharing the responsibilities. I\u2019m very confident she knows what she\u2019s doing.

If he does so, it will be fantastic for him to be there.\u201d",

Senior figures such as Dawn Butler and Ian Lavery, the party chair, have put their names to it, but other MPs have resisted, with Anna Turley and Lucy Powell saying their Labour membership cards were enough of a loyalty pledge to the party. McDonnell, who has signed the pledge himself, said: \u201cPeople wanted reassurance from all of us that we are Labour through and through.\u201d The shadow chancellor\u2019s words on Brexit did not appear to placate Leslie, who said McDonnell was \u201cclearly rowing back on Labour\u2019s conference policy\u201d by saying a second referendum would be looked at only in extremis. \u201cThere\u2019s a disastrous Brexit in less than 1,000 hours. And UK Labour stands on the sidelines pretending to face all ways. What an utter tragedy,\u201d he said. Smith added: \u201cTheresa May [is] not the only one ticking the clock down.\u201d However, other Labour MPs were buoyed by McDonnell\u2019s claim that he would look at the plan put forward by Kyle and Wilson. They hold out hope that the leadership will be persuaded of the need for another referendum if Labour\u2019s proposals fail to win over parliament. Kate Green, a Labour MP who supports the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said: \u201cIt is welcome that John McDonnell has today confirmed that Labour\u2019s proposals need to be brought forward by the end of this month and that if they can\u2019t be agreed in parliament then the party will have no alternative but to follow its conference policy and start campaigning for a people\u2019s vote. \u201cIt\u2019s also encouraging that he also confirmed that the party leadership is willing to look at new compromise proposals to avoid the threat of a no-deal Brexit by approving a deal \u2013 but only subject to it being put to the public.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An Australian-first study into image-base sexual abuse has found nearly one in 10 adults have taken nude photos or recorded footage of others without consent. RMIT researchers surveyed 4,200 people aged 16 to 49 and found more than 6% of respondents had shared the images or footage and close to 5% had made threats to do so. Nearly 9% of respondents had captured images or footage without consent. And 1 in 5 survey respondents had been victims. Image-based sexual abuse is sometimes referred to by the narrower definition of \u201crevenge porn\u201d. The study, carried out in 2016, found men were significantly more likely than women to admit to the behaviour and offenders were more likely to share photos or videos of people they knew such as a partner, ex-partner, friend or family member. The report said lesbian, gay and bisexual survey participants were more likely than heterosexual participants to engage in image-based sexual abuse. Associate professor Nicola Henry said while there had been some focus on e-safety for high school students \u2013 sexting or using apps such as Snapchat \u2013 there was a need for education programs to target older aged groups. \u201cI think there has been a tendency to assume digital abuse and harassment only happens in younger cohorts,\u201d Henry told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe think the focus should be on designing respectful relationship education.\u201d She said the behaviour ranged from upskirting and downblousing to partners seeking revenge post breakup. \u201cWe also know of computer hackers accessing a victim\u2019s webcam and their personal computer files as well as sexual assaults or rapes being filmed,\u201d she said. Henry said there was a correlation between image-based sexual abuse and domestic violence. She cited examples of men secretly recording their partners or ex partners in the shower, getting changed or involved in sexual acts. The research, which will published next month in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour, showed that many survey respondents held victim blaming-attitudes towards revenge porn.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Daley and Gladys Berejiklian remain locked in a tight race less than five weeks from the New South Wales election, according to a new Essential poll which also indicates about one in four voters giving their first-preference vote to minor parties or independents. Labor narrowly leads the Coalition 51 to 49 on a two-party-preferred basis, according to the survey, representing a swing of 5.3% since the last election in 2015. The poll reaffirms the possibility the Coalition could be facing minority government after election day on 23 March, or be returned with only a wafer-thin majority. However the ABC\u2019s election analyst Antony Green has warned this state election is particularly hard to predict given the number of tight, three-cornered contests around the state which would likely render the usual election calculator redundant. \u201cIt promises to be quite a close contest, and it\u2019s also highly likely we won\u2019t know who the government is at the end of election night,\u201d Green wrote last week. Labor\u2019s primary vote sits at 36%, according to the Essential survey, up from 34.1% at the last election, while the Coalition\u2019s primary vote is 39%, down from 45.6% in 2015. The drop in the Coalition\u2019s primary vote in this survey also coincides with the growth in support for One Nation, with 8% of voters saying they would give them their first-preference vote. The party did not contest the previous state election. A similar proportion of voters said they would give first-preference vote to the Greens (9%), a figure that is largely unchanged since the 2015 election when the party attracted 10.3% of the primary vote. It comes despite a significant split emerging in 2018 and the departure of upper house MP Jeremy Buckingham from the party. A further 9% of those surveyed said they planned to vote for an independent or other minor party, meaning 26% of voters would give their first preference to someone other than Labor or the Coalition. The poll of 544 people was conducted by Essential Media between 6 and 11 February, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5%. It is consistent with a UComms/ReachTel poll conducted for the Sydney Morning Herald, published in December 2018, which also found Labor narrowly leading 51-49 on a two party-preferred result, and a January Newspoll which put the parties at 50-50. That Newspoll showed a similar proportion of voters (25%) giving their votes to minor parties or independents, with One Nation\u2019s primary vote at 6%, the Greens at 10% and \u201cothers\u201d at 9%. Survey respondents were also asked about the perceptions of the two leaders. Just over a third of people had a positive view of Berejiklian, or 35%, while 25% held a negative view of the Liberal leader. Daley was viewed positively by 27% of people, while 20% said they held a negative view. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given Daley only became leader of the party in November, 24% of respondents said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to say either way, compared with 16% who said the same about Berejiklian. The Coalition swept to power in NSW in 2011 in a landslide victory, and won again in 2015 despite an almost 10% swing to Labor, holding on to 54 of 93 lower house seats. The current term, which has seen the government change premiers from Mike Baird to Berejikilian, has been marked by a series of controversial policy decisions and backflips, including an aborted ban on greyhound racing, a series of council amalgamations that were abandoned partway through, as well as delays to major infrastructure projects such as the Sydney CBD light rail. The Coalition government\u2019s majority was reduced in two bruising byelection defeats this term \u2013 with the government losing the rural seat of Orange to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in 2016, and Wagga Wagga to independent Joe McGirr in 2018. It currently has a six-seat majority in the lower house. Labor has a tumultuous term of its own, with former leader Luke Foley stepping down in November following allegations he had inappropriately touched an ABC journalist at a Christmas party. Foley denied the allegations. Labor currently holds 34 seats in the lower house, and would need to pick up another 13 to form government its own right.",

      "bodyText": "Labor will introduce a bill to crack down on payday lending on Monday, using a reform first promised by Malcolm Turnbull to test Scott Morrison\u2019s control of the lower house. Labor and the Nationals are also pushing for measures to improve small businesses\u2019 access to justice, an alliance of interests likely to force the Morrison government to back down on its opposition to a bill that passed the Senate on Thursday or risk losing a second substantive lower house vote in a week. Parliament returns on Monday for the last sitting week before the budget in April, with Senate estimates set to scrutinise $420m of Paladin offshore detention security contracts and opposition parties keen to test the minority government in the lower house. After Labor and the crossbench combined to pass a bill for medical evacuations from offshore detention last week, the Morrison government has moved to avoid similar embarrassment by promising to support a motion calling for a royal commission into disability care. Tony Burke, the manager of opposition business, said that at least three issues will return to the lower house on Monday: the disability royal commission, small business measures, and stronger penalties for corporate misconduct. \u201cLast Thursday, the government was opposed to all three,\u201d he said. \u201cFour days later, the government is preparing to backflip on all three. \u201cThese backflips are from a prime minister who will say and do anything to stay in office, even if that means clinging to power by his fingernails.\u201d Also on the notice paper is a private members bill to be introduced by Labor MP Madeleine King to impose a ceiling on the total payments that can be made under rent-to-buy schemes and restricts the amount rental companies and payday lenders can charge customers to 10% of their income. In November 2016 then revenue and financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer committed the government to lower the proposed cap on small amount credit contract and a new cap on total payments on a consumer lease. After a backlash from Nationals MP George Christensen and other backbenchers, the government released for consultation but never introduced to parliament its legislation to enact the policy. In August Turnbull wrote to Labor MP Milton Dick agreeing that it is \u201cimportant that vulnerable consumers are afforded appropriate levels of protection\u201d. He said that legislation \u201cwill be progressed this year, with the changes applying 12 months after its passage\u201d. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie said she \u201ccan\u2019t see why the government wouldn\u2019t support\u201d the payday lending bill, since it was the Coalition\u2019s idea originally. \u201cWe have very little protection for payday lending, which preys on the most vulnerable people, some of who don\u2019t know they are paying hundreds of percent interest,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Labor\u2019s payday lending bill faces a steep path to success as conventional wisdom (although rejected by eminent academics and jurists) suggests an absolute majority of 76 seats is needed to suspend standing orders and pass a private members bill. But the opposition faces a lower bar to pass its small-business access to justice measures, which are contained in a government bill that has passed the Senate. It therefore must come on for a vote which can be won by a simple majority of 75 in the lower house. On Friday Nationals MPs Barnaby Joyce, Keith Pitt and Andrew Broad told Guardian Australia they support the measures, designed to help small business fight competition law cases against big business by applying for no-costs orders. The assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, has carriage of both the payday lending and small-business access to justice bills but has refused to say how the government will handle the challenges. The Nationals\u2019 support for Labor\u2019s amendment to a government bill means the Morrison government must either pass the measures, which are not Liberal policy, or risk a loss on the floor of the lower house. Labor shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said that \u201ceither way we get a win for small business\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the fortunes of a bad government, this is about benefits for good small businesses,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cAccess to justice for small business is a policy we\u2019ve had for three years \u2013 it allows small businesses to take on the big end of town in court without being bankrupted by having to pay legal costs if they lose. \u201cIt\u2019s not an ideological measure, it\u2019s a practical measure to boost economic growth and help small business.\u201d Independent MP Bob Katter will introduce a bill to use the Reserve Bank of Australia to set up a reconstruction and development board to reduce cattle farmers\u2019 debt and interest rates. Katter raised the plan on Wednesday, threatening to support Labor\u2019s call for two extra sitting weeks in March unless the Coalition backed the policy. But the threat of extra weeks has receded, after MP Andrew Wilkie withdrew his support for them.",

When the concept of conferences was first floated it was met with criticism and questions of fairness. AFL head of women\u2019s football, Nicole Livingstone, said, \u201cwe recognise in having a seven-game home and away season not everyone will play each other once, so conferences allow for fairer ladders that reflect that\u201d. \u201cFair\u201d is the term that appears to have been forgotten in the creation of the conferences. Advantages are now clearly based on the conference you are in and the sides you do not play in the regular season. At the conclusion of round three, a combined ladder of Conference A and B provides a perfectly ordered, traditional ladder, signalling the strength of Conference A. The AFL anticipated the conferences to be more even and the vast improvement of Fremantle has obviously added a complication to their split of the 10 teams. But when looking at Conference A, a group that consists of the reigning premiers, a new side bursting at the seams with stars, the 2017 premiers and a side who narrowly missed a spot in the grand final in the past two years, the conferences were off-balance from the outset. The biggest concern raised over the weekend in regard to the strength of Conference A was how fair a finals series can be in this format. The first ever AFLW finals series will see the two top teams in each conference qualify for a preliminary final spot. The top team in Conference A will host the second team in Conference B and vice versa. Four rounds of the 2019 AFLW season remain and we could see some changes in competitiveness between the conferences, but at this stage, questions about the fairness the format provides need to be asked. It also raises concerns for the future of the competition when it expands in 2020 to include four new teams in St Kilda, the West Coast Eagles, Gold Coast Suns and Richmond. If the term \u201cfair\u201d was the driving force for conferences, the definition of the term needs to be re-established because as it stands, it does not apply.

Stalker came from a family with Irish roots and his mother was a Roman Catholic; he could not, it was felt, be accused of taking the establishment\u2019s side.</p> <p>Stalker\u2019s job was to find out exactly how six unarmed men had been shot during a brief period in 1982 and whether there was a deliberate policy of killing men believed to be IRA members rather than arresting and charging them.

For a lifelong Tory such as May, this is an intolerable prospect.</p> \n<p>Which is why I do not believe most cabinet ministers when they insist the \u201clast thing\u201d they want is a general election. For a start, they believe, with quietly growing confidence, that they can beat Corbyn unambiguously this time. And \u2013 remarkably \u2013 they\u2019d rather take that chance than risk the wrath of the far right by acceding to a new referendum. Which, when you think about it, is seriously pathetic.</p> \n<p>Yet, in these urgent and decisive times, another head-to-head between May and the Labour leader would simply not offer the choice that the nation needs. Perhaps uniquely in the history of modern general elections, it would be a sideshow. So \u2013 given this tragic abdication of responsibility by the two main party leaders \u2013 it is for members of parliament to shrug off the chains of tribalism, the discipline of the party whip and the growing threat of constituency deselection. If ever there was a time to think, without fear, of the public interest, and to set aside partisanship, this is it. We inhabit a digitised culture of political cantonisation, reflexive hostility and snarling defensiveness. Which is to say that what is needed is, in the truest sense of the word, counter-cultural.</p> \n<p>There is still a chance for MPs to prove themselves worthy of the public trust, and a way of giving voters \u2013 including those who opted for leave in 2016 \u2013 a final chance to say whether this is really what they had in mind. A few steps away from the cliff\u2019s edge, we still have time to think again. There is no direction to history, no implacable force of providence driving us towards an act of irrevocable, collective self-harm.</p> \n<p>What happens now will happen because of human agency, or its absence.

Rules were broken when 22 people were ordered to pay before they could start treatment, despite the seriousness of their condition, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has acknowledged. Three of the 22 were women who were prevented from having an abortion. A minister in the department has admitted that the 22 were wrongly told they had to pay upfront after hospital personnel made mistakes in their interpretation of a controversial rule that has led to migrants being denied care for cancer, heart complaints and other serious medical conditions. The admission is a blow to the government\u2019s controversial decision to force hospitals in England to demand the cost of treatment upfront from people deemed ineligible for free care. Data published by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act in November 2018 showed that across 84 of England\u2019s 148 acute hospital trusts, 2,279 patients were charged upfront between October 2017 and June 2018. Under the charging regulations those in need of \u201cimmediately necessary and/or urgent\u201d NHS care should receive it without having to pay in advance, regardless of their immigration status. But campaigners, including doctors\u2019 groups and health charities, claim the rule is often being misapplied and is leading directly to migrants who cannot afford to pay the charges missing out on treatment. The errors came to light during a recent government review into the operation of advance charges, which ministers ordered NHS hospitals in England to start implementing from October 2017 as part of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d approach to immigration. Labour and the Liberal Democrats want the rules scrapped, while several medical royal colleges, the British Medical Association and the Equality and Human Rights Commission have all voiced deep unease about the policy. In a recent parliamentary answer Zahida Manzoor, a Conservative peer, said the review had identified \u201c22 case studies [which] included instances where individuals were required to make advance payment for treatment that the department has concluded was arguably, on proper analysis, immediately necessary and/or urgent\u201d. Lady Manzoor did not say if any of the 22 did hand over money in order to get their treatment, how seriously unwell those involved were or what medical conditions they had. But a 113-page legal document, released by the government during a judicial review last year of the charging regulations, made clear that: \u201cEvidence suggests some cases of poor practice where treatment the department [DHSC] considers to be \u2018immediately necessary\u2019 and/or \u2018urgent\u2019 is treated as non-urgent.\u201d It added that the 22 included \u201cthree examples concerning pregnant women who have said that they chose not to have an abortion due to a requirement to make advance payment, with the result that they proceeded with the pregnancy\u201d.

Scythed down in the 75th minute Addison stepped up to take the resulting penalty but her effort lacked power and Ellie Roebuck got down to her right to parry it away. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of young players but we are patient. We respected Tottenham, we knew what their strengths were and we nullified them and it\u2019s great to come away with a clean sheet,\u201d added Houghton. \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased with the performance despite the scoreline,\u201dsaid Spurs captain Jenna Schillaci. \u201cWe had a game plan and I think we stuck to it really well. It was unfortunate to give a set piece away but they\u2019re quality players and we knew if we gave them chances they\u2019d take them.\u201d City go into the hat for Monday\u2019s quarter-final draw knowing next Saturday\u2019s League Cup final opponents, Arsenal, are out, having lost 3-0 to Chelsea. A goal in either half from Beth England and another from Jonna Andersson ensured the Blues cruised through while Lisa Robertson scored twice as Championship Durham knocked out WSL side Bristol City. Kirsty Linnett and Rinsola Babajide ensured Liverpool booked their place in the quarter-finals against Millwall Lionesses. An 82nd minute goal from Rakel H\u00f6nnud\u00f3ttir earned Reading a 2-1 win over Birmingham. Jodie Hutton scored the winning penalty in a shootout after her hat-trick helped Aston Villa come from 2-0 down against Sheffield United to level the score at 3-3 in the 96th minute sending the game into extra time. Casey Stoney got the better of her former England teammate and the new London Bees manager Rachel Yankey as Manchester United ran out 3-0 winners. And West Ham survived going behind to a 14th-minute penalty to beat Huddersfield 8-1, with Leanne Kiernan scoring a hat-trick.",

Her friend travels over from Australia with a Japanese knife in her luggage; she loves to chop vegetables and needs the best knife to enjoy doing that. So while the parrot eats some finely sliced kale from my garden, we toast our yearly meeting with some wonderful wine.

The halves are nothing fancy \u2013 I wait till there is a special offer at Waitrose or Tesco, or Laytons, and buy a dozen or so. They are perfect for an evening alone when you need a bit of a lift, or for a little lunch for two. I keep one in the car, too, James Bond-style, though I don\u2019t have the wine cooler to match. My half-bottle in the boot is for emergencies. I haven\u2019t had the emergency yet, but who knows? It might be my Brexit bottle.</p> <p>As well as the everyday halves, I keep Bollinger for what I think of as ordinary special occasions but, when I can afford it, I buy in some splendid champagne.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be Krug every time \u2013 and I could not afford to buy the 1988 now, as it\u2019s about \u00a3500 a bottle. The secret is to keep your wine for so long that you don\u2019t remember what it cost when you bought it and you don\u2019t care what it costs now.</p> <p>I started buying wine to lay down in 1987, on the advice of my literary agent at the time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/22/publishing-kavanagh-julian-barnes\" title=\"\">the late Pat Kavanagh</a>. Her husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/30/julian-barnes-sense-of-another-ending\" title=\"\">Julian Barnes</a>, is far more serious about wine than I shall ever be, but Pat was able to smuggle out a few bottles back then \u2013 and as I was 28 and knew nothing, beautiful wine was a revelation. Like liquid history. How could it get better and better over time? Why didn\u2019t it give me a headache, even if we drank too much?</p> <p>I took Pat\u2019s advice and put aside some money every time I published a book, so that I could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/sep/12/save-money-wine\" title=\"\">buy en primeur</a>, keep the wine in bond, and then just leave it alone. I was also able to buy some vintages from the 1980s, and I still have a few bottles of 1985 Lynch-Bages. That has sentimental value because it was the year I published my first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/03/jeanettewinterson\" title=\"\">Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</a></em>. I bought the Krug with money from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/02/fiction.jeanettewinterson\" title=\"\">Written on the Body</a></em> in 1992.</p> <p>Over the years I have gone on buying \u2013 not with any great intent, or much of a plan, except pleasure for myself and others.</p> <p>As a writer, I live on my wits. The money I make is erratic and unpredictable, and I cannot know from one year to the next whether I will have a surplus or not. On the other hand, I avoid holidays because they make me panic, so there is usually something in the kitty for a few decent cases of red wine and champagne to put aside for later. Or much later. As I get older, I am glad to have wine that is companionably getting older with me.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have special wine glasses and I don\u2019t show off. I never tell anyone what we are drinking unless they ask. If anyone asks, there will be a story about the wine itself, and a story about when and why I bought it. But it is enough for me to know those stories and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/apr/13/foodanddrink\" title=\"\">I don\u2019t want to be a wine bore</a>.</p> <p>I do want to be a wine evangelist, though \u2013 after all, I was brought up to be a missionary and save souls \u2013 so I just can\u2019t let go of the fire to convert others, to show them what they are missing.</p> <p>Wine is wonderful.

In 1606, with James I on the throne, and the Puritans pushing for political ascendency, Britain passed the Act to Repress the Odious and Loathsome sin of Drunkenness. Wine was especially frowned upon by the Puritans because much of it came to Britain from France and Spain \u2013 Catholic countries.</p> <p>Unfortunately, snarling at Catholic wine followed the usual route of the law of unintended consequences, and boosted the homegrown gin trade. By 1700, the English population of less than 7 million was drinking 18m gallons of gin every year.</p> <p>In the 1960s, foreign holidays and air travel, and the beginning of mass tourism, slowly brought wine back home for the British. At that time, when I was too young to drink anything except milk, wine accounted for less than 10% of alcohol consumption in the UK. Real men drank beer. Real women drank gin \u2013 or if you were unlucky, sweet sherry and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/13/babycham-history-sparkling-perry-champagne-henry-jeffreys\" title=\"\">Babycham</a>.</p> <p>Girls, though, were soon steered down the aisles towards wine, usually white, by the drinks industry. Let\u2019s not forget that there is a drinks industry, nor should we imagine that our tastes and habits are just our own thing. Selling us alcohol is like selling us anything else \u2013 it makes money. Wine has been a success story for the British drinks industry. In 2017, we spent nearly \u00a311bn on wine.</p> <p>Are we drinking too much? That depends on how much you are drinking.</p> <p>I drink with dinner five days a week and, although I look for value, I don\u2019t look for cheapness. If someone offers me supermarket plonk, I much prefer to drink water. I\u2019m not drinking for the alcohol; I am drinking because I love wine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/06/david-nutt-drugs-alcohol\" title=\"\">David Nutt</a>, the genial and sensible pharmacologist, who was David Cameron\u2019s drugs adviser, got fired for saying that alcohol is routinely more dangerous than the drugs ecstasy and LSD. He was right that our drugs policy is more about morality and hysteria than evidence-based science, and he is right that alcohol abuse is a personal and social scourge. Unfortunately, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/27/hangxiety-why-alcohol-gives-you-a-hangover-and-anxiety\" title=\"\">answer, currently in development, is alcosynth</a> \u2013 a product that he hopes will give us all the relaxation and party feel of drinking without the hangover and liver damage.</p> <p>The mistake here is to concentrate on the effects of alcohol \u2013 good and bad \u2013 rather than the pleasure of drinking.</p> <p>Nothing would persuade me to give up wine and I make sure there is no need to do so. The thing about pleasure is that you have to keep it pleasurable. Addiction and dependency are not about pleasure.</p> <p>If I had been following health guidelines over the years I would have been scared of eggs, avoided carbs, red meat, full fat milk and butter, while confronting supermarket shelves stacked with obesity-crisis refined sugar products and processed food.</p> <p>Instead, I eat well and I drink well. My motto is: one liver, one life.</p> <p>A real pleasure is drinking different wines according to the season. I eat seasonally so why wouldn\u2019t I drink seasonally?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the British hadn\u2019t become more adventurous with wine, we\u2019d still be drinking Blue Nun.</p> <footer> <cite>Jeanette Winterson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s winter now, so for my everyday drinking I\u2019m enjoying a Guigal C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne. Majestic sells it, along with a current favourite, a lovely Bourgogne Pinot Noir 2016 Nicolas Potel. That wine is 12.5% ABV, which is what wine used to be before climate change gave us 14% as the new normal.</p> <p>I am never without a few bottles of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/25/dry-january-almost-over-try-new-wine-fiona-beckett\" title=\"\">Berry Bros\u2019s Good Ordinary Claret</a> which, at a tenner a time, is excellent value. In fact, I am thinking of joining its wine club to extend my range of what I drink regularly. But am I wrong? Wine that you know is like a familiar friend: reliable, at the ready, comforting, not too demanding. How many friends do I need?</p> <p>On the other hand, if the British hadn\u2019t become more adventurous with wine, we\u2019d still be drinking Blue Nun. British food and drink were pretty awful before we got the hang of Europe. With Brexit waving goodbye to all that, no wonder we need a stiff drink.</p> <p>Travelling is a great opportunity to try new wines you may never want to bring home. When I travel I stick to local wines and ask advice.</p> <p>Working in Bilbao recently, I had wonderful evenings drinking wine that cost between \u20ac3 and \u20ac5 a glass. On each visit, the barman gave me a range of styles to try, explaining the differences between modern and traditional Spanish wine-making. That is better than a YouTube tutorial, and I have found that around the world people are proud to share their knowledge \u2013 and, if you are lucky, the beautiful young wines in plastic containers that will never be bottled or exported, but which are alive with the land where they are made, and pour into the tumbler like a genie out of a bottle.</p> <p>All of this helps you navigate a wine list or make an educated guess when faced with unfamiliar bottles. Most of all, it\u2019s fun.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what I want to stress about wine. Pleasure and fun.</p> <p>We are not on this Earth for long. Enjoyment and happiness matter. Sharing with friends is important. Spending a little more money on a little less wine will increase the good things in life.</p>",

On the other hand, I avoid holidays because they make me panic, so there is usually something in the kitty for a few decent cases of red wine and champagne to put aside for later. Or much later. As I get older, I am glad to have wine that is companionably getting older with me. I don\u2019t have special wine glasses and I don\u2019t show off. I never tell anyone what we are drinking unless they ask. If anyone asks, there will be a story about the wine itself, and a story about when and why I bought it. But it is enough for me to know those stories and I don\u2019t want to be a wine bore. I do want to be a wine evangelist, though \u2013 after all, I was brought up to be a missionary and save souls \u2013 so I just can\u2019t let go of the fire to convert others, to show them what they are missing. Wine is wonderful. Wine is earth and sunshine, frost and harvest. It is solace and celebration. The miserable puritan Brexit British live in constant fear of pleasure. In 1606, with James I on the throne, and the Puritans pushing for political ascendency, Britain passed the Act to Repress the Odious and Loathsome sin of Drunkenness. Wine was especially frowned upon by the Puritans because much of it came to Britain from France and Spain \u2013 Catholic countries. Unfortunately, snarling at Catholic wine followed the usual route of the law of unintended consequences, and boosted the homegrown gin trade. By 1700, the English population of less than 7 million was drinking 18m gallons of gin every year. In the 1960s, foreign holidays and air travel, and the beginning of mass tourism, slowly brought wine back home for the British. At that time, when I was too young to drink anything except milk, wine accounted for less than 10% of alcohol consumption in the UK. Real men drank beer. Real women drank gin \u2013 or if you were unlucky, sweet sherry and Babycham. Girls, though, were soon steered down the aisles towards wine, usually white, by the drinks industry. Let\u2019s not forget that there is a drinks industry, nor should we imagine that our tastes and habits are just our own thing. Selling us alcohol is like selling us anything else \u2013 it makes money. Wine has been a success story for the British drinks industry. In 2017, we spent nearly \u00a311bn on wine. Are we drinking too much? That depends on how much you are drinking. I drink with dinner five days a week and, although I look for value, I don\u2019t look for cheapness. If someone offers me supermarket plonk, I much prefer to drink water. I\u2019m not drinking for the alcohol; I am drinking because I love wine. David Nutt, the genial and sensible pharmacologist, who was David Cameron\u2019s drugs adviser, got fired for saying that alcohol is routinely more dangerous than the drugs ecstasy and LSD. He was right that our drugs policy is more about morality and hysteria than evidence-based science, and he is right that alcohol abuse is a personal and social scourge. Unfortunately, his answer, currently in development, is alcosynth \u2013 a product that he hopes will give us all the relaxation and party feel of drinking without the hangover and liver damage. The mistake here is to concentrate on the effects of alcohol \u2013 good and bad \u2013 rather than the pleasure of drinking. Nothing would persuade me to give up wine and I make sure there is no need to do so. The thing about pleasure is that you have to keep it pleasurable. Addiction and dependency are not about pleasure. If I had been following health guidelines over the years I would have been scared of eggs, avoided carbs, red meat, full fat milk and butter, while confronting supermarket shelves stacked with obesity-crisis refined sugar products and processed food. Instead, I eat well and I drink well. My motto is: one liver, one life. A real pleasure is drinking different wines according to the season. I eat seasonally so why wouldn\u2019t I drink seasonally? It\u2019s winter now, so for my everyday drinking I\u2019m enjoying a Guigal C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne. Majestic sells it, along with a current favourite, a lovely Bourgogne Pinot Noir 2016 Nicolas Potel. That wine is 12.5% ABV, which is what wine used to be before climate change gave us 14% as the new normal. I am never without a few bottles of Berry Bros\u2019s Good Ordinary Claret which, at a tenner a time, is excellent value. In fact, I am thinking of joining its wine club to extend my range of what I drink regularly. But am I wrong? Wine that you know is like a familiar friend: reliable, at the ready, comforting, not too demanding. How many friends do I need? On the other hand, if the British hadn\u2019t become more adventurous with wine, we\u2019d still be drinking Blue Nun. British food and drink were pretty awful before we got the hang of Europe. With Brexit waving goodbye to all that, no wonder we need a stiff drink. Travelling is a great opportunity to try new wines you may never want to bring home. When I travel I stick to local wines and ask advice. Working in Bilbao recently, I had wonderful evenings drinking wine that cost between \u20ac3 and \u20ac5 a glass. On each visit, the barman gave me a range of styles to try, explaining the differences between modern and traditional Spanish wine-making. That is better than a YouTube tutorial, and I have found that around the world people are proud to share their knowledge \u2013 and, if you are lucky, the beautiful young wines in plastic containers that will never be bottled or exported, but which are alive with the land where they are made, and pour into the tumbler like a genie out of a bottle. All of this helps you navigate a wine list or make an educated guess when faced with unfamiliar bottles. Most of all, it\u2019s fun. And that\u2019s what I want to stress about wine. Pleasure and fun. We are not on this Earth for long. Enjoyment and happiness matter. Sharing with friends is important. Spending a little more money on a little less wine will increase the good things in life.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me. Until we meet again. Goodbye! A pretty atrocious afternoon at the office for Arsenal who just couldn\u2019t compete with Chelsea today. The fact they were second best was mainly down to a defence that fell well short of expectations. The goalkeeper gifted one goal, Mitchell another and the third was certainly avoidable but Arsenal just could not cope with the concept of defending a ball over the top. Chelsea took their goals well and could have scored more but stopped at three to be polite. 90 min: Chelsea are given an extra three minutes to toy with Arsenal. 89 min: Mead tries to get the better of Blundell down the left but the defender holds her up and eventually earns possession. 87 min: Bachmann latches onto a pass into the box and fires a shot from an acute angle at goal but Peyraud-Magnin is equal to the effort. 85 min: Evans pings a cross into the box which Bright heads wide while facing her own goal. It could have gone anywhere that but the defender knew what she was doing. 83 min: Arsenal just aimlessly lumping the ball into the channels has been a constant theme in this. Midfielders have taken no responsibility for their team today, just hoping the forwards are willing to chase the ball regardless. They really miss Nobbs in midfield, that\u2019s for sure. 81 min: It\u2019s almost 4-0 as Ingle launches a straight ball over the top for Kirby, she controls the ball and tries to lift the ball over the onrushing Peyraud-Manning but the goalkeeper stops the ball with her feet. The ball then loops up but it is headed wide by a defender to clear. 79 min: The best thing Arsenal have done for ages starts with a Williamson pass through to Mead who tricks her way past a defender to get into the box but her low shot is saved by Berger who came out quickly. 77 min: Kirby dinks a cross into the box which Peyraud-Magnin tries to catch but flaps at the ball and completely misses it but a defender is on hand to clear. 75 min: Kirby plays the ball through to Bachmann who chips a cross to the back post but the header is blocked by Quinn on the edge of the six-yard box. 73 min: The Arsenal fans are still singing, which is great considering how badly their team is doing, but the A R S E N A L song is making me slowly go mad as it is pumped into my ears. 71 min: Chelsea toy with Arsenal on the edge of the box before Bachmann sends a tame shot well wide with her left foot. Ji departs and Kirby replaces her. Not a bad change to make at this stage. 69 min: Finally Evans comes on, with McCabe exiting. I\u2019m not sure it will make much difference at this stage, mind. Mitchell is outfoxed by Cuthbert and gains retribution for a foul, which she is booked for. Not a great day for Mitchell. 67 min: Chelsea withdraw England, one assumes out of pity for the Arsenal defence. Bachmann replaces her. 65 min: A strong theme of this match for Chelsea has been to send the ball over the top for England to chase, which has been quite successful and it\u2019s quite worrying how Arsenal can\u2019t combat such a simple tactic. 63 min: Arsenal are definitely being more aggressive now but it\u2019s more out of frustration than any desire to actually get back into the game. 61 min: Arsenal have brought on Williamson as they finally realise their defence is not fit for purpose. A long ball down the middle is flicked on for England to chase, which she does and gets to the ball before the sleeping Arsenal defence, allowing her to whack the ball into the top corner beyond Peyraud-Magnin who was rooted to her line for some reason. 57 min: Veje does well down the left and flashes a cross to the front post for Mead to flick towards goal but Berger stays big to deflect the shot wide. 55 min: Spence is limping around. Will she be able to continue? 53 min: Carney lifts a cross to the back post from the left but Cuthbert sends the ball straight at Peyraud-Magnin from close range. Moments later Ingle heads the ball to England who volleys just wide from the edge of the area. 51 min: Ji tries to drive through the middle of the Arsenal defence and looks set to achieve her aim until a bad touch on the edge of the area takes the ball through to the goalkeeper. Too much swerve or just bad goalkeeping? Make up your own mind about Chelsea\u2019s second. 49 min: Ji goes down under pressure from Arnth to win a free-kick on the edge of the box. Carney takes it and aims for the far corner, forcing Peyraud-Magnin to dive to her left but the ball goes just wide. 47 min: Arsenal have started on the front foot here but without threatening. They need to keep this up to get back into the game. Here we go again! The teams are back out. Arsenal are making a change, with Evans set to come on. Williamson is currently discussing how great it was to play in the FA Cup final last season. Not looking like she will be repeating that this time around. How can Arsenal change this? It might be worth bringing Williamson on at the back as they need someone to provide stability there. Arsenal\u2019s defence has been pretty poor throughout, looking nervous whenever Chelsea attack and at two crucial moments they have made catastrophic mistakes. First Mitchell was caught on the ball and then Payraud-Magnin let a shot from distance slip through her hands. Chelsea have been good in patches but Arsenal have set their own downfall. 45+1 min: Three minutes are being added on her thanks to a couple of injury stoppages. 44 min: It should be 3-0. A long pass over the top reaches England after Quinn heads it into her path but the forward\u2019s shot is wayward. Ps a very generous description of the goal from Chelsea. 42 min: Well ... Arsenal really need to take a long, hard look at themselves at the break. Another mistake nearly costs them a third as Arnth sends a stray pass straight to Cuthbert who gleefully runs at the Arsenal defence but smashes her shot from 20 yards straight over. Andersson picks the ball up around 25 yards from goal and whacks a shot with her left foot straight at Peyraud-Magnin but the Arsenal goalkeeper lets it go right through her hands. A terrible piece of goalkeeping from her. Mistakes have certainly cost Arsenal today. 38 min: Bright sends a atrocious backpass in the direction of Berger but it was nowhere near her and drifts out for a corner. Luckily for Bright, the set-piece is easily cleared. 36 min: Ji glides into the box and then whacks a shot from a tight angle well over. She had better options and really should have looked for a teammate in that situation. 34 min: Mead tries to latch onto a pass into the box but Bright read it superbly, sliding in to clear the danger just as the Arsenal forward was about to take possession. 32 min: A lot of the attacking is being done down the channels. If someone in the middle of the park could take control of this game, then their side would surely win. 30 min: Little clips a cross into the box but Mead can only send her shot wide while stretching six yards out. I am sure my commentary has made you want to watch this game. Which you can on Facebook. 28 min: Chelsea have done to get through the Arsenal onslaught and are now on top at Kingsmeadow. Arsenal need to up it here to put the pressure back onto the hosts. 26 min: Spence waits in space on the edge of the box and is found by Carney but with time on her side, she lifts her shot well over the top while leaning back. 24 min: Arnth chases back to clear a long ball over the top from Chelsea but bizarrely heads it straight up in the air and then fouls Cuthbert just outside the area in an attempt to rectify her error. The subsequent free-kick is flicked over the bar by Bright. 22 min: Cuthbert does some delightful trickery down the left but her cross into the box is poor, meaning Arsenal clear the danger with minimal fuss. 20 min: Arsenal have been on top in this game but it shows that you cannot make stupid mistakes at this level, as they will cost you. 18 min: Mead gets the chance to send a free-kick into the box but her delivery is poor, allowing the ball to be cleared from the edge of the box. 16 min: More treatment is required on the pitch as Berge goes down in her own area for no reason. She is just sat on the edge of her six-yard box. No idea what is wrong, to be honest. This is only her second appearance for the club. She is back on her feet after the physios have done their work. 14 min: Arsenal have suffered terribly with injuries this season and Veje causes concern following a challenge from Cuthbert. There was nothing malicious in it but the kick on the shin forces Veje to limp off to the side but she should be able to continue. 12 min: Bloodworth has another chance as she controls a Mead pull-back but then hits a vicious shot across goal and wide. The same pair combine soon after when Bloodworth slips in Mead, who cuts back onto her right foot and but her shot is blocked by a defender. 10 min: McCabe does incredibly well to keep a pass in on the right, then flicks the ball beyond Andersson, before smashing a low shot with her left foot from inside the area but it rebounds off the base of the post. 8 min: Arsenal react immediately as Bloodworth swings in a shot from the left, which Berger parries out towards Miedema but a Chelsea player sends the ball out for a corner. It was close though. Then Van der Donk lifts a cross into the box which Eriksson heads towards her own goal, forcing Berger to tip it over her own bar. Full-back Mitchell tries to go round Cuthbert but is dispossessed by Cuthbert who darts towards the box and lays the pass onto a plate for England to steer home form 15 yards. 4 min: England gets the wrong side of the Arsenal defence but her cross finds no one and drifts out of the danger zone. Down the other end, Mead fires a shot from distance but it is straight down Berger\u2019s throat. 2 min: A Carney whips in a cross from the left but Quinn positions herself to head clear from the front post. A second cross is lumped into the box but the referee blows for offside. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The teams are out on the pitch and there are plenty of people in the stands. Should be a good one. Team news reminder: Chelsea: Berger, Blundell, Bright, Ingle, Carney, Ji, England, Eriksson, Andersson, Cuthbert, Spence Subs: Lindahl, Cooper, Kirby, Carter, Asante, Riley, Bachmann Arsenal: Peyraud-Magnin; Arnth, Quinn, Mitchell; McCabe, Bloodworth, Little, Veje; Van de Donk, Mead, Miedema Subs: Van Veenendaal, Williamson, Kuyken, Evans, Hazard It\u2019s a lovely day in London. Mild and sunnier, the only potential problem will be for goalkeepers as the sunshine is pretty bright out at there at the moment. Getting ready ... These two sides met in the final last year, which shows how big an occasion this will be today. Whoever wins today will be one of the favourites to lift the trophy. Chelsea eased to a 3-1 victory in May, so there is more reason for Arsenal to be at their very best today. The game today will be shown live on Facebook, which is a great idea to attract new audiences by making it available for free on one of the world\u2019s most accessible platforms. The women\u2019s game is definitely growing in England but initiatives like can only help. Arsenal have their gamefaces on. Here it is ... finally: Chelsea: Berger, Blundell, Bright, Ingle, Carney, Ji, England, Eriksson, Andersson, Cuthbert, Spence Subs: Lindahl, Cooper, Kirby, Carter, Asante, Riley, Bachmann Here is the Arsenal team, still waiting on Chelsea to announce theirs ... Arsenal: Peyraud-Magnin; Arnth, Quinn, Mitchell; McCabe, Bloodworth, Little, Veje; Van de Donk, Mead, Miedema Subs: Van Veenendaal, Williamson, Kuyken, Evans, Hazard Here\u2019s an interview with Everton\u2019s Willie Kirk about life in the women\u2019s game: Good afternoon! It\u2019s been a busy couple of days for FA Cup action at Kingsmeadow. Yesterday, Millwall defeated AFC Wimbledon here and now it\u2019s hosting Chelsea against Arsenal. It\u2019s been an interesting season for these two teams, with Arsenal winning 5-0 at the same venue earlier in the campaign in what was a crushing defeat for Chelsea but they did manage to claim victory in the reverse fixture. Arsenal have a three-point advantage over their opponents in the league but Chelsea will be looking for revenge on their home patch from the loss in the league, so it should be an exciting encounter.",

The flag was taken down on Sunday after cathedral staff were made aware of it. It is thought that someone climbed the scaffolding and put the flag there during the hours of darkness. The first anniversary of the nerve agent attack on Skripal, 67, and his daughter Yulia, 33, who were discovered collapsed on a park bench in the city centre, will fall on 4 March. Two men identified as suspects in the attack, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, went on Russian state-funded TV in September last year to claim they had travelled to Salisbury as tourists, to visit its cathedral.

      "bodyText": "When Tyler Mitchell met the most important woman in fashion, US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, to discuss logistics for this shoot, he \u201cwas scared she might have a too directive point of view,\u201d he laughs, speaking on the phone. \u201cBut the funny thing was how relaxed it all was. Turns out we had a lot in common, the use of colour for one.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHere is a woman who changed American visual culture, yet she seemed pretty happy. There were no complaints.\u201d Last August, Mitchell became one of the most talked-about photographers in the world for two reasons: photographing Beyonc\u00e9 for the September issue of the US magazine, and being the first black photographer to shoot a cover in the magazine\u2019s 126-year history. Also, at 23, he is one of the youngest. It was a historic moment for fashion\u2019s relationship with diversity and social change, and one Beyonc\u00e9 addressed in the interview. \u201cIf people in powerful positions continue to hire and cast only people who look like them, sound like them, come from the same neighbourhoods they grew up in, they will never have a greater understanding of experiences different from their own,\u201d she said. Mitchell describes the singer as \u201can angel\u201d. Growing up in Georgia, he got into photography through film. He started making skateboarding videos and films for small-time rappers, and won a place at the Tisch School of the Arts in New York. It was a mid-course trip to Cuba in 2015 with 30 rolls of film \u2013 \u201cthat landscape of Havana, the candy-coloured architecture, it was so complicated and beautiful\u201d \u2013 that pushed him towards still photography (and producing a book, El Paquete). Though unsigned, he returned to New York and started collating his portfolio. As befits a photographer born in 1995, he used social media as his platform. \u201cI\u2019m of the online generation,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always on Tumblr, looking at i-D online. I drink up the content \u2013 I\u2019m a product of it.\u201d After commissions from Dazed, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, the Beyonc\u00e9 cover put him on the map, though a shoot of gun violence survivors for Teen Vogue in March 2018 \u2013 the #NeverAgain movement which included teenage activists from Parkland, Ferguson and Newtown \u2013 was as pivotal in its own way. \u201cI\u2019m not an activist,\u201d Mitchell says, \u201cbut I\u2019m obsessed with politics, so people do come at me with a political agenda.\u201d His leaning towards politics and cultural identity is evident in both his work and the people he finds inspiring: \u201cPaul Thomas Anderson, Gordon Parks, Spike Lee, Roy DeCarava.\u201d He is as focused on the politicisation, and reduction to a set of tropes, of black masculinity in popular culture as he is on fashion.

      "body": "<p>Inspiration is often found in unexpected places and, last summer, Irish playwright Barry McStay discovered it while flicking through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/12/the-last-bat-the-mystery-of-britains-most-solitary-animal\">a Guardian Long Read</a> I wrote about a lonely bat. The true tale of Britain\u2019s only greater mouse-eared bat, which spent 16 winters hibernating alone in a disused railway tunnel in Sussex, inspired McStay to write Vespertilio, a new play that opens this week in another disused railway tunnel, this one beneath Waterloo station in London.</p> <p>Vespertilio begins with a devoted conservationist guarding this rare bat. But what follows is fiction: a young homeless runaway, Josh, seeks shelter in the tunnel, and meets Alan, the middle-aged bat-lover. So begins a fraught relationship between two very different men. Through the poignant symbol of the lone bat, McStay\u2019s two-hander explores loneliness within the gay community, as a story of love, deceit and possibly redemption unfolds in the tunnel.</p> <p>The bat\u2019s story, says McStay, \u201cjust made me really interested in something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be interested in. Why do we keep watching stories about two people falling in love? There has to be a new way of telling the story.

Salter cried when he first read Alan\u2019s lecture about the lonely bat. \u201cThere\u2019s a line \u2013 \u2018Chances are he will spend the rest of his life alone\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>His character Alan \u201cbelieves he\u2019s one of a kind, meant to be alone and doesn\u2019t deserve love.

      "bodyText": "Inspiration is often found in unexpected places and, last summer, Irish playwright Barry McStay discovered it while flicking through a Guardian Long Read I wrote about a lonely bat. The true tale of Britain\u2019s only greater mouse-eared bat, which spent 16 winters hibernating alone in a disused railway tunnel in Sussex, inspired McStay to write Vespertilio, a new play that opens this week in another disused railway tunnel, this one beneath Waterloo station in London. Vespertilio begins with a devoted conservationist guarding this rare bat. But what follows is fiction: a young homeless runaway, Josh, seeks shelter in the tunnel, and meets Alan, the middle-aged bat-lover. So begins a fraught relationship between two very different men. Through the poignant symbol of the lone bat, McStay\u2019s two-hander explores loneliness within the gay community, as a story of love, deceit and possibly redemption unfolds in the tunnel. The bat\u2019s story, says McStay, \u201cjust made me really interested in something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be interested in. Why do we keep watching stories about two people falling in love? There has to be a new way of telling the story. This seemed like just another brilliant way of telling a very old story.\u201d He thought it would be ideal for the Vault festival, which is held each year in arches and tunnels beneath Waterloo station, and found director Lucy Jane Atkinson particularly enthusiastic. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bat nerd,\u201d she says, \u201cand it just sung to me.\u201d When Atkinson was six, rangers on a camping holiday taught her a pro-bat song: \u201cBats eat bugs / They don\u2019t eat people.\u201d Her song has flitted into the show. Atkinson and McStay cast Benedict Salter as bat-obsessed Alan, who lives alone and devotes his life to protecting the creature. Salter cried when he first read Alan\u2019s lecture about the lonely bat. \u201cThere\u2019s a line \u2013 \u2018Chances are he will spend the rest of his life alone\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s upsetting.\u201d His character Alan \u201cbelieves he\u2019s one of a kind, meant to be alone and doesn\u2019t deserve love. To go on a journey with him, where he discovers he might have something to offer \u2013 as an actor, you want to repeat that night after night. I\u2019m gay myself and seeing him struggle with his identity made me quite protective of him.\u201d Joshua Oakes-Rogers was so keen to get the part of 20-year-old charming, mercurial runaway Josh that he learned the whole of McStay\u2019s play before his first audition. \u201cI had a thing for bats,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we ever went to a zoo, my mum would find me just standing in the dark room watching them all hung above.\u201d Oakes-Rogers is particularly taken with Vespertilio\u2019s torchlit tunnel stage, with seats arranged along both sides. \u201cIt\u2019s so dank, I love it!\u201d he says. Cast and audience can hear trains rumbling overhead. McStay and producer Jess Duxbury have consulted regularly with Joe Nunez-Mino of the Bat Conservation Trust. \u201cHe\u2019s seen all drafts,\u201d says Duxbury. \u201cHe\u2019s sent us information and everyone at BCT has been so generous. One of my favourite facts that came up when I first chatted to Joe is that he read the play and went, \u2018You know the weird thing is that bats have one of the highest rates of homosexuality in any mammal.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d exclaim Salter and Oakes-Rogers together. \u201cOf course they do, they have capes!\u201d adds Oakes-Rogers. \u201cThey\u2019ve got drama, they\u2019ve got height, they\u2019ve got momentum, they are the gayest thing in the world,\u201d laughs Salter. One of Atkinson\u2019s Vault shows from last year, A Hundred Words for Snow, is currently touring the country and begins a West End run in the spring. She senses that McStay\u2019s story of bats, love and loneliness could be another breakout success. \u201cVespertilio has that potential,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very relatable, it\u2019s not London-centric and it\u2019s also so compact it is easily tourable.\u201d While interviewing the cast, I realise I don\u2019t actually know if the greater mouse-eared bat has been spotted again this winter.

The electronics company recently launched <a href=\"https://www.refrigerdating.com/\" title=\"\">Refrigerdating</a>, a service that matches you with dates based on what is inside your fridge. It\u2019s like Tinder but you swipe through pictures of food, rather than faces. \u201cWe hope people can meet under more honest or transparent circumstances with the help of the contents of the fridge, because that can tell you a lot about the personality,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-is-trying-to-turn-your-refrigerator-into-tinder/\" title=\"\">a PR manager explained</a>.</p> <p>Speaking of transparent, Samsung didn\u2019t launch this site for the love of matchmaking; it is a promotional tactic for its multi-thousand-pound <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/familyhub/\" title=\"\">smart fridges</a>. </p> <p>At this point I would like to point out that smart fridges are one of the stupidest things to come out of the modern world. It has been said cocaine is God\u2019s way of telling you that you have too much money; I reckon internet-connected fridges are God\u2019s way of telling you that you should be paying more taxes.</p> <p>Despite my hatred for smart fridges, I selflessly joined Refrigerdating for research purposes. I soon learned that Cilla from Stockholm is into oat milk, Nico from Stockholm has a large eggplant and Patrick from Stockholm only eats condiments. Disappointingly, I didn\u2019t match with anybody, which may be because there only seem to be about 15 users and they are probably all employees of Samsung Sweden.

      "bodyText": "If you are single and looking for a cool new way to meet people, Samsung has just the thing. The electronics company recently launched Refrigerdating, a service that matches you with dates based on what is inside your fridge. It\u2019s like Tinder but you swipe through pictures of food, rather than faces. \u201cWe hope people can meet under more honest or transparent circumstances with the help of the contents of the fridge, because that can tell you a lot about the personality,\u201d a PR manager explained. Speaking of transparent, Samsung didn\u2019t launch this site for the love of matchmaking; it is a promotional tactic for its multi-thousand-pound smart fridges. At this point I would like to point out that smart fridges are one of the stupidest things to come out of the modern world. It has been said cocaine is God\u2019s way of telling you that you have too much money; I reckon internet-connected fridges are God\u2019s way of telling you that you should be paying more taxes. Despite my hatred for smart fridges, I selflessly joined Refrigerdating for research purposes. I soon learned that Cilla from Stockholm is into oat milk, Nico from Stockholm has a large eggplant and Patrick from Stockholm only eats condiments. Disappointingly, I didn\u2019t match with anybody, which may be because there only seem to be about 15 users and they are probably all employees of Samsung Sweden. Nevertheless, I enjoyed peering into strangers\u2019 fridges far more than I had anticipated. Not to sound like a fridge fetishist, but Samsung is really on to something here; my gut says it should go further with the concept. How about an app that matches people based on their willingness to consume food with mould on it? It could be called Can You Stomach Me? and I think Theresa May, for one, would really be into it.",

      "body": "<p>Steve Coogan was out for a meal last night, and this morning, while we talk on the phone, Twitter is lighting up with excited chat about his dinner companions. A photo posted by the actor David Schneider shows a smiling group shot: Schneider leaning in like any selfie-taker, surrounded by the grinning faces of Coogan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chris-morris\" title=\"\">Chris Morris</a>, Rebecca Front, Doon Mackichan, Patrick Marber, Peter Baynham and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/armando-iannucci\" title=\"\">Armando Iannucci</a>. \u201cWe\u2019d not sat down in the same room for 15 years, so we all met up and had dinner.

But the get-together was more than a chance to reminisce, as the talk turned to work projects and the possibility of a reunion. \u201cYeah, we said we should do something,\u201d says Coogan. \u201cEveryone has gone off and done their own thing. But 25 years is quite long enough to prove that you can do something else. So we may do a podcast or something \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d But this wouldn\u2019t be for old times\u2019 sake. None of the team that wrote and performed that excoriating, angry comedy is looking to rehash the past. \u201cThere\u2019s no point doing anything that is just based on nostalgia,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause what we did was very edgy and challenging. You either do something equally relevant or don\u2019t bother.\u201d</p> <p>A quarter of a century after Coogan\u2019s clueless sports reporter turned broadcasting pariah, Alan Partridge, made his screen debut on The Day Today, he is returning to the BBC in This Time With Alan Partridge. The conceit is that the disgraced anchor has been invited to cover the absence of the regular presenter of a One Show-style magazine programme. Despite Partridge\u2019s deep-seated loathing for the \u201cBBC gravy train\u201d, he has been in the digital radio wilderness for years, and is desperate to get back in front of the cameras. Luckily, the BBC, wanting to reflect the voice of little England in these politically altered times, thinks Partridge is just what it needs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b79662d2901163c002c8b647d7bea5e98a37538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b79662d2901163c002c8b647d7bea5e98a37538/0_81_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coogan as Partridge in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coogan as Partridge in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Partridge fans will remember, he left the BBC under a cloud after shooting one of his guests dead with an antique pistol during an interview on his prime-time chatshow, Knowing Me, Knowing You.

As the gallery counts down to transmission, he smacks his dry lips repeatedly, shot in closeup like an Ingmar Bergman character, and asks for water.

It represents a shadowy showbiz organisation not unlike the Freemasons that \u201clooks after\u201d its members while doing philanthropic works. It may never get a mention in the script, he says. But it\u2019s all been worked out and is authentic to the character. I still don\u2019t know who is telling me this, Coogan or Partridge. In full wig and costume (he says it takes less makeup these days), he is hard to pin down. Neil Gibbons admits both brothers have had conversations with him where they are unsure who they are talking to.</p> <p>As he is explaining the lapel pin, the just-visible join between Coogan\u2019s toupee and his forehead is the only reminder that Alan is fictional. In the strange, hermetically sealed world of the studio, I have to remind myself I\u2019m listening to an actor in a costume. It is amazing to watch close up. The enjoyment he takes in conjuring Partridge\u2019s prose, even after a long day, is palpable. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit Das Boot in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he jokes. A little laugh ripples through the crew.</p> <p>He is not, as I had expected, a performer grudgingly putting on the blazer and slip-ons because it is what his audience demands. He has long since passed the point where he needs to be Partridge for exposure or money, with Oscar and Bafta nominations cluttering his inbox. So why keep coming back to him?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I suppose the simple explanation is that it makes me laugh,\u201d he says. During a take, the quietly focused brothers \u2013 \u201cLike hired comedy killers,\u201d he says \u2013 will do that silent knee-bend, head-back laugh when Coogan pulls off another bit of business that gives the scene a new moment. The collaboration is total. When something doesn\u2019t work, Coogan defers to them as if they\u2019re Stanley Kubrick, not two young comedy writers he hired to turn in some Paul Calf gags for a TV pilot that never got made.</p> <p>Despite Partridge\u2019s flaws and after living with him all these years, Coogan has a real affection for him. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s this strange, long journey, but it has been very good because I\u2019ve had this sort of love-hate relationship with Alan. I\u2019ve come to accept Alan in my life.\u201d</p> <p>He can dip in and out of Partridge thanks to his co-writers, who have kept the crucible bubbling between TV projects, writing books in that incredible, deluded voice and Alpha Papa, the big-screen Partridge transfer that saw him taken hostage by a disgruntled co-worker. The brothers joke later that their work schedule with Baby Cow, Coogan\u2019s production company, featured no days off at all \u201capart from Christmas\u201d for the next few years, until they pointed out they would need some time away.</p> <p>But their working relationship is a unique one, and one Coogan says he wouldn\u2019t be without. \u201cI was in the makeup chair, and I looked up at the makeup artist, Lisa Cavalli-Green, and I said: \u2018You do realise, Lisa, that you and I are the only ones left?\u2019\u201d She was Partridge\u2019s makeup artist back in 1994.

Coogan warms to this. \u201cThere is a quote in episode two where he says there is evidence that lower wages increase productivity.\u201d He goes on, more Partridge now than Coogan: \u201cAs Kirstie Allsopp says: \u2018A well-fed dog is a lazy dog.\u2019 The thing is, Allsopp never said that at all, but we have fun with things like that.\u201d Libelling Allsopp aside, Partridge is trying to keep his nose clean and make a good impression. This time, he\u2019s back, he says, to \u201cgive of my best\u201d. He\u2019ll cock it up, obviously, but he really is trying. This Time With Alan Partridge starts on BBC One at 9.30pm on Monday 25 February \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2019 because a photograph of Steve Coogan playing Alan Partridge on The Day Today was captioned as 2002 when it dated from 1994.",

And it comes after more women then ever entered Congress via the midterm elections.</p> <p>There are six women running \u2013 so far \u2013 in the Democratic primary. Being a woman and a feminist is part of their campaigns. For candidates like Elizabeth Warren, feminism is not necessarily the defining message or what they are best known for.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that we have at least six women running for president right now,\u201d said Gillibrand at a campaign stop in New Hampshire\u2019s capital, Concord, on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cBecause not only does it give the American people a chance to see what leadership looks like in all its diversity, but [to] see what sensibilities perhaps women leaders bring to the table. We have different life experiences. We might see different problems. We might see different solutions.\u201d</p> <p>Gillibrand\u2019s feminism is tightly intertwined with her political biography. When sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Democratic senator Al Franken in 2017, Gillibrand was the first senator to call for him to go. And while she credits Hillary Clinton with inspiring her to get into politics, that did not stop her from doing something few Democrats dare do in a party still dominated by the former candidate and her husband: say Bill Clinton should have resigned as president over his affair with Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>Gillibrand has told Trump to surrender his office as well. That call prompted the president to liken the senator to a prostitute, when he said she \u201cwould come to my office \u2018begging\u2019 for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)\u201d.</p> <p>While Gillibrand\u2019s #MeToo criticisms of Democrats had the potential to be politically perilous, her interactions with Trump (and his seemingly sexist response) helped raise her profile. Some have dubbed her \u201cthe #MeToo senator\u201d, but other themes are emerging.</p> <p>Speaking on Saturday at her alma mater, Dartmouth College in Hanover, Gillibrand highlighted her success in traditionally conservative areas of New York, pitching herself to voters as a candidate who could win over Republicans and independents to ensure victory in the general election \u2013 and then work across the aisle in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cTo win this campaign,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need to bring together this country, you\u2019re going to need to heal this country, you\u2019re going to need to speak to people in red places and purple places about their lives, about their challenges, about their fears and about what are the right solutions in this country.</p> <p>\u201cI won back a lot of Trump counties that Hillary lost in New York state alone. I do well in our red and purple districts in my state and win them with higher margins than any Democrat, higher than President Obama, higher than Hillary Clinton, higher than our governor, higher than other senators from New York.\u201d</p> <p>After mentioning that she had worked with the staunchly conservative Texas senator Ted Cruz, Gillibrand exclaimed: \u201cI can work with anybody!\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Success in red and purple districts\u2019</h2> <p>At a Concord coffee shop on Friday morning, Gillibrand approached Tomi Salzmann, a 60-year-old conservative voter, to introduce herself. Asked by the Guardian for her impression, Salzmann said: \u201cDo you want to really know what I think? If she was pro-life I would vote for her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649892a6c0b9af72290e703d6fb068a4c169246b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649892a6c0b9af72290e703d6fb068a4c169246b/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillibrand campaigns and shops at Hilltop Consignment Gallery in Concord.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gillibrand campaigns and shops at Hilltop Consignment Gallery in Concord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first elected post Gillibrand won was a congressional seat in a notoriously conservative area of New York (where cows outnumber Democrats, in Gillibrand\u2019s telling). She was advised that she would not be able to win it. She did.</p> <p>Her stances then were markedly more conservative than they are today: she had an A rating from the National Rifle Association and had pushed hardline stances on immigration.</p> <p>Her views have shifted left. On Saturday, she attacked the NRA and gun manufacturers while denouncing the \u201chatred and darkness\u201d Trump has promoted in talking about immigration.</p> <p>Her potential appeal to conservative and independent voters was a drawing point for Lili Stern, a 19-year-old Dartmouth student from Dallas.</p> <p>\u201cI thought she was composed, energised, definitely has the kind of character that can win an election,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hearing about her success in red and purple districts and areas was also a plus.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia Nadworny, also 19, liked the senator\u2019s commitment to bipartisan action.</p> <p>\u201cIt was actually very encouraging and inspiring to hear how she does reach across the aisle and make those connections to people who are different from herself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sue McCoo met the senator when she visited a consignment shop she owns in Concord, buying a small plate with the Lord\u2019s Prayer inscribed on it and a vase for a friend she was staying with. McCoo said she was excited by the number of female candidates, but worried that the rush could hurt their chances overall.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time\u201d for a woman president, she said. But \u201chaving that many will perhaps mean that in New Hampshire anyways a man will win simply because there are so many women and only so much money and only so many women votes.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she is looking for, McCoo said: \u201cIt would be nice if it was somebody who was not so extreme that they can\u2019t work with people who totally disagree with them.\u201d</p>",

For candidates like Elizabeth Warren, feminism is not necessarily the defining message or what they are best known for. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing that we have at least six women running for president right now,\u201d said Gillibrand at a campaign stop in New Hampshire\u2019s capital, Concord, on Friday. \u201cBecause not only does it give the American people a chance to see what leadership looks like in all its diversity, but [to] see what sensibilities perhaps women leaders bring to the table. We have different life experiences. We might see different problems. We might see different solutions.\u201d Gillibrand\u2019s feminism is tightly intertwined with her political biography. When sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Democratic senator Al Franken in 2017, Gillibrand was the first senator to call for him to go. And while she credits Hillary Clinton with inspiring her to get into politics, that did not stop her from doing something few Democrats dare do in a party still dominated by the former candidate and her husband: say Bill Clinton should have resigned as president over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Gillibrand has told Trump to surrender his office as well. That call prompted the president to liken the senator to a prostitute, when he said she \u201cwould come to my office \u2018begging\u2019 for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)\u201d. While Gillibrand\u2019s #MeToo criticisms of Democrats had the potential to be politically perilous, her interactions with Trump (and his seemingly sexist response) helped raise her profile. Some have dubbed her \u201cthe #MeToo senator\u201d, but other themes are emerging. Speaking on Saturday at her alma mater, Dartmouth College in Hanover, Gillibrand highlighted her success in traditionally conservative areas of New York, pitching herself to voters as a candidate who could win over Republicans and independents to ensure victory in the general election \u2013 and then work across the aisle in Washington. \u201cTo win this campaign,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need to bring together this country, you\u2019re going to need to heal this country, you\u2019re going to need to speak to people in red places and purple places about their lives, about their challenges, about their fears and about what are the right solutions in this country. \u201cI won back a lot of Trump counties that Hillary lost in New York state alone. I do well in our red and purple districts in my state and win them with higher margins than any Democrat, higher than President Obama, higher than Hillary Clinton, higher than our governor, higher than other senators from New York.\u201d After mentioning that she had worked with the staunchly conservative Texas senator Ted Cruz, Gillibrand exclaimed: \u201cI can work with anybody!\u201d \u2018Success in red and purple districts\u2019 At a Concord coffee shop on Friday morning, Gillibrand approached Tomi Salzmann, a 60-year-old conservative voter, to introduce herself. Asked by the Guardian for her impression, Salzmann said: \u201cDo you want to really know what I think? If she was pro-life I would vote for her.\u201d The first elected post Gillibrand won was a congressional seat in a notoriously conservative area of New York (where cows outnumber Democrats, in Gillibrand\u2019s telling). She was advised that she would not be able to win it. She did. Her stances then were markedly more conservative than they are today: she had an A rating from the National Rifle Association and had pushed hardline stances on immigration. Her views have shifted left. On Saturday, she attacked the NRA and gun manufacturers while denouncing the \u201chatred and darkness\u201d Trump has promoted in talking about immigration. Her potential appeal to conservative and independent voters was a drawing point for Lili Stern, a 19-year-old Dartmouth student from Dallas. \u201cI thought she was composed, energised, definitely has the kind of character that can win an election,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hearing about her success in red and purple districts and areas was also a plus.\u201d Olivia Nadworny, also 19, liked the senator\u2019s commitment to bipartisan action. \u201cIt was actually very encouraging and inspiring to hear how she does reach across the aisle and make those connections to people who are different from herself,\u201d she said. Sue McCoo met the senator when she visited a consignment shop she owns in Concord, buying a small plate with the Lord\u2019s Prayer inscribed on it and a vase for a friend she was staying with. McCoo said she was excited by the number of female candidates, but worried that the rush could hurt their chances overall. \u201cIt\u2019s past time\u201d for a woman president, she said. But \u201chaving that many will perhaps mean that in New Hampshire anyways a man will win simply because there are so many women and only so much money and only so many women votes.\u201d Asked what she is looking for, McCoo said: \u201cIt would be nice if it was somebody who was not so extreme that they can\u2019t work with people who totally disagree with them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "So there we go. Madrid stay third while Girona move up to 11th. Thanks for your company and enjoy the rest of the weekend. Madrid have won just one title in the last six, but luckily they\u2019re quite nifty in that other competition. And that\u2019s where they\u2019l have to look for succour once more, because they are now nine points behind Barcelona, and even if they beat them in two weeks time, six points more than them in what\u2019s left of the season is a lot. What a performance from Girona! Not only have the beaten Madrid, but they\u2019ve done so from behind, and didn\u2019t they deserve it! Madrid are surely out of the title race now, while Girona are now seven points clear of relegation. 90+5 min Madrid win a corner, Courtois is up ... and he\u2019s there first, heading ... just wide! 90+4 min This has been a brilliant performance from Girona, who hung in there in the first half, thanks especially to their keeper, and have been by far the better side in the second. Eusebio identified Madrid\u2019s weakness, at left-back, targeted it, and his players have done everything to exploit it. 90+2 min Added time has been extended by a minute. 90 min There\u2019ll be four added minutes. That was Ramos\u2019 25th red card for Madrid; what a talent! What a player! 90 min A free-kick is curled in by Kroos and Casemiro chests it down but Stuani intercedes, only to loop the ball up in the air. Ramos tries an overhead kick, but Alcala is already heading clear and thee Madrid captain is shown a second yellow then a red. It\u2019s hard to argue with that, but at the same time, what was he meant to do? 90 min Ludicrous to say, but I wonder if Madrid are missing Ronaldo. He\u2019d probably have scored a brace here, early in each half, as he does. 88 min Casemiro is late on Aleix Garcia, who gets to the ball before him, and is booked. He\u2019s barely featured this half, when his team have needed him. Juanpe drives the free-kick wide. 87 min Bale pops up on the left and skirts around Alcala, who scythes him down; he\u2019s booked. Kroos, though, can\u2019t pick out a man with his free-kick and eventually Bono can hump clear. 86 min Bale finds himself with a sight of goal as the ball bounces in front of him, but can only jab with his studs and Bono blocks. 84 min Gosh, the free-kick we were waiting for before the substitution is bent in by Granell and Lozano, this time in the middle of the box, is up again! But he can only head over the bar. Girona are so good for this - Madrid haven\u2019t been able to up it when things got real. 84 min Portu, who has been superb in the second half, takes a walk to the side; a very slow walk. He\u2019s replaced by Fernandez. 82 min There is no reason to think Madrid will rescue this based on the play that we\u2019re seeing. But, of course, Madrid are Madrid and tautology is tautology. 80 min Odriozola battles hard to force past Lozano and from the line, cuts back for Benzema, who misses his shot ... the ball arrives into the path of Vinicius Jr, but his curler doesn\u2019t come back enough. He looks the most likely source of something for Madrid. 79 min Girona are well worth their lead. In the first half, they were dangerous going forward and in the second that\u2019s continued, while Madrid have largely been denied chances and dangerous possession. 78 min Vinicius Jr finds space, but can only lash a shot over the bar. 77 min La Liga is nearly over for Madrid for another season. Oh I say! Lozano shoots, Courtois can only palm back into play, and with Marcelo not paying attention once more, Portu is there to nod home inside the near post. 74 min Final change for Madrid: off goes Ceballos, who\u2019s been very quiet, and on comes Mariano Diaz. 73 min Marcelo tries a long slash at Bale, but puts far too much on it. 71 min Girona are into this! Portu nashes down the right, playing a one-two off Aleix Garcia, before spanking a rising drive that clatters the near post! Portu is enjoying himself against Marcelo and, on the other side, Odriozola has been pinned back by Lozano. 70 min A heavy touch from Ceballos presents possession to Granell, who espies Courtois loitering and tries a shot from 40 yards that floats over the bar. 69 min Girona look as likely to score a second as Madrid. 68 min In it comes and Ramos goes down, seeking a penalty, but play continues and when Bono gets very little of a punch, the ball falls to Vinicius Jr, who sidefoots firmly but over. 67 min Stuani has a hack at Casemiro, who looks in pain. Madrid have a free-kick out on the right, which Kroos will bend into the box... 67 min Bale replaces Asensio. 66 min I guess the ref was correct in not sending off Ramos, just. He possibly saved Garcia\u2019s shot on purpose, but might also have tried to block with his body - obviously it was him, but there was enough doubt to be lenient. It\u2019s been coming! Courtois goes right, Stuani goes down the middle, and now then! 64 min What is going on?! Stuani plays it wide to Portu, again playing on Marcelo, and again he crosses well ... Stuani heads onto the post, Aleix Garcia shoots, Ramos saves it - of course he does ... AND AFTER A DELAY, THE REF GIVES A PENALTY, BOOKING RAMOS! 62 min Eusebio\u2019s changes have worked well. Lozano is on Ozriozola and has his measure at the back post while, on the other side, Aleix Garcia is imposing himself. There\u2019s more space for Madrid, but they haven\u2019t really used it yet. 61 min Madrid need another goal. If they didn\u2019t know that already, they for sure know it now. And the reality is, they haven\u2019t made that many chances today - the one Benzema missed a few minutes ago, and not that much else. 59 min WHAT A MISS! Granell plays the ball out to Portu, who crosses high for Lozano at the back post. He\u2019s up above the diminutive Odriozola and is header is a good one, so Courtoisa can only parry ... straight to Aleix Garcia, six yards out! It\u2019s impossible not to score, but impossible is nothing, and he leans back to absolutely luz a drive high over the top! 58 min Here comes the man! Vinicius Jr replaces Lucas, and I imagine he\u2019ll go onto the left with Asensio swapping onto the right. 56 min Girona are a little more open this half, which is allowing them more of the ball, but also giving Madrid more space in which to play. 55 min Ramalho pumps over a cross that finds Lozano inside the box, but he can only plop a header into Courtois\u2019 arms. 54 min A quiet little period, which Girona will appreciate. I don\u2019t think Madrid changes are far away. 52 mins Asensio stands up Ramalh, drags the ball to the line, and clips over a fine cross for Benzema who, at the far post, has time to plan his header. He should go across goal but ends up planting it into the side-netting, and looks suitably sheepish thereafter. 51 min Lovely feet from Kroos, who then feeds Benzema. An equally lovely flick almost reaches Lucas, but Alcala intervenes. 50 min A few minutes ago, Vinicius Jr did some warming up, and the crowd were pleased to see him. I\u2019d not be surprised if he comes soon as Solari won\u2019t want to see out a one-goal lead. 49 min Asensio curls a rubbish free-kick into the wall, and the ball ends up with Benzema on the edge of the box, whose bobbled shot deflects wide. Again, the corner comes to nothing. 48 min Lozano gets involved almost immediately, chasing Odriozola when Kroos sticks a ball in behind and pulling him down on the right edge of the box. He\u2019s booked. 46 min Benzema pushes the ball across the face of the box and it takes a clip off Douglas Luiz, arriving in Marcelo\u2019s path; he strikes a cross a shot that Bono shoves over at the near post, conceding a corner that comes to nothing. 46 min Two half-time changes for Girona: Porro and Pons are off, Lozano and Aleix Garcia are on. 46 min Off we go again. \u201cReal Madrid back to their normal old selves, not lighting up the football world but getting results,\u201d says John McEnerney. \u201cIt\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing for the last few seasons winning 3 CLs without being the best side in Europe. It\u2019s what they do &amp; they do it well!\u201d I don\u2019t know if we can say they\u2019ve not been the best side in Europe over that period, even if they\u2019ve not been the best in any one season. A decent half from the European champions, but they\u2019ll know they should be further ahead. Girona, meanwhile, look dangerous in attack, and I\u2019d not be surprised if they scored, but it\u2019s hard to see them not conceding at least once more. 45+2 min Marcelo win the ball off Pedro Porro, who treads on his calf in the meantime. Marcelo is displeased, but should be good to continue. 45 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 45 min Graham Hunter has just advised Marcelo to work harder, calling him \u201cbrother\u201d in the process. 44 min Madrid build patiently and Kroos lays back for Casemiro, who plays a fine reverse pass for Marcelo. He controls beautifully with his left, and as the ball bounces, drives home at the near post with his right. However, he didn\u2019t bother coming back from an offside position. 43 min Girona have actually looked pretty dangerous in attack. Their problem is that they make a lot of defensive errors, often unforced, and against a Madrid in form and in the mood, you\u2019re struggling. 41 min Odriozola mugs Raul Garcia and slides in Benzema, who powers into the box with Juanpe hanging off him and rifles a rising shot that Bono shoves away. 40 min Pere Pons picks up a loose ball and tees up Granell, who absolutely shmices a low drive from 20 yards that flies only just wide. 40 min Marcelo finds himself in space so moves into space and absolutely leathers a right-footer that flies not that wide. 39 min Ozriozola finds Lucas - those two have a nice little partnership - and the latter digs out a cross from the line that almost reaches Benzema. 38 min Pere Pons is back, but Aleix Garcia is still warming up in case. 36 min Superb from Varana, sticking the nut on a fine cross from Porro, just ahead of Pons, who heads his shoulder. He is now on the ground, experiencing discomfort. 36 min Benzama leaps with Juanpe who enjoys a brief taste of elbow and there\u2019s a break while he savours it. 34 min Madrid are playing like a team who know. They\u2019re so patient in possession, comfortable in the knowledge that at some point they\u2019ll acquire themselves another goal. 31 min Lovely from Madrid, Lucas flicking outside to Odriozola, who snaps a fine low cross into the middle. For a second, Benzema looks certain to score, but hanging back to stay onside deprives him of the half-yard he needs to reach it. 30 min Lucas looks a real player now, and he combines with Ceballos to tease Raul Garcia, then swivels into a low cross that Ramalho turns behind for no reason. The corner comes to nowt. 29 min All the play is in the Girona half now. 27 min Madrid keep at it. I\u2019d not be at all surprised to see them chap another before half-time. A fine header from Alcala takes the corner away from Benzema and Bono smashes a right hand that sends the ball well away. But Kroos picks it up 25 yards from goal and curls over a belter of a cross, and Casemiro turns up behind Alcala, who\u2019s distracted by Varane, to power a glance into the bottom corner. That was coming. 25 min As Kroos prepares to take it, Alcala pulls Benzema down, and rather than give a penalty, the ref stops the game and dispenses a warning. Strange. 24 min Lovely pass from Marcelo, out to Lucas, and his cross is deflected by Alcala; Bono can\u2019t catch up with it in time to stop it going behind. The corner begets another. 23 min Ramalho finds Pons down the right, who hooks over a fair cross from a tricky position, but it\u2019s easily collected by Courtois. 21 min Asensio looks sharp and he takes the ball on the left, cuts inside, and curls a low shot that lacks the power it would have had he performed the same activity from the other side. 19 min But here come Griona on the break, Stuani taking time to make a run and set himself before taking a pass from Portu to lash a rising shot at the near post which Courtois palms away. 19 min Madrid get Asensio away down the left and another good low cross misses everyone. 17 min It\u2019s a nice day in Madrid, and Real Madrid are warming up, Kroos directing an attack and lifting the ball over the challenge of Pons before squaring to Lucas. Immediately, he pokes it in behind - to himself - hares after it and lifts a shot that Bono does very well to claw away. Excellent play all round. 16 min We\u2019ve barely seen Lucas Vazquez so far, as almost all of Madrid\u2019s play has come down their left. 14 min Kroos sprays one wide to Marcelo, who can\u2019t quite reach it on the stretch. He\u2019ll be ganting on winning his place back off Reguilon, but will need to do a lot of running so to do. 13 min Nice from Ceballos, his return flick allowing Asensio to cross. His decent low effort is kicked away, and so is his follow-up. 12 min Madrid are showing signs. First, Kroos slings a lovely ball out to Marcelo, whose cross is cleared, then Kroos whips in a free-kick that Luiz heads away. 10 min Benzema drops deep to involve himself in the play and seeing him still there makes me think how remarkable it is that he\u2019s still a first pick. Not because he isn\u2019t good, verily he is, but players like him, who facilitate others, tend not to be appreciated at the Bernabeu. A centre-forward there to clear space for the wingers is not a usual thing. 9 min Can someone pleasure confirm that Pedro Pons\u2019s middle name is \u201cAbsolute\u201d. 8 min Girona will be happy with how this is going. Madrid haven\u2019t got close to their box and they\u2019ve looked dangerous themselves. 7 min Portu exchanges passes with Granell and darts into the box down the left side, but Stuani can\u2019t do anything with his cut-back. 5 min Madrid have settled into their passing. It looks like Girona are four at the back, not their usual three. 4 min Yes, it was offside, so Courtois took a frask in shnook for nothing. You\u2019ve got to laugh. 3 min Stuani was probably offside when he collected the pass. 2 min Look at this! Stuani finds himself running at Varane and gets around the outside! Courtois narrows the angle, and wears the shot on his not insignificant nose. It bleeds. 2 min \u201c\u201cI\u2019d love to love Girona Futbol Club,\u201d emails Charles Antaki. \u201cBeautiful town, lovely coast nearby, small club risen from the lower divisions, and so on. But City, and But Gulf trillions, and But Who Are they Now Really? Nevertheless I hope they give Real a complete thrashing.\u201d Yes, I suppose my experience of Girona is the airport you use when you go on a \u00a3250 for flights, accommodation and insurance holiday on the Costa Brava in 1997. A holiday most renowned for the shirt-wearing Geordie below who turned up in our room with a temper and a pool cue, and a crew of local dealers who\u2019d heard people from Leeds were on their territory, and assumed that a couple of our lot, who were wearing Leeds shirts, were those very people . 1 min My feed drops out, but we\u2019ve started. The question here is whether or not Madrid are up for this - do they just expect to win? - and whether six changes from the win at Ajax will make a difference. The thing is, confidence is coursing through the club, and Asensio, for example, scored the winner the other night. Good luck, Girona. The players are tunnelled... So, these teams. Santi Solari leaves the in-form Vinicius Jr on the bench, which is annoying for those of us who were looking forward to seeing him. Rude. The same is so of Gareth Bale, while Luka Modric is suspended. Girona, meanwhile, play a 3-5-2, so expect Lucas Vasquez and Marco Asensio to have a lot of the ball - Marcelo too. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Courtois; Odriozola, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo; Casemiro, Kroos, Ceballos; Lucas Vasquez, Benzema, Asensio.

Subs: Iraioz, Roberts, Lozano, Carles Planas, Aleix Garcia, Valery I Paik. Are they doing it again? They bloody are, aren\u2019t they. After yet another mosey through a season of nothing, Real Madrid are running into form just as things get serious. And this time, the league, as well as the Champions League, is in reach. If they win today, they go six points behind Barcelona, who they play at home twice the week after next: first in the Copa del Rey semi second leg, and then in the league. Sort those out, and who knows where it\u2019ll all end? And, in Girona, they face obliging opponents. In La Liga, the visitors are sixth-bottom, and Madrid recently based them home and away in the Cup. A 3-3 draw at Camp Nou earlier in the season gives Blanquivermells hope, but in all likelihood they\u2019re going to take a further doing. Kick-off: 11pm GMT",

John Griffin, the taxi entrepreneur who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, said he had put an alternative fundraising strategy to senior party officials including Davis to seek smaller gifts but his ideas had not been taken up. Tensions between Griffin, the founder of Addison Lee, and Davis, the mining executive who is also the party\u2019s treasurer, can be disclosed days after a number of wealthy donors failed to attend the party\u2019s annual Black and White ball. Some of the party\u2019s biggest donors are withholding payments because of concerns over Theresa May\u2019s leadership, the lack of a policy agenda and paralysis over Brexit. Griffin, who is the party\u2019s second most generous donor since 2013, told the Guardian the Conservatives must become a mass party that is funded by signed-up members. \u201cAs one of the people who have given big amounts, I want more people to join me and give smaller amounts.

According to the Electoral Commission website, the Conservative party has received \u00a3147m in donations since 2013, excluding public funds. Almost 30% of this (\u00a342.8m) came from 20 individual donors. Davis, 60, was appointed chief executive of the party in 2017.

Griffin\u2019s comments came after ministers and donors gathered last week for the party\u2019s annual fundraising Black &amp; White ball in Battersea, south London. The event has been criticised for selling access to ministers, with one anonymous donor paying \u00a375,000 for a private night at the Proms with May. Reports have claimed that many other big donors stayed away. Griffin was in Dubai on that night. Party officials would like to copy Labour\u2019s successes in bringing in cash from hundreds of thousands of members instead of relying on monied donors from the world of business and finance. Figures released in August showed Labour raised nearly \u00a356m in 2017 while the Tories managed \u00a345.9m. Legacies from dead Conservative donors were double subscription fees in 2017, with just under \u00a31.7m paid in legacies versus \u00a3835,000 from memberships. The Guardian interviewed three other Tory donors who have given more than \u00a3500,000 since 2010. All said they were unsure whether to give cash to the party at present. One said the party \u201cappears to be dying on its feet\u201d while another said he wanted to see who was going to lead it into the next election before committing any cash. However another peer, Lord Fink, a former party treasurer under David Cameron, said he was not aware of any fundraising problems and voiced support for Davis. \u201cMick is doing a fabulous job for the party,\u201d he said. The Tories have traditionally concentrated their fundraising efforts on the Leader\u2019s Group, where the party\u2019s richest donors pay \u00a350,000 to dine with the prime minister, and the Black and White Ball. The Guardian disclosed that May had dinner with the co-chair of the controversial Presidents Club only weeks after she had criticised the charity\u2019s event at which female staff were allegedly propositioned for sex. Bruce Ritchie donated at least \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives\u2019 Leader\u2019s Group (CLG). He was one of 48 benefactors who socialised with the prime minister between 1 April and 30 June last year, with others including business people who support a hard Brexit and oil executives. In total, donations to the CLG amounted to \u00a32.4m. The Tories were forced on Sunday night to change the description of a donors\u2019 club after being accused of selling access to the chancellor, Phillip Hammond. Individuals were being offered membership of a \u201cchancellor\u2019s group\u201d that the party said had the \u201covert patronage of the chancellor\u201d and offered the chance to \u201cdiscuss topical issues\u201d with key finance ministers, go to post-budget briefings and get \u201cmonthly updates on the economy\u201d.

But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism.

India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has placed a 200% tariff on Pakistani imports and the home ministry announced on Sunday it was withdrawing the security details of a several Kashmiri separatist leaders. A car laden with explosives driven by a member of the Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have been responsible for the deadliest attack in the history of Kashmir\u2019s 30-year insurgency on Thursday. Ceremonies have been held in the capital, Delhi, and across the country to farewell the dead as public anger continues to boil. \u201cThe fire that is raging in your hearts, is in my heart too,\u201d the prime minister, Narendra Modi, told an audience in Bihar state on Sunday. India\u2019s home ministry has also directed police to protect Kashmiris studying or working in states across India following reports of revenge attacks including attempts to storm a female students\u2019 hostel in the northern city of Dehradun. Authorities cut mobile internet in Kashmir and roads and markets were deserted on Sunday as residents observed a general strike to protest the vigilante violence. Soldiers and paramilitaries stationed in the region were on high alert and a new protocol was in force banning civilian cars from driving near convoys of security personnel. In Jammu, the region adjacent to Kashmir, several thousand people have been stranded for the past four days and been placed in a relief camp. A curfew has been established in the area after arson attacks on Kashmiri homes. Mohammad Akram, a volunteer at a relief camp in Jammu, said more than 3,000 Kashmiri Muslims were being provided shelter and food. \u201cMore people who were stranded at hotels are coming and some are leaving for Kashmir during the night,\u201d he told the Guardian. At a cricket club in Mumbai, a portrait of Pakistan\u2019s prime minister Imran Khan \u2013 one of several pictures of cricketers hanging in the premises \u2013 was covered \u201cas a mark of protest\u201d, the club president told India\u2019s Press Trust International. Thursday\u2019s bombing has raised tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours to their highest point since the September 2016 attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed on an army camp in Uri, a town near Kashmir\u2019s ceasefire border. That incident killed 19 people and led India to announce it had sent army teams into Pakistani-held territory to destroy militant camps, an operation labelled the \u201csurgical strikes\u201d and celebrated in a blockbuster film released this year. Modi has promised to avenge the suicide attack and says his security forces have been given full freedom to respond. But despite the strong rhetoric, India\u2019s options are limited, said Paul Staniland, an associate professor in political science at the University of Chicago. Sending troops deep into Pakistani-held territory would risk escalating a conflict where nuclear weapons have been in play on both sides since 1998, as well exposing Indian soldiers to capture or warplanes to being shot down. More likely, he said, was a similar small-scale attack along the lines of the 2016 surgical strikes, but this time accompanied something like a precision-guided munition attack. \u201cIt moves slightly beyond the response to Uri and lets Modi say he\u2019s not just doing the exact same thing again, but doesn\u2019t open the door to hard-to-predict escalation dynamics,\u201d Staniland said. But such an attack would be unlikely dissuade Pakistan from continuing to allow armed groups to operate on its territory, he added. \u201cIndia might need to really move up the escalation ladder to impose costs, but that in turn creates bigger risks that Indian governments thus far have decided were ultimately not worth it.\u201d",

Jim Yong Kim\u2019s decision in January to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/jim-yong-kim-to-resign-as-president-of-the-world-bank\">step down as president of the World Bank</a> means he is now in line to head the international community\u2019s flagship development body.</p> <p>Kim\u2019s decision to accept a job at a Wall Street private equity firm went down badly with staff at the bank, who were unimpressed that he could make more of an impact in global development through his lucrative career move.

Kim\u2019s decision to go for the big bucks meant leaving the bank three years before his second term was up, thereby providing an opportunity for Donald Trump to choose his successor.</p> <p>Thanks to a tradition that stretches all the way back to the days when the World Bank and its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, were created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the Americans get to choose the president of the bank and the Europeans have the right to pick the managing director of the IMF.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/14/trump-unseemly-haste-shows-world-bank-presidency-must-no-longer-be-in-thrall-to-us-david-malpass\">This cosy arrangement</a> might have had some justification at the end of the second world war, when the US and Europe accounted for the bulk of global economic output, and decolonisation was a thing of the future. But it has long been an anachronism given the rising economic importance of China, India and other big developing countries.</p> <p>It is a dangerous anachronism, too, because it allows the White House \u2013 or, in the case of the IMF, European governments \u2013 to pick someone for reasons other than their suitability to do the job. Between them the Americans and the Europeans have enough voting power to stitch up the two plum jobs, which is why George W Bush was able to choose the arch neo-con Paul Wolfowitz to head the bank in 2005 and why there was no objection from Barack Obama when Christine Lagarde emerged as the European candidate to run the IMF.</p> <p>Donald Trump has shown scant interest in multilateralism and if he looks slightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/30/trump-world-trade-organization-tariffs-stock-market\">more kindly on the World Bank than the World Trade Organisation </a>it is due to promptings of his daughter, Ivanka, who has taken an interest in the financial empowerment of women in developing countries. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump is prepared to break with tradition and he will expect his nominee for world bank president, the US treasury official David Malpass, to be appointed.</p> <p>The people who have doubts about Malpass fall into two camps: those who think that he will be better than Wolfowitz and that his eventual support for the capital increase suggests his bark is worse than his bite: and those who think he will be every bit as bad as feared.</p> <p>Evidence tends to support the second view. Judging by a piece he wrote for the FT explaining why he would be right for the job, Malpass has a rather simplistic view of how to make poor countries richer: promote growth by slashing taxes, scrapping red tape and ensuring currencies are stable. The reality is that most poor countries have trouble collecting taxes and have large informal sectors where there is little or no regulation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1637cda5cc990776c8860620c75e2f63d42583d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1637cda5cc990776c8860620c75e2f63d42583d2/202_75_3331_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Malpass  with South Korean finance minister Hong Nam-ki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Malpass (right) with South Korean finance minister Hong Nam-ki in Seoul last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor is Malpass a big fan of multilateral institutions, which is probably why he has been chosen. Trump is anti-aid, sceptical about climate change and wants to cut China down to size. The bank, up until now at least, has been in favour of aid, sees itself as central to the fight against global warming and has been in favour of lending to middle income countries such as China. Malpass is an economist who knows how the bank works. The fear is that he will try to use the bank to pursue the White House\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>In theory, Malpass should not be a shoo-in for the job. The executive board has announced that it will operate an open, merit-based and transparent process, but that was exactly what it said back in 2012 when Kim got the nod. And, as things stand, it is unclear whether there will even be any other candidates.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://eurodad.org/Entries/view/1547026/2019/02/14/Open-letter-to-the-World-Bank-Group-Board-of-Executive-Directors\">open letter </a>signed by more than 100 civil society organisations and published last week makes an obvious point. The vacancy at the bank comes at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/angela-merkel-criticises-us-isolationism-urging-win-win-solutions\">multilateralism is in crisis</a>. The rise of anti-establishment parties and protectionism are symptoms of a deep malaise in the global economy, the letter notes, adding: \u201cThe World Bank requires a leader able and willing to critically assess the role the bank can play in challenging the failed model that has led us here.\u201d</p> <p>Is Malpass such a leader? Clearly he isn\u2019t and in an open and fair race he wouldn\u2019t be first, second or third choice to run the World Bank. The question is whether the other big shareholders of the bank are prepared to make a stand.</p> <p>One option would be for the Europeans to say that they accept Trump\u2019s right to pick the next president but that Malpass is not a suitable candidate. There is a precedent for this in the US rejection of the German Caio Koch-Weser to head the IMF in 2000. Another German was eventually chosen.</p> <p>Another solution would be to allow the current acting president, Kristalina Georgieva, to see out the rest of Kim\u2019s term and then have an open contest. This, though, would mean the Europeans publicly saying that they would not expect to choose who succeeds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/19/christine-lagarde-appointed-for-second-term-as-imf-boss\">Lagarde when her second term expires in 2021</a>. It would require a bit of backbone and it would require a bit of principle. No, I don\u2019t think so either.</p>",

Thanks to a tradition that stretches all the way back to the days when the World Bank and its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, were created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the Americans get to choose the president of the bank and the Europeans have the right to pick the managing director of the IMF. This cosy arrangement might have had some justification at the end of the second world war, when the US and Europe accounted for the bulk of global economic output, and decolonisation was a thing of the future. But it has long been an anachronism given the rising economic importance of China, India and other big developing countries. It is a dangerous anachronism, too, because it allows the White House \u2013 or, in the case of the IMF, European governments \u2013 to pick someone for reasons other than their suitability to do the job. Between them the Americans and the Europeans have enough voting power to stitch up the two plum jobs, which is why George W Bush was able to choose the arch neo-con Paul Wolfowitz to head the bank in 2005 and why there was no objection from Barack Obama when Christine Lagarde emerged as the European candidate to run the IMF. Donald Trump has shown scant interest in multilateralism and if he looks slightly more kindly on the World Bank than the World Trade Organisation it is due to promptings of his daughter, Ivanka, who has taken an interest in the financial empowerment of women in developing countries. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump is prepared to break with tradition and he will expect his nominee for world bank president, the US treasury official David Malpass, to be appointed. The people who have doubts about Malpass fall into two camps: those who think that he will be better than Wolfowitz and that his eventual support for the capital increase suggests his bark is worse than his bite: and those who think he will be every bit as bad as feared. Evidence tends to support the second view. Judging by a piece he wrote for the FT explaining why he would be right for the job, Malpass has a rather simplistic view of how to make poor countries richer: promote growth by slashing taxes, scrapping red tape and ensuring currencies are stable. The reality is that most poor countries have trouble collecting taxes and have large informal sectors where there is little or no regulation. Nor is Malpass a big fan of multilateral institutions, which is probably why he has been chosen. Trump is anti-aid, sceptical about climate change and wants to cut China down to size. The bank, up until now at least, has been in favour of aid, sees itself as central to the fight against global warming and has been in favour of lending to middle income countries such as China. Malpass is an economist who knows how the bank works. The fear is that he will try to use the bank to pursue the White House\u2019s agenda. In theory, Malpass should not be a shoo-in for the job. The executive board has announced that it will operate an open, merit-based and transparent process, but that was exactly what it said back in 2012 when Kim got the nod. And, as things stand, it is unclear whether there will even be any other candidates. An open letter signed by more than 100 civil society organisations and published last week makes an obvious point. The vacancy at the bank comes at a time when multilateralism is in crisis. The rise of anti-establishment parties and protectionism are symptoms of a deep malaise in the global economy, the letter notes, adding: \u201cThe World Bank requires a leader able and willing to critically assess the role the bank can play in challenging the failed model that has led us here.\u201d Is Malpass such a leader? Clearly he isn\u2019t and in an open and fair race he wouldn\u2019t be first, second or third choice to run the World Bank. The question is whether the other big shareholders of the bank are prepared to make a stand. One option would be for the Europeans to say that they accept Trump\u2019s right to pick the next president but that Malpass is not a suitable candidate. There is a precedent for this in the US rejection of the German Caio Koch-Weser to head the IMF in 2000. Another German was eventually chosen. Another solution would be to allow the current acting president, Kristalina Georgieva, to see out the rest of Kim\u2019s term and then have an open contest. This, though, would mean the Europeans publicly saying that they would not expect to choose who succeeds Lagarde when her second term expires in 2021. It would require a bit of backbone and it would require a bit of principle. No, I don\u2019t think so either.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s two days before the US release of Marlon James\u2019s much-hyped fourth novel, <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> and the prizewinning Jamaican author has an air of baffled, exhausted ebullience about him. He\u2019s no stranger to critical success: he won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/15/marlon-james-jamaica-booker-homophobic\" title=\"\">2015 Man Booker prize</a> for his violent, multi-voiced epic, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-review\" title=\"\">A Brief History of Seven Killings</a></em>. But it feels like this new book will propel James into a new galaxy of literary stardom.</p> <p>We\u2019ve arranged to have lunch \u2013 on a balmy Sunday in early February \u2013 at the Commodore, a carefully shabby Williamsburg diner near his Brooklyn apartment. Brawnily broad-shouldered, his dreadlocked hair tied back in a ponytail, James has arrived before me. We\u2019re shown to seats at the bar where low winter sun slants through the blinds on to the bar top. James tells me it feels like summer to him \u2013 he spends much of his time <a href=\"https://www.macalester.edu/news/2019/02/a-lesson-from-marlon-james-epic-storyteller/\" title=\"\">teaching creative writing</a> at Macalester College in Minnesota \u2013 and as if to prove it asks the waiter for an Aperol spritz.</p> <p>We order and I pull out my tattered proof of the book. I\u2019ve read it twice already, I tell him, and love it as much as any book I\u2019ve read for a long time. James\u2019s UK publisher, he says, was worried that it would be \u201ctoo literary for fantasy fans, too fantastical for literary fans\u201d. But the best novels defy the narrow clannishness of genre labels and <em>Black Leopard\u2026</em>is one of them. It\u2019s complex, lyrical, moving and furiously gripping. The critics, whose panegyrics have been appearing over recent weeks, seem to agree. Ron Charles of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/black-leopard-red-wolf-is-the-fantasy-epic-everyone-will-be-talking-about/2019/01/25/b94f3298-1f2c-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.e582647c0a25\" title=\"\">the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/black-leopard-red-wolf-is-the-fantasy-epic-everyone-will-be-talking-about/2019/01/25/b94f3298-1f2c-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.e582647c0a25\" title=\"\"> Washington Post</a></em> said that \u201cJames has spun an African fantasy as vibrant, complex and haunting as any western mythology and nobody who survives reading this book will ever forget it\u201d; the notoriously sniffy Michiko Kakutani of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/books/review/black-leopard-red-wolf-marlon-james.html\" title=\"\">the</a><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/books/review/black-leopard-red-wolf-marlon-james.html\" title=\"\"> New York Times</a></em> declared that \u201cwith Tracker and the Leopard, James has created two compelling and iconic characters, characters who will take their place in the pantheon of memorable and fantastical superheroes\u201d; there was also a rave on the revered speculative fiction website Tor.com, with the reviewer, Alex Brown, getting himself into <a href=\"https://www.tor.com/author/alex-brown/\" title=\"\">a right tizzy</a>: \u201cY\u2019all, Marlon James\u2019s <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> is a miracle. It\u2019s a gift from Anansi himself. This book. This book. THIS BOOK.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I read whatever cheap crap got dumped on the third world. I didn\u2019t have a community telling me, \u2018Read this, read that\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em> is the first instalment of the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/11/marlon-james-reveals-first-details-of-african-fantasy-trilogy\" title=\"\">Dark Star </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/11/marlon-james-reveals-first-details-of-african-fantasy-trilogy\" title=\"\">trilogy</a>, with each novel in the series telling the same story from a different perspective (James tells me he\u2019s planned the next two, but has been too busy promoting this book to start writing them yet). Set in a version of Africa that feels at once ancient and fantastical, <em>Black Leopard\u2026</em> is narrated by Tracker, a flawed, wounded, beautifully nuanced protagonist who has the uncanny ability to scent out people wherever they might be in the various kingdoms he travels through. It\u2019s a quest narrative \u2013 the search for a missing child \u2013 but one whose result is established in the book\u2019s very first lines: \u201cThe child is dead. There is nothing left to know.\u201d At almost 700 pages long, with a vast cast of characters both human and mythical, and with a plot whose labyrinthine divagations are dizzyingly complex, it\u2019s not an easy novel, but then that\u2019s not why people read Marlon James.</p> <p>We speak about Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/04/the-buried-giant-review-kazuo-ishiguro-tolkien-britain-mythical-past\" title=\"\">The Buried Giant</a></em>, a fantasy novel that literary critics only seemed able to embrace by viewing it through an allegorical lens. \u201cI don\u2019t write allegory,\u201d James says. \u201cMany critics can only process fantasy as a commentary on the now. Do you review <em>Wolf Hall</em> looking for modern-day parallels? Well if you do, then that\u2019s on you. There are other things to be said about humanity than the contemporary experience.\u201d I ask him why he thinks the literary world\u2019s apparent animus against genre writing persists. \u201cMake no mistake, there\u2019s formula detective fiction, there\u2019s formula science fiction,\u201d he says, jabbing his finger on the bar top, \u201cbut there\u2019s formula literary fiction too. It\u2019s genre snobbery that we\u2019re only ready to acclaim stuff that\u2019s of the genre but different in some way. It\u2019s sci-fi but, it\u2019s fantasy but\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to write a but.\u201d</p> <p>The central event in James\u2019s Man Booker-winning third novel, <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em>, is the 1976 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/urban.worldmusic\" title=\"\">assassination attempt on Bob Marley</a>, in which the singer was shot in the arm and his wife, Rita, through the head. The novel is unflinching in its portrayal of the violence that swept across Jamaica at the time, the gun-toting criminals who segued from political thugs into murderous drug gangs. James was six at the time, his parents both police detectives.</p> <p>He must, I reason, have had some sense of this turbulent atmosphere as a child, particularly given his parents\u2019 occupation. \u201cEven then, given everything that was going on in Jamaica, my childhood was frustratingly middle-class,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut what I remember about when Bob Marley got shot was that I rarely saw my parents get scared for long, but they were afraid after that. They were always chill, they were always in control. Marley changed all that. The fact that the most untouchable man in Jamaica could get shot was what threw them off.\u201d There was another event that stuck with him. \u201cI remember election night 1980, gunmen shot up my mum\u2019s workplace. She was in there. She was so matter-of-fact about it. \u2018Yeah, they shot up HQ.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7feeba1dd878b92d35aa9ed2be2e05c650961caf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7feeba1dd878b92d35aa9ed2be2e05c650961caf/0_22_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marlon James poses with his award at the 2015 Man Booker prize ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlon James poses with his award at the 2015 Man Booker prize ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against this dramatic backdrop, the bookish, reclusive James lived out an adolescence that mixed solitude with bullying from the jocks at his Kingston high school, who called him \u201csissy\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy teenage years before college, I spent pretty much all of my time in my bedroom,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI spent so much time there that my neighbours thought I did high school in America. I\u2019d go to class, then I\u2019d disappear. I\u2019d just basically come home to eat dinner, sleep, draw comics.\u201d He had few friends. \u201cThis made a comic like <em>X-Men</em> really resonate,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re outcasts, they\u2019re outsiders, they\u2019re disliked by a world that they\u2019re still a part of. Even other heroes didn\u2019t trust the X-Men. And that connected with me in a really, really major way.\u201d He drew his own comics, then started writing a fantasy novel. \u201cI was a very pretentious teenager and I was trying to write something heavy.\u201d</p> <p>While <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/24/game-of-thrones-season-eight-what-we-learned\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a></em> has been the go-to cultural reference point for <em>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</em>, it feels like there\u2019s also a good deal of Tolkien in there. He shakes his head. \u201cI never read any of the foundational fantasy novels when I was a kid. Not the pantheon. Those fantasy novels that you might have thought would be everywhere, like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, really weren\u2019t. I read whatever cheap crap got dumped on the third world. I didn\u2019t have a community telling me, \u2018Read this, read that.\u2019 A lot of what I write about in terms of the fantastic I picked up from comics, particularly Marvel comics. And even that idea of a group of people banded together, which people think I got from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/14/lordoftherings1\" title=\"\">Fellowship of the Ring</a></em>, it\u2019s more like X-Men or one of those anti-teams like Doom Patrol or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/02/suicide-squad-review-dc-comics-will-smith-margot-robbie-jared-leto\" title=\"\">Suicide Squad</a>. Because comics were easier to get hold of than books.\u201d</p> <p>James went from high school to the University of the West Indies, still living at home, still writing, but now reading whatever novels came his way, from Fielding \u2013 \u201cOh my God, <em>Tom Jones</em> was so much fun\u201d \u2013 to James Clavell \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t aged well.\u201d He studied literature and accounting \u2013 \u201cthat was a terrible idea\u201d \u2013 but it was writing that made his trips to campus worthwhile. \u201cOne of the absolute great things about college was creative writing classes. I didn\u2019t even know they existed until I got there. The teacher was John Hearne, one of the first great novelists of the 20th century in Jamaica. It was a game-changer for me. Here was a class where I was going to be judged on the thing I was doing so much at home anyway.\u201d</p> <p>On leaving UWI in the early 90s, James found himself a job at an advertising agency, figuring that it would be a continuation of the creative, geeky world he\u2019d built around himself at university.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I hit advertising it was nothing like I\u2019d imagined. It was like going back to high school. People were narrow, not open-minded, homophobic. But people gotta eat. And I was good at it.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him if he\u2019s kept any of his work from this time. He laughs. \u201cSalman [Rushdie, who is a friend, also worked in advertising] talks now and again about the one or two of his that survive, but I really hope none of mine do. When I went into advertising, yes, I was being creative, but it was writing for committee, which is not the same thing at all. To be a writer, you have to write for yourself. When I wrote my first novel, I didn\u2019t write it to be published, but to prove that I could write it for myself. I needed an avenue to write darker stuff. There\u2019s no place for that in writing that\u2019s selling eggs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/oreo-fran-ross-novel-marlon-james\">Oreo: Marlon James on a crazy, sexy, forgotten gem of black literature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was while at the advertising agency that James found himself drawn into a local evangelical church. Alongside a ready-made community, it seemed to offer a means of dealing with the fact that it was becoming increasingly clear to James, who\u2019d lived a monkish life thus far, that he was gay. He described in horrifying detail in a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/why-marlon-james-decided-to-write-an-african-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">recent </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/why-marlon-james-decided-to-write-an-african-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">New Yorker</a></em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/why-marlon-james-decided-to-write-an-african-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\"> article</a> how he underwent exorcism at the church. It was during this traumatic time, though, that he wrote <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/john-crow-s-devil.html\" title=\"\">John Crow\u2019s Devil</a></em>, his lowering Faulknerian debut, which tells of two rival priests, each with a guilty sexual secret to hide, competing for primacy in a fictional Jamaican village in the 1950s. It\u2019s a fabulous book, dark and angry and experimental, every page bearing traces of the linguistic daring and visionary imagination that would later characterise James\u2019s work.</p> <p>In that same <em>New Yorker</em> article, he said that he was sceptical of pop psychology and trying to read too much of his personal life into his books, but he concedes that his first novel plays out the conflicts he was going through at the time.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying on being a writer for size,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI was trying on writing about things that are close to me for size. Like sexuality. At the time, I wasn\u2019t in any form of gay relationship. It\u2019s funny that I\u2019ve gone from hating pop psychology to being way too Freudian. I can see all my fears and desires in it. Ones I could never give in to because I was deep in the church and I was a super-suppressed gay dude.\u201d</p> <p>He left the church and sent his novel out to a selection of New York agents. When the first handful said no, he sent it to more, and more, and more, 78 in all. Each of them rejected it. \u201cI remember that somebody said it was the subject matter \u2013 that nobody wants to read about the Caribbean, that it was because it was super dark, because there are no white people in it. At that time, dark had to be couched in a certain way. It had to be <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/17/fiction.alismith\" title=\"\">The Lovely Bones</a></em>. It had to have a redemptive narrative. I think we\u2019re still in a place where we want a white person to play a part, even in a black story. I briefly toyed with putting my [white] friend Gerard\u2019s picture in my biog and sending the book back out,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p> <p>In the end, James\u2019s novel was read by an American author, Kaylie Jones, who passed it on to the indie press Akashic Books in New York. <em>John Crow\u2019s Devil</em> was published to a warm critical reception in 2005. The narrative from here is often painted as an inexorable rise to literary stardom, but James reminds me that his second novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/book-of-night-women.html\" title=\"\">The Book of Night Women</a></em>, a brutal 18th-century slave narrative that takes place on a Jamaican sugar plantation, was also turned down almost 20 times, before being picked up by Riverhead Books and published in 2009.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/09/the-best-new-books-for-black-history-month\">The best new books for Black History Month</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was his next book, <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em>, which established James as a <a href=\"https://themanbookerprize.com/resources/media/pressreleases/2015/10/13/brief-history-seven-killings-wins-2015-man-booker-prize\" title=\"\">major literary force</a>. When Michael Wood, the Man Booker chair that year, was asked how long deliberations about the winner had taken, he replied carefully that they\u2019d been in the room for two hours. Someone else who was there tells me \u2013 on the assurance of anonymity \u2013 that it was barely 10 minutes before they agreed on James\u2019s extraordinary novel. \u201cEven among these enormously sophisticated readers, they had never read anything like this... everyone was blown away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt changed everything,\u201d James says of the prize. \u201cI visited countless countries. I\u2019d started thinking about this novel [<em>Black Leopard</em>\u2026] well before I won the Booker, so I wasn\u2019t consumed with expectations about what I was going to do next.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested to his agent a \u201cquiet, literary\u201d novel about Jamaicans in New York. Then he began to speak about fantasy. \u201cThere are people who follow the Booker with over-ambitious books that fail. I worried that this \u2013\u201d he taps <em>Black Leopard... </em>\u2013 \u201cmight just come across as me going bigger, harder, faster. It was more reason for me to choose the quiet, literary, observant, contemporary novel. The mature and wise follow-up instead of a book with flipping monsters in it. But I was still thinking of myself as a kind of underdog writer, someone who\u2019d be able to get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>One thing the new novel shares with its predecessors is a uniquely intense presentation of violence. I ask him whether he ever feels that his work strays close to gratuitousness, to a kind of wilful lingering over scenes of pain.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to risk it or you won\u2019t get close to the power or the horror of it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to risk going too far. Man, I sound like Foucault. I actually think this kind of antiseptic, clipped, edited version of violence I see in literature sells it short. If you don\u2019t read the scene of the murder of a child and find it unbearable, then that scene failed. I think people are used to violence, but they\u2019re not used to suffering. In Hollywood films, we see violence, but we don\u2019t see suffering. In my writing of violence I do not escape suffering and I think one of my violent scenes is equivalent to 30 of someone else\u2019s. I get this rap of being too violent, but actually what I\u2019m saying is that violence comes with consequences and suffering and I don\u2019t blink at either. So it\u2019s going to reverberate longer in my books.\u201d</p> <p>It feels like there\u2019s something particular about the fact that a Jamaican relocated to the US (James left Jamaica in 2007) should be writing this great syncretic African epic, that both his distance and his closeness to the cultures from which he draws at once give the novel the perspective and authenticity it requires. I ask if there were any authors whose work inspired the vision of <em>Black Leopard\u2026</em></p> <p>\u201cI really wasn\u2019t reading a lot of other people. I was reading a lot of the original myths and legends. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to write a fantasy novel. I wanted the ability to pick and choose and do what Tolkien did with Scandinavian and British culture. I wanted this pool of ideas and legends and building something out of it. I read enough and researched enough that I could have written three historical novels. I could easily have written an Ethiopian <em>Wolf Hall</em>. Or a Ghanaian <em>Fifth </em><em>Queen</em> [Ford Madox Ford\u2019s unjustly forgotten trilogy about Katharine Howard].\u201d</p> <p>As far as other literary inspirations, there is always Salman Rushdie, he says \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/05/reading-group-shame-by-salman-rushdie-is-septembers-book\" title=\"\">Shame</a></em> is one of his favourite novels. I email Rushdie on my return and he says he hasn\u2019t read the new book yet, but that James is \u201ca writer of prodigious imaginative gifts and, judging by the advance praise, he\u2019s about to have a monster hit\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s also Ben Okri, whose <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jan/20/booker-club-famished-road\" title=\"\">The Famished Road</a></em>, also one of a trilogy, won the Booker in 1991. \u201cWhen I read <em>Famished Road</em>,\u201d James tells me, \u201cthe urbanity of it is distinctly African. It\u2019s the noise, the cacophony, the spirits and the magic. You can smell the groceries, the shit, but you can also see the zombies. I actually reread <em>The Famished Road</em> while I was writing this. The one thing we all have in common is that we recognise that realism can\u2019t express what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve all at some point reached the end of ourselves in realism. Our reality can\u2019t be expressed by the Victorian novel. Okri is such an influence on me. I\u2019ve read <em>Famished Road</em> like four times.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1323cd03ab3bb86a5df4baebcb488beca8a903ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1323cd03ab3bb86a5df4baebcb488beca8a903ff/0_0_3577_4769/750.jpg\" alt=\"Marlon James photographed in New York.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlon James photographed in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike McGregor/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Okri speaks to me on the phone when I\u2019m back in England. \u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to do is amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly given the context of the Caribbean/African relationship. The depth of culture is historically very important, that we have this reciprocity, this dialogue in our literature through history. We all have this rich, unacknowledged African past. This is something that has been felt by many writers and we\u2019ve been looking for a means of articulating it in a universal way, looking for those deep myths, those deep histories. There\u2019s been a lapse of a generation in the literary relationship between African, Caribbean and American writers, and what Marlon is doing seems to signal to me the return to something that\u2019s important for all three linked cultures and is therefore a sign of hope.\u201d</p> <p>As we leave the bar, James speaks to me about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-windrush-generation-the-scandal-isnt-over\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal,</a> which he\u2019d been following closely. \u201cIt struck me as very British-colonial,\u201d he says. \u201cI was reading in the <em>Guardian</em> today where it was talking about British people living in Spain who are really apprehensive about losing their benefits and yet they support Brexit. They want Spain to support them but they don\u2019t want to support Spain. Such entitlement to something that you have no intention of returning. Windrush hit me in the same way. You\u2019re talking about the descendants of people who fought in both world wars. If anything, they should be giving them subsidies. You made so much money colonising all of these countries, leaving each one in far worse shape than you found them, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to accept any of these people in your country, people whose parents and grandparents helped build it.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of days after the interview, it\u2019s announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-b-jordan\" title=\"\">Michael B Jordan</a>, one of the stars of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a></em>, has bought the rights to the new novel. I call James, who\u2019s at an airport on his way between book signings, to congratulate him. He loved <em>Black Panther</em>, he tells me. \u201cI saw it five times. I started this book in 2015, so I don\u2019t know that they\u2019d even announced that it was going to be made. But from the moment they announced it I was super-excited. I\u2019ve known the comic since the 70s, since Denys Cowan used to write for it.\u201d There was no concern that it might seem too close to the material in the novel James was halfway through writing by the time the film came out? \u201cI didn\u2019t think about <em>Black Panther</em> when I was writing the book. I knew it was a different story, I think we still expect the same story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/09/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-accepts-pen-pinter-prize-with-call-to-speak-out\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a> speaks about the danger of a single story. There are a million stories that can be told about Africa \u2013 that was one and what I was writing was another.\u201d</p> <p>There was an instant rapport between James and Jordan. \u201cWe spoke on the phone for nearly two hours, about what we want to achieve with our work and representation and what stories need to be told. We were on the same page in that regard before we even talked about movie deals. We were so much on the same wavelength as to what stories we want to see.</p> <p>\u201cAs people of colour in the diaspora, we\u2019re particularly interested in stories that go beyond slavery. I\u2019m tired of that being seen as the furthest in the past we can go or that swords and sorcery aren\u2019t available to us.\u201d</p> <p>I ask James if he\u2019s going to write the script \u2013 he worked on a screenplay of <em>A Brief Histor</em>y\u2026 that is yet to be aired. \u201cI\u2019m too busy,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve got part two and three of this series to write.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Black Leopard, Red Wolf </em>by Marlon James is published by Penguin (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s two days before the US release of Marlon James\u2019s much-hyped fourth novel, Black Leopard, Red Wolf and the prizewinning Jamaican author has an air of baffled, exhausted ebullience about him. He\u2019s no stranger to critical success: he won the 2015 Man Booker prize for his violent, multi-voiced epic, A Brief History of Seven Killings. But it feels like this new book will propel James into a new galaxy of literary stardom. We\u2019ve arranged to have lunch \u2013 on a balmy Sunday in early February \u2013 at the Commodore, a carefully shabby Williamsburg diner near his Brooklyn apartment. Brawnily broad-shouldered, his dreadlocked hair tied back in a ponytail, James has arrived before me. We\u2019re shown to seats at the bar where low winter sun slants through the blinds on to the bar top. James tells me it feels like summer to him \u2013 he spends much of his time teaching creative writing at Macalester College in Minnesota \u2013 and as if to prove it asks the waiter for an Aperol spritz. We order and I pull out my tattered proof of the book. I\u2019ve read it twice already, I tell him, and love it as much as any book I\u2019ve read for a long time. James\u2019s UK publisher, he says, was worried that it would be \u201ctoo literary for fantasy fans, too fantastical for literary fans\u201d. But the best novels defy the narrow clannishness of genre labels and Black Leopard\u2026is one of them. It\u2019s complex, lyrical, moving and furiously gripping. The critics, whose panegyrics have been appearing over recent weeks, seem to agree. Ron Charles of the Washington Post said that \u201cJames has spun an African fantasy as vibrant, complex and haunting as any western mythology and nobody who survives reading this book will ever forget it\u201d; the notoriously sniffy Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times declared that \u201cwith Tracker and the Leopard, James has created two compelling and iconic characters, characters who will take their place in the pantheon of memorable and fantastical superheroes\u201d; there was also a rave on the revered speculative fiction website Tor.com, with the reviewer, Alex Brown, getting himself into a right tizzy: \u201cY\u2019all, Marlon James\u2019s Black Leopard, Red Wolf is a miracle. It\u2019s a gift from Anansi himself. This book. This book. THIS BOOK.\u201d Black Leopard, Red Wolf is the first instalment of the Dark Star trilogy, with each novel in the series telling the same story from a different perspective (James tells me he\u2019s planned the next two, but has been too busy promoting this book to start writing them yet). Set in a version of Africa that feels at once ancient and fantastical, Black Leopard\u2026 is narrated by Tracker, a flawed, wounded, beautifully nuanced protagonist who has the uncanny ability to scent out people wherever they might be in the various kingdoms he travels through. It\u2019s a quest narrative \u2013 the search for a missing child \u2013 but one whose result is established in the book\u2019s very first lines: \u201cThe child is dead. There is nothing left to know.\u201d At almost 700 pages long, with a vast cast of characters both human and mythical, and with a plot whose labyrinthine divagations are dizzyingly complex, it\u2019s not an easy novel, but then that\u2019s not why people read Marlon James. We speak about Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Buried Giant, a fantasy novel that literary critics only seemed able to embrace by viewing it through an allegorical lens. \u201cI don\u2019t write allegory,\u201d James says. \u201cMany critics can only process fantasy as a commentary on the now. Do you review Wolf Hall looking for modern-day parallels? Well if you do, then that\u2019s on you. There are other things to be said about humanity than the contemporary experience.\u201d I ask him why he thinks the literary world\u2019s apparent animus against genre writing persists. \u201cMake no mistake, there\u2019s formula detective fiction, there\u2019s formula science fiction,\u201d he says, jabbing his finger on the bar top, \u201cbut there\u2019s formula literary fiction too. It\u2019s genre snobbery that we\u2019re only ready to acclaim stuff that\u2019s of the genre but different in some way. It\u2019s sci-fi but, it\u2019s fantasy but\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to write a but.\u201d The central event in James\u2019s Man Booker-winning third novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, is the 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley, in which the singer was shot in the arm and his wife, Rita, through the head. The novel is unflinching in its portrayal of the violence that swept across Jamaica at the time, the gun-toting criminals who segued from political thugs into murderous drug gangs. James was six at the time, his parents both police detectives. He must, I reason, have had some sense of this turbulent atmosphere as a child, particularly given his parents\u2019 occupation. \u201cEven then, given everything that was going on in Jamaica, my childhood was frustratingly middle-class,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut what I remember about when Bob Marley got shot was that I rarely saw my parents get scared for long, but they were afraid after that. They were always chill, they were always in control. Marley changed all that. The fact that the most untouchable man in Jamaica could get shot was what threw them off.\u201d There was another event that stuck with him. \u201cI remember election night 1980, gunmen shot up my mum\u2019s workplace. She was in there. She was so matter-of-fact about it. \u2018Yeah, they shot up HQ.\u2019\u201d Against this dramatic backdrop, the bookish, reclusive James lived out an adolescence that mixed solitude with bullying from the jocks at his Kingston high school, who called him \u201csissy\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d. \u201cMy teenage years before college, I spent pretty much all of my time in my bedroom,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI spent so much time there that my neighbours thought I did high school in America. I\u2019d go to class, then I\u2019d disappear. I\u2019d just basically come home to eat dinner, sleep, draw comics.\u201d He had few friends. \u201cThis made a comic like X-Men really resonate,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re outcasts, they\u2019re outsiders, they\u2019re disliked by a world that they\u2019re still a part of. Even other heroes didn\u2019t trust the X-Men. And that connected with me in a really, really major way.\u201d He drew his own comics, then started writing a fantasy novel. \u201cI was a very pretentious teenager and I was trying to write something heavy.\u201d While Game of Thrones has been the go-to cultural reference point for Black Leopard, Red Wolf, it feels like there\u2019s also a good deal of Tolkien in there. He shakes his head. \u201cI never read any of the foundational fantasy novels when I was a kid. Not the pantheon. Those fantasy novels that you might have thought would be everywhere, like Dune and Lord of the Rings, really weren\u2019t. I read whatever cheap crap got dumped on the third world. I didn\u2019t have a community telling me, \u2018Read this, read that.\u2019 A lot of what I write about in terms of the fantastic I picked up from comics, particularly Marvel comics. And even that idea of a group of people banded together, which people think I got from Fellowship of the Ring, it\u2019s more like X-Men or one of those anti-teams like Doom Patrol or Suicide Squad. Because comics were easier to get hold of than books.\u201d James went from high school to the University of the West Indies, still living at home, still writing, but now reading whatever novels came his way, from Fielding \u2013 \u201cOh my God, Tom Jones was so much fun\u201d \u2013 to James Clavell \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sure that hasn\u2019t aged well.\u201d He studied literature and accounting \u2013 \u201cthat was a terrible idea\u201d \u2013 but it was writing that made his trips to campus worthwhile. \u201cOne of the absolute great things about college was creative writing classes. I didn\u2019t even know they existed until I got there. The teacher was John Hearne, one of the first great novelists of the 20th century in Jamaica. It was a game-changer for me. Here was a class where I was going to be judged on the thing I was doing so much at home anyway.\u201d On leaving UWI in the early 90s, James found himself a job at an advertising agency, figuring that it would be a continuation of the creative, geeky world he\u2019d built around himself at university. \u201cWhen I hit advertising it was nothing like I\u2019d imagined. It was like going back to high school. People were narrow, not open-minded, homophobic. But people gotta eat. And I was good at it.\u201d I ask him if he\u2019s kept any of his work from this time. He laughs. \u201cSalman [Rushdie, who is a friend, also worked in advertising] talks now and again about the one or two of his that survive, but I really hope none of mine do. When I went into advertising, yes, I was being creative, but it was writing for committee, which is not the same thing at all. To be a writer, you have to write for yourself. When I wrote my first novel, I didn\u2019t write it to be published, but to prove that I could write it for myself. I needed an avenue to write darker stuff. There\u2019s no place for that in writing that\u2019s selling eggs.\u201d It was while at the advertising agency that James found himself drawn into a local evangelical church. Alongside a ready-made community, it seemed to offer a means of dealing with the fact that it was becoming increasingly clear to James, who\u2019d lived a monkish life thus far, that he was gay. He described in horrifying detail in a recent New Yorker article how he underwent exorcism at the church. It was during this traumatic time, though, that he wrote John Crow\u2019s Devil, his lowering Faulknerian debut, which tells of two rival priests, each with a guilty sexual secret to hide, competing for primacy in a fictional Jamaican village in the 1950s. It\u2019s a fabulous book, dark and angry and experimental, every page bearing traces of the linguistic daring and visionary imagination that would later characterise James\u2019s work. In that same New Yorker article, he said that he was sceptical of pop psychology and trying to read too much of his personal life into his books, but he concedes that his first novel plays out the conflicts he was going through at the time. \u201cI was trying on being a writer for size,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI was trying on writing about things that are close to me for size. Like sexuality. At the time, I wasn\u2019t in any form of gay relationship. It\u2019s funny that I\u2019ve gone from hating pop psychology to being way too Freudian. I can see all my fears and desires in it. Ones I could never give in to because I was deep in the church and I was a super-suppressed gay dude.\u201d He left the church and sent his novel out to a selection of New York agents. When the first handful said no, he sent it to more, and more, and more, 78 in all. Each of them rejected it. \u201cI remember that somebody said it was the subject matter \u2013 that nobody wants to read about the Caribbean, that it was because it was super dark, because there are no white people in it. At that time, dark had to be couched in a certain way. It had to be The Lovely Bones. It had to have a redemptive narrative. I think we\u2019re still in a place where we want a white person to play a part, even in a black story. I briefly toyed with putting my [white] friend Gerard\u2019s picture in my biog and sending the book back out,\u201d he says with a laugh. In the end, James\u2019s novel was read by an American author, Kaylie Jones, who passed it on to the indie press Akashic Books in New York. John Crow\u2019s Devil was published to a warm critical reception in 2005. The narrative from here is often painted as an inexorable rise to literary stardom, but James reminds me that his second novel, The Book of Night Women, a brutal 18th-century slave narrative that takes place on a Jamaican sugar plantation, was also turned down almost 20 times, before being picked up by Riverhead Books and published in 2009. It was his next book, A Brief History of Seven Killings, which established James as a major literary force. When Michael Wood, the Man Booker chair that year, was asked how long deliberations about the winner had taken, he replied carefully that they\u2019d been in the room for two hours. Someone else who was there tells me \u2013 on the assurance of anonymity \u2013 that it was barely 10 minutes before they agreed on James\u2019s extraordinary novel. \u201cEven among these enormously sophisticated readers, they had never read anything like this... everyone was blown away.\u201d \u201cIt changed everything,\u201d James says of the prize. \u201cI visited countless countries. I\u2019d started thinking about this novel [Black Leopard\u2026] well before I won the Booker, so I wasn\u2019t consumed with expectations about what I was going to do next.\u201d He suggested to his agent a \u201cquiet, literary\u201d novel about Jamaicans in New York. Then he began to speak about fantasy. \u201cThere are people who follow the Booker with over-ambitious books that fail. I worried that this \u2013\u201d he taps Black Leopard... \u2013 \u201cmight just come across as me going bigger, harder, faster. It was more reason for me to choose the quiet, literary, observant, contemporary novel. The mature and wise follow-up instead of a book with flipping monsters in it. But I was still thinking of myself as a kind of underdog writer, someone who\u2019d be able to get away with it.\u201d One thing the new novel shares with its predecessors is a uniquely intense presentation of violence. I ask him whether he ever feels that his work strays close to gratuitousness, to a kind of wilful lingering over scenes of pain. \u201cYou have to risk it or you won\u2019t get close to the power or the horror of it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to risk going too far. Man, I sound like Foucault. I actually think this kind of antiseptic, clipped, edited version of violence I see in literature sells it short. If you don\u2019t read the scene of the murder of a child and find it unbearable, then that scene failed. I think people are used to violence, but they\u2019re not used to suffering. In Hollywood films, we see violence, but we don\u2019t see suffering. In my writing of violence I do not escape suffering and I think one of my violent scenes is equivalent to 30 of someone else\u2019s. I get this rap of being too violent, but actually what I\u2019m saying is that violence comes with consequences and suffering and I don\u2019t blink at either. So it\u2019s going to reverberate longer in my books.\u201d It feels like there\u2019s something particular about the fact that a Jamaican relocated to the US (James left Jamaica in 2007) should be writing this great syncretic African epic, that both his distance and his closeness to the cultures from which he draws at once give the novel the perspective and authenticity it requires. I ask if there were any authors whose work inspired the vision of Black Leopard\u2026 \u201cI really wasn\u2019t reading a lot of other people. I was reading a lot of the original myths and legends. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to write a fantasy novel. I wanted the ability to pick and choose and do what Tolkien did with Scandinavian and British culture. I wanted this pool of ideas and legends and building something out of it. I read enough and researched enough that I could have written three historical novels. I could easily have written an Ethiopian Wolf Hall. Or a Ghanaian Fifth Queen [Ford Madox Ford\u2019s unjustly forgotten trilogy about Katharine Howard].\u201d As far as other literary inspirations, there is always Salman Rushdie, he says \u2013 Shame is one of his favourite novels. I email Rushdie on my return and he says he hasn\u2019t read the new book yet, but that James is \u201ca writer of prodigious imaginative gifts and, judging by the advance praise, he\u2019s about to have a monster hit\u201d. There\u2019s also Ben Okri, whose The Famished Road, also one of a trilogy, won the Booker in 1991. \u201cWhen I read Famished Road,\u201d James tells me, \u201cthe urbanity of it is distinctly African. It\u2019s the noise, the cacophony, the spirits and the magic. You can smell the groceries, the shit, but you can also see the zombies. I actually reread The Famished Road while I was writing this. The one thing we all have in common is that we recognise that realism can\u2019t express what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve all at some point reached the end of ourselves in realism. Our reality can\u2019t be expressed by the Victorian novel. Okri is such an influence on me. I\u2019ve read Famished Road like four times.\u201d Okri speaks to me on the phone when I\u2019m back in England. \u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to do is amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly given the context of the Caribbean/African relationship. The depth of culture is historically very important, that we have this reciprocity, this dialogue in our literature through history. We all have this rich, unacknowledged African past. This is something that has been felt by many writers and we\u2019ve been looking for a means of articulating it in a universal way, looking for those deep myths, those deep histories. There\u2019s been a lapse of a generation in the literary relationship between African, Caribbean and American writers, and what Marlon is doing seems to signal to me the return to something that\u2019s important for all three linked cultures and is therefore a sign of hope.\u201d As we leave the bar, James speaks to me about the Windrush scandal, which he\u2019d been following closely. \u201cIt struck me as very British-colonial,\u201d he says. \u201cI was reading in the Guardian today where it was talking about British people living in Spain who are really apprehensive about losing their benefits and yet they support Brexit. They want Spain to support them but they don\u2019t want to support Spain. Such entitlement to something that you have no intention of returning. Windrush hit me in the same way. You\u2019re talking about the descendants of people who fought in both world wars. If anything, they should be giving them subsidies. You made so much money colonising all of these countries, leaving each one in far worse shape than you found them, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to accept any of these people in your country, people whose parents and grandparents helped build it.\u201d A couple of days after the interview, it\u2019s announced that Michael B Jordan, one of the stars of Black Panther, has bought the rights to the new novel. I call James, who\u2019s at an airport on his way between book signings, to congratulate him. He loved Black Panther, he tells me. \u201cI saw it five times. I started this book in 2015, so I don\u2019t know that they\u2019d even announced that it was going to be made. But from the moment they announced it I was super-excited. I\u2019ve known the comic since the 70s, since Denys Cowan used to write for it.\u201d There was no concern that it might seem too close to the material in the novel James was halfway through writing by the time the film came out? \u201cI didn\u2019t think about Black Panther when I was writing the book. I knew it was a different story, I think we still expect the same story. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaks about the danger of a single story. There are a million stories that can be told about Africa \u2013 that was one and what I was writing was another.\u201d There was an instant rapport between James and Jordan. \u201cWe spoke on the phone for nearly two hours, about what we want to achieve with our work and representation and what stories need to be told. We were on the same page in that regard before we even talked about movie deals. We were so much on the same wavelength as to what stories we want to see. \u201cAs people of colour in the diaspora, we\u2019re particularly interested in stories that go beyond slavery. I\u2019m tired of that being seen as the furthest in the past we can go or that swords and sorcery aren\u2019t available to us.\u201d I ask James if he\u2019s going to write the script \u2013 he worked on a screenplay of A Brief History\u2026 that is yet to be aired. \u201cI\u2019m too busy,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve got part two and three of this series to write.\u201d \u2022 Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James is published by Penguin (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>The night of the Oscars ceremony \u2013 which was first held 90 years ago this May \u2013 is the one essential date in the movie world calendar, the giddy, glamorous apex of industry celebration. It\u2019s fascinating and infuriating. But the Academy Awards don\u2019t always get it right. In fact, on many now infamous occasions, they got it totally wrong.</p> <p>Giving <em>How Green Was My Valley</em> best picture over <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/09/orson-welles-sketches-new-book\" title=\"\">Citizen Kane</a></em>, for example. But while there is always going to be debate over whether the best picture actually won best picture \u2013 merit is a difficult thing to quantify, after all \u2013 each year\u2019s top prize winner and, perhaps more importantly, the reaction to it, tells us something about the cultural zeitgeist.</p> <p>The Academy Awards represent, indeed, a snapshot of a section of America\u2019s prevailing concerns, the issues and themes that are deemed important by the Academy voters and by the audiences who voted with their feet and put the film on the awards circuit in the first place.</p> <p>Of course, prevailing concerns can be swayed, as they were in the era of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s notoriously forceful awards campaigns. And the issues that concern the average Academy voter are unlikely to overlap much with those of the average punter. But the best of the best pictures over the past nine decades are not just the most elegantly crafted pieces of film-making \u2013 they are the films with themes that resonate still with a present-day audience. <strong>Wendy Ide</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/15/casablanca-humphrey-bogart-film-review-1943\" title=\"\">Casablanca</a><strong>,</strong> Winner at the 16th ceremony, 1944</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5bec7fc885c250706f37421b0425958880ada62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5bec7fc885c250706f37421b0425958880ada62/0_93_2035_1220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A peerless cast\u2019: Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike many of the earlier best picture winners that have aged rather inelegantly, <em>Casablanca</em>, if anything, has matured, its textures deepened.

      "bodyText": "The night of the Oscars ceremony \u2013 which was first held 90 years ago this May \u2013 is the one essential date in the movie world calendar, the giddy, glamorous apex of industry celebration. It\u2019s fascinating and infuriating. But the Academy Awards don\u2019t always get it right. In fact, on many now infamous occasions, they got it totally wrong. Giving How Green Was My Valley best picture over Citizen Kane, for example. But while there is always going to be debate over whether the best picture actually won best picture \u2013 merit is a difficult thing to quantify, after all \u2013 each year\u2019s top prize winner and, perhaps more importantly, the reaction to it, tells us something about the cultural zeitgeist. The Academy Awards represent, indeed, a snapshot of a section of America\u2019s prevailing concerns, the issues and themes that are deemed important by the Academy voters and by the audiences who voted with their feet and put the film on the awards circuit in the first place. Of course, prevailing concerns can be swayed, as they were in the era of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s notoriously forceful awards campaigns. And the issues that concern the average Academy voter are unlikely to overlap much with those of the average punter. But the best of the best pictures over the past nine decades are not just the most elegantly crafted pieces of film-making \u2013 they are the films with themes that resonate still with a present-day audience. Wendy Ide Casablanca, Winner at the 16th ceremony, 1944 Unlike many of the earlier best picture winners that have aged rather inelegantly, Casablanca, if anything, has matured, its textures deepened. A peerless cast \u2013 Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are matched by an impressive array of supporting character actors \u2013 work with a precisely crafted masterpiece of a screenplay. Directed by Michael Curtiz, this story of rootless refugees from the second world war, washed up in a city, which stamps its personality on every frame, feels both timely and timeless. All About Eve, 1951 1951 was notable as the year in which two far from flattering portraits of the acting profession went head to head. Joseph L Mankiewicz\u2019s All About Eve, a crisply malicious portrait of the rivalry and ruthlessness of actresses, won the prize for best picture. But perhaps equally deserving was Billy Wilder\u2019s Sunset Boulevard, a film that turned a mirror on the industry itself. It clearly wasn\u2019t keen on what it saw there. Despite the fact that All About Eve was carried by two remarkable performances, from Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, neither won best actress. The prize went to Judy Holliday, for George Cukor\u2019s Born Yesterday. The Apartment, 1961 A biting tragicomic romance, Billy Wilder\u2019s The Apartment seems darker with each passing year. The story of a low-level employee (Jack Lemmon) who tries to curry favour with his boss by lending his apartment as a venue for the other man\u2019s affair, the film was based partly on a real-life Hollywood scandal. A high-powered agent was shot by a producer for having an affair with his wife that had played out in the apartment of a hapless employee. The Sound of Music, 1966 OK, so it\u2019s no masterpiece and possibly not even the most deserving of the nominees that year (my pick would have been John Schlesinger\u2019s Darling; others might argue for David Lean\u2019s Doctor Zhivago). But few best picture winners have achieved such an enduring cultural impact as this Robert Wise film. A big-hearted crowd-pleaser of a movie, it was credited with saving 20th Century Fox, after the costly failure of Cleopatra. That said, Christopher Plummer hated working on the picture it and renamed it The Sound of Mucus. The French Connection, 1972 The first R-rated film to win best picture, it heralded US cinema\u2019s most vital and visceral period. Gritty, breathlessly thrilling and pulsing with tension, William Friedkin\u2019s grungily authentic crime movie was shot on a shoestring budget. The car chase, now regarded as one of the greatest of all time, was filmed without permits; the near collisions, and in one case an actual collision, were unplanned. If the 1970s was the decade of the outlaw film-maker, The French Connection was the most daring coup. The Godfather, 1973 Francis Ford Coppola had an eventful few years that kicked off with the best picture award for a film widely considered to be a landmark in US cinema. He scored another nomination for best picture the following year, as the producer of George Lucas\u2019s American Graffiti. Then, in 1975, he pulled off the unprecedented achievement of having directed two best picture nominees: The Godfather Part II and The Conversation. The Godfather Part II won, one of only two sequels ever to do so (the other was The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King). One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, 1976 This adaptation of Ken Kesey\u2019s novel was a troubled production from the outset. Its star, Jack Nicholson, and director, Milo\u0161 Forman, fell out spectacularly over the approach; Nicholson organised a cast rebellion and hijacked the rehearsals; director and actor refused to speak to each other throughout. But One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest went on to win the grand slam of Academy Awards: best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor and best actress. It was the second film ever to do so. The Hurt Locker, 2010 A landmark film for its visceral and starkly truthful portrayal of modern warfare and for the fact that it was the first and, to date, only best picture winner to be directed by a woman. Kathryn Bigelow also won best director. Jeremy Renner stars as a maverick bomb disposal expert who finds himself at odds both with his fellow soldiers and with the family at home in a civilian world that seems crushingly mundane to someone hooked on the adrenaline hit of daily near-death experiences. Moonlight, 2017 The results mix-up at the Oscars ceremony, in which La La Land was briefly and erroneously declared best picture winner by co-presenter Faye Dunaway, overshadowed the fact that Barry Jenkins\u2019s swooningly lovely piece of cinematic poetry was one of the most deserving winners in years.

The fashion industry\u2019s influence permeates deep within culture and radiates globally. \u201cWhile the fashion industry is not responsible for the unsustainable system it exists within, it is a key driver of global trends and a significant source of ecological devastation.\u201d She said global clothing consumption had doubled in the past 15 years, while utilisation \u2013 how often clothes are worn \u2013 had decreased by 36%, with total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2bn tonnes annually, exceeding those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. \u201cThere are no signs that this is slowing, and events such as London fashion week contribute to and encourage this continued unsustainable growth,\u201d Farrell added, saying that the fashion industry was the most influential on earth. The BFC said it showcased British businesses engaging in sustainable practices and that it believed shifts within London-based brands could spearhead changes within the wider industry. \u201cWe are committed to supporting businesses to do more to develop through green growth and our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Shetland</strong></h2> <p><strong>Start/end </strong>Bird Observatory<br><strong>Distance </strong>4 miles<br><strong>Time </strong>2 hours if you go all the way south</p> <p>My first encounter with Shetland was Fair Isle, the most remote inhabited island in the UK. I washed up there, a university dropout, to be assistant cook in the bird observatory. It\u2019s the island I know and love best, and it\u2019s where the character DI Jimmy Perez in my Shetland series of murder mysteries was born. It\u2019s also where the BBC filmed part of the adaptation of my book Blue Lightning for the series, and on this walk, you\u2019ll glimpse many of the background scenes.</p> <p>Most visitors stay at the <a href=\"http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bird Observatory &amp; Guesthouse</a> near the north end of the island. The accommodation is quite grand now: all the rooms are en suite and there\u2019s a bar. The staff census the birds on the island and although everyone is welcome, this is a working place and many of the guests are amateur ornithologists.</p> <p>The island is about three miles long and a mile-and-a-half wide, but it\u2019s hilly and there are inlets, known as geos, in the cliffs, so it would be a stretch to walk all the way round in one go. A stroll from the observatory takes you across the track to the promontory of Buness. From here, watch the arrival of the mail boat, the Good Shepherd, and meet the islanders who turn out to unload it. In late spring and summer, it\u2019s a great place to spot the puffins that nest close to the cliff edge. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65b4d580fa7253ec25269577f1d4501d97f80b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b4d580fa7253ec25269577f1d4501d97f80b8c/0_236_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"inlets in the cliffs of Fair Isle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craggy island \u2026 inlets in the cliffs of Fair Isle are known as geos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Debler/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Retrace your steps and follow the road south until you come to the drystone wall, the dyke, which cuts across the low land to the east. This marshy area is called Gilsetter, and in the summer it\u2019s covered in wildflowers. Either continue south along the footpath, or head further east towards the sea and Sheep Rock, which provides the distinctive profile of the Isle.</p> <p>If you rejoin the track further south, you\u2019ll come to the more densely inhabited part of the island. The crofts, where most islanders live, are here, with the shop, the kirk and the small museum.</p> <p>The road splits close to the school so it\u2019s possible to do a circular walk, either by going all the way to the south harbour or by cutting across the footpath past the museum. If you go south, take a look at the small graveyard, next to the shore. It\u2019s a fascinating record of island history.</p> <p>Heading back to the observatory, you\u2019ll see Malcolm\u2019s Head to the west. From the top, the south of the island is spread beneath you and there\u2019s a view north towards Ward Hill and the stunning cliffs that are home to Fair Isle\u2019s gannets. If you venture on to the hill in the breeding season, beware of the \u201cbonxies\u201d (the great skuas) that protect their young by dive- bombing intruders.</p> <p>Fair Isle is a magical place for the photographer and natural historian. But it\u2019s the people who make it so special. So, if you visit, do make an effort to get to know them \u2013 go along to island events, use the shop, visit the museum. You might meet the original Jimmy Perez. <strong>AC</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wild-fire-617666.html\">Wild Fire, by Ann Cleeves</a>, the last in the Shetland series, is published by Pan.</em> <em>Series five of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01s711r\" title=\"\">Shetland is on BBC One</a> at 9pm on Tuesdays</em></p> <h2><strong>Requiem, southern Snowdonia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2569fe25e3bf01c063af9182b42ce617e127335d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2569fe25e3bf01c063af9182b42ce617e127335d/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mystic peak \u2026 Cadair Idris looms over Dolgellau from the south.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystic peak \u2026 Cadair Idris looms over Dolgellau from the south.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hornblow/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Start/end </strong>Eldon Sq, Dolgellau<br><strong>Distance</strong> 8\u00bd miles<br><strong>Time</strong> 6-8 hours</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it like that,\u201d I implored my walking companion, Rob, as we headed into the small market town of Dolgellau in Gwynedd.</p> <p>We were stocking up on snacks before a hike, and he insisted on calling it \u201cDolly-gelloo\u201d (it should be Dol-geth-lie).</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get us into all kinds of trouble,\u201d I sighed, as I ushered him out of the grocery store to the start of our trail.</p> <p>Trouble, of the fictional kind anyway, is something that has become synonymous with this place of late, since it appeared as the fictional Welsh village of Penllynith in the BBC thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/02/requiem-review-bbc1-horror-cliches\" title=\"\">Requiem</a>, about a missing girl and a woman called Matilda trying to find the truth about what happened to her.</p> <p>The producers are said to have selected this location because of the mysticism of the rugged Welsh landscape, and you don\u2019t get more mystical than the full day\u2019s stroll up to the peak of Cadair Idris that looms above it. This is where we were headed, a place full of tales of ghouls and spectres: it\u2019s said to be the \u201cChair of Idris\u201d, the giant who sits in the <em>cwm</em> (hollow) below the summit, watching the stars, as well as the hunting ground for Gwyn ap Nudd (the Lord of the Underworld), and home to a monster in the \u201cbottomless\u201d lake of Llyn y Gadair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43a0775571ca3d480f5dc20f33db4cd4cff86c0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a0775571ca3d480f5dc20f33db4cd4cff86c0b/0_495_4039_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lydia Wilson as Matilda in BBC One drama Requiem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lydia Wilson as Matilda in BBC One drama Requiem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Antony/BBC/New Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We followed a network of connecting footpaths to the base of the summit trail at the <a href=\"http://www.gwernan.wales/\" title=\"\">Gwernan Lake Hotel</a>. From here we headed uphill, first through woodland where the trees bent over the path in perfect fairytale formation. Then out onto the hillside, following the contours up to the famed lake.</p> <p>We spent the next couple of hours climbing further still, gawping at otherworldly views as we wove through jagged rocks on a boot-beaten path. On reaching the top I turned to Rob and said: \u201cYou know, if you spend a night on the summit you are supposed to either become a poet or go mad \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need,\u201d replied Rob, smiling. \u201cThere was a young woman from Venus\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Where was Gwyn ap Nudd when you needed him?</p> <p>On the way back to town, we stopped on the cliff edges that surrounded the water. Rocks lined the slopes, where they had stopped mid-tumble while spilling into it like granulated sugar. It reminded me of a dramatic scene in the TV show, where the voiceover tells us that this area is \u201cnot like anywhere else\u201d. Peering down at this massive amphitheatre of rock, we were inclined to finally agree. The names of the places may sound make-believe, and Requiem is a work of fiction, but the walk from Dolgellau to Cadair Idris is, in real life, better than anything you could ever imagine. <strong>PS</strong></p> <h2><strong>Game of Thrones: Dark Hedges, County Antrim</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f667607d7cec2ffc903ba806c421b54cb6da2408\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f667607d7cec2ffc903ba806c421b54cb6da2408/0_138_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Down the Kings Road \u2026 Dark Hedges, near Ballymoney, County Antrim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Down the Kings Road \u2026 Dark Hedges, near Ballymoney, County Antrim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Start/end </strong>The Hedges Hotel, near Ballymoney<br><strong>Distance </strong>\u00bd mile<br><strong>Time </strong>As long as you like</p> <p>There was a time when the Giant\u2019s Causeway was the most famous site in Northern Ireland, but thanks to George RR Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones the whole country is now a TV lover\u2019s playground, from the coast at Ballycastle to the quarry at Magheramorne, which appears as The Wall in earlier seasons, but is said to be Winterfell in the forthcoming finale.

      "bodyText": "Shetland Start/end Bird Observatory Distance 4 miles Time 2 hours if you go all the way south My first encounter with Shetland was Fair Isle, the most remote inhabited island in the UK. I washed up there, a university dropout, to be assistant cook in the bird observatory. It\u2019s the island I know and love best, and it\u2019s where the character DI Jimmy Perez in my Shetland series of murder mysteries was born. It\u2019s also where the BBC filmed part of the adaptation of my book Blue Lightning for the series, and on this walk, you\u2019ll glimpse many of the background scenes. Most visitors stay at the Bird Observatory &amp; Guesthouse near the north end of the island. The accommodation is quite grand now: all the rooms are en suite and there\u2019s a bar. The staff census the birds on the island and although everyone is welcome, this is a working place and many of the guests are amateur ornithologists. The island is about three miles long and a mile-and-a-half wide, but it\u2019s hilly and there are inlets, known as geos, in the cliffs, so it would be a stretch to walk all the way round in one go. A stroll from the observatory takes you across the track to the promontory of Buness. From here, watch the arrival of the mail boat, the Good Shepherd, and meet the islanders who turn out to unload it. In late spring and summer, it\u2019s a great place to spot the puffins that nest close to the cliff edge. Retrace your steps and follow the road south until you come to the drystone wall, the dyke, which cuts across the low land to the east. This marshy area is called Gilsetter, and in the summer it\u2019s covered in wildflowers. Either continue south along the footpath, or head further east towards the sea and Sheep Rock, which provides the distinctive profile of the Isle. If you rejoin the track further south, you\u2019ll come to the more densely inhabited part of the island. The crofts, where most islanders live, are here, with the shop, the kirk and the small museum. The road splits close to the school so it\u2019s possible to do a circular walk, either by going all the way to the south harbour or by cutting across the footpath past the museum. If you go south, take a look at the small graveyard, next to the shore. It\u2019s a fascinating record of island history. Heading back to the observatory, you\u2019ll see Malcolm\u2019s Head to the west. From the top, the south of the island is spread beneath you and there\u2019s a view north towards Ward Hill and the stunning cliffs that are home to Fair Isle\u2019s gannets. If you venture on to the hill in the breeding season, beware of the \u201cbonxies\u201d (the great skuas) that protect their young by dive- bombing intruders. Fair Isle is a magical place for the photographer and natural historian. But it\u2019s the people who make it so special. So, if you visit, do make an effort to get to know them \u2013 go along to island events, use the shop, visit the museum. You might meet the original Jimmy Perez. AC \u2022 Wild Fire, by Ann Cleeves, the last in the Shetland series, is published by Pan. Series five of Shetland is on BBC One at 9pm on Tuesdays Requiem, southern Snowdonia Start/end Eldon Sq, Dolgellau Distance 8\u00bd miles Time 6-8 hours \u201cPlease don\u2019t say it like that,\u201d I implored my walking companion, Rob, as we headed into the small market town of Dolgellau in Gwynedd. We were stocking up on snacks before a hike, and he insisted on calling it \u201cDolly-gelloo\u201d (it should be Dol-geth-lie). \u201cYou\u2019ll get us into all kinds of trouble,\u201d I sighed, as I ushered him out of the grocery store to the start of our trail. Trouble, of the fictional kind anyway, is something that has become synonymous with this place of late, since it appeared as the fictional Welsh village of Penllynith in the BBC thriller Requiem, about a missing girl and a woman called Matilda trying to find the truth about what happened to her. The producers are said to have selected this location because of the mysticism of the rugged Welsh landscape, and you don\u2019t get more mystical than the full day\u2019s stroll up to the peak of Cadair Idris that looms above it. This is where we were headed, a place full of tales of ghouls and spectres: it\u2019s said to be the \u201cChair of Idris\u201d, the giant who sits in the cwm (hollow) below the summit, watching the stars, as well as the hunting ground for Gwyn ap Nudd (the Lord of the Underworld), and home to a monster in the \u201cbottomless\u201d lake of Llyn y Gadair. We followed a network of connecting footpaths to the base of the summit trail at the Gwernan Lake Hotel. From here we headed uphill, first through woodland where the trees bent over the path in perfect fairytale formation. Then out onto the hillside, following the contours up to the famed lake. We spent the next couple of hours climbing further still, gawping at otherworldly views as we wove through jagged rocks on a boot-beaten path. On reaching the top I turned to Rob and said: \u201cYou know, if you spend a night on the summit you are supposed to either become a poet or go mad \u2026\u201d \u201cNo need,\u201d replied Rob, smiling. \u201cThere was a young woman from Venus\u2026\u201d Where was Gwyn ap Nudd when you needed him? On the way back to town, we stopped on the cliff edges that surrounded the water. Rocks lined the slopes, where they had stopped mid-tumble while spilling into it like granulated sugar. It reminded me of a dramatic scene in the TV show, where the voiceover tells us that this area is \u201cnot like anywhere else\u201d. Peering down at this massive amphitheatre of rock, we were inclined to finally agree. The names of the places may sound make-believe, and Requiem is a work of fiction, but the walk from Dolgellau to Cadair Idris is, in real life, better than anything you could ever imagine. PS Game of Thrones: Dark Hedges, County Antrim Start/end The Hedges Hotel, near Ballymoney Distance \u00bd mile Time As long as you like There was a time when the Giant\u2019s Causeway was the most famous site in Northern Ireland, but thanks to George RR Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones the whole country is now a TV lover\u2019s playground, from the coast at Ballycastle to the quarry at Magheramorne, which appears as The Wall in earlier seasons, but is said to be Winterfell in the forthcoming finale. The easiest and most atmospheric walk runs under the Dark Hedges \u2013 the King\u2019s Road in the books, where trees almost 250 years old form a tunnel over the narrow lane, creating a passageway \u2013 particularly from the south. There\u2019s parking (for a charge) in the hotel. Avoid the crowds by going at first light, or late thing in the day, when you may spot the apparition of the grey lady.

Head first for the Victoria Hotel, whose restaurant is the location in which fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock first meets waitress Alma in Phantom Thread. Then head out, like they do, to stroll south, first along the wild stretch of sand below the cliffs (keep an eye out for ammonite fossils amid the \u201cscars\u201d, or cliffs). At the seaside village of Ravenscar, climb up to the Cleveland Way to walk back, while gazing down on the coast, following in the footsteps of both dinosaurs and cinematic legends. PS Sex Education: Wordsworth Walk, Wye Valley Start/end Brown\u2019s Village Stores, Llandogo, Monmouthshire Distance 3 miles Time 2 hours If you\u2019d passed through this Wye Valley enclave last year, you probably wouldn\u2019t have stopped even for a five-minute stroll. Now, however, after the village provided the backdrop to the Netflix hit Sex Education, set in a secondary school and starring Gillian Anderson, fans often linger at the start of this walk to see the shop that features in it. Do the same \u2013 taking time to say hello to Roger and Ruth who own the store \u2013 but then follow the circular Wordsworth Walk to dig deeper into this borderland village, which served as muse for a more romantic type of script penned by the poet more usually linked with the Lake District.

PS Detectorists: Brownsord Way, Suffolk Start/end Framlingham Castle Distance 11 miles Time 5 hours Finding hidden treasure formed the basis for this comedy starring, written and directed by Mackenzie Crook, but the countryside in which the Detectorists follow their passion is easily discovered without a metal detector in sight. Framlingham, eastern Suffolk, doubles for the fictional Essex town of Danebury. Start at the church meeting rooms opposite the town\u2019s Norman castle, where Andy (Crook\u2019s character) heads for meetings of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club. Then follow the waymarked Brownsord Way trail on your own hunt through time, via wildflower meadows, a mere dug in the 12th-century that\u2019s home to otters, and Pepper\u2019s Wash, a ford known to be home to Roman remains.

Where the agreement ends is on the issue of causality.</p> <p>Most research falls well short of Berenson\u2019s certainty, which he primarily bases on two studies. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2892048\">One is by a Swedish researcher</a> who in 1987 concluded that \u201ccannabis is responsible for between 10% and 15% of schizophrenia cases\u201d. The other, published by the National Academy of Medicine in 2017, found that \u201ccannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk\u201d.</p> <p>The latter report, Berenson wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/opinion/marijuana-pot-health-risks-legalization.html\">the New York Times</a> last month, \u201cdeclared the issue settled\u201d. That claim was in turn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zivacooper/status/1083061126219259904\">rebutted by Ziva Cooper, a study board member</a>, who argued in a series of tweets that researchers merely \u201cfound an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia\u201d.</p> <p>Cooper, who directs the Cannabis Research Initiative at UCLA, wrote: \u201cSince the report, we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use, shedding some light on the potential direction of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The reaction from people in the advocacy and science community, I\u2019m surprised by their intellectual dishonesty,</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Berenson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/14/18175446/alex-berenson-tell-your-children-marijuana-psychosis-violence\">Writing for Vox</a>, the reporter German Lopez noted: \u201cFar from declaring this issue \u2018settled\u2019, the National Academy\u2019s report was extremely careful, cautioning that marijuana\u2019s \u2013 and marijuana addiction\u2019s \u2013 link to psychosis \u2018may be multidirectional and complex\u2019. Marijuana may not cause psychosis; something else may cause both psychosis and pot use. Or the causation could go the other way: psychotic disorders may lead to marijuana use, perhaps in an attempt to self-medicate.\u201d</p> <p>One 2010 review of studies on the topic <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19783132\">declared</a>: \u201cThe contentious issue of whether cannabis use can cause serious psychotic disorders that would not otherwise have occurred cannot be answered from the existing data.\u201d</p> <p>Even those who lean towards Berenson\u2019s position tend to show <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904437\">restraint</a>.</p> <p>One of the most certain findings against Berenson\u2019s position, meanwhile, comes from Dr Carl Hart, a drug and addiction researcher at Columbia.</p> <p>In 2016, he concluded: \u201cCannabis does not in itself cause a psychosis disorder. Rather, the evidence leads us to conclude that both early use and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/marijuana-cannabis-health-effects-issues-mental-health-disorders-science\">Does marijuana use really cause psychotic disorders? | Carl L Hart and Charles Ksir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Hart said he was frustrated by even the framing of the question.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing that dumb game that we usually play in the media, like \u2018There\u2019s one side here, there\u2019s one side there,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn science it doesn\u2019t work that way. The evidence guides your position.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bullshit claim. There\u2019s not evidence for it.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018He\u2019s clearly an advocate\u2019</h2> <p>In Tell Your Children, Berenson anticipates resistance. \u201cI know what a lot of you are thinking right now,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis is propaganda. Marijuana is safe. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been told for the last 25 years. I once thought it, too.\u201d</p> <p>He selected the title for the book after anticipating, correctly, that it would be compared to the now widely-mocked 1936 film Reefer Madness, which depicts teens descending into violent insanity. Tell Your Children was the film\u2019s original name. Nonetheless, he told the Guardian he has been surprised by his book\u2019s reception.</p> <p>\u201cThe reaction from people in the advocacy and science community, I\u2019m surprised by their intellectual dishonesty,\u201d Berenson said.</p> <p>In response, Berenson has become increasingly active on Twitter, posting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1093900383037067270\">links to crimes</a> committed by people with marijuana in their system, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1095423329219952640\">goading his critics</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1094066545108701184\">repeating the mantra</a>: \u201cCannabis causes psychosis. Psychosis causes violence.\u201d</p> <p>In conversation, he says he sees himself lining up opposite a well-resourced foe, as monied elites, shielded by a faux-counterculture veneer, line up to make a buck. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rebels seized power and they didn\u2019t even realize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the media, they have an industry, they have financing, they have everything.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I feel like in defending the facts, I\u2019ve been pushed a little bit into being an advocate, which is not where I want to be. I want to be a journalist.\u201d</p> <p>Some think Berenson crossed that line long ago.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s clearly an advocate,\u201d said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the <a href=\"https://blog.norml.org/\">National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a> (Norml). \u201cHe has a biased view. He cherry picks the science that he thinks fits his agenda and he disregards the science that doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/super-bowl-marijuana-industry-advertising\">How a failed Super Bowl ad signals the future of cannabis advertising</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is a common claim from Berenson\u2019s critics on both the issue of schizophrenia and on his claims that states which have fully legalized marijuana have experienced a demonstrable spike in crime, the other primary argument in his book.</p> <p>In return, he sees his critics as advocates defending ideological positions even as science says otherwise.</p> <p>He cites as an example Issac Campos, an associate professor of history at the University of Cincinnati and a signer of the letter. Berenson cited his work in a passage about attitudes towards marijuana in Mexico in the early 20th century.</p> <p>After Campos told Vox that Tell Your Children \u201cpretty badly misrepresented\u201d his argument, Berenson told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m sorry that [Campos\u2019] ideology doesn\u2019t let him see what his research found, which is pretty amazing.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Just tell the truth\u2019</h2> <p>Although debates on the science of the issue are profound, to some degree Berenson and many of his critics seem to be arguing past each other. </p> <p>He wants marijuana legalization advocates to concede that the drug carries real risks; Armentano said that is something they readily do.</p> <p>\u201cNorml is very up front and always has been that cannabis is not innocuous, and that marijuana poses particular risks,\u201d said Armentano. \u201cBerenson is not somehow playing \u2018gotcha\u2019 with a group like Norml by trying to highlight or identify the fact that there may be certain apps at risk populations for cannabis.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates, meanwhile, want Berenson to contend with what they perceive as the failures of marijuana prohibition.</p> <p>In the open letter posted on Friday, the researchers and clinicians wrote: \u201cWeighed against the harms of prohibition, including the criminalization of millions of people, overwhelmingly black and brown, and the devastating collateral consequences of criminal justice system involvement, legalization is the less harmful approach.\u201d</p> <p>Berenson is open to that position \u2013 although he doesn\u2019t agree with it.</p> <p>\u201cYou can believe that cannabis is a real risk for psychosis and violence and still believe it should be legal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a totally reasonable position to take.

      "bodyText": "A group of 75 scholars and medical professionals have criticised a controversial new book about the purported dangers of marijuana, calling it an example of \u201calarmism\u201d designed to stir up public fear \u201cbased on a deeply inaccurate misreading of science\u201d. Tell Your Children, by Alex Berenson, was released last month. It has reignited debate about the drug in a social and political climate rapidly trending towards the legalization of recreational use. Berenson argues that proponents of marijuana use have ignored evidence that the drug\u2019s active compound, THC, may precipitate the onset of schizophrenia and provoke acts of violence in individuals who experience a psychotic \u201cbreak\u201d. On Friday, 75 scholars and clinicians signed an open letter, joining a chorus of disagreement with Berenson by arguing that \u201cestablishing marijuana as a causal link to violence at the individual level is both theoretically and empirically problematic\u201d. The signatories include academics from New York University, Harvard Medical School and Columbia University and care providers including addiction medicine doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers. \u201cWe urge policymakers and the public to rely on scientific evidence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cnot flawed pop science and ideological polemics, in formulating their opinions about marijuana legalization.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Berenson dismissed the letter, arguing that it \u201cattracted only a handful of signatures from MDs, and almost no psychiatrists, who are on the front lines of treating psychosis and severe mental illness\u201d. \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysicians know the truth.\u201d \u2018The evidence guides your position\u2019 The correlation between chronic mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, and marijuana use is widely accepted in scientific literature. Where the agreement ends is on the issue of causality. Most research falls well short of Berenson\u2019s certainty, which he primarily bases on two studies. One is by a Swedish researcher who in 1987 concluded that \u201ccannabis is responsible for between 10% and 15% of schizophrenia cases\u201d. The other, published by the National Academy of Medicine in 2017, found that \u201ccannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk\u201d. The latter report, Berenson wrote in the New York Times last month, \u201cdeclared the issue settled\u201d. That claim was in turn rebutted by Ziva Cooper, a study board member, who argued in a series of tweets that researchers merely \u201cfound an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia\u201d. Cooper, who directs the Cannabis Research Initiative at UCLA, wrote: \u201cSince the report, we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use, shedding some light on the potential direction of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia.\u201d Writing for Vox, the reporter German Lopez noted: \u201cFar from declaring this issue \u2018settled\u2019, the National Academy\u2019s report was extremely careful, cautioning that marijuana\u2019s \u2013 and marijuana addiction\u2019s \u2013 link to psychosis \u2018may be multidirectional and complex\u2019. Marijuana may not cause psychosis; something else may cause both psychosis and pot use. Or the causation could go the other way: psychotic disorders may lead to marijuana use, perhaps in an attempt to self-medicate.\u201d One 2010 review of studies on the topic declared: \u201cThe contentious issue of whether cannabis use can cause serious psychotic disorders that would not otherwise have occurred cannot be answered from the existing data.\u201d Even those who lean towards Berenson\u2019s position tend to show restraint. One of the most certain findings against Berenson\u2019s position, meanwhile, comes from Dr Carl Hart, a drug and addiction researcher at Columbia. In 2016, he concluded: \u201cCannabis does not in itself cause a psychosis disorder. Rather, the evidence leads us to conclude that both early use and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, Hart said he was frustrated by even the framing of the question. \u201cI\u2019m not playing that dumb game that we usually play in the media, like \u2018There\u2019s one side here, there\u2019s one side there,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn science it doesn\u2019t work that way. The evidence guides your position. \u201cIt\u2019s a bullshit claim. There\u2019s not evidence for it.\u201d \u2018He\u2019s clearly an advocate\u2019 In Tell Your Children, Berenson anticipates resistance. \u201cI know what a lot of you are thinking right now,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis is propaganda. Marijuana is safe. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been told for the last 25 years. I once thought it, too.\u201d He selected the title for the book after anticipating, correctly, that it would be compared to the now widely-mocked 1936 film Reefer Madness, which depicts teens descending into violent insanity. Tell Your Children was the film\u2019s original name. Nonetheless, he told the Guardian he has been surprised by his book\u2019s reception. \u201cThe reaction from people in the advocacy and science community, I\u2019m surprised by their intellectual dishonesty,\u201d Berenson said. In response, Berenson has become increasingly active on Twitter, posting links to crimes committed by people with marijuana in their system, goading his critics and repeating the mantra: \u201cCannabis causes psychosis. Psychosis causes violence.\u201d In conversation, he says he sees himself lining up opposite a well-resourced foe, as monied elites, shielded by a faux-counterculture veneer, line up to make a buck. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rebels seized power and they didn\u2019t even realize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the media, they have an industry, they have financing, they have everything. \u201cUnfortunately, I feel like in defending the facts, I\u2019ve been pushed a little bit into being an advocate, which is not where I want to be. I want to be a journalist.\u201d Some think Berenson crossed that line long ago. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly an advocate,\u201d said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml). \u201cHe has a biased view. He cherry picks the science that he thinks fits his agenda and he disregards the science that doesn\u2019t.\u201d That is a common claim from Berenson\u2019s critics on both the issue of schizophrenia and on his claims that states which have fully legalized marijuana have experienced a demonstrable spike in crime, the other primary argument in his book. In return, he sees his critics as advocates defending ideological positions even as science says otherwise. He cites as an example Issac Campos, an associate professor of history at the University of Cincinnati and a signer of the letter. Berenson cited his work in a passage about attitudes towards marijuana in Mexico in the early 20th century. After Campos told Vox that Tell Your Children \u201cpretty badly misrepresented\u201d his argument, Berenson told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m sorry that [Campos\u2019] ideology doesn\u2019t let him see what his research found, which is pretty amazing.\u201d \u2018Just tell the truth\u2019 Although debates on the science of the issue are profound, to some degree Berenson and many of his critics seem to be arguing past each other. He wants marijuana legalization advocates to concede that the drug carries real risks; Armentano said that is something they readily do. \u201cNorml is very up front and always has been that cannabis is not innocuous, and that marijuana poses particular risks,\u201d said Armentano. \u201cBerenson is not somehow playing \u2018gotcha\u2019 with a group like Norml by trying to highlight or identify the fact that there may be certain apps at risk populations for cannabis.\u201d Advocates, meanwhile, want Berenson to contend with what they perceive as the failures of marijuana prohibition. In the open letter posted on Friday, the researchers and clinicians wrote: \u201cWeighed against the harms of prohibition, including the criminalization of millions of people, overwhelmingly black and brown, and the devastating collateral consequences of criminal justice system involvement, legalization is the less harmful approach.\u201d Berenson is open to that position \u2013 although he doesn\u2019t agree with it. \u201cYou can believe that cannabis is a real risk for psychosis and violence and still believe it should be legal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a totally reasonable position to take. Just tell the truth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has told the EU it must take back its 800 Isis fighters captured in Syria by US-backed forces and put them on trial. The president\u2019s call came as he prepared to claim the end of the caliphate in north-west Syria with the fall of the final Isis-held town. Some EU countries, notably France, have said they are preparing to take back their former jihadists, but the UK has been more resistant: it says the fighters held by the west\u2019s Syrian Kurd allies can only return if they seek consular help in Turkey. The UK government says it faces a dilemma, especially concerning the wives or children of British fighters, and a major challenge either to prosecute the fighters or prevent them from undertaking terrorist acts in their homeland. Trump tweeted: \u201cThe United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 Isis fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them. \u201cThe US does not want to watch as these Isis fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!\u201d Diplomats gathered at this weekend\u2019s Munich security conference, a major meeting of officials and policymakers, have repeatedly warned that the capture of Isis-held territory does not mean an end to the Isis ideological and terrorist threat; they point to the way in which Isis forces are already regathering in Iraq, notably Mosul. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they have cornered the remaining Isis militants in a neighbourhood of Baghuz village near the Iraqi border. Foreign fighters and families have featured prominently among those who have fled the village, which had been been a collection point for extremists who had fled other towns and villages across Syria and Iraq. It is thought to be the last redoubt of zealots who had fought in numerous clashes across both countries. A SDF spokesman on Sunday said Isis militants were preventing more than 1,000 civilians from leaving. Shamima Begum, 19, one of three east London schoolgirls who left the UK in 2015 to join Isis, was on Thursday discovered in the al-Hawl refugee camp in north-east Syria after fleeing the enclave. Trump\u2019s remarks mask an intense transatlantic debate under way between politicians and military over how to handle his unilateral decision to withdraw its 2,000 troops in north-west Syria. The US military, and Arab states, have been pressing the Trump administration to delay the move to give more time for an agreement to be reached on how the mainly Kurd SDF are to be protected from a potential Turkish incursion once US forces leave. The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, met his US counterpart, Patrick Shanahan, on the sidelines of the Munich conference to press his plan for Turkey to establish a safe zone, saying the Kurds in the SDF are indistinguishable from the Kurdish PKK fighting a separatist terrorist war inside Turkey. The Kurdish leadership is resisting the move, fearing it will lead to either a massacre or displacement of the Kurds. \u201cThere is no difference between the PKK and the YPG,\u201d Akar said. \u201cA 440-km-long (273-mile) safe zone in east of Euphrates should be cleared of the terrorist YPG group and should be patrolled by the Turkish forces,\u201d he stressed. In a speech broadcast on Syrian state television, Bashar al-Assad said his troops would \u201cliberate every inch\u201d of the country and warned Kurdish forces not to rely on US protection. \u201cTo those groups who are betting on the Americans, we say the Americans will not protect you... the Americans will put you in their pockets to be used as bargaining tools,\u201d he said. James Jeffery, US envoy for Syria, said it \u201cwill not allow the return of the Assad forces to the places where we will withdraw them from.[\u2026] this is not going to be an abrupt, rapid withdrawal but a step-by-step withdrawal.\u201d There is growing frustration in European and Gulf states at what they regard as the incoherence of US policy making in Syria both in substance and method. Senior Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham have acknowledged that the SDF has borne the brunt of fighting Isis, and there would be long term implications for the US\u2019s reputation in the Middle East if it was seen to desert its allies at this stage. He said Trump had been pressing European forces to set up a small international force to protect the Kurds, including some of the foreign fighters currently held by Kurds either in jails or, in the case of their relatives, in refugee camps. France has as many as 400 forces in Syria, but the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said in an interview published in the Arab press in the weekend that the UK has no plans to send further forces to the region, but will listen to any US request. Joe Biden a potential Democratic presidential candidate urged Europe to wait for the return of a consultative America.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/topic/joel-golby\" title=\"\">Joel Golby</a> is a man of words. He loves words, by the tens of thousands, as evidenced by his features for irreverent/cool culture brand <em>Vice</em>, which are frequently tests of endurance but never, ever dull. His wonderful dissections of the cynical cash grabs that are the property rental ads of London, and earnest yet amusing dissertations on anything from sex doll hotels to Robbie Williams, have rightly won him legions of fans. Now Golby has channelled his considerable energy and limitless wit into his debut book \u2013 a memoir of sorts presented as a collection of essays, rants and musings.</p> <p>While he is best known for his humour, the opener \u2013 Things You Only Know When Both Your Parents Are Dead \u2013 makes it clear that we\u2019re going rather deeper (Golby\u2019s parents had both died by the time he was 25). It\u2019s a body blow of a piece; a clear, evocative and often funny essay on the absurdities of bereavement (\u201cThis is another thing they don\u2019t tell you about death: how, logistically, getting rid of two-and-a-half kilos of ground Mum is a nightmare\u201d).</p> <p>No matter how ridiculous the next chapters get \u2013 and occasionally he can be punchable \u2013 the impact of the first can be felt throughout. Using a blend of insightful self-deprecation and almost lovable braggadocio, Golby tackles subjects big and small with the same forensic thinking and enthusiasm. We head to the desert for a camel festival \u2013 \u201cKnown colloquially as the \u2018Miss Camel\u2019 beauty pageant\u2026 which suggests camels in thick rouge and red lipstick, stiltedly walking on stilettos\u201d \u2013 and are also treated to a tribute to <em>Rocky IV</em>, Golby\u2019s experience with drugs, the bewildering inconsistencies of clothing sizing conventions, and the posing and answering of a million questions you would never think of asking. Could he win a fight against the red and yellow M&amp;M\u2019s from the adverts that speak like mafia dons and, while we\u2019re at it, do they have genitals? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/02/you-will-behave-weirdly-what-i-learned-from-becoming-an-orphan-at-25\">'You will behave weirdly': what I learned from becoming an orphan at 25</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the highlights is Golby\u2019s takedown of the sociopathic buy-to-let landlords who are choking the property market to death with their deposit-snatching claws. \u201cIf the universe is just,\u201d he writes, after describing a couple of his weirdest rented housing setups, \u201cit will, just once, let me watch my landlord die.\u201d</p> <p>While <em>Brilliant, Brilliant</em> has no narrative thread, making it a book to dip in and out of rather than devour in one sitting, Golby is great at switching between the poignant and the absurd, observing life both with the wonder of a toddler who has just discovered where you hid the crayons and the confidence of the friend who tells you \u201cI got this\u201d before attempting to fix your vacuum cleaner. </p> <p>As dazzling as he is at the fantastical, Golby is best when he\u2019s talking about family and relationships. The book ends almost as it began, with Golby\u2019s parents, this time celebrating the birth of the author. Even though we know how the story ends, there is humour and hope. Using the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d five times in the title is a risk, but Golby\u2019s memoir earns the right to at least four of them.</p> <p><em>Adam Kay is the author of </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/this-is-going-to-hurt-559001.html\" title=\"\"><em>This Is Going to Hurt</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant </em>by Joel Golby is published by Mudlark (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Joel Golby is a man of words. He loves words, by the tens of thousands, as evidenced by his features for irreverent/cool culture brand Vice, which are frequently tests of endurance but never, ever dull. His wonderful dissections of the cynical cash grabs that are the property rental ads of London, and earnest yet amusing dissertations on anything from sex doll hotels to Robbie Williams, have rightly won him legions of fans. Now Golby has channelled his considerable energy and limitless wit into his debut book \u2013 a memoir of sorts presented as a collection of essays, rants and musings. While he is best known for his humour, the opener \u2013 Things You Only Know When Both Your Parents Are Dead \u2013 makes it clear that we\u2019re going rather deeper (Golby\u2019s parents had both died by the time he was 25). It\u2019s a body blow of a piece; a clear, evocative and often funny essay on the absurdities of bereavement (\u201cThis is another thing they don\u2019t tell you about death: how, logistically, getting rid of two-and-a-half kilos of ground Mum is a nightmare\u201d). No matter how ridiculous the next chapters get \u2013 and occasionally he can be punchable \u2013 the impact of the first can be felt throughout. Using a blend of insightful self-deprecation and almost lovable braggadocio, Golby tackles subjects big and small with the same forensic thinking and enthusiasm. We head to the desert for a camel festival \u2013 \u201cKnown colloquially as the \u2018Miss Camel\u2019 beauty pageant\u2026 which suggests camels in thick rouge and red lipstick, stiltedly walking on stilettos\u201d \u2013 and are also treated to a tribute to Rocky IV, Golby\u2019s experience with drugs, the bewildering inconsistencies of clothing sizing conventions, and the posing and answering of a million questions you would never think of asking. Could he win a fight against the red and yellow M&amp;M\u2019s from the adverts that speak like mafia dons and, while we\u2019re at it, do they have genitals? Among the highlights is Golby\u2019s takedown of the sociopathic buy-to-let landlords who are choking the property market to death with their deposit-snatching claws. \u201cIf the universe is just,\u201d he writes, after describing a couple of his weirdest rented housing setups, \u201cit will, just once, let me watch my landlord die.\u201d While Brilliant, Brilliant has no narrative thread, making it a book to dip in and out of rather than devour in one sitting, Golby is great at switching between the poignant and the absurd, observing life both with the wonder of a toddler who has just discovered where you hid the crayons and the confidence of the friend who tells you \u201cI got this\u201d before attempting to fix your vacuum cleaner. As dazzling as he is at the fantastical, Golby is best when he\u2019s talking about family and relationships. The book ends almost as it began, with Golby\u2019s parents, this time celebrating the birth of the author. Even though we know how the story ends, there is humour and hope. Using the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d five times in the title is a risk, but Golby\u2019s memoir earns the right to at least four of them.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has visited Tate Modern will know how difficult it is to tear your eyes away from all the wonderful art. Nevertheless, over the last three years, it seems some visitors have managed it. They\u2019ve been seduced by the panoramic views of London from the gallery\u2019s new 10th-floor terrace. You can see St Paul\u2019s, the Shard, the Palace of Westminster and right into the living rooms of the glass-walled Neo Bankside luxury flat development 40 yards away.</p> <p>I\u2019d definitely give that last one a good look. How fascinating: to see straight into people\u2019s homes, their lives. What an amazing modern artwork! And it\u2019s not even spoiled by the thought that it was designed to be looked at. It\u2019s illicit and real: humans in their natural habitat, thinking they\u2019re alone, eating sandwiches, picking their noses, scratching their bottoms, watching crap TV.</p> <p>Maybe you\u2019ll catch a row or a tryst. Or a murder! It\u2019s like <em>Rear Window</em>, but where do they hide a body in a glass-walled room furnished in the latest minimalist fashion? There are no old chests or suits of armour handy. There\u2019d be nothing for it but to grab the electric carving knife and an extension cable and start dragging the corpse towards the wet room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One resident said he\u2019d counted 84 people photographing him in just an hour and a half</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fly in the ointment for voyeurs is that the residents are under no illusions that they\u2019re unobserved. They\u2019re bitterly aware that people are watching and have been fighting a court battle to have part of the platform cordoned off to limit the staring. Tate Modern was understandably unwilling to do this, though it did put up signs asking visitors to respect its neighbours\u2019 privacy, the effect of which was presumably to prompt anyone who somehow hadn\u2019t noticed you could see directly into strangers\u2019 homes to take the opportunity of a quick gawp. \u201cRespect whose privacy? Oh theirs! Oh yeah, I can see why.\u201d</p> <p>The residents say that some visitors use binoculars, some post pictures of the flats\u2019 interiors on social media, some wave and some make obscene gestures. One resident said he\u2019d counted 84 people photographing him in just an hour and a half; another said it was like living in a zoo. They\u2019ve complained about feeling they have to be properly dressed at all times, that they\u2019re self-conscious about eating at their dining tables, that they\u2019re worried about their children or grandchildren being photographed, while one resident reported that, when she visited Tate Modern herself and went up to the terrace, she overheard visitors saying that the \u201crich bastards\u201d in the flats deserved what they got.</p> <p>Funnily enough, that was pretty much the judge\u2019s ruling. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/12/tate-modern-wins-privacy-case-brought-by-owners-of-4m-flats\" title=\"\">high court last week</a>, Mr Justice Mann concluded that \u201cthese properties are impressive, and no doubt there are great advantages to be enjoyed in such extensive glassed views, but that in effect comes at a price in terms of privacy\u201d. He reckoned that the claimants had \u201ccreated or submitted themselves to a sensitivity to privacy which is greater than would be the case of a less-glassed design\u201d. They were asking for it, basically. People who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t get undressed with the lights on.</p> <p>Is that fair? After all, when the residents bought their flats, the Tate viewing terrace wasn\u2019t there. Admittedly, they knew the walls were transparent, but they also knew they were in a very tall building and so were a long way away from anywhere from which anyone could watch them.</p> <p>Their privacy was provided by distance, rather than an intervening opaque surface, but that still counts.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has visited Tate Modern will know how difficult it is to tear your eyes away from all the wonderful art. Nevertheless, over the last three years, it seems some visitors have managed it. They\u2019ve been seduced by the panoramic views of London from the gallery\u2019s new 10th-floor terrace. You can see St Paul\u2019s, the Shard, the Palace of Westminster and right into the living rooms of the glass-walled Neo Bankside luxury flat development 40 yards away. I\u2019d definitely give that last one a good look. How fascinating: to see straight into people\u2019s homes, their lives. What an amazing modern artwork! And it\u2019s not even spoiled by the thought that it was designed to be looked at. It\u2019s illicit and real: humans in their natural habitat, thinking they\u2019re alone, eating sandwiches, picking their noses, scratching their bottoms, watching crap TV. Maybe you\u2019ll catch a row or a tryst. Or a murder! It\u2019s like Rear Window, but where do they hide a body in a glass-walled room furnished in the latest minimalist fashion? There are no old chests or suits of armour handy. There\u2019d be nothing for it but to grab the electric carving knife and an extension cable and start dragging the corpse towards the wet room. The fly in the ointment for voyeurs is that the residents are under no illusions that they\u2019re unobserved. They\u2019re bitterly aware that people are watching and have been fighting a court battle to have part of the platform cordoned off to limit the staring. Tate Modern was understandably unwilling to do this, though it did put up signs asking visitors to respect its neighbours\u2019 privacy, the effect of which was presumably to prompt anyone who somehow hadn\u2019t noticed you could see directly into strangers\u2019 homes to take the opportunity of a quick gawp. \u201cRespect whose privacy? Oh theirs! Oh yeah, I can see why.\u201d The residents say that some visitors use binoculars, some post pictures of the flats\u2019 interiors on social media, some wave and some make obscene gestures. One resident said he\u2019d counted 84 people photographing him in just an hour and a half; another said it was like living in a zoo. They\u2019ve complained about feeling they have to be properly dressed at all times, that they\u2019re self-conscious about eating at their dining tables, that they\u2019re worried about their children or grandchildren being photographed, while one resident reported that, when she visited Tate Modern herself and went up to the terrace, she overheard visitors saying that the \u201crich bastards\u201d in the flats deserved what they got. Funnily enough, that was pretty much the judge\u2019s ruling. At the high court last week, Mr Justice Mann concluded that \u201cthese properties are impressive, and no doubt there are great advantages to be enjoyed in such extensive glassed views, but that in effect comes at a price in terms of privacy\u201d. He reckoned that the claimants had \u201ccreated or submitted themselves to a sensitivity to privacy which is greater than would be the case of a less-glassed design\u201d. They were asking for it, basically. People who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t get undressed with the lights on. Is that fair? After all, when the residents bought their flats, the Tate viewing terrace wasn\u2019t there. Admittedly, they knew the walls were transparent, but they also knew they were in a very tall building and so were a long way away from anywhere from which anyone could watch them. Their privacy was provided by distance, rather than an intervening opaque surface, but that still counts. It was still a reasonable expectation based on the physical circumstances of the properties they purchased. The mere fact that the walls were glass doesn\u2019t mean that those buying the flats wouldn\u2019t mind, or shouldn\u2019t mind, loads of people being able to see everything that happens in them. They won\u2019t just think: \u201cOh well, that\u2019s the price you pay for a spectacular view\u201d because the price they paid for the view was up to \u00a34m. That\u2019s the weakness of their position, unusually. They\u2019re rich so they\u2019re unsympathetic. The common perception is that, in today\u2019s London, people like that are the problem: luxuriating in huge, astronomically expensive developments while, down on the ground, pubs and shops go bust and everyone gets stabbed or sprayed with acid from passing mopeds.

Its lofty brick tower is a totem of the most recent period of real metropolitan optimism: a dynamic redevelopment of a brownfield site into a globally renowned gallery and tourist attraction.

      "bodyText": "Every year on 17 February, a crowd gathers in Rome\u2019s Campo de\u2019 Fiori to place wreaths, poems and candles at the foot of the statue that glowers towards the Vatican from beneath its friar\u2019s cowl. The man it memorialises, the Neapolitan philosopher Giordano Bruno, was burned alive by the Inquisition on that spot in 1600, for heresies including several books in which he advocated the heliocentric cosmology of Copernicus and argued that the universe was infinite and contained multiple other worlds. The charges were similar to those brought against Galileo 16 years later; unlike Galileo, who recanted, Bruno\u2019s defiance has lent an air of heroism to his execution. A witness at his trial reported that, when the death sentence was pronounced, Bruno replied: \u201cYou may be more afraid to bring that sentence against me than I am to accept it.\u201d Though his theory of an infinite universe was only one of many heretical ideas that landed him in trouble with the Catholic church, it has gained him a reputation in recent years as the first martyr for modern science. The physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson opened his 2014 TV series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey with an episode devoted to Bruno and his place in the history of scientific thought, though he left out the fact that Bruno was just as interested in ancient magic as he was in astronomy. Brian Cox also recounts Bruno\u2019s \u201ccinematic death\u201d in his bestseller Human Universe, but concludes that \u201chis contributions to science were questionable. He was more belligerent free-thinker than proto-scientist.\u201d It\u2019s as an icon of courageous free expression that Bruno\u2019s appeal endures in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.

We have already had one \u201cfinal defeat\u201d of Islamic State. This came 18 months ago when the organisation\u2019s capital, Raqqa, fell. Once, it held territory the size of the UK; now, it holds a square kilometre of the remote town of Baghouz in eastern Syria. Soon, it will no longer hold even that. There is a strong argument for caution before anyone talks of \u201cmission accomplished\u201d. Many of the circumstances that favoured the rise of the organisation remain. In Iraq, these include the weakness of the state and security forces, the dominance of the Shia majority and the shortsightedness of its leaders, as well as the alienation and marginalisation of the Iraqi Sunni minority, long the extremists\u2019 core constituency.

The smell lingers.</p> <p>Raphael Samuel, who is 27 and describes himself as a business executive, likens the act of being born to being kidnapped. On his Facebook page are posters where his face is surrounded by phrases like: \u201cIsn\u2019t forcing a child into this world and forcing it to have a career, kidnapping and slavery?\u201d And: \u201cYour parents had you instead of a toy or a dog, you owe them nothing, you are their entertainment.\u201d His story came back to me throughout the day like a series of jabs in the soft meat of my side. \u201cYou are their entertainment,\u201d echoed particularly as I suggested something called \u201can oat bath\u201d to my child, an idea that appeared to translate itself mid-air into the news that she must now live in a wardrobe of glass and bees so noisy was her response. I was not entertained.</p> <p>But in this week of sickness, were she given the language and her own email login, I don\u2019t doubt my four-year-old would agree with Samuel\u2019s philosophy of \u201cantinatalism\u201d and join him in his quest for justice and therefore, extinction. His argument, popularised in the early 2000s by <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born\" title=\"\">David Benatar</a> in a book called <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/better-never-to-have-been.html\" title=\"\">Better Never to Have Been: the Harm of Coming into Existence</a></em>, is that \u201cthose who never exist cannot be deprived\u201d.

Better to have loved than\u2026 Nah screw it, it\u2019s raining.</p> <p>Chicken pox is a curious sickness in that it makes a child physically repulsive right when they need the most attention. I still have the scar from when I plucked a scab from my face as a toddler, and offered it generously to my mum\u2019s friend. This vileness is built into the illness, one that brings to mind ancient words such as \u201criddled\u201d and \u201cgo away\u201d. Mid-pox, midway through another day locked inside to avoid locals catching it by accidentally licking her, not only did I believe my child would side with Samuel, but I was starting to come round to his philosophy, too.</p> <p>People should not have children \u2013 they talk too much, they don\u2019t accept care gracefully, and they are mean about the perfectly nice pasta sauce you made from the leftover courgette. What\u2019s more, mine appears to already be a staunch anti-vaxxer. And not only does she shun all trips to the doctor, loudly, but also the chemist. She is an anti-Calpoler. She is an anti-drink-some-water-er. She is a clinical nightmare. I frantically searched <a href=\"https://www.mumsnet.com/\" title=\"\">Mumsnet</a> for advice, finding instead an insistence of mothers that agree with her, saying all painkillers are awful and we were born to suffer. I read between the lines: the end of the human race would be the kindest thing.</p> <p>When Samuel called his mum to say he was going to sue her, she replied: \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d and not only can I hear her tone through the BBC reports, but I can taste it, her weary acceptance. She knows him. She knows how he thrills to co-opt contemporary politics, words such as consent, much like the Dutch 69-year-old who (saying his request was consistent with people changing their gender) started a legal battle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/dutch-man-69-starts-legal-fight-to-identify-as-20-years-younger\" title=\"\">change his date of birth</a>, saying he \u201cidentified\u201d as someone 20 years younger.</p> <p>Samuel\u2019s mother has lived almost three decades with this boy, she has had many thousands of arguments with him about vegetables and money and whether Blu Tack stains, and at this point she\u2019s just, yeah, OK baby. You do your little court case, I\u2019ll see you for tea, it\u2019s fish. \u201cMum said she wished she had met me before I was born,\u201d he added, in an aside that made me shudder with empathy, \u201cand that if she did, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have had me\u201d. The pox continues.</p> <h2>One more thing\u2026</h2> <p>I didn\u2019t think bones could make me cry, until I saw a picture of a burial discovered by archaeologists in 2014.

This vileness is built into the illness, one that brings to mind ancient words such as \u201criddled\u201d and \u201cgo away\u201d. Mid-pox, midway through another day locked inside to avoid locals catching it by accidentally licking her, not only did I believe my child would side with Samuel, but I was starting to come round to his philosophy, too. People should not have children \u2013 they talk too much, they don\u2019t accept care gracefully, and they are mean about the perfectly nice pasta sauce you made from the leftover courgette. What\u2019s more, mine appears to already be a staunch anti-vaxxer. And not only does she shun all trips to the doctor, loudly, but also the chemist. She is an anti-Calpoler. She is an anti-drink-some-water-er. She is a clinical nightmare. I frantically searched Mumsnet for advice, finding instead an insistence of mothers that agree with her, saying all painkillers are awful and we were born to suffer. I read between the lines: the end of the human race would be the kindest thing. When Samuel called his mum to say he was going to sue her, she replied: \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d and not only can I hear her tone through the BBC reports, but I can taste it, her weary acceptance. She knows him. She knows how he thrills to co-opt contemporary politics, words such as consent, much like the Dutch 69-year-old who (saying his request was consistent with people changing their gender) started a legal battle to change his date of birth, saying he \u201cidentified\u201d as someone 20 years younger. Samuel\u2019s mother has lived almost three decades with this boy, she has had many thousands of arguments with him about vegetables and money and whether Blu Tack stains, and at this point she\u2019s just, yeah, OK baby. You do your little court case, I\u2019ll see you for tea, it\u2019s fish. \u201cMum said she wished she had met me before I was born,\u201d he added, in an aside that made me shudder with empathy, \u201cand that if she did, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have had me\u201d. The pox continues. One more thing\u2026 I didn\u2019t think bones could make me cry, until I saw a picture of a burial discovered by archaeologists in 2014. A prehistoric couple, found in a cave in Greece, were found spooning each other among the rubble. This Time with Alan Partridge starts soon, with Alan returning to the BBC after the unfortunate smell my cheese incident of 1997. He joins a One Show-style programme as guest presenter, bringing with him his sensual arrogance and joyous neuroses. Alan (now with the brilliant Gibbons brothers writing with Coogan) is one of few TV characters who\u2019s got even better as he ages. My king. Last week, above a picture of a shiny bum-bag, the US Pop-Tarts Twitter account put out this tweet: \u2018I like my tarts where I like my money. Right in my fanny.\u2019 If one thing can unite Britain right now, its our agreement that no, this is not a thing that we will be doing.

It was something so innocuous, so unexpected yet quotidian, the virtual opposite of a \u201cshock tactic\u201d in fact. Tucked away among all the hoodies, track pants and baseball caps typical of the much-hyped label, there was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a classic two-piece suit. The item more readily associated with commuters and politicians than hoodie-wearing hype beasts had entered new territory.</p> <p>It sent ripples through the streetwear community. <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/supreme-spring-summer-2018-lookbook-suit\" title=\"\">GQ called it the Supreme piece they would most like to buy</a> and, in an unlikely turn of events, suddenly trainer-hungry superfans were salivating over a blazer.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just a standard suit, you see \u2013 it represents a shift in fashion, which has been dominated by streetwear for the last decade. Items such as hoodies, tracksuits and sneakers now populate menswear runways as a matter of course, and are sold for three figures by luxury retailers. According to the consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2018/bain-spring-luxury-report-2018/\" title=\"\">streetwear \u2013 once a niche sector \u2013 was forecast as one of four driving factors</a> for an estimated 6-8% growth of the luxury market in 2018. Meanwhile, Supreme has gone from cult to serious fashion player.

It has been with us, in one form or another, for centuries \u2013 from French aristocrats\u2019 matching redingotes and breeches in the early 1700s to England\u2019s more conservative version popularised by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Beau-Brummell-English-dandy\" title=\"\">Beau Brummell</a> in the early 1800s and the preppy postwar American iteration championed by <a href=\"https://www.brooksbrothers.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-brooksbrothers-Site/en_GB/Home-Show?setRequestLocale=en_GB\" title=\"\">Brooks Brothers</a>. Its longevity can be put down to its chameleon-like qualities. The suit has been spun in many different directions over the years, from the traditional (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/24/guardianobituaries.italy\" title=\"\">Gianni Agnelli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kennedy\" title=\"\">JFK Jr)</a> to the foppish (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bryanferry\" title=\"\">Bryan Ferry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson\" title=\"\">Wes Anderson</a>) to the outright eccentric (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/18/popandrock.outkast\" title=\"\">Andr\u00e9 3000</a>).

Silicon Valley startup culture has ushered in a new age of casual dressing that makes off-duty clothes appropriate for the corner office. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jp-morgans-relaxed-dress-code-2016-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">JPMorgan Chase announced that \u201cbusiness casual\u201d</a> was its new official everyday dress code. Last year, the business publication <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ryan-jenkins/how-to-attract-and-retain-millennials-with-the-right-dress-code.html\" title=\"\">Inc. released a guide for companies</a> to attract millennials with a more relaxed approach to workplace attire. With white-collar workers increasingly casual, the stuffy totem of adulthood and nine-to-five dressing that is the suit can be reassessed by a new generation of men who associate hoodies and trainers with the uniform of establishment figures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/evan-spiegel\" title=\"\">Evan Spiegel</a>.</p> <p>Andrew Cedotal, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley game designer, is an interesting case. He wears a suit or mixed suit separates, despite his notoriously casual environs \u2013 and likes what it semaphores. \u201cWearing a put-together outfit is a way of very easily communicating that you know how to build an organised and visually appealing presentation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign to people who are marketing experts that you know how to tell a story in a single glance.\u201d</p> <p>Cedotal is an outlier in the Bay Area, and can remember seeing only two other suit-wearers in the wilds of San Francisco. At companies he\u2019s worked for, it\u2019s mostly relegated to the legal team. In the tech industry, where \u201cdisruption\u201d is a cherished value, he is in fact the rebellious one for wearing a throwback uniform. \u201cI\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d52c613db8e4cd091bf26aae0ebec037682e3a35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d52c613db8e4cd091bf26aae0ebec037682e3a35/0_0_1950_3000/650.jpg\" alt=\"A$AP Rocky on location for DKNY Photo Shoot, Times Square, New York, NY October 14, 2013. \u00a9 Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection/Alamy Live NewsDG6RXN New York, NY, USA. 14th Oct, 2013.

Trunzo points to the range of new suiting options \u2013 from craft details at Calvin Klein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\" title=\"\">Dior</a> to younger brands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/13/a-cold-walls-samuel-ross-streetwear-class-race-architecture-virgil-abloh-kanye-west-a-cold-wall\" title=\"\">A-Cold-Wall*</a> and <a href=\"https://www.alyxstudio.com/\" title=\"\">Alyx</a> marrying suiting with a streetwear sensibility \u2013 as ways in which the category is seeking a new audience. \u201cI own 40-odd jackets and I haven\u2019t worn one in years,\u201d Trunzo says. \u201cAnd the other day I found myself in a <a href=\"https://rowingblazers.com/\" title=\"\">Rowing Blazers</a> jacket and Nike Pigalle sweatpants, and I was like, \u2018Whoa, what is happening? I\u2019m falling victim to the resurgence of suiting.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Retailers are starting to see a spike in tailoring, too. Fiona Firth, buying director at <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/?cm_mmc=GoogleUK--c-_-MRP_EN_UK_London-_-Brand--Mr%20Porter_Exact-_-mr%20porter_e_kwd-259816806_INTL&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI19PZw42V4AIV6Z3tCh3HqAZlEAAYASAAEgJ2BfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">Mr Porter</a>, says, \u201cIn an age in which streetwear has ruled the runway, traditional tailoring has definitely fallen by the wayside as men dress more casually.\u201d Over the last two seasons, however, the online luxury retailer has seen increased sales in the suiting category, up 30% last winter and set to grow this season. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see how many luxury houses are introducing tailoring again, but making it relevant for young, casualwear-focused men,\u201d Firth says.</p> <p>Michael Adebayo, a 32-year-old GP based in the north-east of England, is someone for whom wearing a suit is optional \u2013 but he often does it anyway, he says, \u201cin a more relaxed manner, without a tie or pocket square. These days, seeing people combining a suit with trainers or even shorts is amazing.\u201d Adebayo uses suits to stand out \u2013 \u201cVelvet and natural wool fabrics are my favourites\u201d \u2013 rather than blend into a crowd. \u201cI feel I can take on any challenge when wearing a suit and, most importantly, it makes people listen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d5fde5feb664f477e6558bc756e194429a192a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d5fde5feb664f477e6558bc756e194429a192a1/0_156_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Standout suits \u2026 a model walks down the catwalk at the Versace spring/summer 2019 show in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standout suits \u2026 a model walks down the catwalk at the Versace spring/summer 2019 show in Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pietro D\u2019Aprano/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No wonder suits are proving popular far beyond corporate environments, then.

Despite the suit\u2019s formerly fusty reputation, he says seeing hordes of suit-wearers crossing London Bridge in the morning rush hour can be \u201ca thing of beauty\u201d and is in favour of more creative suit trends making their way into the boardroom.</p> <p>Thomas Henry, a 34-year-old strategy director at the <a href=\"https://www.motherusa.com/about/\" title=\"\">creative agency Mother</a> in New York, has worn a suit all his professional life, to give him a certain edge and add an authoritative balance to his youthful appearance.

His current version is a patchworked two-piece featuring tattersall, windowpane and micro-check plaids. \u201cOur customer seems to really appreciate the way we do suiting and jackets,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed some of the formality from it.\u201d</p> <p>London brand Casely-Hayford is built around the suit, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/02/fashion-partners-duos-public-school-loquet-hayford\" title=\"\">designer Charlie Casely-Hayford</a> \u2013 himself a member of the new suit tribe \u2013 has noticed his customer is embracing it in a more relaxed way, too. \u201cOur biggest market is guys who don\u2019t need to wear a suit for their job, but they choose to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe work with a lot of creatives and they wear suits in a totally different way from our more strait-laced clients.\u201d Wearing a suit with a T-shirt and trainers is increasingly common, he says. \u201cThe overarching theme I hear from our clients is comfort and ease, and the idea of getting that from a suit.\u201d</p> <p>So are younger men finally ready to trade their sweatshirt uniform for suits?

      "bodyText": "The streetwear brand Supreme shocked the fashion world last year. No, it wasn\u2019t the red-and-white logo-covered pinball machine, inflatable kayak or even the branded breathalyser it was selling. It was something so innocuous, so unexpected yet quotidian, the virtual opposite of a \u201cshock tactic\u201d in fact. Tucked away among all the hoodies, track pants and baseball caps typical of the much-hyped label, there was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a classic two-piece suit. The item more readily associated with commuters and politicians than hoodie-wearing hype beasts had entered new territory. It sent ripples through the streetwear community. GQ called it the Supreme piece they would most like to buy and, in an unlikely turn of events, suddenly trainer-hungry superfans were salivating over a blazer. This isn\u2019t just a standard suit, you see \u2013 it represents a shift in fashion, which has been dominated by streetwear for the last decade. Items such as hoodies, tracksuits and sneakers now populate menswear runways as a matter of course, and are sold for three figures by luxury retailers. According to the consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, streetwear \u2013 once a niche sector \u2013 was forecast as one of four driving factors for an estimated 6-8% growth of the luxury market in 2018. Meanwhile, Supreme has gone from cult to serious fashion player. In October 2017, private equity firm the Carlyle Group bought a stake in the company. With the look moving from underground to mainstream, though, a streetwear saturation point has been reached. Enter the suit. This season there were four major menswear designer debuts at luxury labels and all rallied behind the two-piece. At Kim Jones\u2019s first outing at Dior, he gave the suit his blessing, with lightweight double-breasted ones in pastel pink and Big Bird yellow. Virgil Abloh, in a much-anticipated collection for Louis Vuitton, steered away from what might have been expected when looking at his streetwear-infused label Off-White, and instead opted for roomy tailoring in white, mint and candy-apple red. Riccardo Tisci, a pioneer of gothic-chic streetwear during his reign at Givenchy, showed tasteful, meeting room-friendly suits as part of his first Burberry collection. Meanwhile Hedi Slimane, showing menswear for the first time at Celine, presented his signature razor-sharp skinny suits in black. The suit is obviously nothing new. It has been with us, in one form or another, for centuries \u2013 from French aristocrats\u2019 matching redingotes and breeches in the early 1700s to England\u2019s more conservative version popularised by Beau Brummell in the early 1800s and the preppy postwar American iteration championed by Brooks Brothers. Its longevity can be put down to its chameleon-like qualities. The suit has been spun in many different directions over the years, from the traditional (Gianni Agnelli, JFK Jr) to the foppish (Bryan Ferry, Wes Anderson) to the outright eccentric (David Bowie, Andr\u00e9 3000). Then, of course, there are the myriad varieties seen in offices every day. Interestingly, though, as its fashionability grows, the suit\u2019s place in the corporate landscape is fading. Silicon Valley startup culture has ushered in a new age of casual dressing that makes off-duty clothes appropriate for the corner office. Two years ago, JPMorgan Chase announced that \u201cbusiness casual\u201d was its new official everyday dress code. Last year, the business publication Inc. released a guide for companies to attract millennials with a more relaxed approach to workplace attire. With white-collar workers increasingly casual, the stuffy totem of adulthood and nine-to-five dressing that is the suit can be reassessed by a new generation of men who associate hoodies and trainers with the uniform of establishment figures such as Mark Zuckerberg or Evan Spiegel. Andrew Cedotal, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley game designer, is an interesting case. He wears a suit or mixed suit separates, despite his notoriously casual environs \u2013 and likes what it semaphores. \u201cWearing a put-together outfit is a way of very easily communicating that you know how to build an organised and visually appealing presentation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign to people who are marketing experts that you know how to tell a story in a single glance.\u201d Cedotal is an outlier in the Bay Area, and can remember seeing only two other suit-wearers in the wilds of San Francisco. At companies he\u2019s worked for, it\u2019s mostly relegated to the legal team. In the tech industry, where \u201cdisruption\u201d is a cherished value, he is in fact the rebellious one for wearing a throwback uniform. \u201cI\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSuiting suddenly feels subversive [in fashion],\u201d says Brian Trunzo, senior menswear editor at WGSN, the global trend forecasting agency. \u201cA traditional suit makes you do a double-take.\u201d With social media feeds filled with streetwear, tailoring is unexpectedly fresh \u2013 and already enjoying the endorsement of fashion editors at the menswear shows, if street-style photography is anything to go by. Trunzo points to the range of new suiting options \u2013 from craft details at Calvin Klein and Dior to younger brands such as A-Cold-Wall* and Alyx marrying suiting with a streetwear sensibility \u2013 as ways in which the category is seeking a new audience. \u201cI own 40-odd jackets and I haven\u2019t worn one in years,\u201d Trunzo says. \u201cAnd the other day I found myself in a Rowing Blazers jacket and Nike Pigalle sweatpants, and I was like, \u2018Whoa, what is happening? I\u2019m falling victim to the resurgence of suiting.\u2019\u201d Retailers are starting to see a spike in tailoring, too. Fiona Firth, buying director at Mr Porter, says, \u201cIn an age in which streetwear has ruled the runway, traditional tailoring has definitely fallen by the wayside as men dress more casually.\u201d Over the last two seasons, however, the online luxury retailer has seen increased sales in the suiting category, up 30% last winter and set to grow this season. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see how many luxury houses are introducing tailoring again, but making it relevant for young, casualwear-focused men,\u201d Firth says. Michael Adebayo, a 32-year-old GP based in the north-east of England, is someone for whom wearing a suit is optional \u2013 but he often does it anyway, he says, \u201cin a more relaxed manner, without a tie or pocket square. These days, seeing people combining a suit with trainers or even shorts is amazing.\u201d Adebayo uses suits to stand out \u2013 \u201cVelvet and natural wool fabrics are my favourites\u201d \u2013 rather than blend into a crowd. \u201cI feel I can take on any challenge when wearing a suit and, most importantly, it makes people listen.\u201d No wonder suits are proving popular far beyond corporate environments, then. In October and November last year, there was a 33% year-on-year increase for the term \u201cmen\u2019s suits\u201d on the global fashion search platform Lyst. \u201cIt\u2019s hit the radar of the consumer,\u201d says Marshal Cohen, an analyst at market research firm NPD Group. \u201cSuit separates seem to be the place it\u2019s going to start. We\u2019re already seeing it in the numbers.\u201d This new era of suiting won\u2019t simply be a return to the slim-fitted \u201csuited-and-booted\u201d movement of the early noughties when Slimane\u2019s skinny tailoring for Dior Homme dominated, but will bring the swagger of streetwear into the more traditional world of tailoring. Look at the mint green, oversized Louis Vuitton double-breasted suit Kanye West wore (with no shirt and slide sandals) over the summer, or Michael B Jordan\u2019s Off-White suit with a belted waist and bright orange armband. Then there\u2019s the floral appliqu\u00e9d Haider Ackermann suit \u2013 a mix of rock\u2019n\u2019roll and romance \u2013 that Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore at the Toronto film festival in September, or DJ Benji B, more usually found in a bomber jacket or hoodie, in a Virgil Abloh-designed, loose-fitting Louis Vuitton suit at the Fashion Awards in December. Footwear is key \u2013 see Stormzy, a tracksuit devotee, on the front of Elle\u2019s February issue in tailoring and trainers \u2013 a surefire way to de-corporate any suit. Of course, for some, the suit never went out of style in the first place. Finance manager David D\u2019Costa, 31, wears one as his \u201cwork uniform\u201d. \u201cA mentor in my first job guided me through the basics of suit wearing and over time I\u2019ve developed my own style,\u201d he says. Despite the suit\u2019s formerly fusty reputation, he says seeing hordes of suit-wearers crossing London Bridge in the morning rush hour can be \u201ca thing of beauty\u201d and is in favour of more creative suit trends making their way into the boardroom. Thomas Henry, a 34-year-old strategy director at the creative agency Mother in New York, has worn a suit all his professional life, to give him a certain edge and add an authoritative balance to his youthful appearance. He remembers the Mad Men-inspired tailoring revival of a decade ago, but is the only member of his office to embrace the suit today, and doesn\u2019t think that will change \u2013 because of the impact it makes. \u201cA deep irony about the creative industry is that you spend all this time telling your clients to stand out, yet the people who work in the field have a deep insecurity about looking different.\u201d Henry has no such qualms. Brendon Babenzien, founder of New York-based brand Noah, which brings together surf, skate and music references with classic American menswear, is aware of this new suit wearer. He usually includes some sort of tailoring among his casual-leaning collections. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who dresses up or down all the time,\u201d he says. His current version is a patchworked two-piece featuring tattersall, windowpane and micro-check plaids. \u201cOur customer seems to really appreciate the way we do suiting and jackets,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed some of the formality from it.\u201d London brand Casely-Hayford is built around the suit, but designer Charlie Casely-Hayford \u2013 himself a member of the new suit tribe \u2013 has noticed his customer is embracing it in a more relaxed way, too. \u201cOur biggest market is guys who don\u2019t need to wear a suit for their job, but they choose to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe work with a lot of creatives and they wear suits in a totally different way from our more strait-laced clients.\u201d Wearing a suit with a T-shirt and trainers is increasingly common, he says. \u201cThe overarching theme I hear from our clients is comfort and ease, and the idea of getting that from a suit.\u201d So are younger men finally ready to trade their sweatshirt uniform for suits? All signs point toward yes. But perhaps it\u2019s not a comeback per se. \u201cI teach at a couple of universities,\u201d says analyst Cohen. \u201cSome of my students come to class wearing suits. I say, \u2018What are you all dressed up for?\u2019 And they say: \u2018This is me, this is my style. I discovered the suit.\u2019\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Noise, Alex Waibel tells me, is one of the major challenges that artificial speech translation has to meet. A device may be able to recognise speech in a laboratory, or a meeting room, but will struggle to cope with the kind of background noise I can hear surrounding <a href=\"http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/21_74.php\" title=\"\">Professor Waibel</a> as he speaks to me from Kyoto station. I\u2019m struggling to follow him in English, on a scratchy line that reminds me we are nearly 10,000km apart \u2013 and that distance is still an obstacle to communication even if you\u2019re speaking the same language. We haven\u2019t reached the future yet.</p> <p>If we had, Waibel would have been able to speak in his native German and I would have been able to hear his words in English. He would also be able to converse hands-free and seamlessly with the Japanese people around him, with all parties speaking their native language.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.kit.edu/english/\" title=\"\">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, where he is a professor of computer science, Waibel and his colleagues already give lectures in German that their students can follow in English via an electronic translator. The system generates text that students can read on their laptops or phones, so the process is somewhat akin to subtitling. It helps that lecturers speak clearly, don\u2019t have to compete with background chatter, and say much the same thing each year.</p> <p>The idea of artificial speech translation has been around for a long time. Waibel, who is also a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, \u201csort of invented it. I proposed it at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in 1978.\u201d Douglas Adams sort of invented it around the same time too. <em>The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</em> featured a life form called the Babel fish which, when placed in the ear, enabled a listener to understand any language in the universe. It came to represent one of those devices that technology enthusiasts dream of long before they become practically realisable, like portable voice communicators and TVs flat enough to hang on walls: a thing that ought to exist, and so one day surely will.</p> <p>Waibel\u2019s first speech translation system, assembled in 1991, had a 500-word vocabulary, ran on large work stations and took several minutes to process what it heard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ready for prime time,\u201d he acknowledges. Now devices that look like prototype Babel fish have started to appear, riding a wave of advances in artificial translation and voice recognition. Google has incorporated a translation feature into its Pixel earbuds, using Google Translate, which can also deliver voice translation via its smartphone app. Skype has a Translator feature that handles speech in 10 languages. A number of smaller outfits, such as <a href=\"https://www.waverlylabs.com/\" title=\"\">Waverly Labs</a>, a Brooklyn-based startup, have developed earpiece translators. Reviews in the tech media could reasonably be summarised as \u201cnot bad, actually\u201d.</p> <p>The systems currently available offer proof of the concept, but at this stage they seem to be regarded as eye-catching novelties rather than steps towards what Waibel calls \u201cmaking a language-transparent society\u201d.</p> <p>One of the main developments driving artificial speech translation is the vogue for encouraging people to talk to their technology.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re generally very early in the paradigm of voice-enabled devices,\u201d says Barak Turovsky, Google Translate\u2019s director of product, \u201cbut it\u2019s growing very rapidly, and translation will be one of the key parts of this journey.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, Google introduced interpreter mode for its home devices. Saying: \u201cHey, Google, be my French interpreter\u201d will activate spoken and, on smart displays, text translation. Google suggests hotel check-in as a possible application \u2013 perhaps the obvious example of a practical alternative to speaking travellers\u2019 English, either as a native or as an additional language.</p> <p>You can do this already if you have the Translate app on your phone, albeit using an awkwardly small screen and speaker. That kind of simple public interaction accounts for much usage of the app\u2019s conversations feature. But another popular application is what Turovsky calls \u201cromance\u201d. Data logs reveal the popularity of statements such as \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cYou have beautiful eyes\u201d. Much of this may not represent anything very new. After all, chat-up lines have been standard phrasebook content for decades.</p> <p>Waverly Labs used the chat-up function as a hook for its <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\" title=\"\">Indiegogo</a> funding drive, with a video in which the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Andrew Ochoa, relates how he got the idea for a translator when he met a French woman on holiday but couldn\u2019t communicate with her very well. Trying to use a translation app was \u201chorrible\u201d. Phones get in the way \u2013 but earpieces are not in your face. The video shows what might have been: he presents a French woman with an earpiece, and off they go for coffee and sightseeing. The pitch was spectacularly successful, raising $4.4m (\u00a33.4m) \u2013 30 times the target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649a04da363d376e6d75057bf573f9d02d963b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649a04da363d376e6d75057bf573f9d02d963b5f/0_0_2646_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waverly Labs\u2019 Pilot earpiece (red and white) and Google\u2019s Pixel earbuds (black).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waverly Labs\u2019 Pilot earpiece (red and white) and Google\u2019s Pixel earbuds (black).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer Design desk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One customer said the company\u2019s Pilot earpiece had enabled him to speak to his girlfriend\u2019s mother for the first time. Some even report that it has enabled them to speak to their spouses. \u201cEvery once in a while, we\u2019ll receive an email from someone who says they\u2019re using this to speak with their Spanish-speaking wife,\u201d says Ochoa. \u201cIt baffles me how they even got together in the first place!\u201d We might surmise that it was through the internet and an agency. Ochoa acknowledges that \u201cthe technology has to improve a bit before you\u2019ll really be able to find love through the earbud, but it\u2019s not too far away\u201d.</p> <p>Many of the early adopters put the Pilot earpiece to entirely unromantic uses, acquiring it for use in organisations. Waverly is now preparing a new model for professional applications, which entails performance improvements in speech recognition, translation accuracy and the time it takes to deliver the translated speech. \u201cProfessionals are less inclined to be patient in a conversation,\u201d Ochoa observes.</p> <p>The new version will also feature hygienic design improvements, to overcome the Pilot\u2019s least appealing feature. For a conversation, both speakers need to have Pilots in their ears. \u201cWe find that there\u2019s a barrier with sharing one of the earphones with a stranger,\u201d says Ochoa. That can\u2019t have been totally unexpected. The problem would be solved if earpiece translators became sufficiently prevalent that strangers would be likely to already have their own in their ears. Whether that happens, and how quickly, will probably depend not so much on the earpieces themselves, but on the prevalence of voice-controlled devices and artificial translation in general.</p> <p>Here, the main driver appears to be access to emerging Asian markets. Google reckons that 50% of the internet\u2019s content is in English, but only 20% of the world\u2019s population speak the language.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at areas where there is a lot of growth in internet usage, like Asian countries, most of them don\u2019t know English at all,\u201d says Turovsky. \u201cSo in that regard, breaking language barriers is an important goal for everyone \u2013 and obviously for Google. That\u2019s why Google is investing so many resources into translation systems.\u201d</p> <p>Waibel also highlights the significance of Asia, noting that voice translation has really taken off in Japan and China. There\u2019s still a long way to go, though. Translation needs to be simultaneous, like the translator\u2019s voice speaking over the foreign politician on the TV, rather than in packets that oblige speakers to pause after every few remarks and wait for the translation to be delivered. It needs to work offline, for situations where internet access isn\u2019t possible \u2013 and to address concerns about the amount of private speech data accumulating in the cloud, having been sent to servers for processing.</p> <p>Systems not only need to cope with physical challenges such as noise, Waibel suggests, they will also need to be socially aware \u2013 to know their manners, and to address people appropriately. When I first emailed him, aware that he is a German professor and that continental traditions demand solemn respect for academic status, I erred on the side of formality and addressed him as \u201cDear Prof Waibel\u201d. As I expected, he replied in international English mode: \u201cHi Marek.\u201d Etiquette-sensitive artificial translators could relieve people of the need to be aware of differing cultural norms. They would facilitate interaction while reducing understanding. At the same time, they might help to preserve local customs, slowing the spread of habits associated with international English, such as its readiness to get on first-name terms.</p> <p>Professors and other professionals will not outsource language awareness to software, though. If the technology matures into seamless, ubiquitous artificial speech translation \u2013 Babel fish, in short \u2013 it will actually add value to language skills. Automated translation will deliver a commodity product: basic, practical, low-prestige information that helps people buy things or find their way around. Whether it will help people conduct their family lives or romantic relationships is open to question \u2013 though one noteworthy possibility is that it could overcome the language barriers that often arise between generations after migration, leaving children and their grandparents without a shared language.</p> <p>Whatever uses it is put to, though, it will never be as good as the real thing. Even if voice-morphing technology simulates the speaker\u2019s voice, their lip movements won\u2019t match, and they will look like they are in a dubbed movie.</p> <p>The contrast will underline the value of shared languages, and the value of learning them. Making the effort to learn someone\u2019s language is a sign of commitment, and therefore of trustworthiness. Sharing a language can also promote a sense of belonging and community, as with the international scientists who use English as a lingua franca, where their predecessors used Latin. Immigrant shopkeepers who learn their customers\u2019 language are not just making sales easier; they are showing that they wish to draw closer to their customers\u2019 community, and politely asserting a place in it.</p> <p>When machine translation becomes a ubiquitous commodity product, human language skills will command a premium. The person who has a language in their head will always have the advantage over somebody who relies on a device, in the same way that somebody with a head for figures has the advantage over somebody who has to reach for a calculator. Though the practical need for a lingua franca will diminish, the social value of sharing one will persist. And software will never be a substitute for the subtle but vital understanding that comes with knowledge of a language. That knowledge will always be needed to pick the nuances from the noise.</p> <p>\u2022 Marek Kohn\u2019s <em>Four Words for Friend: Why Using More Than One Language Matters Now More Than </em><em>Ever</em><em> </em>is published by Yale University Press (\u00a320).

I\u2019m struggling to follow him in English, on a scratchy line that reminds me we are nearly 10,000km apart \u2013 and that distance is still an obstacle to communication even if you\u2019re speaking the same language. We haven\u2019t reached the future yet. If we had, Waibel would have been able to speak in his native German and I would have been able to hear his words in English. He would also be able to converse hands-free and seamlessly with the Japanese people around him, with all parties speaking their native language. At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where he is a professor of computer science, Waibel and his colleagues already give lectures in German that their students can follow in English via an electronic translator. The system generates text that students can read on their laptops or phones, so the process is somewhat akin to subtitling. It helps that lecturers speak clearly, don\u2019t have to compete with background chatter, and say much the same thing each year. The idea of artificial speech translation has been around for a long time. Waibel, who is also a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, \u201csort of invented it. I proposed it at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in 1978.\u201d Douglas Adams sort of invented it around the same time too. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy featured a life form called the Babel fish which, when placed in the ear, enabled a listener to understand any language in the universe. It came to represent one of those devices that technology enthusiasts dream of long before they become practically realisable, like portable voice communicators and TVs flat enough to hang on walls: a thing that ought to exist, and so one day surely will. Waibel\u2019s first speech translation system, assembled in 1991, had a 500-word vocabulary, ran on large work stations and took several minutes to process what it heard. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ready for prime time,\u201d he acknowledges. Now devices that look like prototype Babel fish have started to appear, riding a wave of advances in artificial translation and voice recognition. Google has incorporated a translation feature into its Pixel earbuds, using Google Translate, which can also deliver voice translation via its smartphone app. Skype has a Translator feature that handles speech in 10 languages. A number of smaller outfits, such as Waverly Labs, a Brooklyn-based startup, have developed earpiece translators. Reviews in the tech media could reasonably be summarised as \u201cnot bad, actually\u201d. The systems currently available offer proof of the concept, but at this stage they seem to be regarded as eye-catching novelties rather than steps towards what Waibel calls \u201cmaking a language-transparent society\u201d. One of the main developments driving artificial speech translation is the vogue for encouraging people to talk to their technology. \u201cWe\u2019re generally very early in the paradigm of voice-enabled devices,\u201d says Barak Turovsky, Google Translate\u2019s director of product, \u201cbut it\u2019s growing very rapidly, and translation will be one of the key parts of this journey.\u201d Last month, Google introduced interpreter mode for its home devices. Saying: \u201cHey, Google, be my French interpreter\u201d will activate spoken and, on smart displays, text translation. Google suggests hotel check-in as a possible application \u2013 perhaps the obvious example of a practical alternative to speaking travellers\u2019 English, either as a native or as an additional language. You can do this already if you have the Translate app on your phone, albeit using an awkwardly small screen and speaker. That kind of simple public interaction accounts for much usage of the app\u2019s conversations feature. But another popular application is what Turovsky calls \u201cromance\u201d. Data logs reveal the popularity of statements such as \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cYou have beautiful eyes\u201d. Much of this may not represent anything very new. After all, chat-up lines have been standard phrasebook content for decades. Waverly Labs used the chat-up function as a hook for its Indiegogo funding drive, with a video in which the company\u2019s founder and CEO, Andrew Ochoa, relates how he got the idea for a translator when he met a French woman on holiday but couldn\u2019t communicate with her very well. Trying to use a translation app was \u201chorrible\u201d. Phones get in the way \u2013 but earpieces are not in your face. The video shows what might have been: he presents a French woman with an earpiece, and off they go for coffee and sightseeing. The pitch was spectacularly successful, raising $4.4m (\u00a33.4m) \u2013 30 times the target. One customer said the company\u2019s Pilot earpiece had enabled him to speak to his girlfriend\u2019s mother for the first time. Some even report that it has enabled them to speak to their spouses. \u201cEvery once in a while, we\u2019ll receive an email from someone who says they\u2019re using this to speak with their Spanish-speaking wife,\u201d says Ochoa. \u201cIt baffles me how they even got together in the first place!\u201d We might surmise that it was through the internet and an agency. Ochoa acknowledges that \u201cthe technology has to improve a bit before you\u2019ll really be able to find love through the earbud, but it\u2019s not too far away\u201d. Many of the early adopters put the Pilot earpiece to entirely unromantic uses, acquiring it for use in organisations. Waverly is now preparing a new model for professional applications, which entails performance improvements in speech recognition, translation accuracy and the time it takes to deliver the translated speech. \u201cProfessionals are less inclined to be patient in a conversation,\u201d Ochoa observes. The new version will also feature hygienic design improvements, to overcome the Pilot\u2019s least appealing feature. For a conversation, both speakers need to have Pilots in their ears. \u201cWe find that there\u2019s a barrier with sharing one of the earphones with a stranger,\u201d says Ochoa. That can\u2019t have been totally unexpected. The problem would be solved if earpiece translators became sufficiently prevalent that strangers would be likely to already have their own in their ears. Whether that happens, and how quickly, will probably depend not so much on the earpieces themselves, but on the prevalence of voice-controlled devices and artificial translation in general. Here, the main driver appears to be access to emerging Asian markets. Google reckons that 50% of the internet\u2019s content is in English, but only 20% of the world\u2019s population speak the language. \u201cIf you look at areas where there is a lot of growth in internet usage, like Asian countries, most of them don\u2019t know English at all,\u201d says Turovsky. \u201cSo in that regard, breaking language barriers is an important goal for everyone \u2013 and obviously for Google. That\u2019s why Google is investing so many resources into translation systems.\u201d Waibel also highlights the significance of Asia, noting that voice translation has really taken off in Japan and China. There\u2019s still a long way to go, though. Translation needs to be simultaneous, like the translator\u2019s voice speaking over the foreign politician on the TV, rather than in packets that oblige speakers to pause after every few remarks and wait for the translation to be delivered. It needs to work offline, for situations where internet access isn\u2019t possible \u2013 and to address concerns about the amount of private speech data accumulating in the cloud, having been sent to servers for processing. Systems not only need to cope with physical challenges such as noise, Waibel suggests, they will also need to be socially aware \u2013 to know their manners, and to address people appropriately. When I first emailed him, aware that he is a German professor and that continental traditions demand solemn respect for academic status, I erred on the side of formality and addressed him as \u201cDear Prof Waibel\u201d. As I expected, he replied in international English mode: \u201cHi Marek.\u201d Etiquette-sensitive artificial translators could relieve people of the need to be aware of differing cultural norms. They would facilitate interaction while reducing understanding. At the same time, they might help to preserve local customs, slowing the spread of habits associated with international English, such as its readiness to get on first-name terms. Professors and other professionals will not outsource language awareness to software, though. If the technology matures into seamless, ubiquitous artificial speech translation \u2013 Babel fish, in short \u2013 it will actually add value to language skills. Automated translation will deliver a commodity product: basic, practical, low-prestige information that helps people buy things or find their way around. Whether it will help people conduct their family lives or romantic relationships is open to question \u2013 though one noteworthy possibility is that it could overcome the language barriers that often arise between generations after migration, leaving children and their grandparents without a shared language. Whatever uses it is put to, though, it will never be as good as the real thing. Even if voice-morphing technology simulates the speaker\u2019s voice, their lip movements won\u2019t match, and they will look like they are in a dubbed movie. The contrast will underline the value of shared languages, and the value of learning them. Making the effort to learn someone\u2019s language is a sign of commitment, and therefore of trustworthiness. Sharing a language can also promote a sense of belonging and community, as with the international scientists who use English as a lingua franca, where their predecessors used Latin. Immigrant shopkeepers who learn their customers\u2019 language are not just making sales easier; they are showing that they wish to draw closer to their customers\u2019 community, and politely asserting a place in it. When machine translation becomes a ubiquitous commodity product, human language skills will command a premium. The person who has a language in their head will always have the advantage over somebody who relies on a device, in the same way that somebody with a head for figures has the advantage over somebody who has to reach for a calculator. Though the practical need for a lingua franca will diminish, the social value of sharing one will persist. And software will never be a substitute for the subtle but vital understanding that comes with knowledge of a language. That knowledge will always be needed to pick the nuances from the noise. \u2022 Marek Kohn\u2019s Four Words for Friend: Why Using More Than One Language Matters Now More Than Ever is published by Yale University Press (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>Robert del Naja is in no mood to talk about the past. Which is tricky, because as the force behind Massive Attack\u2019s current live spectacle (a reconfigured outing for their 1998 album <em>Mezzanine</em>), a degree of unpicking old memories might seem unavoidable. Still, sitting backstage in the clinical dressing room of an Amsterdam concert hall, each of us angled at either end of a sofa an hour before he\u2019s due on stage, Del Naja considers his unease with historical rehashing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a problem with nostalgia, because a lot of the time things are self-referential. When you\u2019re working in the way we do, taking things from the past and making them new, making collages\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI stopped feeling nostalgia for the moment because I imagine myself looking back on it from the future, which really freaks me out. I get this vertigo where I\u2019m not thinking about the past, I\u2019m thinking about how I\u2019m going to feel in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d Nostalgia isn\u2019t as good as it used to be, I joke. Del Naja rubs a hand forwards through his hair.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/30/massive-attack-mezzanine-tour-cocteau-twins-liz-fraser\" title=\"\">Mezzanine</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/30/massive-attack-mezzanine-tour-cocteau-twins-liz-fraser\" title=\"\"> was supposed to spell the end of Massive Attack</a>. By the time it was finally released, months late, in the spring of 98, the group \u2013 Del Naja (aka 3D), Grant Marshall (Daddy G) and Andrew Vowles (Mushroom) \u2013 had been fighting for a year and were barely speaking to one another. They recorded individually, gave interviews separately. The album, their third and moodiest, was a distinct, post-punk swerve away from the hip-hop and breakbeat culture they had championed in Bristol. It came slickly packaged in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/aug/07/3d-and-the-art-of-massive-attack-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Nick Knight sleeve</a> with an acid orange disc, and was released to mixed reviews, but, in true Massive fashion, it came to be belatedly revered as a masterpiece by critics everywhere from <em>Pitchfork</em> to the <em>Paris Review</em>.</p> <p>It also became their biggest commercial success, gifting the singles charts (and countless film and TV directors) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s&amp;list=PL5GvFoMoPqHkciYLbIiyOxvjlLayantI9&amp;t=0s&amp;index=19\" title=\"\">Teardrop</a>, Angel and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3mn7EC-skg&amp;list=PL5GvFoMoPqHkciYLbIiyOxvjlLayantI9&amp;t=0s&amp;index=20\" title=\"\">Inertia Creeps</a>. Despite their ubiquity, the songs still very much stand up. Live, they\u2019re menacing, resonant, moving. Nonetheless, after multiple furious rows about the new direction, soon after the album\u2019s release, Mushroom left the band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"de74e4c1a5b4173b7c7dfabbd954c736ea92e23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de74e4c1a5b4173b7c7dfabbd954c736ea92e23e/21_28_2500_1489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Massive Attack\u2019s Mezzanine XXI tour in Amsterdam, with projections of Adam Curtis\u2019s collaboratively made films.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"596\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Images from Massive Attack\u2019s Mezzanine XXI tour in Amsterdam, February 2019, with projections of Adam Curtis\u2019s collaboratively made films.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does it still feel raw? Marshall has entered the dressing room and leans against the wall, languid and softly spoken. \u201cRaw. Yeah, it is to a certain extent. [<em>Mezzanine</em>] was the end of our trio but\u2026 it projected us to greater things, I suppose. We\u2019ve been through different things which have made us a bit raw, but we\u2019ve managed to patch it up.\u201d</p> <p>What is Marshall\u2019s abiding memory of making the album? \u201cIt\u2019s fraught with bad memories, but it was a departure from what we were used to and so, yeah, that\u2019s kind of where all the heartaches came in.\u201d Del Naja\u2019s main memory \u201cis probably the fight really. It wasn\u2019t as simple as it used to be, because <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/omm/story/0,,1240048,00.html\" title=\"\">Blue Lines</a></em> [their debut] was based on our collective history. Culturally and musically it was a big jam together. And then the second album [<em>Protection</em>] we\u2019d become something, so we had a kind of routine and procedure. I felt that [with] <em>Mezzanine</em>, the procedure had to be ripped up, the rulebook had to be changed.\u201d</p> <p>The fight was about Teardrop, still their biggest-selling single; Del Naja and Marshall wanted former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/26/cocteau-twins-elizabeth-fraser-interview\" title=\"\">Cocteau Twins frontwoman Liz Fraser</a> on vocals. Mushroom secretly sent the track to Madonna, who loved it and called, keen to record it. Having already worked with her in 1995 on a cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s I Want You \u2013 at the time, to Mushroom\u2019s fury \u2013 Del Naja was incandescent and turned her down. He won\u2019t comment on it now. \u201cIt was hard,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI guess that is what I remember of <em>Mezzanine</em>: it was a proper struggle.\u201d</p> <p>On stage earlier, tension is redirected into the technicalities. Soundchecks are, in my experience, routinely boring. A band stops, starts, stops, repeats the same riff over and over while someone is asked to check the lights and a sound engineer perfects the levels of a hi-hat. Naturally, Massive Attack do things a little differently: the venue in which they are due to play two sold-out shows is bathed in red light and, as their PR and I creep towards the stalls for a seat, they deliver a full, seemingly note-perfect run-through of Teardrop. A life-affirming, butterflies-in-stomach exclusive for an audience of two.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/07/adam-curtis-massive-attack-review\" title=\"\">Films by acclaimed documentary-maker Adam Curtis, collaboratively made with Del Naja</a> for what seems to be Massive Attack\u2019s most ambitious show yet, are projected on giant screens. It\u2019s a mind melt. Curtis\u2019s signature aesthetic reels through a potted history of the past two decades \u2013 from trash pop culture to devastating scenes of war. They play out against a deconstructed <em>Mezzanine </em>21st anniversary set that later often stuns the Dutch audience into reverent silence. It\u2019s not how album shows \u2013 usually rowdy, indulgent, faithful playbacks \u2013 generally work. But then, Massive Attack\u2019s 2016 tour was devoted to the urgency of the refugee crisis; shows in 2010 brought political consciousness via LED screens made by United Visual Artists. Now Bauhaus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/21/gang-of-four\" title=\"\">Gang of Four</a> and the Cure covers slip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/avicii-appreciation-the-poster-boy-for-edm-who-struggled-with-the-spotlight\" title=\"\">alongside Avicii</a>, while a YouTube mashup of fan videos is both wry and moving.</p> <p>The whole performance is meticulous; the band never say a word. It\u2019s a stunning statement, a live visual art experience designed to provoke rather than straightforwardly please.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u7K72X4eo_s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s\">Watch Massive Attack\u2019s acclaimed video for Teardrop.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The next night, backstage at the venue, both Curtis (who has flown over specially) and Del Naja cautiously wonder whether it worked. Was it heavy-handed? Did the audience get what they were trying to achieve? Did it make them curious or really think about war, data, control, feedback loops, political idealism and the rest?</p> <p>The short answer, from watching the audience shush each other and vox-popping fans afterwards, is yes. Johanna is gutted that she \u201cwas not stoned to appreciate it on a bigger level\u201d. One woman, wearing red lipstick and bovver boots, says she is overwhelmed. \u201cIt was really good, they took you along on their story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for it to be unpredictable,\u201d says Del Naja. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. There\u2019s no sort of bants, no chatting because you kind of felt\u2026 Well, you wouldn\u2019t go to a play and the actors turn around and say: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019 And there has to be some personal creative risk attached where you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. It should be disorienting for us and the audience otherwise\u2026\u201d It\u2019s boring? He grins.</p> <p>\u201cGigs have become very formulaic these days,\u201d adds Curtis. \u201cNot just gigs but all of culture \u2013 and that\u2019s the challenge. The way you make people look again is by finding a different sort of image. And so the overall aim is to show how over the past 20 years, we\u2019ve gone into a very static, repetitive world that surrounds us with the same images that keep us from really looking.\u201d</p> <p>The two, who first worked together on a one-off commission for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/24/massive-attack-robert-del-naja\" title=\"\">Manchester international festival in 2013</a>, make an outwardly unlikely pairing. Del Naja retains a resolutely boyish energy and is dressed in black, off-duty streetwear; Curtis, just landed from London, is in a jacket and crisp white shirt. I ask how they considered some of the more sensitive, emotional material shown \u2013 a dead body, grieving relatives \u2013 and Curtis becomes exasperated.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very careful about which images we used. They had to be powerful.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is not only cliched, it\u2019s knowing these days. It\u2019s about time idealism came back. Really, I\u2019m being serious about that.\u201d He explains how he tried to make an idealistic film to go with Massive\u2019s cover of anti-war folk song Where Have All the Flowers Gone? \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way you connect with people, pull them out of their bubble and make them realise what\u2019s happening in their name. Which I don\u2019t think we have quite realised yet. We\u2019re still fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. I just get quite shocked by how insulated we have become in the face of these big wars which we\u2019re really involved in. Rant over. Sorry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17683ec998f0d017002306de43b2393ff1b62d71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17683ec998f0d017002306de43b2393ff1b62d71/0_165_4439_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More projections from Massive Attack and Adam Curtis\u2019s collaborative films in Amsterdam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of projections in Massive Attack\u2019s Mezzanine XX1 tour, Amsterdam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Del Naja starts giggling, Curtis gives him a sideways Laurel and Hardy-esque sigh. The show is very much a product of their particular push and pull. It\u2019s a long way from the romantic spirit of Massive Attack\u2019s early days, when as part of the Wild Bunch, the collective operated a collaborative process.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found our own sort of niches now, in a creative sense, which is a lot more comfortable, working together, because we can express ourselves the way we want to,\u201d explains Marshall, the evening before. \u201cBack then, we were trying to pretend that we were in this big pot, all drinking soup out of the same pot when that wasn\u2019t really the case. We really all had our own little bowls and\u2013\u201d he mimics stirring a tiny bowl \u2013 \u201cand were trying to take it away and do something.\u201d He stops, deadpan. \u201cYou like that analogy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you can forget the soup analogy,\u201d says Del Naja, meaning it. I laugh. I like the soup analogy. I ask what their worst row has been over, then apologise for asking such a horrible question. Del Naja jumps in.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. We have the kind of insidious things that just get under your skin over time, as opposed to big flare-ups. You know what I mean?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Del Naja and Marshall still look, dress and sound as they ever did. It\u2019s an utter shock to learn they are 54 and 59.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve remedied that,\u201d adds Marshall, \u201cby the fact that we don\u2019t really work together as such any more. We\u2019ve known each other like brothers this whole time. So you know, you get this brotherly thing when you go: \u2018Right, slightly sick of you now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I find scary,\u201d chips in Del Naja, \u201cis that everyone remembers everything differently, everyone has selective memory, and when you realise that [when] the brain has to remember something, it has to recreate the whole thought to remember it, and does that multiple times in its life, it\u2019s so unreliable.\u201d</p> <p>This is a very Del Naja sentence: he is a master of the sort of 3am chat \u2013 the post-party and pre-dawn mezzanine \u2013 where at least one brilliant point gets made. Thoughts bounce together at speed; he uses algorithms to explain the studio dynamic of making music, and politics to make sense of art.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why this gig is as much \u2018an album moment\u2019 as an album was,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everything has changed \u2013 the way we present ourselves, the way we share everything we do, the social experiment, the social experience. All that stuff is very different from when we put <em>Mezzanine</em> out. [Now,] you put a record out to justify a tour and that\u2019s what a lot of people do. So the album just seems irrelevant as a foremost product.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still do like the concept of an album,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cYou know, in a communal fashion...\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1510a59c08c811127f2df655a71e2e5937a60b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1510a59c08c811127f2df655a71e2e5937a60b4/400_303_3779_2267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Massive Attack\u2019s Mezzanine XX1 in Amsterdam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Massive Attack on stage; Mezzanine XX1, Amsterdam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re two different things now for artists and consumers,\u201d says Del Naja. What was the last one he bought? \u201cI mean, I love buying albums, I\u2019m obsessed, but now you just click \u2018add\u2019, don\u2019t you? And when do you actually listen to anything? You know, unless you\u2019re in the car or you\u2019ve got time to do that, it\u2019s just not the same world any more in terms of concentration. Attention span\u2019s the biggest commodity of all now. Data is the new oil. It\u2019s inside your head. That\u2019s where the value is and so is the tension. I mean, trying to get anyone to concentrate on anything when people get excited if the audience swipes down a page. If you actually stop and click, fuck me, that\u2019s gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d agrees Marshall. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to a record, a whole album, in five years.\u201d He makes a move to leave. \u201cI only like about three tracks on this album, anyway,\u201d he says, by way of goodbye.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if he was ribbing Del Naja, or whether he really would like to make an album together in the old fashioned-way. I ask if he\u2019s off for a pre-show ritual. \u201cYeah, get pissed. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do now.\u201d</p> <p>Freed from rose-tinting the band\u2019s history, Del Naja chats warmly and intensely \u2013 about physics, artificial intelligence, the robot in his studio that he\u2019s training to paint. \u201cI have total faith in the next generation. Looking at their response to climate change is really interesting and, again, that\u2019s the power of social media at its best, to mobilise people. I think that\u2019s a real positive. I think the negative is our generation and the generation above us that are still the problem because they don\u2019t want to change.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t evolved that much as human beings,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe still fall into the same patterns and traps and it\u2019s easy to turn ourselves against each other tribally. It seems too easy and it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>We chat some more, about pilates vs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/19/hot-or-not-bikram-no-more-beneficial-than-any-other-yoga-says-vascular-study\" title=\"\">Bikram yoga</a>, Brexit \u2013 \u201cpredictable and sad\u201d \u2013 and his tongue-in-cheek preparation for the apocalypse. \u201cI got a breadmaker, because everyone\u2019s going to ramp up the hysteria before Leave. Everyone will be going, \u201cOh right, everything\u2019s fucked, medicine and food, and you\u2019re not going to get bread anywhere, right? Or water or petrol. That\u2019s the first things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ec723e95b154d4a7e2ee5f6d0405af415f26769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ec723e95b154d4a7e2ee5f6d0405af415f26769/0_168_3807_2284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Fraser with Massive Attack at the Hydro, Glasgow, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Fraser with Massive Attack at the Hydro, Glasgow, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew MacColl/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Del Naja doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s changed much in the last 20 years. \u201cYou never do think you\u2019re going to grow up, because your brain stays the same and your personality hasn\u2019t really changed. It\u2019s your physical self that tells you.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, Del Naja and Marshall still look, dress and sound as they ever did. It\u2019s an utter shock to learn later, looking it up on my phone, that they are 54 and 59. \u201cYou cannot actually physically manage to be that hedonistic any more,\u201d says Del Naja. \u201cThere\u2019s been a major slow down. If I have a big night out, that\u2019s my week gone. It\u2019s like, you know what? Forget it, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>At the aftershow, in a small room of a dozen people backstage, Dave, the band\u2019s weary tour manager of 20 years, mixes up rounds of dark and stormys. A huddle of friends linger by the table football. Curtis describes his friend as \u201ca very smart boy\u201d and admits that the only \u201cbattle\u201d they had in creating the show was that \u201cRobert, being an artist, always wants to be slightly enigmatic, whereas I\u2019m a journalist and believe in clarity.\u201d</p> <p>Buoyed by the show, both are amped and giddy. Del Naja talks me through some of the more bonkers Massive Attack trivia. Like the time they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/31/how-we-made-moon-safari-air-jean-benoit-dunckel-nicolas-godin-interview\" title=\"\">said no to signing Air</a>. Or to working with Amy Winehouse.

      "bodyText": "Robert del Naja is in no mood to talk about the past. Which is tricky, because as the force behind Massive Attack\u2019s current live spectacle (a reconfigured outing for their 1998 album Mezzanine), a degree of unpicking old memories might seem unavoidable. Still, sitting backstage in the clinical dressing room of an Amsterdam concert hall, each of us angled at either end of a sofa an hour before he\u2019s due on stage, Del Naja considers his unease with historical rehashing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a problem with nostalgia, because a lot of the time things are self-referential. When you\u2019re working in the way we do, taking things from the past and making them new, making collages\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI stopped feeling nostalgia for the moment because I imagine myself looking back on it from the future, which really freaks me out. I get this vertigo where I\u2019m not thinking about the past, I\u2019m thinking about how I\u2019m going to feel in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201d Nostalgia isn\u2019t as good as it used to be, I joke. Del Naja rubs a hand forwards through his hair. Mezzanine was supposed to spell the end of Massive Attack. By the time it was finally released, months late, in the spring of 98, the group \u2013 Del Naja (aka 3D), Grant Marshall (Daddy G) and Andrew Vowles (Mushroom) \u2013 had been fighting for a year and were barely speaking to one another. They recorded individually, gave interviews separately. The album, their third and moodiest, was a distinct, post-punk swerve away from the hip-hop and breakbeat culture they had championed in Bristol. It came slickly packaged in a Nick Knight sleeve with an acid orange disc, and was released to mixed reviews, but, in true Massive fashion, it came to be belatedly revered as a masterpiece by critics everywhere from Pitchfork to the Paris Review. It also became their biggest commercial success, gifting the singles charts (and countless film and TV directors) Teardrop, Angel and Inertia Creeps. Despite their ubiquity, the songs still very much stand up. Live, they\u2019re menacing, resonant, moving. Nonetheless, after multiple furious rows about the new direction, soon after the album\u2019s release, Mushroom left the band. Does it still feel raw? Marshall has entered the dressing room and leans against the wall, languid and softly spoken. \u201cRaw. Yeah, it is to a certain extent. [Mezzanine] was the end of our trio but\u2026 it projected us to greater things, I suppose. We\u2019ve been through different things which have made us a bit raw, but we\u2019ve managed to patch it up.\u201d What is Marshall\u2019s abiding memory of making the album? \u201cIt\u2019s fraught with bad memories, but it was a departure from what we were used to and so, yeah, that\u2019s kind of where all the heartaches came in.\u201d Del Naja\u2019s main memory \u201cis probably the fight really. It wasn\u2019t as simple as it used to be, because Blue Lines [their debut] was based on our collective history. Culturally and musically it was a big jam together. And then the second album [Protection] we\u2019d become something, so we had a kind of routine and procedure. I felt that [with] Mezzanine, the procedure had to be ripped up, the rulebook had to be changed.\u201d The fight was about Teardrop, still their biggest-selling single; Del Naja and Marshall wanted former Cocteau Twins frontwoman Liz Fraser on vocals. Mushroom secretly sent the track to Madonna, who loved it and called, keen to record it. Having already worked with her in 1995 on a cover of Marvin Gaye\u2019s I Want You \u2013 at the time, to Mushroom\u2019s fury \u2013 Del Naja was incandescent and turned her down. He won\u2019t comment on it now. \u201cIt was hard,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI guess that is what I remember of Mezzanine: it was a proper struggle.\u201d On stage earlier, tension is redirected into the technicalities. Soundchecks are, in my experience, routinely boring. A band stops, starts, stops, repeats the same riff over and over while someone is asked to check the lights and a sound engineer perfects the levels of a hi-hat. Naturally, Massive Attack do things a little differently: the venue in which they are due to play two sold-out shows is bathed in red light and, as their PR and I creep towards the stalls for a seat, they deliver a full, seemingly note-perfect run-through of Teardrop. A life-affirming, butterflies-in-stomach exclusive for an audience of two. Films by acclaimed documentary-maker Adam Curtis, collaboratively made with Del Naja for what seems to be Massive Attack\u2019s most ambitious show yet, are projected on giant screens. It\u2019s a mind melt. Curtis\u2019s signature aesthetic reels through a potted history of the past two decades \u2013 from trash pop culture to devastating scenes of war. They play out against a deconstructed Mezzanine 21st anniversary set that later often stuns the Dutch audience into reverent silence. It\u2019s not how album shows \u2013 usually rowdy, indulgent, faithful playbacks \u2013 generally work. But then, Massive Attack\u2019s 2016 tour was devoted to the urgency of the refugee crisis; shows in 2010 brought political consciousness via LED screens made by United Visual Artists. Now Bauhaus, Gang of Four and the Cure covers slip in alongside Avicii, while a YouTube mashup of fan videos is both wry and moving. The whole performance is meticulous; the band never say a word. It\u2019s a stunning statement, a live visual art experience designed to provoke rather than straightforwardly please. The next night, backstage at the venue, both Curtis (who has flown over specially) and Del Naja cautiously wonder whether it worked. Was it heavy-handed? Did the audience get what they were trying to achieve? Did it make them curious or really think about war, data, control, feedback loops, political idealism and the rest? The short answer, from watching the audience shush each other and vox-popping fans afterwards, is yes. Johanna is gutted that she \u201cwas not stoned to appreciate it on a bigger level\u201d. One woman, wearing red lipstick and bovver boots, says she is overwhelmed. \u201cIt was really good, they took you along on their story.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m happy for it to be unpredictable,\u201d says Del Naja. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. There\u2019s no sort of bants, no chatting because you kind of felt\u2026 Well, you wouldn\u2019t go to a play and the actors turn around and say: \u2018Are you all right?\u2019 And there has to be some personal creative risk attached where you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. It should be disorienting for us and the audience otherwise\u2026\u201d It\u2019s boring? He grins. \u201cGigs have become very formulaic these days,\u201d adds Curtis. \u201cNot just gigs but all of culture \u2013 and that\u2019s the challenge. The way you make people look again is by finding a different sort of image. And so the overall aim is to show how over the past 20 years, we\u2019ve gone into a very static, repetitive world that surrounds us with the same images that keep us from really looking.\u201d The two, who first worked together on a one-off commission for Manchester international festival in 2013, make an outwardly unlikely pairing. Del Naja retains a resolutely boyish energy and is dressed in black, off-duty streetwear; Curtis, just landed from London, is in a jacket and crisp white shirt. I ask how they considered some of the more sensitive, emotional material shown \u2013 a dead body, grieving relatives \u2013 and Curtis becomes exasperated. \u201cWe were very careful about which images we used. They had to be powerful. \u201cEverything is not only cliched, it\u2019s knowing these days. It\u2019s about time idealism came back. Really, I\u2019m being serious about that.\u201d He explains how he tried to make an idealistic film to go with Massive\u2019s cover of anti-war folk song Where Have All the Flowers Gone? \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way you connect with people, pull them out of their bubble and make them realise what\u2019s happening in their name. Which I don\u2019t think we have quite realised yet. We\u2019re still fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, you know.\u201d I do. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. I just get quite shocked by how insulated we have become in the face of these big wars which we\u2019re really involved in. Rant over. Sorry.\u201d Del Naja starts giggling, Curtis gives him a sideways Laurel and Hardy-esque sigh. The show is very much a product of their particular push and pull. It\u2019s a long way from the romantic spirit of Massive Attack\u2019s early days, when as part of the Wild Bunch, the collective operated a collaborative process. \u201cWe\u2019ve found our own sort of niches now, in a creative sense, which is a lot more comfortable, working together, because we can express ourselves the way we want to,\u201d explains Marshall, the evening before. \u201cBack then, we were trying to pretend that we were in this big pot, all drinking soup out of the same pot when that wasn\u2019t really the case. We really all had our own little bowls and\u2013\u201d he mimics stirring a tiny bowl \u2013 \u201cand were trying to take it away and do something.\u201d He stops, deadpan. \u201cYou like that analogy?\u201d \u201cI think you can forget the soup analogy,\u201d says Del Naja, meaning it. I laugh. I like the soup analogy. I ask what their worst row has been over, then apologise for asking such a horrible question. Del Naja jumps in. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We have the kind of insidious things that just get under your skin over time, as opposed to big flare-ups. You know what I mean?\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve remedied that,\u201d adds Marshall, \u201cby the fact that we don\u2019t really work together as such any more. We\u2019ve known each other like brothers this whole time. So you know, you get this brotherly thing when you go: \u2018Right, slightly sick of you now.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat I find scary,\u201d chips in Del Naja, \u201cis that everyone remembers everything differently, everyone has selective memory, and when you realise that [when] the brain has to remember something, it has to recreate the whole thought to remember it, and does that multiple times in its life, it\u2019s so unreliable.\u201d This is a very Del Naja sentence: he is a master of the sort of 3am chat \u2013 the post-party and pre-dawn mezzanine \u2013 where at least one brilliant point gets made. Thoughts bounce together at speed; he uses algorithms to explain the studio dynamic of making music, and politics to make sense of art. \u201cThat\u2019s why this gig is as much \u2018an album moment\u2019 as an album was,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everything has changed \u2013 the way we present ourselves, the way we share everything we do, the social experiment, the social experience. All that stuff is very different from when we put Mezzanine out. [Now,] you put a record out to justify a tour and that\u2019s what a lot of people do. So the album just seems irrelevant as a foremost product.\u201d \u201cI still do like the concept of an album,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cYou know, in a communal fashion...\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re two different things now for artists and consumers,\u201d says Del Naja. What was the last one he bought? \u201cI mean, I love buying albums, I\u2019m obsessed, but now you just click \u2018add\u2019, don\u2019t you? And when do you actually listen to anything? You know, unless you\u2019re in the car or you\u2019ve got time to do that, it\u2019s just not the same world any more in terms of concentration. Attention span\u2019s the biggest commodity of all now. Data is the new oil. It\u2019s inside your head. That\u2019s where the value is and so is the tension. I mean, trying to get anyone to concentrate on anything when people get excited if the audience swipes down a page. If you actually stop and click, fuck me, that\u2019s gold.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d agrees Marshall. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to a record, a whole album, in five years.\u201d He makes a move to leave. \u201cI only like about three tracks on this album, anyway,\u201d he says, by way of goodbye. I\u2019m not sure if he was ribbing Del Naja, or whether he really would like to make an album together in the old fashioned-way. I ask if he\u2019s off for a pre-show ritual. \u201cYeah, get pissed. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do now.\u201d Freed from rose-tinting the band\u2019s history, Del Naja chats warmly and intensely \u2013 about physics, artificial intelligence, the robot in his studio that he\u2019s training to paint. \u201cI have total faith in the next generation. Looking at their response to climate change is really interesting and, again, that\u2019s the power of social media at its best, to mobilise people. I think that\u2019s a real positive. I think the negative is our generation and the generation above us that are still the problem because they don\u2019t want to change. \u201cWe haven\u2019t evolved that much as human beings,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe still fall into the same patterns and traps and it\u2019s easy to turn ourselves against each other tribally. It seems too easy and it\u2019s scary.\u201d We chat some more, about pilates vs Bikram yoga, Brexit \u2013 \u201cpredictable and sad\u201d \u2013 and his tongue-in-cheek preparation for the apocalypse. \u201cI got a breadmaker, because everyone\u2019s going to ramp up the hysteria before Leave. Everyone will be going, \u201cOh right, everything\u2019s fucked, medicine and food, and you\u2019re not going to get bread anywhere, right? Or water or petrol. That\u2019s the first things.\u201d Del Naja doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s changed much in the last 20 years. \u201cYou never do think you\u2019re going to grow up, because your brain stays the same and your personality hasn\u2019t really changed. It\u2019s your physical self that tells you.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, Del Naja and Marshall still look, dress and sound as they ever did. It\u2019s an utter shock to learn later, looking it up on my phone, that they are 54 and 59. \u201cYou cannot actually physically manage to be that hedonistic any more,\u201d says Del Naja. \u201cThere\u2019s been a major slow down. If I have a big night out, that\u2019s my week gone. It\u2019s like, you know what? Forget it, I\u2019m done.\u201d At the aftershow, in a small room of a dozen people backstage, Dave, the band\u2019s weary tour manager of 20 years, mixes up rounds of dark and stormys. A huddle of friends linger by the table football. Curtis describes his friend as \u201ca very smart boy\u201d and admits that the only \u201cbattle\u201d they had in creating the show was that \u201cRobert, being an artist, always wants to be slightly enigmatic, whereas I\u2019m a journalist and believe in clarity.\u201d Buoyed by the show, both are amped and giddy. Del Naja talks me through some of the more bonkers Massive Attack trivia. Like the time they said no to signing Air. Or to working with Amy Winehouse. He remembers that they also turned down Sam Mendes when he asked to use Teardrop for the title song of American Beauty \u2013 \u201cWe would have been No 1 in America, haha\u201d \u2013 and a plea from Radiohead to remix OK Computer. \u201cWe were just too busy for it at the time.\u201d A superfan, Richard Coffey from Ireland, graciously referred to as the band\u2019s unofficial historian, joins the party and spends some time analysing the current arrangements of Teardrop, which he explains to Del Naja \u201care probably at their best at the moment\u201d. Coffey\u2019s obsession translates to an encyclopaedic knowledge of all the interviews Massive Attack have ever given. How did he discover them? \u201cI heard them on The Matrix,\u201d he says, earnestly. \u201cDissolved Girl [from Mezzanine] was on the soundtrack.\u201d Del Naja starts giggling again. Given how long they\u2019ve been at it and how embedded they have become in the fabric of British culture, it\u2019s easy to forget just how good and visionary Massive Attack are. How influential they\u2019ve been. How they pioneered a sound that managed to glide between teenage bedrooms, parties and fuzzy Sunday evenings. One which, even now, despite the more low-key impact of 100th Window (2003) and Heligoland (2010), you could draw a contemporary line through the evolution of British pop, through dubstep, to The Weeknd, Lana Del Ray and beyond. \u201cMost people just look at me like I\u2019m fucking mad,\u201d laughs Del Naja. To be fair, he\u2019s spent 10 minutes talking to me about the complexities of internet-alternative the mesh, a conversation about tech that will no doubt soon become mainstream. \u201cWhat are you talking about, they\u2019ll say. You\u2019re off your head!\u201d He grins again. \u201cI\u2019ve become a prophet of doom, but I\u2019m an optimist, really.\u201d \u2022 Massive Attack Mezzanine XX1 is at O2, London, 22 Feb; Dublin\u2019s 3Arena, 24 Feb; Bristol Steel Yard, 1 &amp; 2 March.

      "body": "<p>In dark times, stories of resurrection have always worked a treat for those trying to flog a religion or sell a little hope. And in a small Yorkshire town once sustained by textiles, resurrection is exactly what a likable offbeat collective is trying to bring.</p> <p>Keighley Rugby League Club, a regular member of the last-chance saloon, was placed in special measures in November for failing to pay the players\u2019 wages. It looked to be in dire trouble, only to be rescued at the 11th hour by a consortium of familiar faces, the men in charge during the glory years of the 1990s, when the waiting list for boundary boards was so long that the club flogged advertising space on the roof.</p> <p>Back in 1991, when Mick O\u2019Neil and Mike Smith first joined the board, the ground was being used by the Health and Safety Executive as an example of decrepitude, and the club was again near bankruptcy.</p> <p>O\u2019Neil and Smith had grand plans and for four crazy years lived every moment of them. The club was renamed Keighley Cougars, the wooden grandstand, which had been closed and condemned as unsafe after the Bradford City fire, was reopened, a hospitality area built and the ground became known as Cougar Park. They signed the world champion American gladiator Wesley \u201cTwo Scoops\u201d Berry as a publicity stunt and started the then innovative practice of giving individual players theme tunes.</p> <p>They began a pioneering community cohesion programme, taking 1,000 local school children down to Wembley to watch Great Britain and had government ministers coming up to visit the Cougar Classroom. Crowd numbers mushroomed from the hundreds to four, five, six thousand as Cougarmania hit the town and gave the people of Keighley something to swing behind.

      "bodyText": "In dark times, stories of resurrection have always worked a treat for those trying to flog a religion or sell a little hope. And in a small Yorkshire town once sustained by textiles, resurrection is exactly what a likable offbeat collective is trying to bring. Keighley Rugby League Club, a regular member of the last-chance saloon, was placed in special measures in November for failing to pay the players\u2019 wages. It looked to be in dire trouble, only to be rescued at the 11th hour by a consortium of familiar faces, the men in charge during the glory years of the 1990s, when the waiting list for boundary boards was so long that the club flogged advertising space on the roof. Back in 1991, when Mick O\u2019Neil and Mike Smith first joined the board, the ground was being used by the Health and Safety Executive as an example of decrepitude, and the club was again near bankruptcy. O\u2019Neil and Smith had grand plans and for four crazy years lived every moment of them. The club was renamed Keighley Cougars, the wooden grandstand, which had been closed and condemned as unsafe after the Bradford City fire, was reopened, a hospitality area built and the ground became known as Cougar Park. They signed the world champion American gladiator Wesley \u201cTwo Scoops\u201d Berry as a publicity stunt and started the then innovative practice of giving individual players theme tunes. They began a pioneering community cohesion programme, taking 1,000 local school children down to Wembley to watch Great Britain and had government ministers coming up to visit the Cougar Classroom. Crowd numbers mushroomed from the hundreds to four, five, six thousand as Cougarmania hit the town and gave the people of Keighley something to swing behind. It was a galvanising, groundbreaking example of what a sports club with real meaning to the local community can do. In 1993, they won the Third Division, in 1995 the Second Division and promotion to the top tier, then known as the Stones Bitter Championship. But then disaster: Rupert Murdoch took a personal interest in British rugby league as part of his pay-TV battles in Australia, the summer Super League was formed and Keighley were left the wrong side of the divide. The coach left, the sponsors fell away, as did the crowds, and the wage bill, built on presumption of top division status, was unpayable. The club went bust and the leading members of the management went their separate ways to Australia, Switzerland and Spain. \u201cWe felt like a rock group who\u2019d been stabbed in the heart.\u201d says Smith. But they\u2019re back \u2013 Smith, Mick O\u2019Neil and Tim Wood, the old Cougars company director \u2013 alongside O\u2019Neil\u2019s son, Ryan, and his husband, Kaue Garcia. \u201cWe\u2019re untypical,\u201d says Smith, \u201cWe\u2019re all half crazy, we\u2019ve got a couple of old halfwits, two gay guys, a Brazilian, and one with a brain.\u201d Ryan O\u2019Neil, who has lived away from Keighley for 20 years, can\u2019t quite believe he\u2019s back. \u201cGrowing up in Keighley as a closeted gay man wasn\u2019t the easiest.

Collins said on Friday that the committee would be releasing unpublished documents from Six4Three, a US software developer engaged in a bitter dispute with Facebook. \u201cWhen the Cambridge Analytica story broke,\u201d he said, \u201cFacebook made all these public pronouncements about how shocked they were that people\u2019s data had been abused. What these documents show is that this was actually their MO. The scale of the deception they practised is really quite breathtaking.\u201d The Washington Post claimed last week that Facebook was in negotiations with the US Federal Trade Commission over the data mishandling exposed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fine is reported to potentially run into billions of dollars. The documents published by parliament are expected to show further evidence of its abuse of competition laws. The report will throw the spotlight once again on the use of data in the EU referendum.Chris Vickery, a cybersecurity expert, handed over a vast repository of material relating to AIQ, the Canadian data firm used by Vote Leave in the referendum. The committee has engaged outside experts to assess the evidence, some of which was published by the Observer and which showed similarities in the code used by four Leave campaigns that hired AIQ: Vote Leave, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the DUP. Under British electoral laws, it is illegal for campaigns to co-ordinate unless they declare spending jointly. But it is the committee\u2019s call for an independent investigation into foreign interference in British elections that is likely to be least welcomed by the government. It will put Theresa May in a potentially embarrassing spot. She called out Russian attempts to interfere in British democracy in a speech she made in November 2017 but has been silent ever since, despite mounting evidence including the Observer\u2019s revelations of a covert relationship between Arron Banks, the funder of the Leave.EU campaign, and the Russian government. The source of Banks\u2019s donation is now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA), but the government has refused to say if any investigation is going on into his links to Russia, despite calls to do so from Collins and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson.",

      "body": "<p>Bereaved families and lawyers are threatening to boycott the long-awaited inquests into the 1974 IRA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/26/birmingham-pub-bombings-inquests-will-not-name-suspects\" title=\"\">Birmingham pub bombings</a> because of concern over missing documents, lack of legal funding and what the process can deliver.</p> <p>They are anxious that the inquest\u2019s frame of reference has become so limited that it will yield little insight into the circumstances surrounding the two bombings that killed 21 people and wounded 220.</p> <p>Compounding their concern is the lack of disclosure of vital evidence and the fact that key files that would have shed light on the explosions at Birmingham\u2019s Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs have disappeared.</p> <p>On Friday, with the five-week inquest due to commence from 25 February, the law firm representing half of the families of bombing victims was told its application for a well-resourced legal team had been rejected. The Legal Aid Agency awarded the Northern Ireland firm KRW LAW LLP only a tenth of the funding it had requested for its 10 clients, leaving it dwarfed by the size and resources available to the publicly funded legal team of police officers and government officials.</p> <p>On Saturday a <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/supporthilda\" title=\"\">crowdfunding</a> page was set up in a late attempt to pay for greater legal representation. However, families have warned that crisis talks will take place this week over whether they will officially boycott the inquest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/20/julie-hambleton-birmingham-pub-bombings-justice\" title=\"\">Julie Hambleton, sister of one of the victims,</a> 18-year-old Maxine Hambleton, said the legal funding decision was the latest in a series of demoralising developments.</p> <p>\u201cSomething is seriously amiss, it\u2019s absolutely outrageous. We are meant to have a judiciary system that is the envy of the world, but we\u2019re going to be left with more questions than we started with,\u201d said Hambleton.</p> <p>Christopher Stanley of KRW said the integrity of the inquest was of serious concern to his clients.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe could walk away, we could boycott it. We could advise on that. We have discussed putting down tools because we have to act in the best interests of our clients. An intelligent person in their position might say: \u2018What is the point in me engaging in this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Families fear the hearings will focus primarily on the nature of the IRA warnings before the bombings and the response of the emergency services on the night of 21 November 1974. The coroner has already ruled out investigating whether an informer was embedded within the IRA cell responsible for the bombings after a pre-inquest hearing last month heard there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of a state agent involvement.</p> <p>He has also infuriated families by excluding all evidence relating to the perpetrators. The Birmingham Six were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/01/new-birmingham-pub-bombing-suspects-found-ira-documentary-claims\" title=\"\">wrongly jailed</a> for 18 years over the bombings before proving their innocence. On Wednesday, the former Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/chris-mullin-names-birmingham-pub-bombings-suspects\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin identified two of the four men</a> he alleged were responsible.</p> <p>Stanley said: \u201cIf one of the purposes of complex multi-death inquests is to allay rumours and suspicion, then this will not.\u201d</p> <p>Disclosure is another vexed issue, with Hambleton \u201cincredulous\u201d that so far no police force or government department \u2013 including the Home Office, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, as well as MI5, MI6 and military intelligence \u2013 has said that it holds material relating to the atrocity.</p> <p>Of particular concern are two folders belonging to the joint intelligence committee, examining information from the security services, GCHQ and military intelligence, which have gone missing and are understood to have contained \u201cmovements of the IRA\u201d.</p> <p>To date, 28,000 pages of evidence have been disclosed but lawyers and families are curious about the files they will not see.</p> <p>\u201cWe know nothing, what search engine terms have been used or how many people are searching. We don\u2019t know what the coroner has seen,\u201d said Stanley. He is also worried that there has been no application for public interest immunity (PII), the legal device that means sensitive testimony is not made public in court to protect the national interest.</p> <p>The lack of PII applications for the Birmingham inquest has raised predictions that no contentious testimony will be heard.</p> <p>Also causing consternation is that despite the threat of an IRA bombing campaign at the time, no state agency appears to have produced any guidelines, policies or protocols on how to prevent or respond to a bomb threat or explosion. The lack of a policy may explain why, before the blasts, officers were sent to search empty offices in Birmingham\u2019s Rotunda building above the Mulberry Bush but failed to evacuate the pub itself.

      "bodyText": "Bereaved families and lawyers are threatening to boycott the long-awaited inquests into the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings because of concern over missing documents, lack of legal funding and what the process can deliver. They are anxious that the inquest\u2019s frame of reference has become so limited that it will yield little insight into the circumstances surrounding the two bombings that killed 21 people and wounded 220. Compounding their concern is the lack of disclosure of vital evidence and the fact that key files that would have shed light on the explosions at Birmingham\u2019s Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs have disappeared. On Friday, with the five-week inquest due to commence from 25 February, the law firm representing half of the families of bombing victims was told its application for a well-resourced legal team had been rejected. The Legal Aid Agency awarded the Northern Ireland firm KRW LAW LLP only a tenth of the funding it had requested for its 10 clients, leaving it dwarfed by the size and resources available to the publicly funded legal team of police officers and government officials. On Saturday a crowdfunding page was set up in a late attempt to pay for greater legal representation. However, families have warned that crisis talks will take place this week over whether they will officially boycott the inquest. Julie Hambleton, sister of one of the victims, 18-year-old Maxine Hambleton, said the legal funding decision was the latest in a series of demoralising developments. \u201cSomething is seriously amiss, it\u2019s absolutely outrageous. We are meant to have a judiciary system that is the envy of the world, but we\u2019re going to be left with more questions than we started with,\u201d said Hambleton. Christopher Stanley of KRW said the integrity of the inquest was of serious concern to his clients. He said: \u201cWe could walk away, we could boycott it. We could advise on that. We have discussed putting down tools because we have to act in the best interests of our clients. An intelligent person in their position might say: \u2018What is the point in me engaging in this?\u2019\u201d Families fear the hearings will focus primarily on the nature of the IRA warnings before the bombings and the response of the emergency services on the night of 21 November 1974. The coroner has already ruled out investigating whether an informer was embedded within the IRA cell responsible for the bombings after a pre-inquest hearing last month heard there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of a state agent involvement. He has also infuriated families by excluding all evidence relating to the perpetrators. The Birmingham Six were wrongly jailed for 18 years over the bombings before proving their innocence. On Wednesday, the former Labour MP Chris Mullin identified two of the four men he alleged were responsible. Stanley said: \u201cIf one of the purposes of complex multi-death inquests is to allay rumours and suspicion, then this will not.\u201d Disclosure is another vexed issue, with Hambleton \u201cincredulous\u201d that so far no police force or government department \u2013 including the Home Office, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, as well as MI5, MI6 and military intelligence \u2013 has said that it holds material relating to the atrocity. Of particular concern are two folders belonging to the joint intelligence committee, examining information from the security services, GCHQ and military intelligence, which have gone missing and are understood to have contained \u201cmovements of the IRA\u201d. To date, 28,000 pages of evidence have been disclosed but lawyers and families are curious about the files they will not see. \u201cWe know nothing, what search engine terms have been used or how many people are searching. We don\u2019t know what the coroner has seen,\u201d said Stanley. He is also worried that there has been no application for public interest immunity (PII), the legal device that means sensitive testimony is not made public in court to protect the national interest. The lack of PII applications for the Birmingham inquest has raised predictions that no contentious testimony will be heard. Also causing consternation is that despite the threat of an IRA bombing campaign at the time, no state agency appears to have produced any guidelines, policies or protocols on how to prevent or respond to a bomb threat or explosion. The lack of a policy may explain why, before the blasts, officers were sent to search empty offices in Birmingham\u2019s Rotunda building above the Mulberry Bush but failed to evacuate the pub itself. Ten of the victims died in the pub and dozens more were seriously wounded. \u201cThere were either no policies in place, or there were policies in place but they hadn\u2019t trickled down. We would expect a file of protocols and policies from the Cabinet Office downwards,\u201d said Stanley. One option for the families, if they decide to boycott the inquest, would be to pursue a judge-led inquiry along the lines of the 2011 investigation by Sir William Gage into the death of Baha Mousa, who died in British army custody in Iraq. Stanley said that they could consider folding the Birmingham inquest and the recently resumed inquest into the 1974 Guildford pub bombings, in which five people were killed. The Birmingham pub bombings came at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Detonating at 8:17pm inside the Mulberry Bush and ten minutes later at the Tavern in the Town, the devices were planted during a concerted mainland bombing campaign by the IRA. The month before the Birmingham attacks, October 1974, two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, were targeted and four British soldiers and one civilian killed by bombs left by the Provisional IRA. Two weeks before the Birmingham bombings, a British soldier and a civilian were killed and 28 injured when the IRA threw a bomb through the window of the Kings Arms pub in Woolwich, England. The year, 1974, culminated with the Provisional IRA announcing a Christmas ceasefire, but not before they carried out a bomb attack on the home of former Prime Minister Edward Heath, who was not injured. More than 3,500 people were killed during the Troubles, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were paramilitary group members.",

Sometimes, as with Lampard, it all makes sense. Other times, not so much. Unless Roberto Mancini seriously believed his son, Andrea, might break into Manchester City\u2019s side when he signed him in 2010 (optimistic, you would have to say, given that Mancini Jr is now at Francavilla Calcio 1927 in Italy\u2019s fourth division).

As the columnist Norman Chad, aka Couch Slouch, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/the-nepotism-football-league/2015/09/27/6fd94bee-6305-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html?utm_term=.da1164cd1868\" title=\"\">once wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cIn case you forgot, the \u2018N\u2019 in NFL also stands for \u2018Nepotism\u2019. Skill can go a long way, but nothing beats having your father hire you.\u201d</p> <p>Rather stunningly, Chad had worked out that almost a quarter of the NFL coaches at that time employed their sons in prominent coaching roles. The Seattle Seahawks had even created two positions on behalf of Pete Carroll for the coach\u2019s sons, Nate and Brennan. Though still not quite as impressive, perhaps, as Bill Belichick appointing his own flesh and blood, Steve, as his assistant with the New England Patriots. At 24, Steve\u2019s sporting qualifications involved some lacrosse at Rutgers University and a year as their long snapper. The equivalent, as Chad noted, of scrawling graffiti on the wall of a Greyhound bus station before getting hired by the <em>New Yorker</em> as a senior correspondent.</p> <p>Football, too, likes to keep it in the family, in all sorts of different ways, and there is no doubt it can make a lot of people rich in the process. Just consider the number of agents with familiar surnames, usually the sons of managers or senior boardroom figures, who have made a killing from the sport. Or some of the other relationships that have made sure, when it comes to all the different branches of football\u2019s family tree, that the entitled apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the entitled apple orchard.</p> <p>What possibly was it, for example, that qualified David Sharpe, then 23, to take over as chairman of Wigan Athletic in 2015? Apart from the obvious, perhaps: that Dave Whelan, the club\u2019s owner, was his grandad. Sharpe had initially been in charge of the family\u2019s fish\u2011and\u2011chips restaurant, Sharpy\u2019s, before it was boarded up because of a lack of customers, costing Whelan \u00a31.3m in the process.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, he has not worked in football since.</p> <p>Yet Davies, I imagine, was grateful to have his family member in such close proximity. Amid many strange goings-on at Forest under their regime, the manager was handed a bumper new contract when he was only eight months into his initial three-and-a-half-year deal.</p> <p>On a different theme, you might have seen the headlines recently about the agent James Warnock\u2019s close links to Cardiff City.

      "bodyText": "A Tory donor has registered a new party ready to champion a hard Brexit in a snap election amid rising concern that the Conservatives will eventually split over Theresa May\u2019s strategy. Jeremy Hosking, the multimillionaire financier who backed a series of pro-Brexit Tory candidates at the last election, said he had submitted the paperwork to form his new party, Brexit Express, which would welcome Tory MPs wanting to protest should the prime minister \u201cbotch Brexit\u201d. He made the move after launching a billboard campaign supporting a no-deal Brexit, claiming it was the only way of securing the right deal with the EU in the long term. Hosking said he expected many parties to be formed over the next year as \u201cpart of the reorientation of British politics\u201d. \u201cCan these unhappy spouses co-exist in the same political party? The best form of defence is attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily want the Tory party to split, but it seems to me that there is a good case for it.\u201d His decision follows the emergence of a series of pro-Brexit campaign groups to prepare for another referendum or contest European elections due to take place in May, after Britain is supposed to have left the EU.

The outcome may have consequences for other women who killed their partners after allegedly being subjected to similar forms of control. Since Challen\u2019s 2011 conviction, which saw her jailed for 22 years, reduced to 18 on appeal, her two sons, James and David, have amassed a body of evidence to suggest that their mother was a victim of psychological abuse that they say should have been taken into account during her trial. \u201cThe jury heard our mother being painted as a person \u2018consumed by jealousy\u2019, who having suspected our father of cheating on her, counted his Viagra pills and took his life because she found herself eaten up with jealousy at his friendships with other women,\u201d the two sons explain in a statement shared with the Observer.

The case will be studied by legal experts to gauge the extent to which coercive control is now recognised by the courts following the law change. \u201cWe\u2019re saying the fact that the law only came into being in 2015 shows that previously we didn\u2019t have that mechanism for understanding controlling behaviour,\u201d Wistrich said.

It still gives you a warm feeling. In those days, Cardiff played on the Arms Park. I lived in the Rhondda and the club was on a pedestal there. I never dared to think about playing for them and it was a difficult decision to leave in 1969. Who knows what I would have gone on to achieve had I stayed but I count myself fortunate to have played six years for Cardiff and been capped by Wales and the Lions followed by 14 happy years at Salford. I have no regrets.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Wales faced England in 1969, their coaching revolution had just started but teams were not allowed to meet up more than 48 hours before a match and in effect had one training session to prepare. Wales stayed in the Angel hotel and names who were to become world renowned \u2013 Barry John, Gareth Edwards, Mervyn Davies, JPR Williams, John Dawes and Dai Morris \u2013 made the short walk down Westgate Street to get to the ground that Saturday.</p> \n<p>\u201cI always slept well before a game,\u201d Richards recalls. \u201cWalking to the ground was part of the experience and running out on to the Arms Park was special. When I was a kid it seemed the only place where rugby existed. When I was seven my grandfather [Edwin Rees, a professional footballer with Charlton Athletic and Bradford City in the 1920s] and my stepfather took me to see Cardiff play Newport. One of their forwards stooped to pick up the ball and Cliff Morgan darted between his legs to scoop it up. I was hooked.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/14/eddie-jones-hand-grenades-wales-neil-jenkins-england-six-nations\">Eddie Jones hand grenades will not faze us, says Wales\u2019s Neil Jenkins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt was all coming together for Wales in 1969. Clive Rowlands was the coach, an inspirational figure who knew what it took to win, we had a terrific set of forwards, half\u2011backs of a kind you will never find again and flair behind. Added to that was footballing ability, players who knew how to use the ball strategically. Put it all together and things happen, as it did that day against England. I scored the tries but it was the forwards who won the game. They destroyed England\u2019s pack.\u201d</p> \n<p>The sides went in 3-3 at half-time. Bob Hiller had given England the lead with a penalty before Richards scored his first try after his opposite number, Ken Plummer, was caught in possession five metres from his line and Barry John forced a turnover. Wales had been playing into the wind and with it breezed to victory. John scored their second try, helping himself to a Keith Jarrett pass intended for Richards and weaving away from four tacklers, before Richards rounded Plummer to finish a passing move then outmuscled him after JPR Williams was held on the line. Richards\u2019s fourth was his best, coming into midfield 35 metres out after a lineout, powering through a tackle and stepping away from another before outpacing two defenders. It was the hapless Plummer\u2019s first cap, a replacement for the injured Keith Fielding, who was to join Richards at Salford. Plummer had to wait seven years for his second.</p> \n<p>\u201cKen Plummer was not to blame for what happened,\u201d says Richards. \u201cI was introduced to him at a Varsity match some years later; I don\u2019t think he was pleased to see me. I am not sure I touched the ball more than four times: it is about being in the right place. Look at some of the tries Wales and England have scored this year from kicks. Some tries are down to flair, others to hard work, perseverance and reading the game.\u201d</p> \n<p>Such as Richards\u2019s in the draw in France that had thwarted Wales\u2019s grand slam hopes, chasing Gareth Edwards\u2019s chip over a scrum into space after the right wing had rushed up. \u201cI suppose I could have had five [against England] had Barry not intervened,\u201d says Richards. \u201cHe had a habit of ghosting through tacklers.

The prime minister seems determined to leave everything to a last-minute crisis in the final few days of March, and content to risk no-deal, despite the damage it would do. But this is a terrible way to make decisions and an irresponsible way to govern. If she cannot resolve things soon, we need some parliamentary safeguards in place instead.</p> <p>Already even the threat of no-deal is causing huge problems. Businesses don\u2019t know what to do about their April orders. Leading British manufacturers said last week that they were spending tens of millions of pounds on preparing for no-deal, but were hoping the money would be wasted. Police officers don\u2019t know if European arrest warrants they have issued for criminals will be torn up overnight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ministers talk about their plans but they are praising the emperor\u2019s new clothes, not daring to admit he is naked</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I want to see a workable deal that supports manufacturing and can sustain a consensus. But the prime minister\u2019s refusal to change her red lines, her refusal even to consider a customs union, and her determination to pander only to the hardline European Research Group within her own party make me deeply worried. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/14/brexit-latest-news-developments-debate-vote-amendments-fox-tells-potential-tory-rebels-they-will-undermine-pms-negotiation-if-she-loses-key-vote-politics-live\" title=\"\">The votes last week </a>show that the ERG will not be satisfied with any sensible plan. Its members advocate no-deal, but they won\u2019t be the ones who suffer if food prices go up as a result of WTO tariffs and border delays to food, and they won\u2019t be the ones who are hit if manufacturing jobs are lost.</p> <p> The government has a basic responsibility to keep us safe, to make sure the poorest families can afford food in the shops, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/revealed-uk-patients-stockpile-drugs-in-fear-of-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">or that patients can get their medicines</a>, or that our businesses can trade. Yet, even with all those things potentially at risk in just over five weeks\u2019 time, the cabinet didn\u2019t even discuss Brexit last week. Ministers talk about plans and negotiations, but sound like they are praising the emperor\u2019s new clothes, not daring to admit the emperor is stark naked.</p> <p>That is why we have published a cross-party bill which would force the prime minister to take key decisions by the middle of March, rather than taking brinkmanship games right up to the line. If a deal isn\u2019t approved by 13 March, she would have to choose whether she wants the default option to be no-deal or whether \u2013 and for how long \u2013 to request an extension of article 50, and parliament will get to vote on her choice. It provides a chance to pause for breath if we have run out of time, and a chance for the prime minister to finally admit that her approach isn\u2019t working and reset the debate.</p> <p>The bill doesn\u2019t revoke article 50, block Brexit or resolve the question of what kind of deal we should have. It is just a commonsense safeguard to prevent a last-minute crisis or no-deal by accident on 29 March. The government isn\u2019t behaving responsibly, so MPs of all parties will have to do so, so that we can try to find a sensible way through the chaos before it is too late.</p> <p>\u2022 Yvette Cooper is the Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "With less than six weeks to go until Brexit, our country is drifting without any idea of where we are heading or whether we are about to crash. The prime minister seems determined to leave everything to a last-minute crisis in the final few days of March, and content to risk no-deal, despite the damage it would do. But this is a terrible way to make decisions and an irresponsible way to govern. If she cannot resolve things soon, we need some parliamentary safeguards in place instead. Already even the threat of no-deal is causing huge problems. Businesses don\u2019t know what to do about their April orders. Leading British manufacturers said last week that they were spending tens of millions of pounds on preparing for no-deal, but were hoping the money would be wasted. Police officers don\u2019t know if European arrest warrants they have issued for criminals will be torn up overnight. I want to see a workable deal that supports manufacturing and can sustain a consensus. But the prime minister\u2019s refusal to change her red lines, her refusal even to consider a customs union, and her determination to pander only to the hardline European Research Group within her own party make me deeply worried. The votes last week show that the ERG will not be satisfied with any sensible plan. Its members advocate no-deal, but they won\u2019t be the ones who suffer if food prices go up as a result of WTO tariffs and border delays to food, and they won\u2019t be the ones who are hit if manufacturing jobs are lost. The government has a basic responsibility to keep us safe, to make sure the poorest families can afford food in the shops, or that patients can get their medicines, or that our businesses can trade. Yet, even with all those things potentially at risk in just over five weeks\u2019 time, the cabinet didn\u2019t even discuss Brexit last week. Ministers talk about plans and negotiations, but sound like they are praising the emperor\u2019s new clothes, not daring to admit the emperor is stark naked. That is why we have published a cross-party bill which would force the prime minister to take key decisions by the middle of March, rather than taking brinkmanship games right up to the line. If a deal isn\u2019t approved by 13 March, she would have to choose whether she wants the default option to be no-deal or whether \u2013 and for how long \u2013 to request an extension of article 50, and parliament will get to vote on her choice. It provides a chance to pause for breath if we have run out of time, and a chance for the prime minister to finally admit that her approach isn\u2019t working and reset the debate. The bill doesn\u2019t revoke article 50, block Brexit or resolve the question of what kind of deal we should have. It is just a commonsense safeguard to prevent a last-minute crisis or no-deal by accident on 29 March. The government isn\u2019t behaving responsibly, so MPs of all parties will have to do so, so that we can try to find a sensible way through the chaos before it is too late. \u2022 Yvette Cooper is the Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford",

      "body": "<p>Taking its inspiration from a posthumous 2012 <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2012/08/marie-colvin-private-war\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair</a></em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2012/08/marie-colvin-private-war\" title=\"\"> profile by Marie Brenner</a>, this narrative feature debut from celebrated documentary-maker Matthew Heineman casts Rosamund Pike as the renowned American journalist Marie Colvin, who risked her life to report from the front line, and seven years ago paid the ultimate price. \u201cWhy is the world not here?\u201d was Colvin\u2019s repeated question as she ventured into the most deadly \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 areas of conflict. The answer seems simple: where Colvin felt an unstoppable need to witness and report on \u201cthe truth\u201d, others often feared to follow.</p> <p>Heineman\u2019s film opens and closes in Homs, the besieged Syrian city that Colvin memorably described as \u201ca ghost town, echoing with the sound of shelling and the crack of sniper fire\u201d, in which terrorised civilians were cut off from supplies and medical care. As cinematographer Robert Richardson\u2019s camera rises from the rubble like an ascending spirit, we hear Colvin\u2019s disembodied voice ruminating upon her legacy, and concluding that \u201cI cared enough to go to these places and write, in some way, something that would make someone else care as much about it as I did at the time\u201d.</p> <p>From here, we spiral back a decade, to Colvin\u2019s home life in London, thence to Sri Lanka where, in 2001, she lost an eye in a grenade attack. Undaunted, Colvin adopts the black eye patch that would become a badge of defiance, and heads back into the fray. Teaming up with soldier-turned-photographer Paul Conroy (Jamie Dornan), she travels to Fallujah in Iraq, uncovering a mass grave full of victims of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. Haunted by PTSD (variously subdued by medical treatment and alcohol), Colvin continues to be drawn to danger zones, putting her life on the line in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, while declaring that \u201cfear comes later\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upPq_HsC4AI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/upPq_HsC4AI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upPq_HsC4AI\">Watch a trailer for A Private War.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Described by its director not as a biopic but, rather, \u201ca psychological portrait of Marie Colvin\u201d, this impassioned if occasionally contrived drama clearly draws upon Heineman\u2019s experiences in making <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/cartel-land-review-alarming-account-mexican-drug-vigilantes\" title=\"\">Cartel Land</a></em>, his expos\u00e9 of Mexico\u2019s terrifying drug gangs, and, more significantly, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/23/city-of-ghosts-film-raqqa-is-being-slaughtered-silently-syria-islamic-state\" title=\"\">City of Ghosts, </a></em>which followed the heroic work of Raqqa\u2019s citizen journalists \u2013 attention-grabbing documentaries that, like Colvin\u2019s work, strove to put a human face on distant suffering.</p> <p>Certainly, <em>A Private War</em> gives powerful voice to the plight of the innocent victims of conflict, such as the Syrian refugees who serve as extras in key scenes, and whose stories are recounted with chilling, heartbreaking authenticity. But Heineman is also focused on Colvin\u2019s inner struggles, raising age-old questions of risk-addiction while finding something deeper and more altruistic in his subject\u2019s motives.</p> <p>Pike throws herself into the central role with tangible conviction, perfectly capturing what Brenner called Colvin\u2019s \u201cAmerican whiskey tone\u201d, and relishing the contradictions of a character who carried a copy of Martha Gellhorn\u2019s collected war writings <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1986/apr/03/politics\" title=\"\">The Face of War</a></em> while expressing a \u201cdefiant preference\u201d for La Perla underwear.</p> <p>The script by Arash Amel, whose credits include the execrable <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/08/grace-of-monaco-nicole-kidman-film-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Grace of Monaco</a></em>, is less sure-footed, conjuring none-too-subtle battles between lust for life and death wish (\u201cYou are like a moth to a bloody flame!\u201d declares Greg Wise, playing a fictionalised husband) while staking out the key events of Colvin\u2019s career.

      "bodyText": "Taking its inspiration from a posthumous 2012 Vanity Fair profile by Marie Brenner, this narrative feature debut from celebrated documentary-maker Matthew Heineman casts Rosamund Pike as the renowned American journalist Marie Colvin, who risked her life to report from the front line, and seven years ago paid the ultimate price. \u201cWhy is the world not here?\u201d was Colvin\u2019s repeated question as she ventured into the most deadly \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 areas of conflict. The answer seems simple: where Colvin felt an unstoppable need to witness and report on \u201cthe truth\u201d, others often feared to follow. Heineman\u2019s film opens and closes in Homs, the besieged Syrian city that Colvin memorably described as \u201ca ghost town, echoing with the sound of shelling and the crack of sniper fire\u201d, in which terrorised civilians were cut off from supplies and medical care. As cinematographer Robert Richardson\u2019s camera rises from the rubble like an ascending spirit, we hear Colvin\u2019s disembodied voice ruminating upon her legacy, and concluding that \u201cI cared enough to go to these places and write, in some way, something that would make someone else care as much about it as I did at the time\u201d. From here, we spiral back a decade, to Colvin\u2019s home life in London, thence to Sri Lanka where, in 2001, she lost an eye in a grenade attack. Undaunted, Colvin adopts the black eye patch that would become a badge of defiance, and heads back into the fray. Teaming up with soldier-turned-photographer Paul Conroy (Jamie Dornan), she travels to Fallujah in Iraq, uncovering a mass grave full of victims of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. Haunted by PTSD (variously subdued by medical treatment and alcohol), Colvin continues to be drawn to danger zones, putting her life on the line in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, while declaring that \u201cfear comes later\u201d. Described by its director not as a biopic but, rather, \u201ca psychological portrait of Marie Colvin\u201d, this impassioned if occasionally contrived drama clearly draws upon Heineman\u2019s experiences in making Cartel Land, his expos\u00e9 of Mexico\u2019s terrifying drug gangs, and, more significantly, City of Ghosts, which followed the heroic work of Raqqa\u2019s citizen journalists \u2013 attention-grabbing documentaries that, like Colvin\u2019s work, strove to put a human face on distant suffering. Certainly, A Private War gives powerful voice to the plight of the innocent victims of conflict, such as the Syrian refugees who serve as extras in key scenes, and whose stories are recounted with chilling, heartbreaking authenticity. But Heineman is also focused on Colvin\u2019s inner struggles, raising age-old questions of risk-addiction while finding something deeper and more altruistic in his subject\u2019s motives. Pike throws herself into the central role with tangible conviction, perfectly capturing what Brenner called Colvin\u2019s \u201cAmerican whiskey tone\u201d, and relishing the contradictions of a character who carried a copy of Martha Gellhorn\u2019s collected war writings The Face of War while expressing a \u201cdefiant preference\u201d for La Perla underwear. The script by Arash Amel, whose credits include the execrable Grace of Monaco, is less sure-footed, conjuring none-too-subtle battles between lust for life and death wish (\u201cYou are like a moth to a bloody flame!\u201d declares Greg Wise, playing a fictionalised husband) while staking out the key events of Colvin\u2019s career. An on-screen countdown device (\u201cLondon, England, 2001, 11 years before Homs\u201d; \u201cMarjah, Afghanistan, 2009, three years before Homs\u201d) strikes a queasy note of predestination that sits uneasily with Colvin\u2019s determination to take control of her own life. Yet Pike\u2019s performance is gutsy enough to smooth over the cracks, pulling the audience into the drama even as cliches contrive to push them away.

She is getting home on her own, native wit condensed in her determined face. Sun gilds the distant buildings, but she seems to live in a foreground of grimy shadows \u2013 young and yet prematurely old, the pompom on her hat a frivolous betrayal of her toughness. She shoots a dark glance at the photographer.</p> <p><strong>Diane Arbus</strong> (1923-71) saw the street as a land of secrets, each passing figure properly mysterious. Roaming about with her old 35mm camera, she shows New Yorkers exactly this way. A woman in costly furs stares back at her, startled, barely holding herself together. A young mother carrying her child appears as grave as the Madonna in a Piet\u00e0. And a transfixing image of a taxi waiting at the lights is a miniature travelling theatre. Inside, the almost illegible figure of a man turns away from his female companion, who is furiously biting her nails as she smokes. The driver, noticing Arbus, seems equally bemused by the photographer outside, crouching down with her lens, and the tension inside his vehicle.</p> <p>This image, one of a hundred in the Hayward\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/diane-arbus-beginning\" title=\"\">tremendous exhibition</a>, was only discovered after Arbus\u2019s suicide at 48.

Arbus\u2019s father was a wealthy furrier, and she is always noticing the way Fifth Avenue dames hide inside their animal skins, just as the tattooed man wears the inkings on his torso like a jacket. He looks back at Arbus from the eyeholes of a Dracula mask drawn on his face \u2013 perfectly insouciant, as if it was quite usual in 1961 to sit at the bar half-naked.</p> <p>What strikes, from first to last, is this intense exchange on either side of the lens. Arbus doesn\u2019t just stare at these people, she compels their stare in return. The kid with the toy gun trains his sights on her from the middle of a throng; the woman at the pastry counter, surreptitiously chewing as she opens her purse, gives her a guilty glare; an old couple in Central Park look ready to shoo her away \u2013 Arbus has caught them, you feel, in a typical moment of ire.</p> <p>Some of these early subjects became famous in her lifetime \u2013 the raging nutter in Times Square, the identical twins with their dark dresses and luminous eyes, prefiguring the sinister girls in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/shining-kubrick-horror\" title=\"\">The Shining</a></em>. Others were barely known. A beautiful photograph of a dwarf in his hotel room, luxuriously handsome and raffish, but with a lifetime\u2019s hardship in his eyes, was only descried by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/29/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a> in her <a href=\"http://www.susansontag.com/SusanSontag/books/onPhotography.shtml\" title=\"\">notorious attack</a> on Arbus after the photographer\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cIn photographing dwarfs, you don\u2019t get majesty and beauty,\u201d Sontag insisted, \u201cyou get dwarfs.\u201d The untruth of this is apparent in this marvellous portrait. Arbus observed that there was always far more to know, that each person is infinitely more than their face. In these early photographs she does not capture her sitters so much as free them into their full force of personality.</p> <p>The Arbus exhibition \u2013 brilliantly designed \u2013 is a shadow forest of pillars in which each spotlit image is encountered by chance, just as you might come across its subject in an alley. At <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/don-mccullin\" title=\"\">Tate Britain</a>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/don-mccullin\" title=\"\">Don McCullin</a></strong>\u2019s lifetime retrospective unfolds through 23 chronological sections, with more works than I have ever seen in a solo show. The onslaught is as harrowing as it should be, asking you to keep on looking, not to tear your eyes away from the starving Biafran child or the dying Cambodian peasant for the more local horrors of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The urgency is stupendous \u2013 every time. And if nobody can truly take in every single image with the same degree of shock and compassion then it is hardly McCullin\u2019s fault.

      "bodyText": "It is 1957, and a girl clutching schoolbooks to her small body steps from the gutter to the sidewalk of an empty New York street. She is getting home on her own, native wit condensed in her determined face. Sun gilds the distant buildings, but she seems to live in a foreground of grimy shadows \u2013 young and yet prematurely old, the pompom on her hat a frivolous betrayal of her toughness. She shoots a dark glance at the photographer. Diane Arbus (1923-71) saw the street as a land of secrets, each passing figure properly mysterious. Roaming about with her old 35mm camera, she shows New Yorkers exactly this way. A woman in costly furs stares back at her, startled, barely holding herself together. A young mother carrying her child appears as grave as the Madonna in a Piet\u00e0. And a transfixing image of a taxi waiting at the lights is a miniature travelling theatre. Inside, the almost illegible figure of a man turns away from his female companion, who is furiously biting her nails as she smokes. The driver, noticing Arbus, seems equally bemused by the photographer outside, crouching down with her lens, and the tension inside his vehicle. This image, one of a hundred in the Hayward\u2019s tremendous exhibition, was only discovered after Arbus\u2019s suicide at 48. It comes from a cache of unpublished photographs begun in the late 1950s, the start of her independent career after a decade working with her husband, and before the classic photographs that made her one of the great names of American art. To describe these images as a revelation would be true, but mere understatement. Many have never been shown here before. What they give is the strongest sense of Arbus as a lone soul out in the city, fixing upon the strangeness everywhere around her with a fierce and yet empathetic eye. Here are people too small for their uniforms \u2013 the cinema usher, frail and exhausted as a Soutine bellhop inside his oversized coat \u2013 or too large for this world, such as the Jewish giant towering over his elderly parents, who look up with palpable anxiety.

In practice, in ENO\u2019s staging, no violent death is more poised or balletic than Akhnaten\u2019s, no insurrection more sensuously attenuated.

Its conceit \u2013 the woman never touches the ground, for 17 whole minutes \u2013 may verge on the contrived, but is saved by the power and rightness of the simple embraces that break up the acrobatics necessary to keep one person ingeniously supported by another. These embraces give the work \u2013 a meditation on the unknowability of another\u2019s feelings \u2013 its heart. There is such piercing emotional truth in a lovers\u2019 clasp of hands, or the quiet pressing of cheek to cheek at just the right moment.</p> <p>The evening\u2019s new works, a pair of interwoven duets \u2013 <em>In Between Us Is Me</em> (for two men) and <em>The Secret of Having It All</em> (two women) \u2013 show Cousins exploring new territory, both in terms of emotional range and the techniques he uses.</p> <p><em>In Between Us Is Me</em> opens as if it were a companion piece to <em>Within Her Eyes</em>, with a close, flowing duet in which Georges Hann and Rhys Dennis never actually touch. When the men do finally make contact, we are plunged into a different atmosphere.

      "bodyText": "In this triple bill at DanceEast, the London-based choreographer James Cousins revisits Within Her Eyes \u2013 his 2012 breakthrough work for two dancers that earned him a place on the GCSE dance syllabus, no less \u2013 and adds depth to his exploration of the duet form. Within Her Eyes stands the test of time as a smart little piece. Its conceit \u2013 the woman never touches the ground, for 17 whole minutes \u2013 may verge on the contrived, but is saved by the power and rightness of the simple embraces that break up the acrobatics necessary to keep one person ingeniously supported by another. These embraces give the work \u2013 a meditation on the unknowability of another\u2019s feelings \u2013 its heart. There is such piercing emotional truth in a lovers\u2019 clasp of hands, or the quiet pressing of cheek to cheek at just the right moment. The evening\u2019s new works, a pair of interwoven duets \u2013 In Between Us Is Me (for two men) and The Secret of Having It All (two women) \u2013 show Cousins exploring new territory, both in terms of emotional range and the techniques he uses. In Between Us Is Me opens as if it were a companion piece to Within Her Eyes, with a close, flowing duet in which Georges Hann and Rhys Dennis never actually touch. When the men do finally make contact, we are plunged into a different atmosphere. This is the private world of one character\u2019s mental space \u2013 a glaring box, like a prison cell (clever lighting design by Jackie Shemesh), against whose \u201cwalls\u201d he hurls himself in a frenzy of self-doubt that makes all too clear the difficulties this couple will face in being and staying together.

      "body": "<p>High noon. Mexican standoff. Last chance saloon. There\u2019s been no end of opportunities to deploy metaphors drawn from the Wild West to describe Brexit. This is kind of appropriate since the benighted enterprise was triggered by a bunch of cowboys and peddled by snake-oil salesmen.</p> <p>In another way, talk of shootouts and showdowns is a bad journalistic habit of which I\u2019ve been occasionally guilty myself. Describing Brexit in these dramatic terms suggests we are about to reach some kind of resolution and the end credits can finally roll. Yet we never do. Every exchange of gunfire at the Not O.K. Corral is followed by the grim realisation that the plot has not been advanced at all. We are still stuck where we have been marooned for months: without a deal that parliament will pass and without a proved majority for any alternative. In Brexitland, it is always crisis and never catharsis.</p> <p>What goes for the process is true also of the woman supposed to be in charge of ensuring that Britain departs the EU in a non-chaotic fashion. I heard a Conservative MP remark recently that the prime minister was \u201cin the last chance saloon\u201d. Calamity May has been sitting in that unhappy establishment for so long that the bar has long since run out of whiskey and the pianist is covered in cobwebs. More than a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/20/its-compass-smashed-the-ghost-ship-brexit-sails-into-ever-darker-waters\" title=\"\">she went down</a> to a historic parliamentary defeat, and after another humiliation at the hands of MPs in the past few days, Mrs May is still trying to sell the deal the Commons rejected by an unprecedented margin and the EU says it won\u2019t rewrite to please the Brexit ultras.</p> <p>Step back to look at the big picture and you can see that Britain is trapped in a grotesque situation. There are just 40 days left before one of the world\u2019s top 10 economies is due to terminate an intricately complex 45-year partnership with its closest neighbours. The leaders of this country have devoted 32 months to negotiating the withdrawal. And we still have absolutely no idea under what arrangements, if any, Britain will be trading and dealing with its neighbours in the very near future. The possibility that we might crash out at 11pm on 29 March with no agreement at all remains a live one.</p> <p>This limbo status applies to much of the rest of the world as well because our commercial relationships with other countries have been managed through membership of the EU. Britain has 69 trade agreements with non-EU states that the government hopes to \u201croll over\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/13/brexit-uk-trade-deals-eu\" title=\"\">Liam Fox</a> has had to admit that all the time he has spent in airport VIP lounges has so far yielded only a small minority of these vital arrangements, covering less than a seventh of the \u00a3117bn of British trade with the countries involved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e66060ce8e2f629fe38cfbefa83a139e30b50592\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66060ce8e2f629fe38cfbefa83a139e30b50592/0_166_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We can all see what Mrs May is up to. There\u2019s no secret cunning about her plan.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the very few consolations of Brexit is the regular bulletins of failure that have to be issued by its leading proponents. The international trade secretary and evangelist for a \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d has agreed terms with the Swiss and the Israelis. Oh, and the Faroe Islands. You can\u2019t get much more \u201cglobal\u201d than the Faroe Islands, can you? He hasn\u2019t secured agreements with such non-trivial countries as South Korea and Japan. Cargo ships will this week depart British ports for the far east, and vice versa, and their captains will have no idea what terms and tariffs will apply to their goods when they reach their destinations. They may be told they can\u2019t even be landed.</p> <p>We can all see what Mrs May is up to. There\u2019s no secret cunning about her plan. Despite the manifold weaknesses of her position, she still has control of the process and is using that power to take Britain closer and closer to the cliff edge of a no-deal exit. She persists with this perilous gamble in the belief that, when MPs are staring into the abyss, enough will be scared into backing her deal. We should not discount the possibility that this might work if the EU offers enough tweaks, some of the Brexit ultras blink and sufficient Labour MPs can be seduced with promises of cash bungs to their constituencies. If she pulls off a late win in this fashion, some will briefly hail her as a tactical genius. Yet even if she succeeds in railroading her unloved deal through the Commons, this will guarantee terrible trouble further down the line. And if she fails? Britain will be left dangling over the cliff edge.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn was not wrong to say the prime minister \u201ccontinues to recklessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/12/theresa-may-asks-mps-to-hold-their-nerve-on-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">run down the clock</a>\u201d. What he did not say is that he is complicit in the deliberate exhaustion of time. I mean this in two ways. A different type of Labour leader would have been able to reach over to some of the moderates on the Tory benches to mould a better outcome. But Mr Corbyn is not a man who will work with any kind of Tory and he is not the kind of Labour leader any Tory will trust. Most importantly, he doesn\u2019t want to stop Brexit. He wants a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d that he can then condemn. His endless prevarications are designed to avoid committing to the second referendum that the vast majority of his members and most Labour supporters yearn for, but he will avoid if he possibly can.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The clock would not be running down so dangerously without the active or passive connivance of MPs as a body.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A lot of the blame for Britain\u2019s drift towards disaster lies with the cynical manoeuvres of the two main party leaders, but culpability doesn\u2019t entirely rest with them. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn are, in the end, just two people. There are another 648 MPs and each bears responsibility for how he or she acts \u2013 or doesn\u2019t. The clock would not be running down so dangerously without the active or passive connivance of MPs as a body. A large majority grasp that continuing uncertainty is racking up an ever higher bill in lost investment and relocated jobs. Even if the crash-out scenario doesn\u2019t ultimately materialise, the threat of it is has already forced many companies to make decisions that will be irreversibly damaging to the country\u2019s future prosperity. Business <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/spending-tightest-in-a-decade-as-brexit-hits-a4063371.html\" title=\"\">investment has fallen</a> for four consecutive quarters. Most MPs also know that a no-deal outcome threatens to be terrible for many of their constituents. Any parliamentarian capable of reading a calendar can see that we are running horribly short of time to avoid a calamity Brexit. And yet, for a variety of reasons, mainly timidity in the face of this national emergency, the latent majority in the Commons for a non-disastrous outcome has not been willing to act.</p> <p>Parliament has declined opportunities to give binding instructions to the government that there cannot be a no-deal outcome. When recently offered the choice, MPs voted against taking the process out of Mrs May\u2019s hands. Last week, parliament effectively decided to give her another fortnight to try to fettle her agreement, even though she still has not told MPs, and perhaps does not even know herself, what changes she is going to seek when she flies to Brussels this week. So it is not just the two party leaders who are running down the clock \u2013 it is also parliament as a collective.</p> <p>The senior teams in both the main parties should be searching their consciences. The shadow cabinet has not asserted itself by demanding that Labour satisfies the wishes of its members and throws its weight behind a second referendum. They privately point the finger at Mr Corbyn\u2019s Eurosceptic inner circle who, as one shadow cabinet member put it to me, have the leader \u201cunder close guard\u201d. Rather than blaming others to excuse their own failure, senior Labour politicians should be acting.</p> <p>The sensible ministers in the cabinet know that this nightmarish limbo is hurting the economy and wounding Britain\u2019s reputation with the rest of the world. Growth last year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/07/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-cuts-growth-forecast\" title=\"\">its weakest</a> since the financial crash. Senior ministers also understand that a no-deal outcome will be a catastrophe. Yet they have so far proved incapable of forcing a change of strategy on the prime minister. There have been regular predictions that at least six members of the cabinet are <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1087671/Brexit-news-update-Theresa-May-no-deal-cabinet-resignations-Dominic-Grieve\" title=\"\">poised to resign</a> if Mrs May doesn\u2019t change course. Yet each time they have been presented with an opportunity to act, they have allowed it to pass. The generous way to describe these ministers is as people waiting for the right moment. The unkind way to categorise them is as ditherers and cowards.</p> <p>The next deadline for everyone\u2019s diary is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/12/what-next-after-theresa-mays-appeal-for-more-time-on-brexit\" title=\"\">27 February</a> when Mrs May will have to report to MPs on what she got out of her latest talks with the EU and there will be another chance for parliament to act. There is fighting talk from the sensibles in the government that this will be the moment when they will finally assert themselves, and by quitting if necessary, to create a majority to halt the slide towards a catastrophe Brexit. High noon approaches. Again.</p> <p>To me, it feels a lot more like one minute to midnight.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "High noon. Mexican standoff. Last chance saloon. There\u2019s been no end of opportunities to deploy metaphors drawn from the Wild West to describe Brexit. This is kind of appropriate since the benighted enterprise was triggered by a bunch of cowboys and peddled by snake-oil salesmen. In another way, talk of shootouts and showdowns is a bad journalistic habit of which I\u2019ve been occasionally guilty myself. Describing Brexit in these dramatic terms suggests we are about to reach some kind of resolution and the end credits can finally roll. Yet we never do. Every exchange of gunfire at the Not O.K. Corral is followed by the grim realisation that the plot has not been advanced at all. We are still stuck where we have been marooned for months: without a deal that parliament will pass and without a proved majority for any alternative. In Brexitland, it is always crisis and never catharsis. What goes for the process is true also of the woman supposed to be in charge of ensuring that Britain departs the EU in a non-chaotic fashion. I heard a Conservative MP remark recently that the prime minister was \u201cin the last chance saloon\u201d. Calamity May has been sitting in that unhappy establishment for so long that the bar has long since run out of whiskey and the pianist is covered in cobwebs. More than a month after she went down to a historic parliamentary defeat, and after another humiliation at the hands of MPs in the past few days, Mrs May is still trying to sell the deal the Commons rejected by an unprecedented margin and the EU says it won\u2019t rewrite to please the Brexit ultras. Step back to look at the big picture and you can see that Britain is trapped in a grotesque situation. There are just 40 days left before one of the world\u2019s top 10 economies is due to terminate an intricately complex 45-year partnership with its closest neighbours. The leaders of this country have devoted 32 months to negotiating the withdrawal. And we still have absolutely no idea under what arrangements, if any, Britain will be trading and dealing with its neighbours in the very near future. The possibility that we might crash out at 11pm on 29 March with no agreement at all remains a live one. This limbo status applies to much of the rest of the world as well because our commercial relationships with other countries have been managed through membership of the EU. Britain has 69 trade agreements with non-EU states that the government hopes to \u201croll over\u201d. Liam Fox has had to admit that all the time he has spent in airport VIP lounges has so far yielded only a small minority of these vital arrangements, covering less than a seventh of the \u00a3117bn of British trade with the countries involved. One of the very few consolations of Brexit is the regular bulletins of failure that have to be issued by its leading proponents. The international trade secretary and evangelist for a \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d has agreed terms with the Swiss and the Israelis. Oh, and the Faroe Islands. You can\u2019t get much more \u201cglobal\u201d than the Faroe Islands, can you? He hasn\u2019t secured agreements with such non-trivial countries as South Korea and Japan. Cargo ships will this week depart British ports for the far east, and vice versa, and their captains will have no idea what terms and tariffs will apply to their goods when they reach their destinations. They may be told they can\u2019t even be landed. We can all see what Mrs May is up to. There\u2019s no secret cunning about her plan. Despite the manifold weaknesses of her position, she still has control of the process and is using that power to take Britain closer and closer to the cliff edge of a no-deal exit. She persists with this perilous gamble in the belief that, when MPs are staring into the abyss, enough will be scared into backing her deal. We should not discount the possibility that this might work if the EU offers enough tweaks, some of the Brexit ultras blink and sufficient Labour MPs can be seduced with promises of cash bungs to their constituencies. If she pulls off a late win in this fashion, some will briefly hail her as a tactical genius. Yet even if she succeeds in railroading her unloved deal through the Commons, this will guarantee terrible trouble further down the line. And if she fails? Britain will be left dangling over the cliff edge. Jeremy Corbyn was not wrong to say the prime minister \u201ccontinues to recklessly run down the clock\u201d. What he did not say is that he is complicit in the deliberate exhaustion of time. I mean this in two ways. A different type of Labour leader would have been able to reach over to some of the moderates on the Tory benches to mould a better outcome. But Mr Corbyn is not a man who will work with any kind of Tory and he is not the kind of Labour leader any Tory will trust. Most importantly, he doesn\u2019t want to stop Brexit. He wants a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d that he can then condemn. His endless prevarications are designed to avoid committing to the second referendum that the vast majority of his members and most Labour supporters yearn for, but he will avoid if he possibly can. A lot of the blame for Britain\u2019s drift towards disaster lies with the cynical manoeuvres of the two main party leaders, but culpability doesn\u2019t entirely rest with them. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn are, in the end, just two people. There are another 648 MPs and each bears responsibility for how he or she acts \u2013 or doesn\u2019t. The clock would not be running down so dangerously without the active or passive connivance of MPs as a body. A large majority grasp that continuing uncertainty is racking up an ever higher bill in lost investment and relocated jobs. Even if the crash-out scenario doesn\u2019t ultimately materialise, the threat of it is has already forced many companies to make decisions that will be irreversibly damaging to the country\u2019s future prosperity. Business investment has fallen for four consecutive quarters. Most MPs also know that a no-deal outcome threatens to be terrible for many of their constituents. Any parliamentarian capable of reading a calendar can see that we are running horribly short of time to avoid a calamity Brexit. And yet, for a variety of reasons, mainly timidity in the face of this national emergency, the latent majority in the Commons for a non-disastrous outcome has not been willing to act. Parliament has declined opportunities to give binding instructions to the government that there cannot be a no-deal outcome. When recently offered the choice, MPs voted against taking the process out of Mrs May\u2019s hands. Last week, parliament effectively decided to give her another fortnight to try to fettle her agreement, even though she still has not told MPs, and perhaps does not even know herself, what changes she is going to seek when she flies to Brussels this week. So it is not just the two party leaders who are running down the clock \u2013 it is also parliament as a collective. The senior teams in both the main parties should be searching their consciences. The shadow cabinet has not asserted itself by demanding that Labour satisfies the wishes of its members and throws its weight behind a second referendum. They privately point the finger at Mr Corbyn\u2019s Eurosceptic inner circle who, as one shadow cabinet member put it to me, have the leader \u201cunder close guard\u201d. Rather than blaming others to excuse their own failure, senior Labour politicians should be acting. The sensible ministers in the cabinet know that this nightmarish limbo is hurting the economy and wounding Britain\u2019s reputation with the rest of the world. Growth last year was its weakest since the financial crash. Senior ministers also understand that a no-deal outcome will be a catastrophe. Yet they have so far proved incapable of forcing a change of strategy on the prime minister. There have been regular predictions that at least six members of the cabinet are poised to resign if Mrs May doesn\u2019t change course. Yet each time they have been presented with an opportunity to act, they have allowed it to pass. The generous way to describe these ministers is as people waiting for the right moment. The unkind way to categorise them is as ditherers and cowards. The next deadline for everyone\u2019s diary is 27 February when Mrs May will have to report to MPs on what she got out of her latest talks with the EU and there will be another chance for parliament to act. There is fighting talk from the sensibles in the government that this will be the moment when they will finally assert themselves, and by quitting if necessary, to create a majority to halt the slide towards a catastrophe Brexit. High noon approaches. Again. To me, it feels a lot more like one minute to midnight. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "Renting a property in the UK can be a bleak business. The average monthly rent rose to \u00a3932 last month and in London it is even more expensive at \u00a31,588, according to new figures. It is of little surprise then that more young people are choosing to stay in the family home. Recent research showed nearly a million more young adults live with their parents than was the case two decades ago. The proportion of people aged 20 to 34 who live with their parents has risen from 19% in 1997 to 25% in 2017 \u2013 some 3.4 million people, according to the thinktank Civitas. With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, let alone the means to save towards a deposit, some are now choosing alternatives. The older choice Office administrator Tina Gotla-Aluri, 42, was struggling to cope with the \u00a3950 a month she was paying for her house share in Putney, south-west London, when a friend suggested Share and Care Homeshare, which matches older homeowners who have a spare room with people who can offer practical help in exchange. She now lives in Putney with a man in his 90s and pays \u00a3180 a month to the scheme. In return, Gotla-Aluri provides companionship, goes food shopping, and cooks meals. \u201cHe is quite well travelled and food is one of the things we have bonded over,\u201d she says. \u201cI cook British food like Sunday dinners and sometimes Indian or Moroccan food. It\u2019s mutually beneficial.\u201d She says the lower rent has made her less anxious about money. \u201cIt has given me breathing space. It was very stressful. I was only working to pay rent, and as an administrator I don\u2019t make much. I hardly had anything left for food and travel. It was very depressing, but now I can go to the cinema and out with friends.\u201d Hitting the road When Michael Hayne, 41, a delivery driver from Mansfield, split up with his wife after 10 years of marriage with two daughters, he sofa-surfed at various family members\u2019 homes for about six months because he couldn\u2019t afford to rent. \u201cI worked out it was about \u00a31,100 to get a house to rent plus bills,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed somewhere for the kids to stay and didn\u2019t want a bedsit. I realised I wouldn\u2019t have much money left after paying child maintenance and childcare costs.\u201d He was inspired by reading about a couple who sold up and toured the world in a van. \u201cI took out a loan and bought a Mercedes Sprinter van for \u00a32,500 and spent weeks stripping it out and turning it into a home.\u201d His van includes beds for when his daughters stay, a four-burner cooker and storage at the back for his bike. \u201cI wanted a van because it\u2019s cheaper than a camper van, which can cost upwards of \u00a310,000, plus I like the style of a van. It\u2019s a blank canvas that I can build myself. For example, I made a sleeping area for my girls, and I can change it around.\u201d The cost of running the van, including vehicle tax and breakdown insurance but not petrol, sets him back about \u00a370 a month. Hayne has lived in the van for a year and parks for free in country lanes and near industrial estates. He showers at a local gym. \u201cThe girls love it. They\u2019ve been to Scotland, Whitby, Scarborough and the Norfolk coast. Not paying rent frees up the funds to do those things.\u201d Sitting it out While some people house-sit for free to get a taste of luxury or a different life for a few weeks, designer Jennifer Hamley, 39, and her husband, Ben, 37, have turned it into a way to live rent-free. \u201cWe decided to try house-sitting after we came back from a year living in Bali,\u201d says Hamley. \u201cRental prices had escalated and a friend suggested it.

The first ball will be bowled at 2.45pm local time.</p> <p>Despite a quarter of Big Bash franchises residing in Victoria it\u2019s taken until the eighth instalment of the BBL for the trophy to find its home in Melbourne. It just remains to be seen whether the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBL/status/1096962521892761605\">shiny glowing crucible thingumajig</a> is dressed in red or green ribbons.</p> <p>By virtue of finishing higher on the ladder (second place, compared to the Stars\u2019 fourth) Renegades have home ground advantage. This means today\u2019s match is being played at Docklands Stadium, a venue that has proven difficult to score at this season, creating a series of chaotic contests. That is of course until Friday\u2019s semi-final when Renegades timed their high-scoring chase to perfection.</p> <p>The venue\u2019s old dry drop-ins have allowed Renegades\u2019 bowling attack to shine. Kane Richardson is the competition\u2019s leading wicket-taker, while Cameron Boyce has the fourth-best economy rate for bowlers that have sent down at least 40 overs. By contrast only one Renegade batsman, Sam Harper, features in the top-20 run scorers. <br></p> <p>For much of the summer the Stars looked unlikely candidates to make the postseason, and form suggested the powerful Hurricanes would blow them away in the semis, but individuals have stood up at crucial times. Daniel Worrall\u2019s performance with the ball in Hobart was impressive enough to spark talk of an Ashes call-up, while for the second game in a row skipper Glenn Maxwell showed on his day he is unplayable. Before that the regular season was all about Marcus Stoinis, averaging almost 55 with the bat the all-rounder also snared the second-most wickets for the Stars.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a long old season, and the short turnaround between the semis and final hasn\u2019t done the hype machine any favours, but around 40,000 fans are expected to turn up for this one; and we all know crosstown rivalries add an extra touch of spice.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUJ_ifjKopM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eUJ_ifjKopM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Who will be the first Melbourne side to lift the Big Bash League trophy, red, or green?</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report for what was a truly remarkable Big Bash capitulation from the Stars: That\u2019s all you need from me for now. This will take some time to fully digest so keep your eyes peeled for further analysis elsewhere on the site. Congratulations Melbourne Renegades. I don\u2019t know how you did it, but you did. A guy in a short-sleeved shirt and a sleeve of tats just presented a glowing LED trophy to Aaron Finch. Lovely stuff. Christian, and the losing skipper Glenn Maxwell, have both said a few words. The Renegades are now receiving their medals in one of the better ceremonies of this kind I\u2019ve seen. 38 not out with the bat at a crucial stage in the Renegades\u2019 innings, then 2/33 with the ball - not to mention a couple of catches. If you want to win a T20 tournament, just get him in your side. Spare a thought for Eddie McGuire, two grand finals a few months apart that looked destined to go to sides he chairs... I\u2019m still struggling to process what just happened. The Stars were in control for 32 of the 40 overs. How did they capitulate so badly? 20th over: Stars 132-7 (Zampa 17, Bird 4) Dan Christian, player of the match, has the honour of sending down the glory over. Zampa rages against the dying of the light with a six and a four, but it\u2019s too little too late. One of the all-time collapses hands the Renegades the BBL08 title. 19th over: Stars 118-7 (Zampa 6, Bird 1) Gurney is too good to concede the kind of runs the Stars require, especially with tailenders at the crease. This is lap of honour stuff now for the Renegades. 28 required from the final over. 18th over: Stars 113-7 (Zampa 2, Bird 0) 89-0 after 12 overs. 113-7 after 18. Gee whizz. And the burns keep coming. This is a zinger. Full toss on leg stump - rank awful stinky delivery - and somehow Bravo contrives to lob a thick edge into the covers where White takes a simple catch. There\u2019ll be a 30for30 about the curse of the Stars, surely. The quality and experience they\u2019ve had through that organisation, the opportunities they\u2019ve created for themselves, but another season seems destined for failure, and this will hurt, a lot. This is like Oprah Winfrey giving away cars. Gotch the latest to hand the Renegades a scalp, chipping Christian straight to long-on. Marvel stadium is rocking. One can only imagine the colour of Eddie McGuire\u2019s rage face right now. Superb tight boundary-less over from Gurney. and it ends with the simple dismissal of Maddinson, ramping a delivery with no pace straight to the waiting Finch at short fine-leg. If the Stars blow this it will be an ugly autopsy. Handscomb\u2019s rush of blood second ball, Dunk not reading the room, the volume of dot balls early... this has been a self-inflicted catastrophe. What a match this has turned into. 17th over: Stars 108-5 (Gotch 2) 16th over: Stars 101-4 (Maddinson 1, Gotch 1) The Stars are now skittish at the crease, doing all they can to nudge singles but the run-rate is creeping up towards 11 rpo and they need boundaries. What an astonishing turnaround in such a short space of time. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!? Maxwell is gone now, shovelling a length delivery on leg stump up and into the hands of Harvey running in from the square leg boundary. This is barmy. Four wickets in 13 balls and the balance of power has swung wildly. Suddenly the rpo is just about ten and the Stars are without their top-order. What is happening out there!? The Stars are imploding! Following Maxwell\u2019s escape Dunk dumps Boyce straight down Christian\u2019s throat at long-off. This is definitely game on now. Around the wickets the dot balls are stacking up and the run-rate is above nine rpo. Wowee! 15th over: Stars 99-3 (Maxwell 1) Still on 0, Maxwell drives his fourth delivery to the diving White at cover but he shells a tough chance. 14th over: Stars 95-2 (Dunk 54, Maxwell 0) The crowd is suddenly into this, the Stars look a little edgy at the crease, and we could be set for a grandstand finale. One brings two! Awful awful awful batting from Peter Handscomb, charging down the pitch to Tremain, mistiming a swipe over the offside, skewing a simple catch to Christian at cover. Is this suddenly a contest? Finch\u2019s latest Hail Mary sees the ball land in Cameron Boyce\u2019s hands - and it works! Stoinis goes for the big heave-ho, picks the wrong ball and the zing bails light up. Just the second delivery in three overs from Boyce that hasn\u2019t gone for runs. 12th over: Stars 89-0 (Dunk 50, Stoinis 37) Finch returns to his strike man Richardson, desperate for that opening, but the leading wicket-taker of BBL08 cannot force a breakthrough and is now bowled out with figures of 0/27. This is becoming a very serene procession for the Stars. 11th over: Stars 77-0 (Dunk 44, Stoinis 31) The creative Gurney back into the attack with his team desperate for a breakthrough but the Stars openers know they needn\u2019t take any risks and they\u2019re content just to dab the ball around Marvel Stadium and accept the easy runs on offer. 10th over: Stars 72-0 (Dunk 40, Stoinis 30) Aaron Finch is getting visibly irate out there now, kicking the turf after failing to collect a potential run out opportunity. Stoinis makes him pay, cutting Christian for four. The Renegades have barely created a false stroke, let alone a chance so far. Routine stuff for the Stars, not the most thrilling spectacle. 9th over: Stars 63-0 (Dunk 39, Stoinis 23) Once again Boyce sends down an over of five tame singles punctuated by a monster six, this time a straight hit from the blade of Stoinis. The Stars are cruising and the tension and atmosphere is ebbing out of Marvel Stadium. 8th over: Stars 52-0 (Dunk 37, Stoinis 14) Dan Christian\u2019s turn to see if he can repeat his heroics with the bat but with the Stars in such a patient mood opportunities to force breakthroughs are hard to come by. For comparison, at the same stage of their innings the Renegades were 51/4. The Stars have this under control, for now. 7th over: Stars 47-0 (Dunk 34, Stoinis 12) Time for spin and Cameron Boyce but it does not have the desired effect for the Renegades. Five dots are accompanied by the first six of the Stars\u2019 innings, slapped lustily over midwicket by the assertive Dunk. 6th over: Stars 36-0 (Dunk 26, Stoinis 9) Richardson remains in the attack and he continues to be tight without looking overly threatening. The Stars continue to accumulate patiently, although if they stuff up this chase later on we could easily look back at this powerplay as an overly cautious waste of dot balls. 5th over: Stars 33-0 (Dunk 24, Stoinis 8) Harry Gurney is the first bowling change but there\u2019s nothing in his left-arm variations to worry the Stars openers who are happy to build into this run-chase. 4th over: Stars 29-0 (Dunk 23, Stoinis 5) For the third over out of four Dunk finds runs early in the over, three this time, setting a platform for the Stars. He backs that up with a crisp cut for four and some smart running to chip away at the Renegades\u2019 145. 3rd over: Stars 17-0 (Dunk 15, Stoinis 2) Better from Richardson, keeping the circumspect Stoinis honest with a first-class line and length. The Stars\u2019 inability to rotate the strike is a bit of a concern. There have been eight dot-balls already, many the product of a lack of intent. 2nd over: Stars 14-0 (Dunk 13, Stoinis 1) Chris Tremain shares the new ball but he suffers the same fate as Richardson, offering too much room to Dunk and his free swing of the bat sends the ball behind point for four. Dunk then almost gives his wicket away, using way too much bottom hand to a defensive prod, lobbing the ball dangerously close to mid-on. There\u2019s little strike rotation so aside from that boundary it\u2019s a decent over for the Renegades. 1st over: Stars 9-0 (Dunk 8, Stoinis 1) Four first ball! Wide length delivery from Kane Richardson, Ben Dunk throws his hands at it and the thick edge flies high and safely down to third man. The second ball is a cleaner hit but the cover drive is intercepted by the sweeper. The remainder of the over is safe accumulation. The Stars are up and running confidently. Right, the Renegades are out in the field, Marcus Stoinis and Ben Dunk are joining them, the run-chase will begin any second. The Stars will chase 146 for victory. Despite being off the pace for most of the innings the Renegades will not feel too unhappy with the state of play thanks to Tom Cooper and Dan Christian. The Stars didn\u2019t bowl exceptionally well but took wickets early and in Adam Zampa and Sandeep Lamichhane had a pair of bowlers the Gades didn\u2019t really know what to do with. A third spinner for Green Melbourne might have done even more damage. Join us shortly for the run-chase. 20th over: Renegades 145-5 (Cooper 43, Christian 38) Bravo begins the final over with an inch perfect yorker that Christian can only dig out for a single. Another yorker another single, then Christian swipes and misses a length delivery before Bravo executes another yorker that cannot be hit beyond the infield. 15 runs from 16 largely death over deliveries for Bravo, but oh boy, those numbers are dented by a mighty six from Cooper, swinging hard across the line. Another yorker looks to have wrapped up the innings but Bravo then tries to affect a run out, misses, and concedes overthrows! Somehow the Renegades make it to a competitive 145. 19th over: Renegades 133-5 (Cooper 33, Christian 36) Worrall begins his final over with a stinky wide full toss that Christian larrups over cover for four. Cooper then helps himself to six by helping a leg-stump half-volley over midwicket. Four more follows with a leg-stump full toss. Worrall ends with 0/37, figures dented by a disastrous 17-run final over. 18th over: Renegades 116-5 (Cooper 21, Christian 31) Christian knocks Bravo for a single first ball, prompting the West Indian to come around the wicket to the right-handed Cooper, finding three dot balls in a row with the awkward change of angle - length, then short, then full - superb death bowling. Cooper eventually gets off strike with a toe end to the keeper but he was a strong run out risk if Handscomb could have hit the far set of stumps. Bravo tidies up a terrific over with a single. This partnership has built a foundation for the Renegades, can they accelerate to a defendable score? 17th over: Renegades 113-5 (Cooper 20, Christian 29) Worrall returns and he begins with one-dot-one, putting the pressure on the Renegades to manufacture a boundary - and Dan Christian does exactly that! Stepping to leg he shovels out a yorker that skims just over the fingers of the leaping extra-cover sweeper for six. What a shot! Decent over for the Reds, 11 from it. Resuming our chat from pregame... 16th over: Renegades 102-5 (Cooper 17, Christian 21) Here we go! The first ball of the final 30 - all pace remember - goes for four, ramped expertly by Cooper. That\u2019s followed up by a succession of easy singles and a hard run two. 15th over: Renegades 91-5 (Cooper 11, Christian 17) The Renegades\u2019 trial by spin is over. Lamichhane finishes with 0/16 from his complement. Cooper is fortunate not to be run out but Maxwell\u2019s effort bounces over the stumps after hitting a trampoline just on the edge of the square. Expect the Gades to tee-off now in the five remaining overs of pace bowling. 14th over: Renegades 85-5 (Cooper 7, Christian 15) Zampa ends with 2/21 from his four overs. Pick of the bowlers so far despite being taken downtown in his first set of six. Renegades dealing in singles for the time being. 13th over: Renegades 80-5 (Cooper 6, Christian 11) Dwayne Bravo\u2019s turn to roll his arm over and he gets away with about the worst ball you could imagine going for a single, Cooper unable to dispatch the loopy leg-stump full toss. The luck changes soon after though, Bravo beating Christian for pace with a bumper, finding the edge, but the ball is just too high and hot for the leaping Handscomb. 12th over: Renegades 71-5 (Cooper 5, Christian 3) Well aware of the match situation Maxwell is now employing spin from both ends. Three dots, three singles from Lamichhane\u2019s third over. The Renegades are in quicksand. 11th over: Renegades 68-5 (Cooper 4, Christian 1) The Renegades are clueless against Zampa, repeatedly yorking themselves and ending up in all sorts of awkward body positions at the crease. Ricky Ponting on comms explains how the Renegades are statistically the poorest players of spin in the competition, and you can see why. Zampa\u2019s back, and boy is he back! Harvey had no idea what he was doing with that wrong \u2018un, playing down a couple of wrong lines before hearing the fateful death rattle. Superb bowling, not the best indication of Harvey\u2019s ability against leg-spin. 10th over: Renegades 65-4 (Harvey 14, Cooper 2) Back to seam for the Stars with Stoinis replacing Zampa. Mic\u2019d up in the field Ben Dunk explains how the Stars are looking to take the pace off the ball, mix up their deliveries and keep the Renegades from establishing any rhythm. It\u2019s a strategy that has worked well so far but not so much in this over with Harvey finding runs from most deliveries, including a controlled pull for four. 9th over: Renegades 57-4 (Harvey 7, Cooper 1) Better from the Renegades, Harvey sweeping Lamichhane for four then rotating the strike with Cooper to keep the scoreboard ticking over. Stars still very much on top though. 8th over: Renegades 51-4 (Harvey 2, Cooper 1) Just two runs and a wicket from Zampa\u2019s second over. Excellent comeback following the battering he took in his first over. Oh dear. This is turning into a nightmare for the Renegades. White is the latest to go, beaten all ends up by a skiddy quicker ball, the first of Zampa\u2019s second over. 7th over: Renegades 49-3 (White 12, Harvey 1) More spin, this time Lamichhane, and his wrong \u2018un beats Harvey twice in a row. A single brings White on strike but he\u2019s not interested in forcing the issue, accepting a dot and a single. Harper then almost perishes from the final ball of the over, lobbing a limp edge just short of point. This is not looking good for the Renegades. What also didn\u2019t look good was Finch absolutely battering a white Bunnings chair with his bat on his way down the race following his dismissal. 6th over: Renegades 47-3 (White 11) Finch has the bit between his teeth now, welcoming Bird to the crease for his third over by lofting him back over his head for four. White ups the ante, cutting with brute force for six over point, the ball barely climbing above head height. But hold on, what have we here? FINCH RUN OUT AT THE NON-STRIKER\u2019S END OFF BIRD\u2019S BOOT! That is wild. How unlucky can you get? White strikes a firm drive, Bird extends his right foot in his follow through, the ball clips his laces, diverts onto the stumps and Finch is a metre from his ground. That is a game turning moment. 5th over: Renegades 36-2 (Finch 8, White 5) Time for spin, and time for Finch to launch at Zampa, slapping him disdainfully over cover for four. The follow up is also destined for the fence but it clatters into the non-striker White who executes some tidy fielding for his former side. The big Bear makes up for it later with an easy as you like four over cover. The Renegades needed that over, can they build on it? 4th over: Renegades 25-2 (Finch 2, White 0) Huge partnership now for the Renegades. Two senior batsmen at the crease with a rebuilding job on their hands. The Stars haven\u2019t bowled unplayably but the occasion appears to have got to both Harris and Harper. Bird is the word (sorry, not sorry)! Harper has batted like a drunk on rollerskates in his short innings and it eventually comes to a tame end, limply mistiming a pull straight back into bowler\u2019s hands. Stars shining brightly at Marvel Stadium. 3rd over: Renegades 22-1 (Finch 1, Harper 5) Harper opens his account with a late cut-cum-outside edge that\u2019s 50-50 honours between batsman and bowler. Worrall does have a slip and a gully but they were bisected. Worrall responds with an outrageous back of the hand wrong \u2018un that Harper does well to keep out. He is a superb craftsman Worrall, the curved run-up, the old school swing, the ultra-modern varieties, and he has a huge shout declined for LBW (Harper probably just outside the line of off stump) but the Renegade No 3 should have been run out in the same motion but the shy from Bird at gully missed with the batsman miles out of his ground. Couple of let-offs for the Reds. 2nd over: Renegades 16-1 (Finch 0, Harper 0 ) That wasn\u2019t a great over from Bird but the Stars will be delighted with the early wicket. Jackson Bird shares the new ball. He\u2019s regarded as something of an Aaron Finch specialist, but a leg-bye gets the Australian white ball skipper off strike immediately. The match-up with Harris suits the Gades much better. Bird slides a couple of wides across the left-hander then drops a couple in his arc, the first slapped straight for four, the second carted to cow corner for a couple. Harris then reacts to the change in field by stepping to leg and using the width to cut for four behind point. The adrenaline eventually gets him though, Bird sending down an off-cutter that Harris tries to launch into Bourke Street but succeeds only in spiralling a top-edge high into the sky, Handscomb calmly making the ground to pouch a catch over his shoulder. 1st over: Renegades 3-0 (Harris 2, Finch 0) Semi-final hero Daniel Worrall begins with a wide outside off stump but things improve significantly from there, with just three coming from the opening over. Two tight dot balls follow the wide then the bowler shifts from over to around the wicket. Eventually the change of angle allows Marcus Harris to milk a couple off his pads, prompting Worrall to return back over and find another dot. Good start for the Stars. The teams are out on the Marvel Stadium turf. It\u2019s warm and humid in Melbourne today, the pitch looks a beauty, the arena is maybe two-thirds full. Let\u2019s get it on. This is a typically excellent thread from Russell Degnan looking into attendances during BBBL08. \u201cThis season has been BAD,\u201d Degnan writes. \u201cLast season was poor (across all venues, remember, it is adjusted to the average), but this season is well down on that. Excluding a couple of days around NYE (the showpiece games) the crowds started poorly and got worse.\u201d I\u2019m also very much here for Jim Maxwell\u2019s hot takes on Shane Warne\u2019s commentary. In case you missed it, the doyen teed off on the Fox Sports pundit during the Renegades semi-final on Friday night, doubling down in an an interview with Fairfax. \u201cI think he often sounds like a punter in a pub, not a commentator,\u201d Maxwell stated with typical brevity and accuracy. Or players in dodgy adverts, like this beauty featuring Stars coach Stephen Fleming. Or this spicy piece of work from former Stars skipper now Renegade Cameron White. This also fits into another specific niche of mine regarding actors in adverts who are trying to make it look like they\u2019re eating something when they\u2019re not. As always, you can keep me company during today\u2019s action. Anything in-play is best shared via Twitter - @JPHowcroft- but there should be time for me to handle the occasional email as well - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. What kind of things do I like to receive? Interviews like this with a young Aaron Finch from 2010 that reveals how messy his house is, please and thank you. Apologies to international readers or those from interstate (in particular The Guardian\u2019s own Sam Perry) but the local dimension to this final inevitably has an AFL angle. Each club is chaired by an influential figure in Australian Rules football, the Stars since inception by Collingwood president Eddie McGuire, the Renegades since 2015 by Hawthorn legend Jason Dunstall. McGuire has been instrumental in the formation of the Stars, championing their star-studded squad building and glitzy image. Back in 2011 in an in-depth feature by Fairfax\u2019s Chloe Saltau, McGuire laid out his ambition to the inaugural playing group back when T20 was still seen as something of a hit and giggle sideshow. \u201cThis might be a good gimmick, that\u2019s how it might be seen by some. It might be a bit of extra pocket money for you guys, but we\u2019re a sporting club and we\u2019re here to f---in\u2019 win. Let\u2019s get that right from the get-go. Whatever\u2019s required, we\u2019ll put in. I\u2019m not wasting my time, I\u2019ve got other things to do in my life and so have you guys. We want to win, we want to get the best crowds in, we want to win financially, we want to win spiritually, we want to win with facilities, we want this to be one of the best cricket clubs in the world from day one.\u201d Today\u2019s final pits plenty of friends and erstwhile colleagues against one another, both among the playing groups and backroom teams. None is more significant than the duel between the two skippers, Glenn Maxwell and Aaron Finch. State and international teammates for many years, the pair are former housemates and remain firm friends. As recently as yesterday they shared a coffee in their local cafe in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs. One change for the Stars with Jackson Bird returning to the bowling attack in place of all-rounder Evan Gulbis. The Renegades are unchanged from their semi-final triumph. Good afternoon and welcome to live OBO coverage of the Big Bash League final between Melbourne Renegades and Melbourne Stars from Marvel Stadium. The first ball will be bowled at 2.45pm local time. Despite a quarter of Big Bash franchises residing in Victoria it\u2019s taken until the eighth instalment of the BBL for the trophy to find its home in Melbourne. It just remains to be seen whether the shiny glowing crucible thingumajig is dressed in red or green ribbons. By virtue of finishing higher on the ladder (second place, compared to the Stars\u2019 fourth) Renegades have home ground advantage. This means today\u2019s match is being played at Docklands Stadium, a venue that has proven difficult to score at this season, creating a series of chaotic contests. That is of course until Friday\u2019s semi-final when Renegades timed their high-scoring chase to perfection. The venue\u2019s old dry drop-ins have allowed Renegades\u2019 bowling attack to shine. Kane Richardson is the competition\u2019s leading wicket-taker, while Cameron Boyce has the fourth-best economy rate for bowlers that have sent down at least 40 overs. By contrast only one Renegade batsman, Sam Harper, features in the top-20 run scorers. For much of the summer the Stars looked unlikely candidates to make the postseason, and form suggested the powerful Hurricanes would blow them away in the semis, but individuals have stood up at crucial times. Daniel Worrall\u2019s performance with the ball in Hobart was impressive enough to spark talk of an Ashes call-up, while for the second game in a row skipper Glenn Maxwell showed on his day he is unplayable. Before that the regular season was all about Marcus Stoinis, averaging almost 55 with the bat the all-rounder also snared the second-most wickets for the Stars. It\u2019s been a long old season, and the short turnaround between the semis and final hasn\u2019t done the hype machine any favours, but around 40,000 fans are expected to turn up for this one; and we all know crosstown rivalries add an extra touch of spice.",

Welcome, then, to this year\u2019s first splendid week of modern crime thrillers: there can have been few single weeks in which we have had such a quality surfeit. And, intriguingly, all on terrestrial, known by some who should know better than to patronise as \u201ccouncil telly\u201d.</p> <p>The one that might have been solved the most quickly will, of course, be spread and sprawled over our next few weeks, as will the landscape of <strong>Shetland</strong>. What amounts to, essentially, the one black man in that subarctic archipelago has been found dead. Had I been DI Jimmy Perez, I might at least have <em>considered</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/09/what-does-liam-neeson-primal-urge-tell-us-about-racism\" title=\"\">a call to Liam Neeson\u2019s agent</a> (too early for gags? Ah well)\u2026 but it\u2019s another Highlander I\u2019m first thinking of.</p> <p>Young Johnny Kenton, who directed the opener of this (maybe last, must-be-hoped penultimate) season of <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/endeavour/2a1229\" title=\"\">Endeavour</a></strong>, did so with such style and perfect pacing \u2013 here languid, there threatening, here dappled, there red-blood pounding \u2013 as to astound. The discovery of the first body found in this episode, Pylon, was shot in such extraordinary fashion that it almost made you forget that the body was (of course, again) that of a young girl. Shaun Evans, Endeavour himself, who directs the second episode, has his work cut out. I grow to mildly resent those speaking nibbles of nonsense about <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2019/02/06/42246/itv_turns_its_back_on_comedy\" title=\"\">\u201cwarm-bath television\u201d</a> \u2013 including ITV\u2019s own doubtless esteemed head of studios, Kevin Lygo, who betrays in that quote a misunderstanding of a hefty jewel in the station\u2019s crown, one of the knees of its bees.</p> <p>I say \u201cmodern\u201d thrillers, and with this I\u2019m quite at peace: <em>Endeavour</em> still shows us how we came to current times via 1969 \u2013 the end, as <em>Withnail and I </em>had it, of \u201cthe greatest decade in the history of the world\u201d, ha. It almost goes without saying that it\u2019s period pitch-perfect: the boxy panda car, an 1100, back in the days when Austin could still somehow make cars; Led Zeppelin\u2019s pulsing, disturbing What Is and What Should Never Be, although Endeavour, in disguise and in retreat, shackled in uniform, hiding from the mirror (from his own regrets) with an ill-judged moustache and boxed into run-down red brick, chooses also to let Led Zep slip him by: he\u2019s mainlining Puccini.</p> <p>I thought this first episode remarkable for its scene- and time-setting: less so, perhaps, the plot. Often Russell Lewis\u2019s plotting can be ingenious: this time maybe less so (although it did give us the best line of the week, Fred Thursday\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re not a man. You\u2019re not the <em>arse</em> of a man\u201d) \u2013 but still we will watch, because of the interplay between characters, which will never disappoint. As so often it\u2019s the strength in depth of casting \u2013 the bone-dry Dr DeBryn, ever underwritten, got some tiny caustic lines; Fred\u2019s wife, Win, looks set to come out of her beaten-down niceness newly forged in steel and misery.

On one hand it\u2019s a grand new take on every superhero franchise \u2013 the premise of five or perhaps seven superheroes, adopted at birth, brought up as siblings, reunited when dad dies, resenting each other, quietly hating \u2013 is certainly new. It\u2019s wonderfully filmed, and very whizzy and gothic, and dark.

      "bodyText": "Endeavour (ITV) | itv.com Shetland (BBC One) | iPlayer Trapped (BBC Four) | iPlayer The Umbrella Academy (Netflix) | netflix.com The Making of Me (Channel 4) | channel4.com Storyville: Under the Wire (BBC Four) | iPlayer An arm is washed ashore on a remote beach. A body is found lying below a pylon: flowers in her hair, and a white horse whinnies. A shambling man forcibly hugs his twin sister outside the Icelandic parliament, and sets them both gruesomely on fire. Welcome, then, to this year\u2019s first splendid week of modern crime thrillers: there can have been few single weeks in which we have had such a quality surfeit. And, intriguingly, all on terrestrial, known by some who should know better than to patronise as \u201ccouncil telly\u201d. The one that might have been solved the most quickly will, of course, be spread and sprawled over our next few weeks, as will the landscape of Shetland. What amounts to, essentially, the one black man in that subarctic archipelago has been found dead. Had I been DI Jimmy Perez, I might at least have considered a call to Liam Neeson\u2019s agent (too early for gags? Ah well)\u2026 but it\u2019s another Highlander I\u2019m first thinking of. Young Johnny Kenton, who directed the opener of this (maybe last, must-be-hoped penultimate) season of Endeavour, did so with such style and perfect pacing \u2013 here languid, there threatening, here dappled, there red-blood pounding \u2013 as to astound. The discovery of the first body found in this episode, Pylon, was shot in such extraordinary fashion that it almost made you forget that the body was (of course, again) that of a young girl. Shaun Evans, Endeavour himself, who directs the second episode, has his work cut out. I grow to mildly resent those speaking nibbles of nonsense about \u201cwarm-bath television\u201d \u2013 including ITV\u2019s own doubtless esteemed head of studios, Kevin Lygo, who betrays in that quote a misunderstanding of a hefty jewel in the station\u2019s crown, one of the knees of its bees. I say \u201cmodern\u201d thrillers, and with this I\u2019m quite at peace: Endeavour still shows us how we came to current times via 1969 \u2013 the end, as Withnail and I had it, of \u201cthe greatest decade in the history of the world\u201d, ha. It almost goes without saying that it\u2019s period pitch-perfect: the boxy panda car, an 1100, back in the days when Austin could still somehow make cars; Led Zeppelin\u2019s pulsing, disturbing What Is and What Should Never Be, although Endeavour, in disguise and in retreat, shackled in uniform, hiding from the mirror (from his own regrets) with an ill-judged moustache and boxed into run-down red brick, chooses also to let Led Zep slip him by: he\u2019s mainlining Puccini. I thought this first episode remarkable for its scene- and time-setting: less so, perhaps, the plot. Often Russell Lewis\u2019s plotting can be ingenious: this time maybe less so (although it did give us the best line of the week, Fred Thursday\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re not a man. You\u2019re not the arse of a man\u201d) \u2013 but still we will watch, because of the interplay between characters, which will never disappoint. As so often it\u2019s the strength in depth of casting \u2013 the bone-dry Dr DeBryn, ever underwritten, got some tiny caustic lines; Fred\u2019s wife, Win, looks set to come out of her beaten-down niceness newly forged in steel and misery. Bring it on home, I say. Well, there you go. Only seven tracks after What Is and What Should Never Be. No particularly witty, caustic lines in Shetland, just the soulful Dougie Henshall, again shrugging on what\u2019s been nicely called his donkey jacket of doom, for another series: even though writer Ann Cleeves has chosen to discontinue the books, there\u2019s happily no hint that the spin-off series itself need yet hit the cliff edge. Trapped, a random find when first I found it three years ago, and a wonderful find too, returned with gusto, punch, and perhaps Iceland\u2019s first act of terrorism. Throw in a smelting plant, in all that ice and fire, owned by a shell (Muslim) company, nice greenies objecting to earthquakes which might \u2013 just might \u2013 be brought about by fracking, nice cold farmers impoverished by globalisation, angry people who will always be angry at their essential lack of effect, or just inherent\u2026 lack\u2026 and the Icelandic government, whose prime minister knows all the police by name, suddenly has a crisis, herding cats. Fortunately they have big unselfish Andri, nicely reunited with old colleagues, scunnered by family issues, as chief cat-herder. Intelligent, glorious, and don\u2019t watch it without gloves. I wanted in this week\u2019s review to love a new Netflix thing. The Umbrella Academy will divide critics. On one hand it\u2019s a grand new take on every superhero franchise \u2013 the premise of five or perhaps seven superheroes, adopted at birth, brought up as siblings, reunited when dad dies, resenting each other, quietly hating \u2013 is certainly new. It\u2019s wonderfully filmed, and very whizzy and gothic, and dark. On the other\u2026 it\u2019s born of a graphic novel, and, as so often, doesn\u2019t quite hang together unless you\u2019ve actually possessed the patience to read the original. Despite the hype and amazing PR, no characters stand out, no stories stand out, and it\u2019s a vanity project indulged by long pockets. Truly disliked it. I\u2019ll expect hate mail. I refer you to the earlier \u201cbest line of the week\u201d. The Making of Me trod a kind path between the transgendered and those likely to be \u201ctriggered\u201d by the transgendered. The first episode told three tales of anguish, and possible redemption. Those who get triggered, the red-faced and the whey, can have found nothing to object to in these first three tales of human beings doing brave dodgy surgery: instead it was a delight, in that it told not tales of surgery but of people, loved. Under the Wire, a truly hard yet wonderful watch, told inter alia the story of Marie Colvin, famously shelled in Homs. But photographer Paul Conroy, whose story this essentially was, deserves glory, as much as Marie. Paul knew Marie well, a thousand times better than me.

Kind of.</p> <p>\u201cI come in, music blaring,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta make a statement.\u201d He\u2019s talking of the time he arrived at 10pm at a Bronx skate park to try to talk to a local kid. Gomez zoomed up in his soft-top car, roof down, flash suit a-flapping, with his music blasting out. Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight. \u201cIt turns heads,\u201d reasons Gomez. \u201cEspecially the drum sequence.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, you will love Gomez, or Manny, as he\u2019s known. In <em><a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/conviction\" title=\"\">Conviction</a></em>, a six-part true-crime series, we follow him over a couple of years as he tries to get a young client out of Rikers Island jail. Pedro Hernandez, 16, is accused of shooting another youth, aged 15, in an argument. Pedro swears he\u2019s innocent, and his mum, Jessica Perez, gets in touch with Manny to see if he can help. And Manny gets to work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is care in Conviction's detail, and the structure is meticulous. But it rattles along</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reporter Saki Knafo from the <em>New York Times</em> magazine is our narrator and guide, but it\u2019s Manny that holds our attention. He\u2019s the biggest character in a story packed with memorable individuals: Jessica, tough, uncompromising; Pedro himself, quiet and studious. Everyone we meet sears themselves on to our synapses, from the cop that arrested Pedro, to the kid who was shot. But it\u2019s fast-talking Manny, bowling into neighbourhoods and chatting to everyone, returning over and over until he finds the person with the information, hanging out until they\u2019re willing to go on the record\u2026 oh, it\u2019s definitely Manny who sticks with you. He drives a 400-mile round trip to talk to a man in jail. He sits outside a 16th-floor flat for three hours from 6am to see if someone comes out (he has a Coke bottle in case he wants to pee). It\u2019s rare for a podcast to give you such a feel of a neighbourhood without one of those lengthy I\u2019m-not-from-around-here descriptive speeches by the host. No need for that here: <em>Conviction </em>is steeped in the Bronx, because of Manny.</p> <p>Knafo is fair: he talks to the cop, to the accuser, gets everyone\u2019s side of the story. There is care in <em>Conviction\u2019s</em> detail, and the structure is meticulous. But this is not a chin-scratcher of a podcast. <em>Conviction</em> rattles along. It\u2019s fun, in exactly the same way a detective story usually is.</p> <p>A side note: Gimlet Media, which made <em>Conviction</em> alongside the <em>New York Times</em>, has recently been sold to Spotify for an astonishing $230m. (No longer can anyone host a panel called: How Do You Make Money Out of Podcasting?) It\u2019s a surprise, but Gimlet has always been an exception, more conventional and ambitious than many US podcasting collectives. Its first show, <em>StartUp</em>, was about starting up a business: that business was Gimlet itself. In just four years it has transformed itself smoothly into a pod powerhouse, making its own shows, but ones too for brands such as Tinder, eBay, Reebok, Virgin Atlantic and every podcast\u2019s favourite sponsor, Blue Apron.</p> <p>Without doubt, Gimlet has been responsible for some of the best podcasts of recent times \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all\" title=\"\">Reply All</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/mogul\" title=\"\">Mogul</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/homecoming\" title=\"\">Homecoming</a></em> \u2013 but these were mostly made in co-production with others. Gimlet\u2019s homegrown podcasts are a little cerebral and similar to other, livelier shows already out there. It has a women-talking-pop-culture podcast, a small-and-everyday-things-are-fascinating podcast, a BME culture podcast (<em><a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/the-nod\" title=\"\">The Nod</a></em>: excellent), a childrens\u2019 stories podcast. It has been clever enough to cover all the bases. And Spotify clearly wants to move into non-music listening, to become the place you go to for anything audio.

      "bodyText": "Manuel Gomez is a hero for our times. You know, the rogue US private investigator, working around the law to find the truth and free the innocent? That Philip Marlowe/Mike Hammer/Jim Rockford type? Well, Gomez is that, but updated to today. Kind of. \u201cI come in, music blaring,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta make a statement.\u201d He\u2019s talking of the time he arrived at 10pm at a Bronx skate park to try to talk to a local kid. Gomez zoomed up in his soft-top car, roof down, flash suit a-flapping, with his music blasting out. Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight. \u201cIt turns heads,\u201d reasons Gomez. \u201cEspecially the drum sequence.\u201d Oh, you will love Gomez, or Manny, as he\u2019s known. In Conviction, a six-part true-crime series, we follow him over a couple of years as he tries to get a young client out of Rikers Island jail. Pedro Hernandez, 16, is accused of shooting another youth, aged 15, in an argument. Pedro swears he\u2019s innocent, and his mum, Jessica Perez, gets in touch with Manny to see if he can help. And Manny gets to work. Reporter Saki Knafo from the New York Times magazine is our narrator and guide, but it\u2019s Manny that holds our attention. He\u2019s the biggest character in a story packed with memorable individuals: Jessica, tough, uncompromising; Pedro himself, quiet and studious. Everyone we meet sears themselves on to our synapses, from the cop that arrested Pedro, to the kid who was shot. But it\u2019s fast-talking Manny, bowling into neighbourhoods and chatting to everyone, returning over and over until he finds the person with the information, hanging out until they\u2019re willing to go on the record\u2026 oh, it\u2019s definitely Manny who sticks with you. He drives a 400-mile round trip to talk to a man in jail. He sits outside a 16th-floor flat for three hours from 6am to see if someone comes out (he has a Coke bottle in case he wants to pee). It\u2019s rare for a podcast to give you such a feel of a neighbourhood without one of those lengthy I\u2019m-not-from-around-here descriptive speeches by the host. No need for that here: Conviction is steeped in the Bronx, because of Manny. Knafo is fair: he talks to the cop, to the accuser, gets everyone\u2019s side of the story. There is care in Conviction\u2019s detail, and the structure is meticulous. But this is not a chin-scratcher of a podcast. Conviction rattles along. It\u2019s fun, in exactly the same way a detective story usually is. A side note: Gimlet Media, which made Conviction alongside the New York Times, has recently been sold to Spotify for an astonishing $230m. (No longer can anyone host a panel called: How Do You Make Money Out of Podcasting?) It\u2019s a surprise, but Gimlet has always been an exception, more conventional and ambitious than many US podcasting collectives. Its first show, StartUp, was about starting up a business: that business was Gimlet itself. In just four years it has transformed itself smoothly into a pod powerhouse, making its own shows, but ones too for brands such as Tinder, eBay, Reebok, Virgin Atlantic and every podcast\u2019s favourite sponsor, Blue Apron. Without doubt, Gimlet has been responsible for some of the best podcasts of recent times \u2013 Reply All, Mogul, Homecoming \u2013 but these were mostly made in co-production with others. Gimlet\u2019s homegrown podcasts are a little cerebral and similar to other, livelier shows already out there. It has a women-talking-pop-culture podcast, a small-and-everyday-things-are-fascinating podcast, a BME culture podcast (The Nod: excellent), a childrens\u2019 stories podcast. It has been clever enough to cover all the bases. And Spotify clearly wants to move into non-music listening, to become the place you go to for anything audio. But still, in a time when Audible is slashing its podcast output, when Panoply (Slate\u2019s podcast publisher) pulled out in September last year, $230m is a lot of money. We shall see.

      "body": "<p>The philosopher Jeremy Bentham was famed for his panopticon, a hypothetical circular prison that was designed in such a way that its inmates never knew whether or not they were being observed. This would, his theory went, encourage prisoners to presume they were always being watched, and thus act accordingly. No true version of the prison was ever really built, and the word itself only now lives on due to its prodigious utility within breathless op-eds about surveillance culture, mostly written by people who\u2019ve already overused references to Orwell and Kafka.</p> <p>The genius of today\u2019s boring dystopia has been to offer this surveillance as a feature, not a bug; to cast that all-seeing-eye not as a malevolent shadowy jailer, but as the world\u2019s most boring personal assistant. Nowhere is this truer than with <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/save-time-with-smart-reply-in-gmail/\" title=\"\">Gmail smart replies</a>, the pocket panopticon that now resides in every inbox. Not only can it see what you\u2019ve already read and written, it has some great ideas on how to make your next contribution, too. But how well does it really know us? How deeply does its unsleeping, lidless eye scan our thoughts and deeds? And could I use this information, the knowledge of a god, to create a stronger, better, smarter me? Seeking answers, I stopped resisting and spent an entire week surrendering to its every whim.</p> <p>It\u2019s odd that Gmail smart replies have only been around since 2017, since they\u2019re the kind of subtly ever-present tool that now seems always to have been there. Odder still, it feels this way despite the fact I had never used it before. My memory of seeing, and ignoring, the little options below my emails was that they seemed generally accurate, but also glib and oddly worded. More importantly, they seemed written in a tone that I have never used in my entire life, one of indeterminate, cheery abandon that would surely present as false were I to ever use it myself.</p> <p>But God has his reasons and I endeavoured to discern them for myself. Opening my inbox I found an email from my wife telling me she had booked a restaurant and hoped I thought it would be as great as she did. Below it lay three unassuming rectangles poised for my selection:</p> <p>\u2013 OK, thanks!</p> <p>\u2013 Yes, I agree!</p> <p>\u2013 I don\u2019t think so.</p> <p>Opting for \u201cOK, thanks!\u201d I began my smart reply odyssey and a descent into what quickly became the world\u2019s most boring Choose Your Own Adventure game.</p> <p>Starting off, I had thought the main issue would be accuracy. I worried I\u2019d be forced to make wildly inappropriate remarks to longstanding friends and colleagues, like the hapless idiot in an American sitcom, receiving ear-piece instructions to get him through a date with the hottest girl in school. You know the scene: he\u2019s doing great for a while, but eventually comes a cropper when his Bergerac is hit in the crotch by a wheelie bin, or a nest of wasps, which causes our hero to repeat his every swear word verbatim. This, I feared, could be my fate; glibly responding to emails announcing the death of a family friend with blandly inappropriate corporate speak like \u201cOutstanding!\u201d or \u201cCan we change this to Friday?\u201d It turned out I shouldn\u2019t have worried, as the replies were almost universally, even unnervingly, appropriate to the topic. My week was merely a never-ending spree of palatable options that were terrifyingly bland.</p> <p>The major stumbling block to my ever having used smart replies before was tone. Smart replies always gave me a sense of alien weirdness, so much so that when I did begin seeing them, I\u2019d go out of my way to make sure the wording I did use in my reply was nothing like those suggested. It was as if I was spiting this assistant out of fear I\u2019d be revealed as a Big Data techno-stooge. It\u2019s not just that the replies are curt and impersonal, they\u2019re also so chipper as to sound demented. I have a reputation to uphold, and it\u2019s not as a perky yes man. Nowhere was this more apparent than with my friend Al, who was good enough to email me a particularly chucklesome video he\u2019d found on YouTube. To my horror, my only options by way of reply were:</p> <p>\u2013 Love It!</p> <p>\u2013 Thanks, I\u2019ll check it out!</p> <p>\u2013 Hahaha that\u2019s awesome!</p> <p>Since it was, at least superficially, closest to the feeling engendered by the video, I went for \u201cHahaha that\u2019s awesome!\u201d making it, I think, the first time I\u2019ve ever used that latter adjective in my entire life. One thing that struck me was how Gmail had worked out that the video itself was funny. I mean, it was funny \u2013 it was a wedding band from the Irish midlands who appeared to have made a music video for roughly the price of a Quavers multi-pack \u2013 but that\u2019s not the point. The fact is, this wasn\u2019t stated anywhere in the email itself. How did it know? Would \u201cHahaha that\u2019s awesome!\u201d still have been an option if the video he\u2019d linked to had been Kofi Annan giving a dignified reading from <em>Angela\u2019s Ashes</em>, or a compilation of old ladies receiving larger-than-expected gas bills?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How had Gmail worked out that the video my friend had sent me was funny? This wasn\u2019t stated anywhere in the email itself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The other big take away, and one that speaks to my larger point, is the rather poorer job it had done of approximating my own speech. It knew enough to suggest it was funny, but not enough to stop me from sounding like a hyperbolic youth pastor on bad speed. This was to be a constant theme in my week of robo-replying, the sense that Gmail wasn\u2019t just reading, but remodelling me in its own ghastly image.</p> <p>\u201cAn exclamation mark,\u201d wrote F Scott Fitzgerald, \u201cis like laughing at your own joke.\u201d God knows, then, what he would have made of my output this week alone. \u201cYes!\u201d, \u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d, \u201cWill do!\u201d, \u201cGot that!\u201d, \u201cSee you then!\u201d, \u201cOf course!\u201d Now I was laughing at my own joke a dozen times a day like some half-mad cyborg, rendered dizzily incontinent by even the mildest exchange of words. Google, it turns out, splits its sides for emails confirming dental appointments or lunch dates. Somewhere in the beeping digital ether, the hive-mind wipes hot tears from a dead digital eye, weeping with laughter at the thought of a Thursday lunch meeting. My emails suddenly presented me as a giddy type, pummelled into hysterics each time an attachment was received as stated. Running on the spot and punching the air at the thought of buying new bin attachments from Hackney council by the weekend.</p> <p>Google made a big point of claiming smart replies respond not to your own style of writing, but to a generalised neural network of everyone\u2019s responses to similar cases. This was, I presume, intended to placate those who felt the opposite was too creepy, but I began to find it unnerving, too. After a week I started to accept this was not Google\u2019s idea of who I was, but their conception of some new, better me they felt I should become. No more S\u00e9amas the recalcitrant Scrooge, indifferent to the ecstasy of being asked, for a sixth time, if I was attending a social function. Step forward my new, better self, one who screams: \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be there thanks!\u201d with something like the manic ebullience of someone hoping to deter you from entering the bathroom they\u2019re in.</p> <p>If it were just the case that smart replies made me gormless and weird, that would be one thing, but there were other, unexpected hurdles. One email I received was from an event organiser addressing an overdue payment for a talk I\u2019d given. I like this person and readily understood it wasn\u2019t their fault, so was only too happy to offer my polite thanks for the update. But I was then surprised to find I had no choice either way. In response to being asked if it wasn\u2019t too much hassle for me to be paid at the end of the month, my options were:</p> <p>\u2013 That\u2019s fine, thanks!</p> <p>\u2013 Of course!</p> <p>\u2013 Nope, that\u2019s fine!</p> <p>Rather like the child who wakes up with bold plans to clean his room, only to have this new regime interrupted by a parent demanding they tidy up, Google had removed any choice in the matter and, in the process, made me resent options I may well have embraced on my own. Gritting my teeth, I selected: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, thanks!\u201d and reflected on the fact that Google\u2019s responses to my non-payment ran only from moderately cheerful to fizzily delighted. What might that say about the silicon values now beating within my inbox\u2019s beige, beeping heart? Whatever the case, I was beginning to chafe against my Big Data overlords and felt ready to call it a day.</p> <p>Following a week of emails in this vein, I was looking forward to reverting to normal and letting a few of my more common recipients in on the gag. When I did, I was horrified to discover no one had noticed a thing. Not even Al, who\u2019d seen me use the word \u201cawesome!\u201d and hadn\u2019t raised an eyebrow. I found myself offended that the ruse I had pulled on unsuspecting friends had worked so well, forced to reckon with the fact that my sense of individuality was, clearly, somewhat overrated.</p> <p>The blandness of Gmail\u2019s smart replies had been their camouflage, the processing power of 10m moon landings, disguised in a sea of inane pleasantries and errant exclamation marks. Worse still, I can\u2019t stop scanning messages I receive, detecting the hidden, mechanical hand of Uncle Google in every misplaced Americanism, or brisk and jaunty phrase. I no longer know which of my friends, colleagues, or bin collection services I\u2019m even really talking to any more. A week inside the machine has changed all that. We must, as always, be careful gazing long into the abyss, because the abyss gazes back. And That\u2019s fine!</p>",

One thing that struck me was how Gmail had worked out that the video itself was funny. I mean, it was funny \u2013 it was a wedding band from the Irish midlands who appeared to have made a music video for roughly the price of a Quavers multi-pack \u2013 but that\u2019s not the point. The fact is, this wasn\u2019t stated anywhere in the email itself. How did it know? Would \u201cHahaha that\u2019s awesome!\u201d still have been an option if the video he\u2019d linked to had been Kofi Annan giving a dignified reading from Angela\u2019s Ashes, or a compilation of old ladies receiving larger-than-expected gas bills? The other big take away, and one that speaks to my larger point, is the rather poorer job it had done of approximating my own speech. It knew enough to suggest it was funny, but not enough to stop me from sounding like a hyperbolic youth pastor on bad speed. This was to be a constant theme in my week of robo-replying, the sense that Gmail wasn\u2019t just reading, but remodelling me in its own ghastly image. \u201cAn exclamation mark,\u201d wrote F Scott Fitzgerald, \u201cis like laughing at your own joke.\u201d God knows, then, what he would have made of my output this week alone. \u201cYes!\u201d, \u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d, \u201cWill do!\u201d, \u201cGot that!\u201d, \u201cSee you then!\u201d, \u201cOf course!\u201d Now I was laughing at my own joke a dozen times a day like some half-mad cyborg, rendered dizzily incontinent by even the mildest exchange of words. Google, it turns out, splits its sides for emails confirming dental appointments or lunch dates. Somewhere in the beeping digital ether, the hive-mind wipes hot tears from a dead digital eye, weeping with laughter at the thought of a Thursday lunch meeting. My emails suddenly presented me as a giddy type, pummelled into hysterics each time an attachment was received as stated. Running on the spot and punching the air at the thought of buying new bin attachments from Hackney council by the weekend. Google made a big point of claiming smart replies respond not to your own style of writing, but to a generalised neural network of everyone\u2019s responses to similar cases. This was, I presume, intended to placate those who felt the opposite was too creepy, but I began to find it unnerving, too. After a week I started to accept this was not Google\u2019s idea of who I was, but their conception of some new, better me they felt I should become. No more S\u00e9amas the recalcitrant Scrooge, indifferent to the ecstasy of being asked, for a sixth time, if I was attending a social function. Step forward my new, better self, one who screams: \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be there thanks!\u201d with something like the manic ebullience of someone hoping to deter you from entering the bathroom they\u2019re in. If it were just the case that smart replies made me gormless and weird, that would be one thing, but there were other, unexpected hurdles. One email I received was from an event organiser addressing an overdue payment for a talk I\u2019d given. I like this person and readily understood it wasn\u2019t their fault, so was only too happy to offer my polite thanks for the update. But I was then surprised to find I had no choice either way. In response to being asked if it wasn\u2019t too much hassle for me to be paid at the end of the month, my options were: \u2013 That\u2019s fine, thanks! \u2013 Of course! \u2013 Nope, that\u2019s fine! Rather like the child who wakes up with bold plans to clean his room, only to have this new regime interrupted by a parent demanding they tidy up, Google had removed any choice in the matter and, in the process, made me resent options I may well have embraced on my own. Gritting my teeth, I selected: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, thanks!\u201d and reflected on the fact that Google\u2019s responses to my non-payment ran only from moderately cheerful to fizzily delighted. What might that say about the silicon values now beating within my inbox\u2019s beige, beeping heart? Whatever the case, I was beginning to chafe against my Big Data overlords and felt ready to call it a day. Following a week of emails in this vein, I was looking forward to reverting to normal and letting a few of my more common recipients in on the gag. When I did, I was horrified to discover no one had noticed a thing. Not even Al, who\u2019d seen me use the word \u201cawesome!\u201d and hadn\u2019t raised an eyebrow. I found myself offended that the ruse I had pulled on unsuspecting friends had worked so well, forced to reckon with the fact that my sense of individuality was, clearly, somewhat overrated. The blandness of Gmail\u2019s smart replies had been their camouflage, the processing power of 10m moon landings, disguised in a sea of inane pleasantries and errant exclamation marks. Worse still, I can\u2019t stop scanning messages I receive, detecting the hidden, mechanical hand of Uncle Google in every misplaced Americanism, or brisk and jaunty phrase. I no longer know which of my friends, colleagues, or bin collection services I\u2019m even really talking to any more. A week inside the machine has changed all that. We must, as always, be careful gazing long into the abyss, because the abyss gazes back. And That\u2019s fine!",

It\u2019s also safe; or at least, that\u2019s always been my experience. I must have walked hundreds of miles around it on my own without incident (unlike in Acapulco, where someone was kidnapped from my bus a few months ago). For me, the magic is tangible; my favourite late-night stop, as I wend my way back to my hotel or apartment, is the churrer\u00eda El Moro on Obregon, busy round the clock. Last time I was there I found myself, at 1am, sharing a table with a large Mexican family (probably quite like Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s) and a mariachi musician in full costume. He propped his guitar against the wall, took a bite of his cinnamon-drenched churro and a slug of his spicy Oaxacan hot chocolate, and we smiled at one another to acknowledge the sheer deliciousness of the flavour, and of the moment. Way to go British Airways flies to Mexico City from around \u00a3750. Hotel Marbella has doubles from \u00a360; the Stanza has doubles from \u00a350. For a feel of Roma\u2019s typical interiors, try the upmarket Casa Goliana, doubles from \u00a3250",

In five grand canvases, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQEqw_CqEI\" title=\"\">Thomas Cole</a> described an arc from nature, through pastoralism and empire, to desolation.

We\u2019re at the apex of the story arc, pivoting from blind triumph to hubristic ruin. He tells of coming climate catastrophes, brought on by our complacency and profligacy. These devastations will likely end history, culture and ethics as we know them. The portents surround us, but we wilfully turn away. A glimmer of hope, though, is present if we mend our ways.</p> <p>There is much to learn from this book. From media and scientific reports of the past decade, Wallace-Wells sifts key predictions and conveys them in vivid prose. He trebles the size of the Book of Revelation\u2019s posse of horsemen, elucidating a dozen categories of anguish including heat death, conflagration, poisoned air and water, psychological trauma, and societal collapse. As he points out, none of this is news. Yet for most of us, the terrifying projections of where our planet is headed arrive in our ears overwhelmed by a cacophony of media reports blaring the day\u2019s politics and entertainment.</p> <p>For those not steeped in news about climate change, this is a lively introduction to both the latest predictions and their uncertainties. Wallace-Wells not only summarises recent projections, but excavates important unifying themes. Rapidity is one of these. The climate crisis was largely created by the actions of just a single generation. The physiological and psychological limits of human life are another. Many climate projections indicate that we\u2019ll increasingly cross these limits. The latter part of the book is less grounded in science and data, and comprises a series of riffs about the future of human culture and society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Billions know how bad things are, through their intellects, emotions and lived realities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019ve snoozed through or turned away from the climate change news, this book will waken and update you.

This is part of his aim: to startle and shake us.</p> <p>The valuable core of the book is contained within a rind of unnecessary exaggeration. The book\u2019s title belies its contents.

The opening paragraphs of the book burn strawmen to fuel the claim that \u201cyou\u201d readers do not understand how bad things are. Billions of people do, in fact, understand how bad things are, through their intellects, emotions and lived realities. The claim that bitcoin \u201cconsumes more electricity than is generated by all the world\u2019s solar panels combined\u201d misuses a speculative projection in a <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/move-over-bitcoin-bros-a-green-cryptocurrency-is-here/\" title=\"\">Grist</a> article and is off by a factor of 100 (in 2017, bitcoin used about 2.55GW, <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/solar/\" title=\"\">global photovoltaic capacity</a> was 398GW). Such claims are eye-catching and get the story in front of the insouciant. But they are also what alienated many climate researchers from Wallace-Wells\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/book-excerpt-the-uninhabitable-earth-david-wallace-wells.html\" title=\"\">New York Magazine</a></em><a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/book-excerpt-the-uninhabitable-earth-david-wallace-wells.html\" title=\"\"> essay</a> of the same title.</p> <p>Yet, occasional factual errors aside, where \u201cexaggeration\u201d starts is hard to say given our improvident trajectory. A time of crisis demands a multiplicity of responses, including voices of alarm. Not every call to action will strike the same balance between woe and hope. That Wallace-Wells has irritated some contemporary specialists in \u201cclimate communication\u201d is perhaps a healthy sign that discussions of climate are now reaching far beyond the measured discourse of academia and intergovernmental panels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/03/david-wallace-wells-on-climate-people-should-be-scared-im-scared\">David Wallace-Wells on climate: \u2018People should be scared \u2013 I'm scared\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How, then, to act in the face of these frightening projections? This is not a book of solutions. Wallace-Wells outlines some political and economic pathways \u2013 taxes and public investments \u2013 but gives them little exposition. He\u2019s dismissive about the value of changes in individual behaviours. He writes that choices by the \u201cconsumer class\u201d about food and childbearing are manifestations of \u201cascetic pride\u201d and \u201ccop-outs\u201d. He insists that he\u2019s \u201cnot about to go vegan\u201d, delivering a critique of consumerist neoliberalism with a burger in his hand. Consumer choices are largely distractions from or substitutes for political action, he argues. But this ignores the possibility that individual action might be a prerequisite to political change. Reformation of the self, including our behaviours as consumers, can inspire, inform and sustain political and cultural action. This is perhaps especially true for storytellers who wield influence through their widely heard voices.</p> <p>Like Cole before him, Wallace-Wells\u2019s project is a moral one, an indictment of his culture. Both narratives aim to convince us that the guiding beliefs of our times are wrong. But unlike Cole, who believed that self-annihilation was inevitable, Wallace-Wells insists that we can snap the narrative arc of rise and fall. Amid his stories of desolation and travail, he underscores our agency. This accounts for the excitement he feels about his newborn daughter\u2019s future. She will live on a planet burned, flooded and baked out of recognition. But she will also, he believes, be a participant in what he calls \u201cliterally the greatest story ever told\u201d, the possibility that calamity might somehow catalyse \u201ca happy ending\u201d.</p> <p>If we are to find such an ending, it will not come from disembodied analysis alone. The book\u2019s greatest omission is a lack of fieldwork. In its pages, we don\u2019t go into the streets to talk to people, to hear their insights and perspectives. Instead, we hear Wallace-Wells interpreting an impressive stack of news clippings, interviews with specialists, and papers. But even the best scientific paper is one step removed from its subjects. In Walt Whitman\u2019s words, we \u201ctake things at second or third hand\u201d. Our greatest fear should perhaps be that we have forgotten how to listen to the living Earth.</p> <p><em>David George Haskell is author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/07/songs-of-trees-david-george-haskell-review\" title=\"\">The Songs of Trees</a> and The Forest Unseen, and professor of biology at Sewanee: The University of the South, Tennessee</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>The</em> <em>Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future</em> by David Wallace-Wells is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).

But they are also what alienated many climate researchers from Wallace-Wells\u2019s New York Magazine essay of the same title. Yet, occasional factual errors aside, where \u201cexaggeration\u201d starts is hard to say given our improvident trajectory. A time of crisis demands a multiplicity of responses, including voices of alarm. Not every call to action will strike the same balance between woe and hope. That Wallace-Wells has irritated some contemporary specialists in \u201cclimate communication\u201d is perhaps a healthy sign that discussions of climate are now reaching far beyond the measured discourse of academia and intergovernmental panels. How, then, to act in the face of these frightening projections? This is not a book of solutions. Wallace-Wells outlines some political and economic pathways \u2013 taxes and public investments \u2013 but gives them little exposition. He\u2019s dismissive about the value of changes in individual behaviours. He writes that choices by the \u201cconsumer class\u201d about food and childbearing are manifestations of \u201cascetic pride\u201d and \u201ccop-outs\u201d. He insists that he\u2019s \u201cnot about to go vegan\u201d, delivering a critique of consumerist neoliberalism with a burger in his hand. Consumer choices are largely distractions from or substitutes for political action, he argues. But this ignores the possibility that individual action might be a prerequisite to political change. Reformation of the self, including our behaviours as consumers, can inspire, inform and sustain political and cultural action. This is perhaps especially true for storytellers who wield influence through their widely heard voices. Like Cole before him, Wallace-Wells\u2019s project is a moral one, an indictment of his culture. Both narratives aim to convince us that the guiding beliefs of our times are wrong. But unlike Cole, who believed that self-annihilation was inevitable, Wallace-Wells insists that we can snap the narrative arc of rise and fall. Amid his stories of desolation and travail, he underscores our agency. This accounts for the excitement he feels about his newborn daughter\u2019s future. She will live on a planet burned, flooded and baked out of recognition. But she will also, he believes, be a participant in what he calls \u201cliterally the greatest story ever told\u201d, the possibility that calamity might somehow catalyse \u201ca happy ending\u201d. If we are to find such an ending, it will not come from disembodied analysis alone. The book\u2019s greatest omission is a lack of fieldwork. In its pages, we don\u2019t go into the streets to talk to people, to hear their insights and perspectives. Instead, we hear Wallace-Wells interpreting an impressive stack of news clippings, interviews with specialists, and papers. But even the best scientific paper is one step removed from its subjects. In Walt Whitman\u2019s words, we \u201ctake things at second or third hand\u201d. Our greatest fear should perhaps be that we have forgotten how to listen to the living Earth.

Like Riina, Guzm\u00e1n built his cartel initially by forging alliances \u2013 it even came to be called \u201cLa Federaci\u00f3n\u201d.</p> <p>El Chapo fought wars, but never against the state per se. He didn\u2019t need to; Guzm\u00e1n preferred conviviality with power. His trial told Mexicans what they already knew, and North Americans what they suspected: that the state apparatus was bought top-to-bottom: presidents bribed, army generals on the payroll, police commanders likewise, protecting contraband tunnels and even smuggling drugs themselves; police escorts for consignments of cocaine. \u201cI may not be the president of Mexico,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said, even while imprisoned, \u201cbut in Mexico I\u2019m the boss.\u201d</p> <p>Through the other end of the same lens, power needed Guzm\u00e1n too, in a way that the Italian state, faced with lower levels of violence, did not need the mafia. A pyramidal narco-order in Mexico wherein everyone knows their place, including law enforcement, can be guarantor of a \u201cPax Mafiosa\u201d, whereby both pyramid and state join forces against wilder, unrulier clans. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s wars were different, and differently self-defeating, from Riina\u2019s.</p> <p>Unable to accept the division of US-border smuggling plazas designated by Gallardo to heirs of the old Guadalajara cartel, Guzm\u00e1n picked them off one by one, laying claim to the entire frontier. Confederates \u2013 the Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel in Tijuana, the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and even that of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva brothers with whom Guzm\u00e1n grew up \u2013 became enemies, escalating hyper-violence to levels that surpassed Sicily\u2019s worst nightmares. While Riina disappeared one boy in acid, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/americas/25mexico.html\" title=\"\">Santiago Meza L\u00f3pez</a> \u2013 \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d, the pork stew-maker \u2013 who defected from the Arellano brothers to Guzm\u00e1n, dissolved hundreds.</p> <p>Both Cosa Nostra and the Sinaloa cartel became multinational, global conglomerates, through alliances, franchises and brute force. As such, they enjoyed the services of illustrious American and British banks that embraced and cleaned their vast profits with impunity, too big to prosecute even when they were caught. Both Riina and Guzm\u00e1n thus blurred the line between crime and capitalism; they knew their trade as well as any graduate from Harvard Business School. As Riina said: \u201cI reached the fifth year of elementary school. A career in Cosa Nostra doesn\u2019t need a laureate degree.\u201d Both broke the law, but gave the lie to legality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"279c064e910ff00fdcb3f326aa30facb7cf4e036\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/279c064e910ff00fdcb3f326aa30facb7cf4e036/4_224_2067_1240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman was extradited to the US in 2017. on 13 February he was found guilty of multiple crimes and faces life in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guzm\u00e1n made the added calculation that profit margins were highest at the retail end, ousting Colombian distribution networks in the US \u2013 which had, ironically, replaced Sicilian control after the Gotti trial of 1992.</p> <p>But strength of scale became weakness of control. Both \u201cshorties\u201d can claim to have operated the last truly pyramidal cartels, but neither man really controlled their respective syndicates single-handedly, whatever the judgments at trial. The respective \u201cCupole\u201d or high-domes, of Cosa Nostra and the Sinaloa cartel were incapable of cohesion.</p> <p>No one knew who to trust: Riina was probably betrayed by a more business-minded, less bellicose don, Bernardo Provenzano. El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel imploded between factions and he was likely shopped by its co-founder, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d, who disagreed with Guzm\u00e1n over succession and strategy. Differences came to a head with El Mayo\u2019s disdain over discussions for a proposed biopic with Sean Penn.</p> <p>Violence worsens in mafia-land when the plates shift, the plaza is unquiet, chains of command are challenged or disturbed, when the hive gets kicked. Like when you smash a ball of mercury and it becomes a flurry of little balls flying around. This is what happened as Falcone hammered into Cosa Nostra, and when President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico\u2019s latest war on drugs in 2006. And what has been happening in Mexico since Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest, extradition and fall.</p> <p>What might be called \u201cnarco-genealogy\u201d comes into play. The decade of the Maxi trial was also that of the rise of the Neapolitan Camorra, partly because of its efficacy in allying with Colombian syndicates in time for the cocaine boom, partly because if Cosa Nostra was a patrician corporation, Camorra was opportunist, understanding the zeitgeist of new free-market forces better than patronage or \u201chonour\u201d. It was leaner and meaner, had a horizontal, not vertical, organisation, no \u201ccupola\u201d or central command. Likewise, while Guzm\u00e1n and Zambada built the Sinaloa edifice, new kids on the block paid little heed to its ways with politicians, police chiefs and generals. Los Zetas took a leaf from the Camorra\u2019s opportunism and free-rolling structure, developed new technology as propaganda and imposed terror on their terrain. In Sinaloa country, you find people to praise Guzm\u00e1n; in the Zetas\u2019 Tamaulipas, you don\u2019t mention their name. Guzm\u00e1n never wrenched control from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/21/mexico-los-zetas-drug-trafficking\" title=\"\"> Los Zetas </a>of the lucrative Gulf coast and routes through Nuevo Laredo into Texas, busiest trade corridor in the world.</p> <p>The Sinaloa cartel remains a force. Recent investigations in Nari\u00f1o, Colombia, show it maintaining control of the Pacific waterfront at Tumaco, the port through which a third of all Colombian cocaine passes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/02/mexico-narco-nightmare-amnesty-traffickers\">Mexico\u2019s narco nightmare will not be ended by an amnesty for traffickers | Ed Vulliamy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the leader now, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada is ill with reported bone cancer. And there comes a time when even newcomers come of age. Even the Zetas stretch and weaken, so that those balls of mercury come rather to resemble nuclear fission, as ever-smaller bands, gangs, rogue police forces and \u201cout-sourced\u201d affiliates vie to fill vacuums in the international and domestic markets for drugs.</p> <p>So a third-tier business model emerges, rebellious grandchildren to the dons. In Italy, the \u2018Ndrangheta of Calabria established themselves conclusively in the late 1990s, and in Mexico the ferocious new C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n \u2013 once outsiders and terrorist impostors, now major players on the international crime scene. As these groups battle to expand turf, there\u2019s every chance that Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s demise and conviction will increase, not abate, violence in Mexico, already at its highest levels ever since his extradition.</p> <p>Guzm\u00e1n said: \u201cWhen we are good, nobody remembers us. When we are bad, nobody forgets us.\u201d While real-life Chapo rots in jail but lives on through Netflix, the people to watch now are Nemesio \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, leader of the CJNG, and others whose names we do not know.</p> <p>Victor Clark Alfaro, a mafia expert who has watched cartels come and go in Tijuana since the 1980s, last month recalled narcos of yore flashing their wealth around discos and restaurants. But \u201ctheir heirs are invisible\u201d, he says. \u201cThey are businessmen, they\u2019re people you\u2019d meet at the country club. For the first time in three decades, I cannot name their leaders to you.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s the distance we\u2019ve come past Riina and now Guzm\u00e1n. Because narco traffic is a system, not a syndicate and certainly not a single boss. That\u2019s the fantasy of the \u201ckingpin\u201d strategy under which both \u201cshorties\u201d were convicted: you put away the kingpin and solve the problem.</p> <p>Wrong: the more that system changes, the more it stays the same and the more violent it gets \u2013 so long as demand sustains and the money finds a safe house. For all the mutations and heredity from Falcone to Goldbarg, both old cartels and new splinters defy even the rules of markets at which they are so adept: increasing supply to meet insatiable demand, without suffering a drop in retail price. Drugs know no recession.</p> <p>With Riina dead and El Chapo locked away, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada becomes the old doyen godfather, having never seen the inside of a jail cell during 50 years in the business. Philosopher too: he told the publisher of <em>Proceso</em> magazine, Julio Scherer, during the only interview he ever gave, in 2010: \u201cThe drug trade involves millions of people. How to master them? Well, as for the capos, locked up, dead or extradited, their replacements are already among us.\u201d The war against his kind \u201cis a lost war\u201d. Why lost? asked Scherer. \u201cBecause the narco is rooted in society, just like corruption,\u201d replied El Mayo.</p> <p><em>Ed Vulliamy, author of </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/amexica-ed-vulliamy-review\" title=\"\">Amexica: War Along The Borderline</a></em><em>, was Italy correspondent for the Guardian 1990-94 and then US correspondent for the Observer until 2003.</em></p>",

Salvatore Riina, boss of Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra from the late 1970s, reportedly until his death in jail in 2017, was known as Tot\u00f2 \u2018u Curtu in dialect. And Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, convicted last week of being the world\u2019s biggest drug lord and leader of crime\u2019s mightiest syndicate, Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, became famous as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d. Riina was also called La Belva \u2013 the beast \u2013 for self-explanatory reasons, and Guzm\u00e1n, El Rapido, for the speed at which he delivered Colombian cocaine, via Mexico, to the US and Europe. I saw them both stand trial, a quarter of a century apart: the closing phases of the mafia \u201cMaxi trial\u201d in 1992 with Riina convicted in absentia; then Riina\u2019s own case in 1993; and the opening salvos of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s trial last November. Two eras separating two hemispheres; same business, same nickname. And how that business model appeared to change, yet remained in many crucial respects the same. January 1992 saw final appeals by 360 mafiosi convicted at the Maxi trial of 1985-87 thanks to the endeavours of two phenomenons in anti-mafia history: investigating magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Many convictions they secured were overturned by Judge Corrado Carnevale \u2013 later himself convicted for mafia association. But in court on 30 January, there was mustachioed Falcone with mountains of paper, eyes like a prairie falcon and intellectual talons to match. There was judge Antonio Valente in golden shoulder-toggles, who dealt the crushing blow, dismissing appeals and reversing previously successful ones \u2013 among them: life imprisonment for Riina, on the run, wanted for murder. But it was Falcone and Borsellino who paid with their lives, both blown up that summer. A month before Falcone was killed, I travelled from Italy to the same courthouse in which Guzm\u00e1n was convicted \u2013 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn \u2013 where an ambitious district attorney called Rudy Giuliani, collaborating with Falcone, secured the conviction of John Gotti, and the ultimate demise of his Gambino clan. The blowing up of the Sicilian judges was seen as a sign of the mafia\u2019s defiant strength, but the opposite was true: the Cosa Nostra as an international power astride the Atlantic was crumbling. And in October 1993, it was back to Palermo: there was the man who ordered those murders. Tot\u00f2 \u2018u Curtu arrested at last, on trial in a tweed jacket, burly but sprite, behind red-painted bars, gesticulating as though he owned the place \u2013 he was wrong, re-sentenced in person to life imprisonment. How different in New York this winter. No cage for Guzm\u00e1n, but there he was, after all those corridos, Netflix episodes and novels: seated among his lawyers and exchanging sweet nothings in sign language with his wife Emma Coronel. Mostly stone-faced, but he enjoyed the odd joke along with others \u2013 usually a gag by his own attorneys. Humour was markedly missing from Sicily\u2019s trials.

Riina\u2019s lawyers were ponderous and severe, Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s either show-and-dazzle, or relied on tearing (unsuccessfully) at the credibility of \u201csnitch\u201d witnesses who testified in pursuit of commuted sentences. Falcone had two pentiti turncoats, notably Tommaso Buscetta, on whose \u201ctheorem\u201d their case was based. Andrea Goldbarg and her prosecution team had 16; Mexicans, it seems, do not set store by omert\u00e0, the oath of silence. But what is there to learn about the rise and fall of these two men, how they did business, and the fallout of their isolation in jail? Both dealt in commodities without which American and European societies are apparently unable to function: mostly heroin in Riina\u2019s case, mostly cocaine and methamphetamine in Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s. Both practised that trade with commercial acumen, and enjoyed systemic corruption of the societies wherein they operated. The glaring difference: Riina was tried by his compatriots, Guzm\u00e1n by a foreign power. Italy has the US as an ally in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, but it is not its neighbour and master. Riina\u2019s early career was hallmarked by canny guile, forging alliances to establish the primacy of his Corleone clan over other families from Palermo. But Riina broke with perverse codes of \u201chonour\u201d which Cosa Nostra took seriously: no female or child victims, minimum collateral casualties. And he declared overt war not only on rivals in the \u201csecond Mafia war\u201d but a state that was itself compromised by mafia influence. Riina ordered high-profile murders: of Communist leader Pio La Torre; General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa; Piersanti Mattarella, president of Sicily whose brother Sergio is now president of the Republic \u2013 and, at another level, infamously, a 13-year-old, kidnapped, strangled and dissolved in acid \u2013 by way of warning to others. It was war against society too: the Christmas train bombing of 1984, the Uffizi galleries eight years later.

But when Riina died in 2017, the author on matters mafia Clare Longrigg wrote that Riina \u201calmost destroyed Cosa Nostra\u201d. Guzm\u00e1n had a mentor of a kind that Riina did not: F\u00e9lix Gallardo, godfather and founder of the first real narco-corporation, the Guadalajara cartel of the 1980s. Like Riina, Guzm\u00e1n built his cartel initially by forging alliances \u2013 it even came to be called \u201cLa Federaci\u00f3n\u201d. El Chapo fought wars, but never against the state per se. He didn\u2019t need to; Guzm\u00e1n preferred conviviality with power. His trial told Mexicans what they already knew, and North Americans what they suspected: that the state apparatus was bought top-to-bottom: presidents bribed, army generals on the payroll, police commanders likewise, protecting contraband tunnels and even smuggling drugs themselves; police escorts for consignments of cocaine. \u201cI may not be the president of Mexico,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said, even while imprisoned, \u201cbut in Mexico I\u2019m the boss.\u201d Through the other end of the same lens, power needed Guzm\u00e1n too, in a way that the Italian state, faced with lower levels of violence, did not need the mafia. A pyramidal narco-order in Mexico wherein everyone knows their place, including law enforcement, can be guarantor of a \u201cPax Mafiosa\u201d, whereby both pyramid and state join forces against wilder, unrulier clans. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s wars were different, and differently self-defeating, from Riina\u2019s. Unable to accept the division of US-border smuggling plazas designated by Gallardo to heirs of the old Guadalajara cartel, Guzm\u00e1n picked them off one by one, laying claim to the entire frontier. Confederates \u2013 the Arellano F\u00e9lix cartel in Tijuana, the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and even that of the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva brothers with whom Guzm\u00e1n grew up \u2013 became enemies, escalating hyper-violence to levels that surpassed Sicily\u2019s worst nightmares. While Riina disappeared one boy in acid, Santiago Meza L\u00f3pez \u2013 \u201cEl Pozolero\u201d, the pork stew-maker \u2013 who defected from the Arellano brothers to Guzm\u00e1n, dissolved hundreds. Both Cosa Nostra and the Sinaloa cartel became multinational, global conglomerates, through alliances, franchises and brute force. As such, they enjoyed the services of illustrious American and British banks that embraced and cleaned their vast profits with impunity, too big to prosecute even when they were caught. Both Riina and Guzm\u00e1n thus blurred the line between crime and capitalism; they knew their trade as well as any graduate from Harvard Business School. As Riina said: \u201cI reached the fifth year of elementary school. A career in Cosa Nostra doesn\u2019t need a laureate degree.\u201d Both broke the law, but gave the lie to legality. Guzm\u00e1n made the added calculation that profit margins were highest at the retail end, ousting Colombian distribution networks in the US \u2013 which had, ironically, replaced Sicilian control after the Gotti trial of 1992. But strength of scale became weakness of control. Both \u201cshorties\u201d can claim to have operated the last truly pyramidal cartels, but neither man really controlled their respective syndicates single-handedly, whatever the judgments at trial. The respective \u201cCupole\u201d or high-domes, of Cosa Nostra and the Sinaloa cartel were incapable of cohesion. No one knew who to trust: Riina was probably betrayed by a more business-minded, less bellicose don, Bernardo Provenzano. El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel imploded between factions and he was likely shopped by its co-founder, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d, who disagreed with Guzm\u00e1n over succession and strategy. Differences came to a head with El Mayo\u2019s disdain over discussions for a proposed biopic with Sean Penn. Violence worsens in mafia-land when the plates shift, the plaza is unquiet, chains of command are challenged or disturbed, when the hive gets kicked. Like when you smash a ball of mercury and it becomes a flurry of little balls flying around. This is what happened as Falcone hammered into Cosa Nostra, and when President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico\u2019s latest war on drugs in 2006. And what has been happening in Mexico since Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest, extradition and fall. What might be called \u201cnarco-genealogy\u201d comes into play. The decade of the Maxi trial was also that of the rise of the Neapolitan Camorra, partly because of its efficacy in allying with Colombian syndicates in time for the cocaine boom, partly because if Cosa Nostra was a patrician corporation, Camorra was opportunist, understanding the zeitgeist of new free-market forces better than patronage or \u201chonour\u201d. It was leaner and meaner, had a horizontal, not vertical, organisation, no \u201ccupola\u201d or central command. Likewise, while Guzm\u00e1n and Zambada built the Sinaloa edifice, new kids on the block paid little heed to its ways with politicians, police chiefs and generals. Los Zetas took a leaf from the Camorra\u2019s opportunism and free-rolling structure, developed new technology as propaganda and imposed terror on their terrain. In Sinaloa country, you find people to praise Guzm\u00e1n; in the Zetas\u2019 Tamaulipas, you don\u2019t mention their name. Guzm\u00e1n never wrenched control from Los Zetas of the lucrative Gulf coast and routes through Nuevo Laredo into Texas, busiest trade corridor in the world. The Sinaloa cartel remains a force. Recent investigations in Nari\u00f1o, Colombia, show it maintaining control of the Pacific waterfront at Tumaco, the port through which a third of all Colombian cocaine passes. But the leader now, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada is ill with reported bone cancer. And there comes a time when even newcomers come of age. Even the Zetas stretch and weaken, so that those balls of mercury come rather to resemble nuclear fission, as ever-smaller bands, gangs, rogue police forces and \u201cout-sourced\u201d affiliates vie to fill vacuums in the international and domestic markets for drugs. So a third-tier business model emerges, rebellious grandchildren to the dons. In Italy, the \u2018Ndrangheta of Calabria established themselves conclusively in the late 1990s, and in Mexico the ferocious new C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n \u2013 once outsiders and terrorist impostors, now major players on the international crime scene. As these groups battle to expand turf, there\u2019s every chance that Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s demise and conviction will increase, not abate, violence in Mexico, already at its highest levels ever since his extradition. Guzm\u00e1n said: \u201cWhen we are good, nobody remembers us. When we are bad, nobody forgets us.\u201d While real-life Chapo rots in jail but lives on through Netflix, the people to watch now are Nemesio \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera Cervantes, leader of the CJNG, and others whose names we do not know. Victor Clark Alfaro, a mafia expert who has watched cartels come and go in Tijuana since the 1980s, last month recalled narcos of yore flashing their wealth around discos and restaurants. But \u201ctheir heirs are invisible\u201d, he says. \u201cThey are businessmen, they\u2019re people you\u2019d meet at the country club. For the first time in three decades, I cannot name their leaders to you.\u201d That\u2019s the distance we\u2019ve come past Riina and now Guzm\u00e1n. Because narco traffic is a system, not a syndicate and certainly not a single boss. That\u2019s the fantasy of the \u201ckingpin\u201d strategy under which both \u201cshorties\u201d were convicted: you put away the kingpin and solve the problem. Wrong: the more that system changes, the more it stays the same and the more violent it gets \u2013 so long as demand sustains and the money finds a safe house. For all the mutations and heredity from Falcone to Goldbarg, both old cartels and new splinters defy even the rules of markets at which they are so adept: increasing supply to meet insatiable demand, without suffering a drop in retail price. Drugs know no recession. With Riina dead and El Chapo locked away, \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada becomes the old doyen godfather, having never seen the inside of a jail cell during 50 years in the business. Philosopher too: he told the publisher of Proceso magazine, Julio Scherer, during the only interview he ever gave, in 2010: \u201cThe drug trade involves millions of people. How to master them? Well, as for the capos, locked up, dead or extradited, their replacements are already among us.\u201d The war against his kind \u201cis a lost war\u201d. Why lost? asked Scherer. \u201cBecause the narco is rooted in society, just like corruption,\u201d replied El Mayo.

The grant pledged by the Sackler Trust is going through our internal review process in line with our ethical fundraising policy and charitable objectives.\u201d</p> <p>Goldin began her campaign against the Sacklers after recovering from an addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. In 2014 she was prescribed OxyContin for tendonitis in her left wrist. She now demands that arts institutions in America and Britain refuse further Sackler donations and argues the family should instead start paying for treatment and rehabilitation for opioid addicts.</p> <p>Representatives of Mortimer\u2019s, the London-based branch of the family, oversee the Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation and have made grants amounting to \u00a380m. Goldin said if other institutions where her work is displayed continue to take Sackler money she will plan \u201csome kind of intervention\u201d.</p> <p>This weekend a V&amp;A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are grateful for the generosity of donors who make charitable donations to support our public programme, help care for the collection and invest in our facilities.

The grant pledged by the Sackler Trust is going through our internal review process in line with our ethical fundraising policy and charitable objectives.\u201d Goldin began her campaign against the Sacklers after recovering from an addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. In 2014 she was prescribed OxyContin for tendonitis in her left wrist. She now demands that arts institutions in America and Britain refuse further Sackler donations and argues the family should instead start paying for treatment and rehabilitation for opioid addicts. Representatives of Mortimer\u2019s, the London-based branch of the family, oversee the Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation and have made grants amounting to \u00a380m. Goldin said if other institutions where her work is displayed continue to take Sackler money she will plan \u201csome kind of intervention\u201d. This weekend a V&amp;A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are grateful for the generosity of donors who make charitable donations to support our public programme, help care for the collection and invest in our facilities. All donations are reviewed against the V&amp;A\u2019s gift-acceptance policy, which includes due diligence procedures, considers reputations risk, and outlines best practice within the sector. This policy is reviewed on an annual basis by our senior management team and board of trustees.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2019 to align more closely the first sentence with the headline.",

It is a dining room where the most fundamental of emotions are tended to. Our lunch begins with a version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/poutine-the-posh-chips-and-gravy-taking-over-the-world\" title=\"\">poutine</a>, the Montreal classic of chips under a magnificent armed assault by cheese and long-braised meats. It ends with a build-your-own ice cream sundae, looking like something from a children\u2019s picture book. In between is a display of extremely assured, confident cooking designed purely to please rather than to dazzle. As a result, it is its own kind of dazzling.</p> <p>It\u2019s a decade since I last reviewed Tristan Welch\u2019s food, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/05/restaurants.foodanddrink\" title=\"\">Launceston Place</a> in Kensington. Back then he was a young man, hunkering down in London\u2019s culinary trenches, determined to win an imagined war to prove he was as cutting edge as any Japanese multi-layered blade. He had ideas, technique and clever bits of kit. He was damn well going to use all three. It felt like he was cooking for gongs rather than his diners.</p> <p>Mackerel fillets came with both foams and pickles of cucumbers. Lobster arrived with a soup of green cobnuts. A frozen bitter-lemon parfait was forced to make friends with a thyme sorbet. It was impressive and, ultimately, exhausting. And all this in a softly carpeted, downlit room in subdued shades of grey, which made you feel like you were in an expensive Swiss clinic, where crisp-linened nurses did things to you with well-lubricated tubing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f6dd2d28261b989c1f02600c27b3d428c3aee88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6dd2d28261b989c1f02600c27b3d428c3aee88/0_229_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parker's Tavern poutine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That\u2019s bold\u2019: the poutine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parker\u2019s Tavern, inside the re-invigorated <a href=\"https://universityarms.com/\" title=\"\">University Arms Hotel</a>, is a different matter entirely. A version first opened in 1834, but this is very much a new proposition and here no one will interfere with you. It looks like a cross between a gentleman\u2019s club and a Parisian bistro. There are banquettes in blood-orange leather. There are wood-block floors, wood-panelled walls in gun-metal grey hung with vaguely interesting prints, acres of white tablecloth and airy views across Parker\u2019s Piece, from which the restaurant takes its name. You will imagine coming here for a quick bite; you won\u2019t want to leave.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the menu, which walks a jagged line through both British chophouse classics and something rather better travelled. It\u2019s the nerdy attention to detail. The meaty sauce with those chips has been fretted over, possibly for days. Sizeable cuts of beef went in; only fragments remain. There is an edge of piquancy, and something else, too, which turns out to be unadvertised lardons. Not mentioning pork products in your beef sauce? Blimey. That\u2019s bold. Our waiter apologises profusely when I raise it. I tell him I was merely curious; that unexpected outbreaks of pig are never going to distress me. Others may be less sanguine. Likewise, I suspect there will be purists who will eye-roll their way through the dish complaining it\u2019s not poutine because it doesn\u2019t have cheese curds (fresh milk just coagulated with rennet). Frankly, I think the melting tumble of aged cheddar used here is very much more the thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05392c7da37e8f4d19f2a6cbb745bb13988f03f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05392c7da37e8f4d19f2a6cbb745bb13988f03f9/0_102_5360_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tandoori quail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A whole quail has been given a seeing-to by a crimson tandoori marinade\u2019: tandoori quail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the more restless part of the starters list, there is a whole quail, given a seeing-to by a crimson tandoori marinade so good it would get the nod from the Pakistani grill houses down London\u2019s Whitechapel Road. It is a bold punch of roasted spice, garlic and ginger. I eat the bird with my hands until my fingers are stained red. Underneath is a rugged dal, alongside ribbons of cucumber in a yogurt dressing to cool things down.</p> <p>From nearer home comes an impeccable fish cake, far heavier on fish than cheap fillers. But what makes it \u2013 and the other two dishes we try \u2013 is the lake of sauce. Welch\u2019s kitchen has a killer line in luscious, sparky butter emulsions; the sort that brings velvety lubrication to the most grinding of days. This one has the glorious detail of finely chopped boiled egg alongside the capers and parsley. I\u2019m suddenly overcome by the urge to pipe a roaring rendition of Jerusalem, so I can stand and salute it as an emblem of all that is good and true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b32793c05f0bd11445b448540e0e2a77b1bd8b01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b32793c05f0bd11445b448540e0e2a77b1bd8b01/0_278_5500_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parker's skate wing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dish of the day: skate wing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then comes a main course of chicken blanquette and now I want to bend the knee. It reads like an old stager but here it is shiny and new. Instead of the stew the word blanquette suggests, it\u2019s a couple of braised legs, scattered with shavings of black truffle. There\u2019s a pillow of mash so soft and luxurious you could put a baby down on it for a nap, and then another stupidly encouraging cream, butter sauce with just the right punch of acidity.

      "bodyText": "Parker\u2019s Tavern, University Arms Hotel, Regent Street, Cambridge CB2 1AD (01223 606 266). Starters \u00a37-\u00a316, mains \u00a314-\u00a326, desserts \u00a35-\u00a38, wines from \u00a320 Cambridge is a city of furrow-browed intellect, which is why it needs a restaurant like Parker\u2019s Tavern. It is a dining room where the most fundamental of emotions are tended to. Our lunch begins with a version of poutine, the Montreal classic of chips under a magnificent armed assault by cheese and long-braised meats. It ends with a build-your-own ice cream sundae, looking like something from a children\u2019s picture book. In between is a display of extremely assured, confident cooking designed purely to please rather than to dazzle. As a result, it is its own kind of dazzling. It\u2019s a decade since I last reviewed Tristan Welch\u2019s food, at Launceston Place in Kensington. Back then he was a young man, hunkering down in London\u2019s culinary trenches, determined to win an imagined war to prove he was as cutting edge as any Japanese multi-layered blade. He had ideas, technique and clever bits of kit. He was damn well going to use all three. It felt like he was cooking for gongs rather than his diners. Mackerel fillets came with both foams and pickles of cucumbers. Lobster arrived with a soup of green cobnuts. A frozen bitter-lemon parfait was forced to make friends with a thyme sorbet. It was impressive and, ultimately, exhausting. And all this in a softly carpeted, downlit room in subdued shades of grey, which made you feel like you were in an expensive Swiss clinic, where crisp-linened nurses did things to you with well-lubricated tubing. Parker\u2019s Tavern, inside the re-invigorated University Arms Hotel, is a different matter entirely. A version first opened in 1834, but this is very much a new proposition and here no one will interfere with you. It looks like a cross between a gentleman\u2019s club and a Parisian bistro. There are banquettes in blood-orange leather. There are wood-block floors, wood-panelled walls in gun-metal grey hung with vaguely interesting prints, acres of white tablecloth and airy views across Parker\u2019s Piece, from which the restaurant takes its name. You will imagine coming here for a quick bite; you won\u2019t want to leave. It\u2019s not just the menu, which walks a jagged line through both British chophouse classics and something rather better travelled. It\u2019s the nerdy attention to detail. The meaty sauce with those chips has been fretted over, possibly for days. Sizeable cuts of beef went in; only fragments remain. There is an edge of piquancy, and something else, too, which turns out to be unadvertised lardons. Not mentioning pork products in your beef sauce? Blimey. That\u2019s bold. Our waiter apologises profusely when I raise it. I tell him I was merely curious; that unexpected outbreaks of pig are never going to distress me. Others may be less sanguine. Likewise, I suspect there will be purists who will eye-roll their way through the dish complaining it\u2019s not poutine because it doesn\u2019t have cheese curds (fresh milk just coagulated with rennet). Frankly, I think the melting tumble of aged cheddar used here is very much more the thing. From the more restless part of the starters list, there is a whole quail, given a seeing-to by a crimson tandoori marinade so good it would get the nod from the Pakistani grill houses down London\u2019s Whitechapel Road. It is a bold punch of roasted spice, garlic and ginger. I eat the bird with my hands until my fingers are stained red. Underneath is a rugged dal, alongside ribbons of cucumber in a yogurt dressing to cool things down. From nearer home comes an impeccable fish cake, far heavier on fish than cheap fillers. But what makes it \u2013 and the other two dishes we try \u2013 is the lake of sauce. Welch\u2019s kitchen has a killer line in luscious, sparky butter emulsions; the sort that brings velvety lubrication to the most grinding of days. This one has the glorious detail of finely chopped boiled egg alongside the capers and parsley. I\u2019m suddenly overcome by the urge to pipe a roaring rendition of Jerusalem, so I can stand and salute it as an emblem of all that is good and true. But then comes a main course of chicken blanquette and now I want to bend the knee. It reads like an old stager but here it is shiny and new. Instead of the stew the word blanquette suggests, it\u2019s a couple of braised legs, scattered with shavings of black truffle. There\u2019s a pillow of mash so soft and luxurious you could put a baby down on it for a nap, and then another stupidly encouraging cream, butter sauce with just the right punch of acidity. And if this meal is starting to sound like it should come with a side order of statins, followed by a gentle chat with a dietician about life choices, it isn\u2019t experienced like that. This is largesse, delivered daintily. The fish of the day is skate wing. Clearly, it has been given the same care as everything else. It doesn\u2019t so much slip from the cartilage, as obligingly curl itself around your fork. Naturally, there is an impeccable beurre blanc.

Consider the following from the International Society of Political Psychology: \u201cStudies have been largely silent on whether EU attitudes are also shaped by people\u2019s attitudes towards the principles and practices of supranational governance. This research provides a first test of the nature and role of supranational attitudes. \u201cWe introduce a new measure of supranationalism and, in two studies using samples drawn from the British population, test the psychometric properties of the supranationalism scale. We then identify the socio-ideological correlates (rightwing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation) of supranationalism, along with its effects in predicting EU attitudes and post-Brexit preferences.\u201d Where we were looking for illumination and hope, what do we get but a study that seems to show that academics and insight are all too often mutually exclusive? Mind you, they are not alone. Consider this from the Department for Work and Pensions: \u201cA good example of how the Department has already altered its approach to acting on frontline intelligence is by making staff feedback loops an integral part of the Universal Credit (UC) design process, which uses an iterative and participative process to bring frontline experience to the heart of design activity.\u201d My correspondent offers a helpful translation: \u201cWe intend to take more notice of what our staff tell us.\u201d And what exactly are we meant to make of our defence secretary, Gavin Williamson.

Sexually Skyping with someone who turned out to be a minor. Blocking his then-wife\u2019s career. Offering creepy-sounding \u201chelp\u201d to young female artists. Threatening suicide when women didn\u2019t respond quickly enough\u2026 </p> <p>Away from Adams, who has denied the allegations, a good name for this might be \u201cneedy predator\u201d, a toxic masculinity honed to such a degree that it can mute itself to evade detection. For such types, where better to hide and flourish than in the role of liberal/sensitive/navel-gazing/feminist-simpatico/outsider singer-songwriter?</p> <p>These days, mournful singer-songwriters seem to make up 90% of the music industry. Nor are needy predators confined to music, though in my former job as a music hack there seemed to be plenty around. Why would some people resort to such behaviour and not others? As with so much in rock music, this issue frequently seems to hinge on sexual success and whether, perhaps, that success predates stardom. While there are always exceptions, the less sensitive \u201ccock rockers\u201d (and their equivalent in all genres) tend to exude sexual success that predates their career \u2013 they give the impression that they\u2019d always been quite the catch, whether rock stars or bin men. With cock rockers, it\u2019s a transaction (wish-fulfilment of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle) with their (mainly male) audience. While this doesn\u2019t excuse vile predatory behaviour, women are at least forewarned up to a point.</p> <p>The same transparency is not evident with the perma-tortured singer-songwriter, also working their muso status as a chat-up line, just in a sneakier way (\u201cI\u2019d love to hear your songs\u201d; \u201cLet me help with your career\u201d). A young woman might respond to such attention, especially, say, when it comes from a proved sensitive muso, artists who had spent their career virtue-signalling to the point where, as someone said to me, you wonder what they\u2019re hiding.</p> <p>One could also wonder if, before success, such types struggled to get women to notice them? Whether beyond the angst and self-loathing expressed in their art, there\u2019s a whole other mess of self-pity, anger, rejection and wheedling, manipulative sexual behaviour they\u2019re not admitting to. A mess that\u2019s been internalised, that success failed to soothe, a little voice deep inside saying that women started bothering with them only when they became successful musicians, so they may as well take advantage. Who knows if any of this applies to Ryan Adams? </p> <p>In my experience, self-hate can be the eighth wonder of the entertainment industry. For certain people, self-hate manifests as a fire, burning down everything and everyone. Certainly, women should be wary of men who so deftly conceal a brand of toxic masculinity under cloaks of artsy, liberal-presenting respectability and integrity. Sometimes, it really is the quiet ones \u2013 and not in a good way.</p> <h2>Warding off witches?

Experts say they could date to the 14th century. How fascinating. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 they were discovered at Creswell Crags, on the Northamptonshire/Derbyshire border, deep in the Midlands. That\u2019s right \u2013 goth country.</p> <p>I know about this, as someone from the Midlands, who has been cruelly outed as a former goth, in photographs from my youth that could yet prove to have been digitally altered for blackmailing purposes.

      "bodyText": "The allegations against the US singer-songwriter Ryan Adams are complex and gruesome. Sexually Skyping with someone who turned out to be a minor. Blocking his then-wife\u2019s career. Offering creepy-sounding \u201chelp\u201d to young female artists. Threatening suicide when women didn\u2019t respond quickly enough\u2026 Away from Adams, who has denied the allegations, a good name for this might be \u201cneedy predator\u201d, a toxic masculinity honed to such a degree that it can mute itself to evade detection. For such types, where better to hide and flourish than in the role of liberal/sensitive/navel-gazing/feminist-simpatico/outsider singer-songwriter? These days, mournful singer-songwriters seem to make up 90% of the music industry. Nor are needy predators confined to music, though in my former job as a music hack there seemed to be plenty around. Why would some people resort to such behaviour and not others? As with so much in rock music, this issue frequently seems to hinge on sexual success and whether, perhaps, that success predates stardom. While there are always exceptions, the less sensitive \u201ccock rockers\u201d (and their equivalent in all genres) tend to exude sexual success that predates their career \u2013 they give the impression that they\u2019d always been quite the catch, whether rock stars or bin men. With cock rockers, it\u2019s a transaction (wish-fulfilment of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle) with their (mainly male) audience. While this doesn\u2019t excuse vile predatory behaviour, women are at least forewarned up to a point. The same transparency is not evident with the perma-tortured singer-songwriter, also working their muso status as a chat-up line, just in a sneakier way (\u201cI\u2019d love to hear your songs\u201d; \u201cLet me help with your career\u201d). A young woman might respond to such attention, especially, say, when it comes from a proved sensitive muso, artists who had spent their career virtue-signalling to the point where, as someone said to me, you wonder what they\u2019re hiding. One could also wonder if, before success, such types struggled to get women to notice them? Whether beyond the angst and self-loathing expressed in their art, there\u2019s a whole other mess of self-pity, anger, rejection and wheedling, manipulative sexual behaviour they\u2019re not admitting to. A mess that\u2019s been internalised, that success failed to soothe, a little voice deep inside saying that women started bothering with them only when they became successful musicians, so they may as well take advantage. Who knows if any of this applies to Ryan Adams? In my experience, self-hate can be the eighth wonder of the entertainment industry. For certain people, self-hate manifests as a fire, burning down everything and everyone. Certainly, women should be wary of men who so deftly conceal a brand of toxic masculinity under cloaks of artsy, liberal-presenting respectability and integrity. Sometimes, it really is the quiet ones \u2013 and not in a good way. Warding off witches? More like signs of a goth haunt Anti-witch markings \u2013 scrawls and gouges on walls meant to protect humans from demons and the like \u2013 have been found in English caves. Experts say they could date to the 14th century. How fascinating. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 they were discovered at Creswell Crags, on the Northamptonshire/Derbyshire border, deep in the Midlands. That\u2019s right \u2013 goth country. I know about this, as someone from the Midlands, who has been cruelly outed as a former goth, in photographs from my youth that could yet prove to have been digitally altered for blackmailing purposes. But I digress\u2026 My question: as the Midlands is such a major goth heartland, can experts be certain that the marks weren\u2019t made by a bunch of bored teenage goths in\u2026 well, any time period really? Clues might include: discarded hair crimpers nearby, perhaps a half-drunk bottle of cider, scattered pages of handwritten poetry that\u2019s clearly been sobbed over (themes: eternal darkness, existential despair, the occasional dragon or griffin), evidence that someone has tried to give themselves a tattoo armed only with a Biro and a school compass. While one doesn\u2019t wish to discredit the anti-witch markings of Creswell Crags, the location makes this former goth Midlander just a tad suspicious. A table for one is nothing new. I\u2019ve been doing it for years In New York, there\u2019s a rising trend for eating alone and some restaurants have amended their menus and tables to cater for this.

One delay is one too many but context is vital too.</p> <p>Your article was based on a small audit from a single London hospital, using outdated information going back four years. There was precious little explanation about how mental health services are improving or what is driving demand for care. In London alone, the number of young people\u2019s mental health beds are up almost 25% since 2017.</p> <p>Nationally, 126 more beds have opened in areas of greatest need \u2013 with plans for another 40 within weeks. We know from listening to young people and their families that they want specialist support closer to home. The NHS long-term plan is ramping up community care, investing in earlier support through schools-based counselling and introducing new waiting time standards. </p> <p>Widening access by 70,000 more children and young people each year by 2020/21 is just the start. By 2023/24, an extra 345,000 more children and young people will get help each year, backed by annual funding increases that will outpace the overall growth in health spending over the next five years.</p> <p>Significant progress is being made but mental health is everyone\u2019s responsibility.

I agree. However, global warming and climate change are benign terms, so I suggest that we use global weather chaos (GWC) to describe the frequent worldwide extremes of polar vortices, blizzards, hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves and forest fires. Today\u2019s high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and, thus, temperature rises are clearly partly linked to human-related emissions. </p> <p>Could today\u2019s GWC be evidence of an Earth pushed to new extremes? Could a great CO2 \u201ccrash\u201d occur for as yet unknown reasons and usher in a rapid glacial era? I like Mann\u2019s phrase \u201cweaponisation of ignorance\u201d. Maybe, if fast freezing was considered a remote but possible outcome, his \u201cill-informed citizenry\u201d might be more ready to act now to promote reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. <em>Game of Thrones</em> might be right: winter is coming.<br><strong>Rod Allan</strong><br>Burlington, Ontario<br>Canada<br></p> <h2>Hobsbawm\u2019s choice<br></h2> <p>Neal Ascherson tells us that Eric Hobsbawm had an \u201cexasperating and exasperated\u201d relationship with the Communist party of Great Britain, never \u201cquite beyond the pale\u201d but always on the edge, sustained in part by an internal \u201ccriticism of the leadership\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/10/eric-hobsbawm-life-in-history-richard-j-evans-review\" title=\"\">The radical whose faith never wavered</a>\u201d, the New Review). Yet this was a man who, Ascherson also tells us, backed the Nazi-Soviet pact and the USSR\u2019s invasion of Finland, and expressed sympathy for Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski, head of the murderous Soviet secret police.</p> <p>As Ascherson doesn\u2019t say, he also stayed in the CPGB, despite Khrushchev\u2019s \u201csecret speech\u201d in 1956, and remained a CPGB member almost until the wall came down. In which case, one has to ask what service Hobsbawm might have performed for the party had he been less of an alleged dissident and more a wholly committed ideologue.<br><strong>Terry Philpot</strong><br>Limpsfield Chart, Surrey<br></p> <h2>The ethics of arts funding<br></h2> <p>Peter Bazalgette, former chair of Arts Council England, now executive chairman of ITV, thinks \u201cBP have been magnificent supporters of the arts\u201d and \u201cwould happily take money from them\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/03/arts-funding-booker-prize-how-sponsors-make-money-ethical-tide\" title=\"\">Can the arts afford to be too fussy about how sponsors make their money?</a>\u201d, Focus). Why? Because he can \u201csee everyone driving around in cars, so I think that is reasonable\u201d.</p> <p>Ruth Mackenzie, the British arts director and curator and London head for the Arts Council, is of the same mind, saying: \u201cWe should agree there is no such thing as totally clean money. After all, I don\u2019t ask the people buying tickets for my shows where their money comes from.\u201d </p> <p>Would Bazalgette have the same view in America \u2013 we see people everywhere with guns, so it is reasonable to take money from arms manufacturers? Maybe he and Mackenzie should take into account the fact that air pollution in London is the cause of 9,000 premature deaths each year and where the annual limit for car pollutants is exceeded within the first few weeks.</p> <p>Private funding can be good for arts organisations, but it can also be precarious. Arts leaders should be leading the call for ethical partners and leading campaigns against cuts in funding for Arts Council England.</p> <p>You may not know where your customers get their money, but you should do your best to ensure your own hands are clean.

      "bodyText": "As a mental health nurse since 1984, stories like this never get easier to read (\u201cSuicidal children face long delays for mental health care\u201d, News). One delay is one too many but context is vital too. Your article was based on a small audit from a single London hospital, using outdated information going back four years. There was precious little explanation about how mental health services are improving or what is driving demand for care. In London alone, the number of young people\u2019s mental health beds are up almost 25% since 2017. Nationally, 126 more beds have opened in areas of greatest need \u2013 with plans for another 40 within weeks. We know from listening to young people and their families that they want specialist support closer to home. The NHS long-term plan is ramping up community care, investing in earlier support through schools-based counselling and introducing new waiting time standards. Widening access by 70,000 more children and young people each year by 2020/21 is just the start. By 2023/24, an extra 345,000 more children and young people will get help each year, backed by annual funding increases that will outpace the overall growth in health spending over the next five years. Significant progress is being made but mental health is everyone\u2019s responsibility. We now need wider society to stand side by side with the NHS and look take a long, hard look at what more we can do together to protect young people\u2019s wellbeing. Claire Murdoch, national director for mental health at NHS England Winter is coming Michael Mann says that an outcome of global warming and climate change is the occurrence of more heat records and that polar vortices may have the same cause (\u201cUsing the big freeze to deny climate change\u2026 stupidity or cynicism?\u201d Comment). I agree. However, global warming and climate change are benign terms, so I suggest that we use global weather chaos (GWC) to describe the frequent worldwide extremes of polar vortices, blizzards, hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves and forest fires. Today\u2019s high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and, thus, temperature rises are clearly partly linked to human-related emissions. Could today\u2019s GWC be evidence of an Earth pushed to new extremes? Could a great CO2 \u201ccrash\u201d occur for as yet unknown reasons and usher in a rapid glacial era? I like Mann\u2019s phrase \u201cweaponisation of ignorance\u201d. Maybe, if fast freezing was considered a remote but possible outcome, his \u201cill-informed citizenry\u201d might be more ready to act now to promote reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Game of Thrones might be right: winter is coming. Rod Allan Burlington, Ontario Canada Hobsbawm\u2019s choice Neal Ascherson tells us that Eric Hobsbawm had an \u201cexasperating and exasperated\u201d relationship with the Communist party of Great Britain, never \u201cquite beyond the pale\u201d but always on the edge, sustained in part by an internal \u201ccriticism of the leadership\u201d (\u201cThe radical whose faith never wavered\u201d, the New Review). Yet this was a man who, Ascherson also tells us, backed the Nazi-Soviet pact and the USSR\u2019s invasion of Finland, and expressed sympathy for Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski, head of the murderous Soviet secret police. As Ascherson doesn\u2019t say, he also stayed in the CPGB, despite Khrushchev\u2019s \u201csecret speech\u201d in 1956, and remained a CPGB member almost until the wall came down. In which case, one has to ask what service Hobsbawm might have performed for the party had he been less of an alleged dissident and more a wholly committed ideologue. Terry Philpot Limpsfield Chart, Surrey The ethics of arts funding Peter Bazalgette, former chair of Arts Council England, now executive chairman of ITV, thinks \u201cBP have been magnificent supporters of the arts\u201d and \u201cwould happily take money from them\u201d (\u201cCan the arts afford to be too fussy about how sponsors make their money?\u201d, Focus). Why? Because he can \u201csee everyone driving around in cars, so I think that is reasonable\u201d. Ruth Mackenzie, the British arts director and curator and London head for the Arts Council, is of the same mind, saying: \u201cWe should agree there is no such thing as totally clean money. After all, I don\u2019t ask the people buying tickets for my shows where their money comes from.\u201d Would Bazalgette have the same view in America \u2013 we see people everywhere with guns, so it is reasonable to take money from arms manufacturers? Maybe he and Mackenzie should take into account the fact that air pollution in London is the cause of 9,000 premature deaths each year and where the annual limit for car pollutants is exceeded within the first few weeks. Private funding can be good for arts organisations, but it can also be precarious. Arts leaders should be leading the call for ethical partners and leading campaigns against cuts in funding for Arts Council England. You may not know where your customers get their money, but you should do your best to ensure your own hands are clean. This isn\u2019t something to be flippant about; for many, it\u2019s a matter of life and death. Mike Morris Toxteth, Liverpool Crisis in further education While I appreciate that schools are under budgetary pressure (\u201cSchools staff crisis looms as teachers\u2019 salaries fall by 10%\u201d, News), there is a bigger crisis in our further education colleges. Schools received extra funding for a 3.5% pay award this year; FE colleges did not. Schools received funding for \u201clittle extras\u201d in the last budget; FE colleges did not. Funding for FE colleges has been frozen since 2013. Teachers in FE colleges are paid on average \u00a37,000 less than teachers in schools. It is becoming impossible for colleges to attract and keep the skilled staff they need, particularly in areas such as engineering and construction. Many FE teachers stay through loyalty to their students and the college, but this is unsustainable. If we are to train the post-Brexit generation of skilled individuals, we must be able to pay our staff properly. This requires additional and sustained increases to the funding rate per student. The country\u2019s future depends on providing high-quality training and that depends on being able to attract and retain skilled FE teachers. Dr Alison Birkinshaw, principal and CEO, York College York Football and Brexit entwined Anthony Clavane\u2019s article about football as a refuge from economic woes misses one important point (\u201c\u2018Football brings people together. But it won\u2019t feed us if Nissan goes\u2019\u201d, News). In the last three seasons, almost all teams relegated from the top flight of English football have come from a Brexit supporting town, most notably Sunderland, whose decline from grace post the Brexit vote has been faster than Nissan\u2019s. Not much of a refuge if your team, whether Sunderland, Stoke City, West Brom, Swansea, Middlesbrough or Villa, disappears from the top division, while it doesn\u2019t look much better for Brexit-supporting Huddersfield now.

      "bodyText": "Airlines are cracking down on a ticketing loophole that can knock thousands of pounds off the cost of travel \u2013 but the fight back is only giving more publicity to the advantages of \u201chidden city\u201d travel. At its most simplistic, hidden city ticketing is when a passenger purchases a ticket to less popular and thus cheaper destination that happens to be routed through a more popular, and thus pricier hub destination, and gets off there, skipping the last leg of their journey. Anyone can do it, providing you travel only with carry-on luggage. It\u2019s a dodge people have done for years but thanks to renewed publicity \u2013 and websites that take the leg work out of finding the best fares \u2013 airlines have called in their lawyers. Proof of the industry\u2019s new willingness to act against the long-established practice came in an Berlin court last week where Lufthansa is redoubling its efforts to sue a European business class traveller who used a hidden city ticket to save thousands on a transatlantic flight. According to a court document, an unnamed male passenger booked a return flight from Oslo to Seattle, which had a layover in Frankfurt. He skipped the final, Frankfurt to Oslo return flight, flying to Berlin on a separate ticket. The switch, which sounds innocuous enough, cost Lufthansa around \u20ac2,112 (around \u00a31,864 or $2,385), the amount the airline is now seeking to reclaim from the customer. Whether the scheme was illegal or not is up for debate. Lufthansa\u2019s case \u2013 was thrown out of a Berlin court in December and is now under appeal. But the airline\u2019s action reveals the industry\u2019s determination to close the loophole. Once a practice offered by knowing travel agents, it\u2019s since been now automated through sites like Skiplagged \u2013 to the evident annoyance of airlines who claim they are in effect being deprived both of revenue from travel to the passenger\u2019s intended destination and the ability to sell the seat that\u2019s been skipped. If previous attempts to challenge \u201chidden city ticketing\u201d in the US are anything to go by, the German carrier may find the benefit of identifying and pursuing passengers who fail to complete their journeys under the terms of their ticket hardly worth the costs. According to airline industry analyst Robert Mann, the issue of hidden city ticketing has always been out there but it was only when websites including the US-based Skiplagged began to commercialize the system that the industry took notice. \u201cAirlines pricing is arcane to say the least, especially when pricing can vary by a factor of 10 for almost the same product, but if a customer chooses to use the ticket or a portion of it that\u2019s inconsistent with the terms of sale, it becomes an issue. If the practice becomes common knowledge, and attempts to use it increase, it goes from being a tiny hole in a big bucket to a huge hole spilling out revenue.\u201d In 2015 the booking firm Orbitz and carriers in the US sued Skiplagged, which at the time was claiming one million visitors a month, citing 22-year-old founder Aktarer Zaman for \u201cunfair competition\u201d and \u201cdeceptive behavior\u201d, and alleging that the site promoted \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d travel. The case against Zaman was ultimately thrown out over issues of jurisdiction. Mann believes the Lufthansa\u2019s decision to take action may be one of scale. Gaming the system within the US may cost airlines a few hundred dollars, based on the company\u2019s ability to re-sell the seat that wasn\u2019t used, but with international fares running into the thousands, the stakes for the airlines are significantly raised. \u201cThis is a highly competitive industry so when it comes to international ticketing the numbers become big enough not to ignore very quickly,\u201d Mann says. The practice of hidden city ticketing also holds dangers for passengers. An airline may not notice that a ticket holder has not shown up for a part of flight, but if the practice is repeated or obvious, customers may find themselves stranded in the wrong city, find that the return portion of their trip has been voided, or that they\u2019ve been removed from loyalty programs. In some instances, passengers have found themselves met at the gate by airline attorneys and challenged with a demand for additional fees. The law is as yet unclear on these cases. \u201cIt\u2019s a calculated risk,\u201d said Mann, \u201cbut the numbers are big enough to make it a felony in some cases.\u201d As Lufthansa\u2019s decision to appeal the case makes clear, airlines are now willing to put those dueling positions to test again, this time in a Berlin court.",

      "bodyText": "Penny Wong has indicated Labor will target the Paladin offshore detention security contract in Senate estimates this week, accusing the government of failing to explain why the company was awarded $420m in contracts through closed tender. The Australian Financial Review has reported that Paladin Group\u2019s $420m of contracts to provide security to refugees on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea was extended by the home affairs department in January after a closed tender process. On Sunday the attorney general, Christian Porter, defended the home affairs minister Peter Dutton, who has said he had \u201cno sight\u201d of the tender process. Porter told ABC\u2019s Insiders that \u201cstandard procurement processes are often at arms-length from the minister\u201d. The host Barrie Cassidy put to him the contracts were unusual given it is a \u201clittle-known Singapore company with a registered address on Kangaroo Island\u201d which is a beach shack at the end of a dirt road. \u201cThis was the subject of a fund independent commonwealth procurement process and I\u2019m sure that the claims will be investigated,\u201d Porter replied. Wong told reporters in Adelaide the Paladin contract had \u201ca lot of questions around it\u201d and it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d a company with \u201csuch a poor track record\u201d was awarded $420m. Wong accused Porter of giving answers that were \u201cnot consistent\u201d with Dutton\u2019s because \u201cthis went to a closed tender \u2013 not an open tender, [it was] not an open competitive process\u201d. Wong accused Dutton of \u201ctrying to wash [his] hands of it\u201d. \u201cTomorrow is Senate estimates \u2013 what I\u2019d say to the government is: stop hiding. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you front up and tell the truth about why that contract is awarded in such circumstances, why it went to closed tender?\u201d Porter also continued the Morrison government\u2019s attacks that the medevac bill, which passed parliament over government objections, represents an incentive for people-smuggling operations to Australia, despite the fact the new medical assessment procedures only apply to the current cohort of people in offshore detention. The medevac bill sets up a process for an independent medical panel to force a medical transfer from offshore detention unless the minister overrules it on security grounds or if the person has a \u201csubstantial criminal record\u201d. Porter said that although the \u201cprimary legal observation to make [is] that the legislation is not prospective\u201d the fact that Labor had \u201csoftened\u201d the rules was \u201canother observation that\u2019s no less important and no less real\u201d. \u201cAnd there is some implausibility about the notion that they wouldn\u2019t take that opportunity again if in government for a future cohort. \u201cAnd both of those observations are as real as each other.\u201d Labor has insisted that the legal changes only apply to asylum seekers that are already on Manus Island or Nauru, meaning there is no incentive for asylum seekers to attempt to come to Australia now. Porter said the \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d of the home affairs minister to refuse medical transfers had \u201cnow totally changed\u201d and the government is \u201cvery concerned\u201d that people \u201creasonably suspected\u201d of criminal conduct \u2013 but not convicted \u2013 cannot be refused. Porter defended the government\u2019s decision to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre, which has lead some critics to accuse it of encouraging people smugglers to restart their trade by suggesting Australia\u2019s borders were weakened as a result. Independent MP Kerryn Phelps \u2013 the architect of the medevac bill \u2013 has responded to reports of potential future people-smuggling operations by noting it was the Liberal Party who \u201csent up the signal that Christmas Island is reopening\u201d. Porter said it was a \u201crational\u201d response to deal with the expected \u201cinflux of hundreds of people\u201d that may transfer out of offshore detention for medical treatment. Despite fears of future boat arrivals, six refugees interviewed by Guardian Australia said that neither they nor anyone they knew would be willing to attempt the journey. On Sunday the prime minister\u2019s office released a two-minute video message from Morrison, expected to be translated into 15 languages and aired in 10 countries considered asylum-seeker hot spots. \u201cMake no mistake, if you attempt to come to Australia illegally by boat, you will not succeed,\u201d the prime minister says. \u201cSo do not waste your money or risk your life, or anyone else\u2019s life, for nothing.\u201d",

Virtually all our guests comment on the beauty of the valley and its quiet, pristine appearance. The mine would kill that.

This beautiful valley delivered, and we have been blessed with a wonderful life here. We raised four children and two of them have come home as they too were seeking the life they grew up with, to live and work in a beautiful place with fresh air, clean waterways and a vibrant community.</p> <p>Fourteen years ago, John and I planted grapevines and started a small business called Faulls Ridge Wine. Our grapes are sent away to be made into three varieties of wine which we sell to our local business houses, townspeople and the large number of tourists that visit Gloucester regularly and come to our farm for a wine taste. Over the last 14 years, our business has grown and we have spent a considerable amount of time, effort and money to build this tourist venture. The Rocky Hill coalmine will have an incredibly negative effect on our business. People come to this region because of the beauty, serenity and clean environment; they certainly will not come if that coal mine comes to town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11d35fc1034abb614c5344377aa960e2c55cb54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d11d35fc1034abb614c5344377aa960e2c55cb54/0_73_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeanette Spagnolo and Catherine Clarke wrote in to Guardian Australia.

We had decided to migrate to Australia from our heavily industrialised and mining region of England. The Gloucester region was so much more beautiful than we could ever imagine \u2013 we were in awe of the stunning mountain ranges, rivers you could swim in, remote areas you could walk in safely and the warmth and friendliness of country people.</p> <p>We chose to settle in Barrington, where my husband set up business and my parents purchased the Barrington Store. They did a roaring trade because they were open when other businesses were closed - especially with campers, kayakers and those visiting the Barrington Tops.</p> <p>In 1996 the TRA (Tourism Research Australia) stats showed a tourism value of $9m to the Gloucester economy; when I retired in 2017 the value was $51m \u2013 a slow but sustainable growth. There were approximately 11 tourism accommodation providers in 1996, there is now well over 60. Camping on the beautiful riversides has experienced extraordinary growth.</p> <p>I have been involved in initiating and continuing a program to encourage people to relocate to Gloucester to live over the last 15 years and this has been very successful. The reason people decide to relocate here is the visual amenity, clean air and a vibrant community.</p> <p>Visitors to Gloucester love the natural beauty of the area, particularly accessing the world heritage Barrington Tops. Many of them would say that coalmines would ruin the aesthetics of the area and that they would not come back again should mining occur.</p> <p>As with hundreds of others, we have stayed and we have contributed. We love our community, Gloucester is our home town, and most of all we want it to remain a healthy, safe environment for our grandchildren and for all of those who continue to live here \u2013 just the way we have experienced it.</p> <h2>Michael Manikas</h2> <p><em>Minyang nyura wubaliyn?

Jack was also known as the King of the Barrington Blacks </p> <p> \u2026 the last of the traditionally initiated elders from the region prior to the family being displaced from Gloucester.</p> <p>Jack realised with the displacement of the Aboriginal people from the area the traditional ways were ending therefore he buried the King Stone on the Bucketts, because it was regarded as \u201cthe most sacred tribal ground\u201d. This King Stone was similar in significance to Uluru to the local people of Gloucester. By allowing the proposed mine to proceed it would destroy a significant part of the chance we, the descendants of Jack and Jessie Cook, have in understanding the history of our family. Culture is a key component to addressing many of the health issues currently experienced by Aboriginal Australians. </p> <p>Importantly connection to \u2018country\u2019 is a foundation of culture.

All these locations are scattered though the Gloucester area and proposed mining site or adjacent to the site. Many cannot be identified due the sacred nature of the sites. If the mine progresses all this history will become a mystery to the descendants of Jack and Jessie Cook.</p> <p>Over the last 10 to 15 years, our family, which currently numbers over 700 living individuals, has been coming together from all over Australia on a regular basis back on that land. Kinship groups are beginning to develop, many of us are learning to speak the language and as a result of reconnecting on that land we are collectively rediscovering our culture. This land is becoming the gathering place for generations of the Cook family to enable us all to complete the jigsaw puzzle of our family history and share it with the younger generations of the family.</p> <p>Knowledge has been retained by many of our elders and we are in the early phases of capturing and collating that knowledge. We\u2019re learning where the sacred ceremonial sites were for women\u2019s business and men\u2019s business, along with other important areas. The mine\u2019s own environmental report highlights finding important artefacts around the area. We just don\u2019t know the full extent of the importance of this area. </p> <p>If the mine goes ahead, the family will lose some of our connection with each other and with this place as the land will be destroyed. The culture and connection we have been rebuilding will be once again lost. </p>",
