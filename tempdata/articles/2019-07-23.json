      "body": "<p>Amber Rudd and Liz Truss arrived together. At just the wrong moment. They looked up in panic to see the photographers were all pointing their cameras elsewhere. Professional politicians to the last, they both stopped dead in their tracks and rummaged in their handbags for some imaginary items. Glancing up to make sure the snappers had now noticed them, the two cabinet ministers started walking forward again. What was the point of turning up to an event like this if your appearance went unrecorded?</p> <p>Upstairs, the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre was hosting the world\u2019s largest gathering of psychoanalysts for their biennial congress. None of them are going to be short of work in the weeks and months ahead. Indeed, there were several hundred potential patients downstairs for what was more a jobs fair than a Tory party leadership announcement.</p> <p>Here in the hall every pathology was on view. The smug, the needy, the desperate, the amoral and the deluded. And that was just Boris Johnson. Elsewhere we had Tory MPs pushing one another aside to catch the eye of Gavin Williamson and Grant Shapps, who were revelling in their status as Team Boris fixers-in-chief. \u201cGizza job, I love Boris, me,\u201d they mewled pathetically. Jo Johnson merely sat chained to his seat in the second row, alongside his father and his sister. A newly converted Brexiter by birth if not by belief.</p> <p>Others tried to get get in front of any passing TV camera to express their devotion, while brown-noser <em>par excellence</em> John Hayes settled for telling Sajid Javid that \u2018the Treasury surely awaits\u2019. Slobber, slobber. Javid might make it to the Treasury a little sooner if Hayes were to remove his head from his arse.</p> <p>There were some absentees, though. No Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart or David Gauke. All soon to disappear to the backbenches. Spare a thought too for Matt Hancock, a man who has yet to find a principle he won\u2019t betray for the advancement of his own career. He was stuck at health questions trying to explain why the green paper on further reducing the sugar content of drinks had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/23/health-secretary-buries-paper-smoking-obesity-johnson\">nothing to do with him, even though it had been his idea</a>. Hancock is very much hoping to become the first minister for obesity.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later than planned, the lights dimmed and a short video of great Conservative prime ministers was screened. Ted Heath was airbrushed out of history. Which could be the best legacy for which Johnson can hope. Then party chairman Brandon Lewis took to the stage to declare that the leadership contest had shown the very best of the Tory party.

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd and Liz Truss arrived together. At just the wrong moment. They looked up in panic to see the photographers were all pointing their cameras elsewhere. Professional politicians to the last, they both stopped dead in their tracks and rummaged in their handbags for some imaginary items. Glancing up to make sure the snappers had now noticed them, the two cabinet ministers started walking forward again. What was the point of turning up to an event like this if your appearance went unrecorded? Upstairs, the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre was hosting the world\u2019s largest gathering of psychoanalysts for their biennial congress. None of them are going to be short of work in the weeks and months ahead. Indeed, there were several hundred potential patients downstairs for what was more a jobs fair than a Tory party leadership announcement. Here in the hall every pathology was on view. The smug, the needy, the desperate, the amoral and the deluded. And that was just Boris Johnson. Elsewhere we had Tory MPs pushing one another aside to catch the eye of Gavin Williamson and Grant Shapps, who were revelling in their status as Team Boris fixers-in-chief. \u201cGizza job, I love Boris, me,\u201d they mewled pathetically. Jo Johnson merely sat chained to his seat in the second row, alongside his father and his sister. A newly converted Brexiter by birth if not by belief. Others tried to get get in front of any passing TV camera to express their devotion, while brown-noser par excellence John Hayes settled for telling Sajid Javid that \u2018the Treasury surely awaits\u2019. Slobber, slobber. Javid might make it to the Treasury a little sooner if Hayes were to remove his head from his arse. There were some absentees, though. No Theresa May, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart or David Gauke. All soon to disappear to the backbenches. Spare a thought too for Matt Hancock, a man who has yet to find a principle he won\u2019t betray for the advancement of his own career. He was stuck at health questions trying to explain why the green paper on further reducing the sugar content of drinks had nothing to do with him, even though it had been his idea. Hancock is very much hoping to become the first minister for obesity. Fifteen minutes later than planned, the lights dimmed and a short video of great Conservative prime ministers was screened. Ted Heath was airbrushed out of history. Which could be the best legacy for which Johnson can hope. Then party chairman Brandon Lewis took to the stage to declare that the leadership contest had shown the very best of the Tory party. Not the strongest sales pitch, given the generally dismal levels of debate between Jeremy Hunt and Johnson. Still, I guess Lewis must have feared it could have been even worse. When Cheryl Gillan, the acting chair of the 1922 Committee, made the expected declaration that Boris had won, everyone in the front 10 rows stood up and started cheering. And wouldn\u2019t stop. No one wanted to be marked out as the first person to stop cheering and sit down. On and on it went, with every Tory MP glancing sideways, determined to outlast the others.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been put on notice by rebel Conservatives that he will not survive long as prime minister unless he drops his no-deal Brexit agenda, as he stands on the brink of entering Downing Street. Johnson is expected to be announced as the choice of the Conservative party to be the next prime minister on Tuesday morning after running a campaign against Jeremy Hunt that promised to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d. On the eve of his probable coronation by the Tory membership, several senior Conservatives sent warning shots that his hardline Brexit plans put him on a collision course with parliament. Rory Stewart, a former leadership rival, joined Philip Hammond and David Gauke in telling Johnson he would quit the cabinet before the new prime minister takes office rather than serve under him. In a further ominous move for Johnson, Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, resigned dramatically to launch an attempt to test whether the new prime minister could command a majority among MPs. Duncan\u2019s proposal for an emergency House of Commons debate on support for Johnson was turned down by the Speaker, but it was a sign that some Conservatives are already organising to make life difficult for the new incumbent of No 10. Duncan said he had \u201cvery grave concerns that Johnson flies by the seat of his pants\u201d and branded his former boss \u201chaphazard and ramshackle\u201d, but publicly insisted he was trying to be helpful to the new prime minister by ending speculation about whether MPs supported the new incumbent in No 10. The motion stated: \u201cThat this House has considered the merits of the newly chosen leader of the Conservative party, and supports his wish to form a government.\u201d However, it opened up the possibility that Johnson might fail to demonstrate he had the support of parliament, leaving Theresa May potentially unable to recommend him as her successor to the Queen on Wednesday. Conservative backbenchers fighting no deal are not planning to bring down Johnson immediately, with one serious critic of the frontrunner saying the party \u201cwould take a very, very dim view of getting rid of him before he has done anything yet\u201d. But several Conservative MPs said they would regard Johnson\u2019s first speech to the nation and cabinet appointments as a test of whether he was capable of reaching out across parliament to find a majority for a plan to leave the EU that can find approval from Eurosceptics and more moderate Brexit supporters. If he does not, then organisation will start again in earnest to prevent him pursuing a no-deal Brexit, with some senior Tories already sending out feelers about the possibility of a \u201cnational unity\u201d government with opposition MPs. A senior source on Johnson\u2019s transition team said that, as the new Tory leader, he would immediately emphasise \u201cunity\u201d and the need to bring the party and the country back together. The rebels are prepared to give Johnson the summer to see if he can make headway towards coming to a fresh agreement with the EU that avoids no deal but will make their moves against him after that if he takes the government full tilt towards a no-deal Brexit. One former minister said a \u201csizeable chunk\u201d of the 42 Tories who voted against a no-deal Brexit last week were prepared to put their own careers on the line to stop Johnson pursuing that path \u2013 either through a legislative block on leaving the EU without a deal or a confidence vote if that proves impossible. He said what Johnson said on the steps of Downing Street on Wednesday would be crucial, as his critics within the party will be infuriated and galvanised to action if he \u201ctries to act like he has a majority of 150\u201d or goes down the path of \u201cTrumpian rhetoric\u201d that forgets the country is split on Brexit. Another rebel Tory, Philip Lee, a former health minister pushing for a second referendum, said: \u201cIt is going to be really challenging for him to govern. I don\u2019t see how he has got a majority to govern. It\u2019s a very, very fragile situation with only a tiny majority.\u201d Johnson will have a majority of just two if the party loses the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection this month to the Liberal Democrats. His majority was eroded further on Monday by the withdrawal of the whip from Charlie Elphicke, a Tory backbencher charged with three counts of sexual assault against two women.
