      "bodyText": "A 28-day time limit on immigration detention could save the public purse up to \u00a335m a year, a report by economic data consultants has found, prompting renewed calls for ministers to bring an end to the indefinite jailing of suspected illegal immigrants. The UK has one of the largest immigration detention systems in Europe and is the only country in the region without a statutory time limit on length of detention. The human rights group Liberty commissioned Cambridge Econometrics to examine the costs of jailing suspected illegal immigrants and the potential savings that could be achieved by introducing a 28-day cap on detention. The report, which has been sent to the Home Office and seen by the Guardian, concludes that after taking into account the costs of potential alternatives to detention, such as community support projects, the government could save the taxpayer between \u00a325m and \u00a335m. Sam Grant, the policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: \u201cLocking people up with no release date always has a devastating human cost \u2013 now we know it has a financial cost, too. This report shows the government has a clear opportunity to create a cheaper, more humane system by introducing a 28-day time limit. \u201cThis win-win policy would save the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds while making sure fewer people are detained and for shorter amounts of time. It\u2019s time the government listened to growing pressure from the public and all political parties and ends indefinite detention.\u201d There have long been calls for a cap to be introduced on immigration detention. Most recently, the home affairs select committee, chaired by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, said the Home Office\u2019s approach to immigration detention was careless and cavalier and called for a 28-day time limit. Last July, in a statement to parliament following the publication of a report by the former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephen Shaw into conditions in immigration detention centres, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he would review how time-limited detention worked in other countries to better inform the debate in the UK. In 2017-18, Home Office expenditure on detention was \u00a3108m. Under a 28-day immigration detention time limit, Cambridge Econometrics found there were potential long-term cost savings of \u00a355m to \u00a365m a year. The report said plausible alternatives cost less than detention, with an estimated cost range of \u00a36m to \u00a330m. In 2018, about 25,000 people entered detention and a similar number left, lower than the historical trend. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of people entering and leaving detention ranged from 26,000 to 30,000 each year, with the exception of 2015, when this climbed to 32,400 entering detention and 33,200 leaving. On average, about 65% of people detained are released within 28 days, the report said, while 95% are released within six months and 99% within a year. The 2018 figures show a possible departure from this trend, with a higher proportion of people released within 28 days, 69%. However, Home Office statistics going back to 2010 also show individual cases of people being held for much longer, including more than four years in some instances. In addition, many people can also face multiple stints of detention and redetention, which is not reflected in Home Office statistics. Detainees are held in eight detention centres and two short-term holding facilities. Eight are in England, one in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere has been much debate about the introduction of a 28-day time limit, but as Stephen Shaw noted, it rests mainly on slogans rather than evidence.

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating comments by a Ukip candidate in the European elections speculating about whether he would rape the MP Jess Phillips amid growing concern over threats to politicians. Carl Benjamin, Ukip\u2019s candidate for South West England, sent a tweet to the MP for Birmingham Yardley in 2016 saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even rape you.\u201d He added to the comments in a recent video saying: \u201cWith enough pressure, I might cave.\u201d West Midlands police confirmed officers were examining whether an offence had been committed. It comes as fears grow that toxic rows over Brexit in the run-up to European parliamentary elections later this month will further coarsen public debate. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, will be questioned about the safety of MPs when she appears before parliament\u2019s human rights committee on Wednesday. Benjamin, who is known online as Sargon of Akkad, uploaded a clip to YouTube last month where he added to his original comments. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s been an awful lot of talk about whether I would or wouldn\u2019t rape Jess Phillips. I suppose with enough pressure I might cave, but let\u2019s be honest nobody\u2019s got that much beer.\u201d After news of police interest in Benjamin\u2019s comments emerged, Phillips said she was verbally challenged about it by a member of the public as she left parliament. \u201cJust leaving Westminster and and man ran down the street alongside me asking me about why Carl Benjamin shouldn\u2019t be able to joke about my rape. Shouting: \u2018I pay your wages,\u2019\u201d the MP tweeted. Phillips earlier told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire that she recently broke down in tears in Birmingham city centre \u201cjust because I felt the enormous weight of years and years and years of abuse\u201d. The Labour MP, a frequent target of online trolls, said: \u201cI realised that I did what all women do in these situations \u2013 I had been putting a brave face on it and pretending that it was all fine. \u201cIt dawned on me that, for four years essentially, this man had made a career out of harassing me. And I felt harassed. I felt \u2018How can somebody say that they would rape me if forced, and be a legitimate candidate in an election?\u2019\u201d She said: \u201c[It is] one thing when he was just some idiot off the internet but it\u2019s a different thing when he is standing on the same platforms I am standing on, that he will potentially go to a parliament himself as an elected representative.\u201d West Midlands police confirmed that a complaint of \u201cmalicious communications\u201d had been received. \u201cOfficers have spoken to Ms Phillips and the comments are being investigated to establish if an offence has taken place,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, appeared alongside Benjamin at the launch of the party\u2019s European election campaign last month and defended the comments as a form of \u201csatire\u201d. Asked to respond on Tuesday, Batten said Benjamin would remain as a Ukip candidate despite an outcry over his comments. \u201cI condemn all jokes about rape - they are not funny and never appropriate and I have told Carl to keep to the serious political issues in this campaign,\u201d he said. Dozens of MPs have warned that the Brexit crisis has led to a point where they regularly receive death and rape threats via social media. The Conservative chair of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan, has blamed the language of some Conservative Brexiters for helping to inspire threats against MPs. Security for MPs was stepped up after the murder of the Labour backbencher Jo Cox in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum. Benjamin refused to apologise at a news conference in London last month for his initial post, accusing media outlets of \u201csmearing\u201d him. He said his words should be treated in the same way that other satirists have raised taboo subjects. \u201cI think we should treat women the same as men. That means if a woman is being a giant bitch and laughing at male suicide, I\u2019m going to be a giant dick back to her,\u201d he said. Phillips was inundated with messages of support from the public and fellow politicians after speaking out about Benjamin\u2019s comments. Former Labour colleague Luciana Berger offered \u201csolidarity\u201d and Change UK MP Anna Soubry tweeted: \u201cProud to standby you Jess and send you love and support.\u201d The government officially accepted on Tuesday that it could not get its Brexit deal through parliament in time to avoid European elections on 23 May. Theresa May\u2019s effective deputy David Lidington confirmed that elections to the European parliament would go ahead.",

But she insisted it was worth continuing talks nevertheless.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nothing has been agreed yet. The discussions today were very robust and we are having further meetings this week where we hope to make some progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>Long-Bailey added that the two parties plan to \u201chold further more detailed discussions as the week progresses\u201d and said both sides are \u201chopeful that progress can be made\u201d. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we\u2019ve said previously, the government needs to move on its red lines. We expect to make compromises but, without a government that is willing to compromise, it\u2019s difficult to see how any agreement can be reached and I think the government is aware of that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if there was any point in continuing, given the lack of willingness to compromise she said had been shown by the government, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course there\u2019s a point continuing. We want to resolve this issue for all of our constituencies, whether they were leave seats or remain seats and there certainly is, from my perception of the meetings that we have had so far, a willingness on both sides to move towards some kind of consensus and we certainly need to try.</p> </blockquote> <p>Long-Bailey also confirmed that Labour would seek to press Downing Street on detailed plans for a customs union but reiterated that the government had so far declined to move from its initial position.</p> <p>And she said Labour\u2019s had not altered its position on a public vote, which she said was \u201cone of many options on the table\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1125837483214802948\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today&#39;s Brexit talks were &quot;the most robust to date&quot;, and &quot;occasionally tense&quot;, according to one Labour source - with John McDonnell and Keir Starmer picking apart the Tories&#39; claim to have made concessions on a customs union.</p>&mdash; Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1125837483214802948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1125840400072237057\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Labour source close to talks adds, &quot;What was on the table was politically and legally worthless.&quot;</p>&mdash; Paul Brand (@PaulBrandITV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1125840400072237057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-07T19:12:12.926Z\">at 8.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cd1c7ee8f086f179813d042\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-07T18:04:07.054Z\">7.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The talks between Labour and the Tories have broken up without an agreement this evening \u2013 and will reconvene in search of one tomorrow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1125823225089462273\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Talks are over for tonight: Downing Street spox says they were &quot;constructive and detailed,&quot; and teams will meet again tomorrow. <a href=\"https://t.co/77gO30Y5AC\">https://t.co/77gO30Y5AC</a></p>&mdash; Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1125823225089462273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd1c6708f084f582f895024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-07T17:57:22.437Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on the Cabinet Office\u2019s confirmation that the UK will take part in the European elections, Change UK\u2019s <strong>Chuka Umunna</strong>, has said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit in the form it was promised to the British people is impossible to deliver.

Only a handful of Tories have backed the idea. But there are some signs now that that is starting to change.</p> <p>On Friday <strong>Eric Pickles</strong>, a former Tory MP who now sits in the House of Lords, said that, much to his own surprise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/02/local-elections-2019-results-votes-counted-live-news?page=with:block-5ccc57588f084f582f89290f#block-5ccc57588f084f582f89290f\">he had now come round to the view that, if MPs cannot pass a deal, the public should be asked to decide.</a></p> <p>And today <strong>Daniel Kawczynski</strong> told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live that, if the Commons cannot reach an agreement, a second referendum will become \u201cinevitable\u201d. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we cannot do this, if this is beyond us, and if we fail, then another referendum is inevitable. </p> <p>If we fail, if there can be no compromise between the parties, I can actually see then the logic, and other people will be demanding another referendum. And those like me who have genuine concerns about what will happen to our society if we go through this process again, we will lose that debate over the referendum, because it will be the only option then left available to try to break the gridlock that we\u2019ve entered into. </p> <p>And it will be the fault of these people in the Conservative party \u2013 in the ERG [European Research Group], and others \u2013 who refuse to compromise. I can\u2019t begin to explain how worried and angry I am at their lack of being able to compromise and listen to what their constituents have to say.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is significant about this is that Kawczynski is a Brexiter. And not just a routine Brexiter but someone who at one point felt so strongly about this that he took the unusual step of writing to the Polish government (he was born in Poland) <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/polish-born-mp-accused-of-reckless-attempt-to-block-brexit-delay-11615428\">asking it to veto an article 50 extension. </a>But a few weeks ago Kawczynski had a change of heart. He resigned from the ERG, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, and he voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal at the end of March, having previously voted against it. Today he told Radio 5 Live that the ERG were so intransigent that their tactics could lead to Brexit being overturned. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Talking to them, I think they are so obsessed with this issue, and they are so determined not to compromise in any way, they feel almost as if any form of compromise is some sort of betrayal. And certainly that narrative, one gets a great deal on Twitter: \u2018This is a betrayal\u2019, \u2018This is a betrayal to the country\u2019, \u2018We are not fulfilling what the British people voted for\u2019.

But legally, they do have to take place - unless our withdrawal has been given legal effect - so those will now go ahead. </p> <p>But we will be redoubling our efforts and talks with MPs of all parties to try to make sure that the delay after that is as short as possible. Ideally we\u2019d like to be in a situation where those MEPs never actually have to take their seat at European parliament, certainly to get this done and dusted by the summer recess. </p> <p>That will mean effort, hard work and compromise from different political parties, people from both the leave side and the remain side in the European debate. But I think that is what is in the national interest - deal with the outcome, respect the outcome of the referendum of 2016 and leave the European Union with a deal that protects jobs, investment and living standards in this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>This means that the government is, in practice, setting two new potential deadlines for getting the withdrawal agreement, and the accompanying legislation, passed.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lidington says the government now hopes to get the Brexit agreement passed by Tuesday 2 July. </strong>That is when MEPs will take their seats in the newly-elected European parliament. Lidington says \u201cideally\u201d British MEPs will not need to fall back. But, as a fallback, he says the agreement should \u201ccertainly\u201d be passed by the summer recess.

Now he leads a new party, the Brexit party, and some polling suggests it is on course to win the European elections by<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/02/european-parliament-voting-intention-brex-30-lab-2\"> a nine-point margin</a>. That would be a much bigger win than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014/eu-uk-results\">Ukip\u2019s win (under Farage) in the same elections five years ago.</a></p> <p>Farage abandoned Ukip after it embraced far-right Islamophobia under its current leader, Gerard Batten, but on Brexit he is not softening his message. Far from it. Three years ago, during a referendum event hosted by the Guardian, Farage implied he would be happy with a Norway-style Brexit (ie, a soft Brexit, with the UK staying in the single market). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/15/guardian-eu-referendum-debate-with-farage-clegg-alan-johnson-and-leadsom-live?page=with:block-56e877e5e4b0d6cdda530267#block-56e877e5e4b0d6cdda530267\">Norway was rich, happy and successful, he said. </a>What would be wrong with that? </p> <p>Now he wants no-deal - or a WTO Brexit, as he calls it. He also has ambitions to break open the Westminster two-party political system.</p> <p>Here are the main points from the news conference.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Farage said a Brexit party victory at the European elections would amount to the country voting for a WTO [World Trade Organisation] Brexit.</strong> He and <strong>Richard Tice</strong>, the Brexit party chairman, repeatedly referred to a WTO Brexit, but the same concept is more commonly referred to as a no-deal Brexit, particularly by those opposed to the idea.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Farage said the Brexit party should be allowed to help negotiate Brexit if it won the European elections.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In terms of legitimacy, if the Brexit party wins this election arguing for a WTO Brexit, and we get significant support and we win, I think we will have democratic legitimacy to have a say in how we proceed from here. The new date we have is 31 October. We absolutely believe that the UK must, must, must leave on that date. And if we were part of that discussion, I think we could offer them a very sensible way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Tice said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A vote for the Brexit party is a clear vote for a WTO Brexit, no ifs, no buts.</p> <p>Secondly, a vote for the Brexit party is a vote that our elected MEPs should play a significant role in the future negotiating team. We will demand such a role because we will be the party with the biggest, the most clear democratic mandate to be involved with those negotiations. </p> </blockquote> <p>Farage and Tice called for the Brexit party to be included in the UK negotiating team even though their preferred option, a WTO Brexit, would not really require a negotiation at all. If the UK were to leave without a deal, it would become the default. Farage was asked to explain this apparent inconsistency, but sidestepped the question. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/may/07/brexit-latest-news-developments-hunt-stresses-need-for-compromise-as-cross-party-talks-on-compromise-plan-resume-live-news?page=with:block-5cd15bf68f087d3be8784d59#block-5cd15bf68f087d3be8784d59\"> 11.23am.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Farage claimed some major Tory donors were considering giving money to his new party.</strong> He said that the party had already raised more than \u00a32m, with more than 95% of that coming in \u00a325 sums online. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that may be about to change. I say that because there are now a few, much bigger donors, traditionally donors to the Conservative party, who we are now in conversation with, because they understand and realise that to fight a general election seriously we\u2019re going to need big bucks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed his party would win millions of votes at a general election if Westminster failed to deliver a hard Brexit. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the clean break Brexit is not delivered, then my view would that the Brexit party in a general election would get many, many more votes than the 4m I managed to get as leader of Ukip all those years ago ...</p> <p>I do not believe we will ever get a meaningful Brexit with this current government and this current parliament and this current political class. So, unless they listen to whatever we are able to do on 23 May, and perhaps about to do on 6 June at Peterborough, unless there is a fundamental shift in terms of what MPs are prepared to deliver, we are going to have to start to replace them in significant numbers.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Brexit party was today starting to recruit general election candidates.</strong> He said the party wanted to find a new sort of MP.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want 650 men and women ... with real-world experience, people who either in civic life or business life have got some achievements under their belt.

Here is an extract from one of the mini essays, by <strong>A</strong><strong>nand Menon and Matthew Bevington</strong>, entitled \u201cDo the elections matter for Brexit?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The traditional \u2018grand coalition\u2019 groups look set to lose their overall majority [in the European parliament] for the first time. This introduces uncertainty, both in terms of who the next commission president will be but also about the process involved in selecting them. If, as looks likely, the two largest groupings \u2013 the S&amp;D and EPP \u2013 have to rely on the liberal group (ALDE) to form a stable majority for deciding on major posts, this will have a substantive impact. </p> <p>To take one hypothetical example. A commission led by Michel Barnier \u2013 a far from implausible outcome should the spitzenkandidaten process fail to deliver a candidate who can win majority support in the parliament \u2013 could be expected to cleave closely to the approach adopted by the article 50 task force to date. A different commission president might, by contrast, take issue with that approach (we have already seen signs of tension between Barnier and Juncker over Brexit).</p> <p> And, of course, the new parliament will play a significant role when it comes to agreeing a future relationship between the UK and the EU. Warning signs are there already. The European parliament, for instance, rejected a motion offering tentative support to limited trade talks with the US. It did so because a coalition of the Socialists, Greens and far-right groupings insisted on conditions for such talks. They demanded that the existing negotiating directives for EU-US (TTIP) trade negotiations be revoked, and inserted several conditions on any further talks with the US: first, that aluminium and steel tariffs be lifted; second, that the agreement be subject to a carbon impact assessment; and, third, that it includes cars but excludes agriculture. </p> <p>This hints at some of the problems that might confront the UK with a more divided and polarised European parliament. The EU\u2019s talks with the US are now highly politicised following the TTIP saga. The Brexit process to date has raised suspicions concerning the UK\u2019s intentions in Brussels. It is easy to imagine a similar shopping list of preconditions \u2013 on climate change, minimum regulatory standards, inter alia, to be drawn up by MEPs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cd14fd88f087d3be8784cb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-07T09:29:50.165Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here is Sky\u2019s <strong>Beth Rigby</strong> on the cross-party talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1125688668331675648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Update on x-party talks.

To reach an agreement with Labour that locked the United Kingdom into the customs union might pull in enough Labour votes to allow an agreement to limp over the line but the price could be a catastrophic split in the Conservative party and at a time when the opposition is led by dangerous extremists, the consequences for our country would be unthinkable. </p> </blockquote> <p>This morning <strong>Philip Hammond,</strong> the chancellor, played down the prospect of the party dividing. Speaking in Paris, where he is attending a meeting of finance ministers, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Conservative party is a very broad church.

He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don\u2019t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>MPs.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, it was something different, then the result could be different as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning he was back on the programme.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a summary of the day\u2019s events, it\u2019s worth taking in the previous post and reading the afternoon summary (see: 6.06pm). Following the breakup of talks between the government and the Labour party this evening, Rebecca Long-Bailey \u2013 the shadow business secretary \u2013 acknowledged that the previous three weeks of discussions had brought no sign of compromise from Downing Street. But she insisted it was worth continuing talks nevertheless. Nothing has been agreed yet. The discussions today were very robust and we are having further meetings this week where we hope to make some progress. Long-Bailey added that the two parties plan to \u201chold further more detailed discussions as the week progresses\u201d and said both sides are \u201chopeful that progress can be made\u201d. She said: As we\u2019ve said previously, the government needs to move on its red lines. We expect to make compromises but, without a government that is willing to compromise, it\u2019s difficult to see how any agreement can be reached and I think the government is aware of that. Asked if there was any point in continuing, given the lack of willingness to compromise she said had been shown by the government, she said: Of course there\u2019s a point continuing. We want to resolve this issue for all of our constituencies, whether they were leave seats or remain seats and there certainly is, from my perception of the meetings that we have had so far, a willingness on both sides to move towards some kind of consensus and we certainly need to try. Long-Bailey also confirmed that Labour would seek to press Downing Street on detailed plans for a customs union but reiterated that the government had so far declined to move from its initial position. And she said Labour\u2019s had not altered its position on a public vote, which she said was \u201cone of many options on the table\u201d. The talks between Labour and the Tories have broken up without an agreement this evening \u2013 and will reconvene in search of one tomorrow: Commenting on the Cabinet Office\u2019s confirmation that the UK will take part in the European elections, Change UK\u2019s Chuka Umunna, has said: Brexit in the form it was promised to the British people is impossible to deliver. The only way to end the Brexit chaos is to give people the final say, so they can vote based on the reality of Brexit today as opposed to the fantasy sold to people three years ago. Whilst the main parties engage in their secret talks to facilitate a job-destroying Brexit, Change UK is campaigning in these European elections for a People\u2019s Vote in which we will argue unequivocally to remain in the EU. Voting for Change UK will send the clearest possible message to Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn that you want to end this Brexit nightmare. As we mentioned earlier, the prime minister and the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, have been meeting to discuss the former\u2019s future this evening. That meeting\u2019s now concluded but Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about what, if anything, has come out of it. A source would not comment on the meeting, though it was understood to have included discussions on setting a detailed timetable for when May would step down as Conservative leader. More than two thousand people joined the Lib Dems in the days after the local elections, the party has said. The Lib Dems\u2019 Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: This surge in membership shows that more and more people have had enough of the national embarrassment Brexit has become. They deserve better, and the Liberal Democrats demand better. The Liberal Democrats, with over 100,00 members and nearly three thousand councillors across the country, are clearly the strongest party for remain going into the European elections. Every Liberal Democrat vote is a vote to stop Brexit. Earlier today, the Labour MP, Jess Phillips, discussed the effects of the waves of online abuse she has suffered in recent years. That came as police confirmed they were investigating whether Carl Benjamin \u2013 a Ukip European elections candidate who has made comments speculating whether or not he would rape her \u2013 has committed an offence. This evening, she has tweeted this: Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire earlier today, Phillips said she had recently broke down in tears under the weight of years of abuse. I realised that I did what all women do in these situations \u2013 I had been putting a brave face on it and pretending that it was all fine and that I could cope. It dawned on me that, for four years essentially, this man had made a career out of harassing me. And I felt harassed. I felt \u2018How can somebody say that they would rape me if forced, and be a legitimate candidate in an election?\u2019 Theresa May \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d that Britain will have to take part in European elections on 23 May, and is pinning her hopes on completing the Brexit process in time to avoid MEPs having to take their seats. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said the cross-party Brexit talks have reached \u201ccrunch time\u201d. (See 4.39pm.) He was speaking as he arrived for today\u2019s round of negotiations at the Cabinet Office. Here my colleague Heather Stewart assesses how the talks are going. Political leaders in Northern Ireland have begun talks in a fresh effort to break the protracted impasse on power-sharing, with the prime minister, Theresa May, and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, pledging to review progress at the end of the month. Rory Stewart has told MPs that his ambition to become next Tory leader will not interfere with his new job as international development secretary. Stewart has openly said he will stand in the forthcoming Tory leadership contest but, as he gave evidence to the Commons international development committee, the Tory MP Nigel Evans asked how he could be fully committed to his new job when \u201cyou could be in a leadership election in the next few weeks\u201d. Stewart replied: I completely understand where you are coming from. I have some advantages taking over this job. I am probably the only secretary of state who occupied every Commons junior ministerial role in this department before I took over. I understand therefore our programmes in the Middle East, Asia and Africa in enormous detail ... It is true that the prime minister has signalled that she is stepping down and therefore I, and at least half-a-dozen other cabinet colleagues, have expressed interest in succeeding her. But I am sure they, like me, will remain entirely committed to doing our jobs as powerfully as possible. The Scottish government has dropped controversial plans to cut its taxes on aviation after Nicola Sturgeon declared last week the world faces a climate emergency. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar thinks several Brexiters are starting to think a second referendum could now happen, like Daniel Kawczynski. (See 5.14pm.) These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on today\u2019s cabinet. Almost all the MPs who have publicly backed a second referendum on Brexit are opposition MPs who would vote remain again if given the chance. Only a handful of Tories have backed the idea. But there are some signs now that that is starting to change. On Friday Eric Pickles, a former Tory MP who now sits in the House of Lords, said that, much to his own surprise, he had now come round to the view that, if MPs cannot pass a deal, the public should be asked to decide. And today Daniel Kawczynski told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live that, if the Commons cannot reach an agreement, a second referendum will become \u201cinevitable\u201d. He said: If we cannot do this, if this is beyond us, and if we fail, then another referendum is inevitable. If we fail, if there can be no compromise between the parties, I can actually see then the logic, and other people will be demanding another referendum. And those like me who have genuine concerns about what will happen to our society if we go through this process again, we will lose that debate over the referendum, because it will be the only option then left available to try to break the gridlock that we\u2019ve entered into. And it will be the fault of these people in the Conservative party \u2013 in the ERG [European Research Group], and others \u2013 who refuse to compromise. I can\u2019t begin to explain how worried and angry I am at their lack of being able to compromise and listen to what their constituents have to say. What is significant about this is that Kawczynski is a Brexiter. And not just a routine Brexiter but someone who at one point felt so strongly about this that he took the unusual step of writing to the Polish government (he was born in Poland) asking it to veto an article 50 extension. But a few weeks ago Kawczynski had a change of heart. He resigned from the ERG, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, and he voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal at the end of March, having previously voted against it. Today he told Radio 5 Live that the ERG were so intransigent that their tactics could lead to Brexit being overturned. He said: Talking to them, I think they are so obsessed with this issue, and they are so determined not to compromise in any way, they feel almost as if any form of compromise is some sort of betrayal. And certainly that narrative, one gets a great deal on Twitter: \u2018This is a betrayal\u2019, \u2018This is a betrayal to the country\u2019, \u2018We are not fulfilling what the British people voted for\u2019. I think that\u2019s for the birds \u2013 it\u2019s crazy \u2026 I have to say, wouldn\u2019t it be ironic if the ERG, the Eurosceptic caucus, through their intransigence, actually result in another referendum which will potentially overturn the previous result. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who is leading the Labour team in the cross-party Brexit talks with the government, told journalists as he arrived at the Cabinet Office for this afternoon\u2019s negotiating session that this was \u201ccrunch time\u201d. He told reporters: Talks have been going on for some time as we know, but I think the time has now come to a crunch time where the government has to decide whether it\u2019s serious about significant changes capable of actually carrying a majority in the House of Commons. We\u2019re going to be pressing them hard on that this afternoon. Obviously the evidence this weekend was not promising but that\u2019s what we will be discussing this afternoon, whether we can have that significant change that\u2019s actually capable of carrying a majority in the House of Commons. That\u2019s the substance, but also the process, including how we deal with an incoming Tory leader and of course a confirmatory vote will also be on the agenda, and we\u2019re going to discuss that this afternoon. As the Press Association reports, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, followed shortly after the Labour team, telling journalists he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about today\u2019s negotiations. The Lidington announcement does confirms what Jean-Claude Juncker said earlier: \u201cI don\u2019t get the impression that the UK is very accommodating in terms of deadlines.\u201d (See 2.57pm.) Here is the full quote from David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, on the European elections. Parliament has had several occasions to vote on leaving the European Union. So far, every time there has been a majority against leaving with any particularly orderly deal, so we are engaged as a government in talks with the opposition, and with others across parliament, to try and find a way forward that has maximum possible support amongst politicians of all political parties. But what this now means, given how little time there is, is that it is regrettably not going to be possible to finish that process before the date that is legally due for European parliamentary elections. We very much hoped that we would be able to get our exit sorted and have the treaty concluded so that those elections did not have to take place. But legally, they do have to take place - unless our withdrawal has been given legal effect - so those will now go ahead. But we will be redoubling our efforts and talks with MPs of all parties to try to make sure that the delay after that is as short as possible. Ideally we\u2019d like to be in a situation where those MEPs never actually have to take their seat at European parliament, certainly to get this done and dusted by the summer recess. That will mean effort, hard work and compromise from different political parties, people from both the leave side and the remain side in the European debate. But I think that is what is in the national interest - deal with the outcome, respect the outcome of the referendum of 2016 and leave the European Union with a deal that protects jobs, investment and living standards in this country. This means that the government is, in practice, setting two new potential deadlines for getting the withdrawal agreement, and the accompanying legislation, passed. Lidington says the government now hopes to get the Brexit agreement passed by Tuesday 2 July. That is when MEPs will take their seats in the newly-elected European parliament. Lidington says \u201cideally\u201d British MEPs will not need to fall back. But, as a fallback, he says the agreement should \u201ccertainly\u201d be passed by the summer recess. The date for the start of the summer recess has not been announced yet, but normally it is in mid/late July. Today is the deadline for registering to vote in the European elections. My colleague Martin Belam has written a guide about what you need to do to make sure you can take part. The Press Association has just snapped this. European parliament elections will go ahead in the UK on May 23, after the government determined that there is not enough time left to complete the ratification of Brexit before that date, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington has said. This will be no surprise to anyone who has been following politics closely in recent weeks. It was almost inevitable as soon as Theresa May accepted a proposal to delay Brexit until 31 October at the emergency summit before Easter. But until this afternoon, in public at least, the government was insisting that there was a chance of the elections not actually going ahead because there was a possibility of the Brexit legislation being passed before 23 May, polling day. Jean-Claude Juncker has said that taking David Cameron\u2019s advice to stay out of the Brexit referendum campaign was one of his two major mistakes as European commission president. During a press conference in Brussels, as the EU prepares to select Juncker\u2019s replacement, the former prime minister of Luxembourg said his first error early in his tenure had been to react too late to Luxleaks scandal that revealed the scale of tax evasion in his country. He went on: The second mistake I made was to listen too carefully to the British government - Cameron. Because the then prime minister asked me not to interfere not to intervene in the referendum campaign. It was a mistake not to intervene and not to interfere because we would have been the only ones to destroy the lies which were circulated around. I was wrong to be silent at an important moment. Juncker\u2019s comments come ahead of a summit of the 27 leaders of the EU in the Romanian town of Sibiu where the intention is to discuss the big strategic questions facing the EU over the next five years. Brexit is unlikely to feature in the EU\u2019s thinking at the summit but Juncker made a series of barbs about the state of British politics during a pre-summit press conference. Echoing Theresa May, Juncker said the EU27 meeting had been due to take place after the UK\u2019s departure. \u201cBrexit means brexit - but Brexit hasn\u2019t taken place yet,\u201d Juncker said. While switching to English from German, Juncker noted: Everyone understands English. No one understands England - but everyone understands English. Asked about the slipping of the timetable in talks over future relations in the case of the UK and Switzerland, Juncker told reporters: I don\u2019t get the impression that the UK is very accommodating in terms of deadlines. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March. Juncker added of the potential for the UK to remain in the bloc: I don\u2019t have fears, I don\u2019t have hopes. I was saying the other day that by comparison to the British parliament the Egyptian sphinx are open books. Either they stay or they will leave. If they stay, they stay. If they leave, they leave. Nigel Farage has said that, if his new Brexit party wins the European elections, that would amount to a vote for a WTO Brexit and that his party should be included in the team negotiating with the EU. (See 12.54pm.) Theresa May has been warned that the chances of Tory MPs agreeing a Brexit deal are very slim. Speaking on the World at One, before the government/Labour talks resume later this afternoon, Charles Walker, a vice chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, said the chances of the Tory party pulling back together and backing a Brexit deal were \u201cpretty slim\u201d - about \u201cone in five on a good day\u201d. He also said he did not expect Labour to support the deal. I can\u2019t see that it\u2019s in the Labour party\u2019s interest to help the Conservative party out at the moment. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, is also due to be meeting May this afternoon to tell her that Tory MPs want her to give a timetable for standing down if there is no Brexit deal. Nadine Dorries, one of the Tory MPs who wants May to go, posted this on Twitter this morning. Police are investigating whether a Ukip candidate in the European elections who has made comments speculating whether he would or would not rape the MP Jess Phillips has committed an offence. The Northern Ireland parties have arrived at Stormont for talks aimed at reviving the power-sharing executive. The BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack has this briefing note explaining how they are expected to proceed. A watchdog has called for the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales to be raised. As the Press Association reports, individuals suspected of offences can be arrested and charged from the age of 10 under the existing rules. This is lower than in many European countries and \u201cinconsistent with accepted international standards\u201d, according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). It says criminalising children at the age of 10 or 11 can have a detrimental impact on their wellbeing and development, and risks making them more likely to reoffend as adults. The EHRC is calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be \u201csignificantly\u201d raised. The UK is not ruling out the warlord Khalifa Haftar from a role in a future Libyan government despite his attack on the capital, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary has said. Hunt has promised a review into how his department handled the case of Matthew Hedges, the British academic convicted on spying charges by the United Arab Emirates. The organiser of a pro-independence march in Glasgow is facing prosecution over the event\u2019s start time. This morning the Progressive Economy Forum published a report (pdf) explaining how the government could run pilots to test the case for a universal basic income (UBI), a welfare policy that would involve everyone being entitled to a regular payment from the state. As my colleague Richard Partington reports in our preview story, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, commissioned the report and is interested in the idea for possible inclusion in the next Labour manifesto. Speaking at the launch, McDonnell said that there was a growing acknowledgment that means-tested benefits were flawed. He also described the ideas in the report as pragmatic. These tweets are from the RSA, which hosted the event, and from the Independent\u2019s Ashley Cowburn. The proposal was also backed by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader. In his speech Miliband warmly praised McDonnell for opening up a debate on UBI and for being willing to \u201cthink big\u201d. Addressing the shadow chancellor, he said: I think, John, you are showing an imagination and a willingness to think big which is incredibly important in our politics. It is important for what a Labour government can do, but also for opening up the space .... There will be people who like UBI, people who hate UBI. But I think what I would say to critics is, this is playing on a big pitch. This is primed to answer big questions that people feel in their heart about the problems with our society. So, if you don\u2019t like it, fine. But come up with ideas that are big enough to compete with us. And that is, I think, in the end the real strength of UBI. It asks big questions about the nature of our society and seeks to answer them. Downing Street has just announced that two peers have left the government \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d. They are Lady Fairhead, the former chair of the BBC Trust, who was an international trade minister, and Lady Manzoor, a former Lib Dem peer who defected to the Tories, who was a government whip. At a poster launch in Islington, north London, where Jeremy Corbyn is an MP, the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he wanted to win over Labour voters. He said: My main priority here is to get Labour voters who are rightfully disenchanted with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit, to get behind us in the European elections, that\u2019s the objective. We did extremely well in the local elections, it was unambiguous. It was predominately remain areas and remain voters but we did get a lot of others voting for us on the strength of our performance and credibility in the local government. According to my colleague Daniel Boffey, (like many of us) Jean-Claude Juncker has also given up trying to guess how Brexit will conclude. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has also been holding a press conference this morning. He said he made a mistake in 2016 when, on the advice of the then prime minister, David Cameron, he chose not to get involved in the referendum campaign. The European commission should have got involved to \u201cdestroy the lies\u201d circulating about the EU. He said: The then prime minister asked me not to interfere, not to intervene in the referendum campaign. It was a mistake not to intervene and not to interfere because we would have been the only ones to destroy the lies which were circulated around. I was wrong to be silent at an important moment. Juncker may be over-estimating his powers of persuasion, at least with British voters. He did not intervene, but another president, Barack Obama, did famously urge Britons to vote remain and the consensus is that this had little or no effect on the result. As Ukip leader Nigel Farage probably did more than anyone else to push the Conservative party to the point where David Cameron decided he had to hold a referendum on Brexit. Now he leads a new party, the Brexit party, and some polling suggests it is on course to win the European elections by a nine-point margin. That would be a much bigger win than Ukip\u2019s win (under Farage) in the same elections five years ago. Farage abandoned Ukip after it embraced far-right Islamophobia under its current leader, Gerard Batten, but on Brexit he is not softening his message. Far from it. Three years ago, during a referendum event hosted by the Guardian, Farage implied he would be happy with a Norway-style Brexit (ie, a soft Brexit, with the UK staying in the single market). Norway was rich, happy and successful, he said. What would be wrong with that? Now he wants no-deal - or a WTO Brexit, as he calls it. He also has ambitions to break open the Westminster two-party political system. Here are the main points from the news conference. Farage said a Brexit party victory at the European elections would amount to the country voting for a WTO [World Trade Organisation] Brexit. He and Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, repeatedly referred to a WTO Brexit, but the same concept is more commonly referred to as a no-deal Brexit, particularly by those opposed to the idea. Farage said the Brexit party should be allowed to help negotiate Brexit if it won the European elections. He said: In terms of legitimacy, if the Brexit party wins this election arguing for a WTO Brexit, and we get significant support and we win, I think we will have democratic legitimacy to have a say in how we proceed from here. The new date we have is 31 October. We absolutely believe that the UK must, must, must leave on that date. And if we were part of that discussion, I think we could offer them a very sensible way forward. And Tice said: A vote for the Brexit party is a clear vote for a WTO Brexit, no ifs, no buts. Secondly, a vote for the Brexit party is a vote that our elected MEPs should play a significant role in the future negotiating team. We will demand such a role because we will be the party with the biggest, the most clear democratic mandate to be involved with those negotiations. Farage and Tice called for the Brexit party to be included in the UK negotiating team even though their preferred option, a WTO Brexit, would not really require a negotiation at all. If the UK were to leave without a deal, it would become the default. Farage was asked to explain this apparent inconsistency, but sidestepped the question. (See 11.23am.) Farage claimed some major Tory donors were considering giving money to his new party. He said that the party had already raised more than \u00a32m, with more than 95% of that coming in \u00a325 sums online. But he went on: I think that may be about to change. I say that because there are now a few, much bigger donors, traditionally donors to the Conservative party, who we are now in conversation with, because they understand and realise that to fight a general election seriously we\u2019re going to need big bucks. He claimed his party would win millions of votes at a general election if Westminster failed to deliver a hard Brexit. He said: If the clean break Brexit is not delivered, then my view would that the Brexit party in a general election would get many, many more votes than the 4m I managed to get as leader of Ukip all those years ago ... I do not believe we will ever get a meaningful Brexit with this current government and this current parliament and this current political class. So, unless they listen to whatever we are able to do on 23 May, and perhaps about to do on 6 June at Peterborough, unless there is a fundamental shift in terms of what MPs are prepared to deliver, we are going to have to start to replace them in significant numbers. He said the Brexit party was today starting to recruit general election candidates. He said the party wanted to find a new sort of MP. We want 650 men and women ... with real-world experience, people who either in civic life or business life have got some achievements under their belt. It will be a very new kind of politics. Although Farage claimed this would deliver a new kind of politics, most of the people who get elected to parliament to represent the established parties do have considerable \u201creal-world experience\u201d. He called for the end of first-past-the-post. He said: And if ever there was a time to break the first past the post system, it\u2019s now. He defended his decision to take give a series of interviews to Infowars, a far-right US website specialising in conspiracy theories. Today the Guardian has reported on concerns about Farage\u2019s appearance on the show. Asked about these revelations, Farage said there was \u201cwithout doubt some truth\u201d in the claim that the presenter, Alex Jones, was a conspiracy theorist. But Farage went on: Because you appear on programmes doesn\u2019t mean that you support the editorial line, necessarily, of those podcasts, broadcasts, newspapers or whatever they may be ... I have never been conspiracy theorist at all. But then Farage also attacked the Guardian and the Observer, claiming that some of their stories about him receiving money from Russia and about him delivering a memory stick to Julian Assange, amounted to conspiracy theories. He told the Guardian journalist who asked the question: I think when it comes to crackpot conspiracy theories, you\u2019re way, way ahead of me. Q: Will you be meeting President Trump when he comes to the UK? Farage says, when Trump last come to the UK, one of the government\u2019s red line demands was for Trump not to meet Farage. He says, given his personal relationship with Trump, you would have thought it would make sense for the government to use his him to the country\u2019s advantage. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary shortly. Farage says the Brexit party will not be publishing policies until after the European elections are over. During the campaign it will be focusing on democracy, he says. He says he does not think there will be a \u201cmeaningful Brexit\u201d with this current government and this current parliament. He says it is important to replace MPs in significant numbers. He also says it is important to break first past the post. Q: [From my colleague Rowena Mason] Do you regret giving interviews to Alex Jones, the US conspiracy theorist? The Guardian has written about those interviews today. Farage says he has given interviews all over the world. He has appeared on the Alex Jones programme. But just because you appear on a programme does not mean you support its editorial line, he says. And he claims that the Guardian and the Observer has published outlandish claims about him, saying he has been funded by Russia and that he has run memory sticks to Julian Assange. When it comes to conspiracy theories, the Guardian is way ahead of him, he says. Q: Why aren\u2019t you standing in Peterborough? Farage says he has experience as an MEP. He thinks a lot of Brexit party MEPs will be elected, and he sees it as his duty to take them to Brussels to show them how the system works. Q: Is Arron Banks one of your donors? No, says Farage. He says Banks will not be donating to the party. Q: You say 90% of your money is from small donors. Who are the big donors? Farage says the party has had one big donation, worth \u00a3100,000. It will reveal the name of the donor in due course. Q: How will you get Brexit party MEPs accepted on the UK negotiating team? And, if it is a WTO Brexit, will there be any negotiating anyway? The question comes from a BBC journalist. Farage sarcastically thanks them for turning up, saying the BBC has not covered his rallies, and the Brexit party has not been represented on panels. Farage says if the Brexit party wins, that will be a vote for a WTO Brexit. Farage claims a Brexit party victory at the Euro elections would be a vote for a WTO Brexit. Tice says the current negotiations have failed. Some sensible people need to take over, he says. Q: Are you talking to Tory MPs about defecting, as well as Tory donors? Farage says he is more interesting in recruiting donors at the moment. He says his experience as Ukip leader was that recruiting defectors from other parties meant bringing in all their in-fighting too. He does not want to do that again, he says. Farage is now taking questions. He says the Peterborough shortlist is down to three. The party has to decide within the next 24 hours who the candidate will be. Some national figures want to stand. But there are some interesting local figures too, he says. He says he would not be asking other people to stand for parliament if he were not willing to stand himself. But he has not thought where he might stand, he says. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking now. He says the party is releasing a pledge card today. It makes it clear the party wants a \u201cclean break Brexit\u201d. He says over the last three years the political class has behaved \u201cdespicably\u201d. And that is getting worse by the day, he says. He says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are trying to form \u201ca coalition against the people\u201d. Farage says he has concluded that winning the European elections will not be enough. This is but a first step, he says. He says the party might have to fight a second referendum, which he is confident it would win, he says. But he says the party also wants to change politics for good. He says the Brexit party will fight the Peterborough byelection. It will put up a first-class candidate, although the candidate has not been chosen yet. He says the party will today start recruiting candidates for the general election. It wants a new kind of candidate, people with real life experience. There is a new page on the website where people can apply, he says. He says candidates will be rigorously vetted. He says the party now has 88,000 registered supporters. He says the party has received \u00a32m in donations, mostly in small donations. But that could be about to change. He says some Tory donors are now considering giving money to the party. Farage claims some significant Tory donors are considering giving to the Brexit party. Nigel Farage is holding a Brexit party press conference now. You can watch a live feed here. Richard Tice, the party chairman, is opening the event. He says the Brexit party expects to win the European elections comprehensively. He says they are fielding the most qualified set of candidates put forward by any party for a generation. Many of their candidates have experience of negotiation, he says. He says the Brexit party is unequivocally calling for a WTO Brexit. And if the Brexit party does well in the European elections, some of its MEPs should be included in the negotiating team, he says. He says the Brexit party stands for commonsense politics. Tice says Brexit party will demand to be included in the negotiating team if it wins the European elections. Uk in a Changing Europe, a thinktank, has produced a very useful report (pdf) with a series of short briefings, mostly by academics, on Brexit and the European elections. Here is an extract from one of the mini essays, by Anand Menon and Matthew Bevington, entitled \u201cDo the elections matter for Brexit?\u201d The traditional \u2018grand coalition\u2019 groups look set to lose their overall majority [in the European parliament] for the first time. This introduces uncertainty, both in terms of who the next commission president will be but also about the process involved in selecting them. If, as looks likely, the two largest groupings \u2013 the S&amp;D and EPP \u2013 have to rely on the liberal group (ALDE) to form a stable majority for deciding on major posts, this will have a substantive impact. To take one hypothetical example. A commission led by Michel Barnier \u2013 a far from implausible outcome should the spitzenkandidaten process fail to deliver a candidate who can win majority support in the parliament \u2013 could be expected to cleave closely to the approach adopted by the article 50 task force to date. A different commission president might, by contrast, take issue with that approach (we have already seen signs of tension between Barnier and Juncker over Brexit). And, of course, the new parliament will play a significant role when it comes to agreeing a future relationship between the UK and the EU. Warning signs are there already. The European parliament, for instance, rejected a motion offering tentative support to limited trade talks with the US. It did so because a coalition of the Socialists, Greens and far-right groupings insisted on conditions for such talks. They demanded that the existing negotiating directives for EU-US (TTIP) trade negotiations be revoked, and inserted several conditions on any further talks with the US: first, that aluminium and steel tariffs be lifted; second, that the agreement be subject to a carbon impact assessment; and, third, that it includes cars but excludes agriculture. This hints at some of the problems that might confront the UK with a more divided and polarised European parliament. The EU\u2019s talks with the US are now highly politicised following the TTIP saga. The Brexit process to date has raised suspicions concerning the UK\u2019s intentions in Brussels. It is easy to imagine a similar shopping list of preconditions \u2013 on climate change, minimum regulatory standards, inter alia, to be drawn up by MEPs. And here is Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby on the cross-party talks. Here is a round-up of some of the reports around this morning about the cross-party Brexit talks. Gordon Rayner in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) says Theresa May has been warned she will removed from office if she agrees a deal with Labour. May has been warned her MPs will begin moves to oust her as soon as this week if she agrees a Brexit deal with Labour. The prime minister wants to sign off an agreement with Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday in order to avoid having to send new MEPs to the European parliament, but there is little appetite for a cross-party deal among her own backbenchers. Rivals in the race to succeed Mrs May are on a state of high alert in case a compromise deal with Labour becomes the trigger for a leadership election. Senior sources within the Conservative party said on Monday that Mrs May will be \u201cgone very quickly\u201d if she moves towards Labour\u2019s demands for a post-Brexit customs union with the EU ... Nigel Evans, joint executive secretary of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cIf she comes out of those talks offering something which is Brexit in name only then she has got a real problem.\u201d Robert Peston in an ITV blog says he thinks there is zero chance of a government/Labour deal. In case you were in any doubt, there is zero chance of Labour and Jeremy Corbyn agreeing a Brexit deal with the prime minister, given that its central element is a pledge to keep the UK in the customs union till the next general election. The point is that Labour\u2019s main criticism of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan is that it is \u201cblind\u201d, that it makes gives no promises or commitments about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. And a pledge to keep the UK in the EU\u2019s customs union only till 2022 would not turn blindness into perfect foresight. Tim Ross at Bloomberg says in private both sides have sounded optimistic about the talks. In recent days officials on both sides have privately sounded optimistic about the prospects of an agreement. In part, that\u2019s because of the generally positive atmosphere in which at least some of the discussions have taken place. Critically for the Tory side, Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s chief strategist, is said to be fully engaged and serious in the meetings that have taken place, asking detailed questions about the government\u2019s position and the offers on the table, in a sign he\u2019s interested in doing a deal. The discussions on how to ensure workers\u2019 rights remain protected after Brexit have gone well. Business secretary Greg Clark and his shadow, Rebecca Long-Bailey, produced successful results which are likely to be taken forward even if no wider deal is possible. The Sun in its main leader article suggests that it could live with a Brexit compromise that included a customs union - as long as it was temporary. It says: Nobody in the Tory party should be complacent about the trouble they\u2019re in. A deal with Jeremy Corbyn \u2014 if it includes anything like a permanent customs union\u2014 could split them down the middle ... The only possible pill that the country would swallow would be a customs arrangement that ended before the next election, allowing a new leader with fresh vision to get a mandate for a genuinely international trading policy. Rachel Sylvester in her Times column (paywall) says a new Tory leader could end up opting for a second referendum. After the results of last week\u2019s local elections, which will only be reinforced by the European elections in a few weeks time, a cabinet minister says \u201cmost people would prefer the horror of a second referendum to the risk of a Jeremy Corbyn government through a general election\u201d. Mrs May could still agree to a confirmatory referendum to get her withdrawal agreement passed. Some of her allies believe it was a mistake not to \u201creach over the heads of parliament to the people\u201d when she lost the second meaningful vote. Even if she does not do so her successor will face precisely the same problems trying to force Brexit through a deadlocked Commons. Ultimately the next prime minister will need a mandate of their own. \u201cThe whole thing potentially ends with a new leader promising a tougher Brexit but getting into office, realising they can\u2019t deliver it and then having to make the choice between a general election and referendum,\u201d one cabinet minister says. \u201cIn that case, inevitably, they will choose a referendum because who would want to roll the dice on their own premiership so soon after they got to power?\u201d How ironic it would be if it fell to Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab or Michael Gove to persuade the British people that the \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d they offered up to the electorate in 2016 was not just a con. At the weekend, in a Telegraph article, Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, said that Theresa May could split the party if she tries to keep the UK in the customs union. He said: The temptation for the government now to do whatever is necessary to secure some kind of Brexit agreement is obvious but it must be resisted. To reach an agreement with Labour that locked the United Kingdom into the customs union might pull in enough Labour votes to allow an agreement to limp over the line but the price could be a catastrophic split in the Conservative party and at a time when the opposition is led by dangerous extremists, the consequences for our country would be unthinkable. This morning Philip Hammond, the chancellor, played down the prospect of the party dividing. Speaking in Paris, where he is attending a meeting of finance ministers, he said: The Conservative party is a very broad church. Let\u2019s be honest, Europe has been a fractious issue within the party for 45 years but there are many other things that unite us and I am sure we will get through this, we will get beyond it and I\u2019m sure we will go on presenting a broad, right-of-centre offer to the British people that will be attractive to them. He also admitted the European elections would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for his party. He said: The European elections are going to be difficult in the circumstances; the British people have voted to leave the European Union, it\u2019s obviously challenging to them go and ask them to vote in a European election. But we have to do this, we are legally obliged to do it and we will get on with it. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on where she thinks we are with the cross-party Brexit talks. Why was Jeremy Hunt suggesting that a temporary customs union with the EU might be acceptable? (See 9.02am.) Because, according to a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend, this idea is at the centre of the plan that Theresa May is hoping Jeremy Corbyn will agree to. Here is an extract from Tim Shipman\u2019s story about this (paywall) yesterday. The Sunday Times has learnt [May] will outline plans for a comprehensive but temporary customs arrangement with the EU lasting until the next general election, which Corbyn will be able to depict as a Tory cave-in to his demands. May and her negotiating team will agree that Britain will also align with a wider range of EU single market regulations on goods. Finally, they will enshrine in law that the UK will mirror all EU legislation on workers\u2019 rights. \u201cThere are three main areas: customs, goods alignment and workers\u2019 rights,\u201d said one source involved in the talks. \u201cThe Conservative party will have to suck up concessions on each of those\u201d ... Under the plans, the two parties would agree to maintain the customs arrangement \u2014 with a new name \u2014 until 2022, when the next election is due. \u201cAt that point Labour could use their manifesto to argue for a softer Brexit if they wanted to and a new Conservative prime minister could argue for a harder Brexit,\u201d a source said. A week ago today Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and a leading candidate to replace Theresa May, was on the Today programme. He was asked about the government/Labour talks aimed at finding a Brexit compromise, and the speculation that this might involve the UK staying in a customs union with the EU, and he was clear that he thought this was a bad idea. He told the programme: If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don\u2019t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain LabourMPs. If, on the other hand, it was something different, then the result could be different as well. This morning he was back on the programme. Again, he was asked about a custom union. But this time his response was noticeably different. He said: I have always said that I\u2019m not a believer in the customs union as a sustainable long-term solution. I want to look at whatever deal is come to between the parties, and I know this is a crucial week, and I would not want to affect the progress of those talks by pronouncing in advance. But I think this is a time when we have to be willing to make compromises on all sides because the message of last week was that voters for both main parties are very, very angry about the fact that Brexit hasn\u2019t been delivered. I personally think that any kind of permanent customs union wouldn\u2019t work in the long run because our economy is too big, but let\u2019s see what the parties come up with. There are two significant lines in this. Hunt stressed the need for compromise, citing last week\u2019s local election results as strengthening the need for both sides to relax their red lines. He said that he was opposed to the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU, implying that a temporary customs union plan would be acceptable. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 11am: Nigel Farage holds a Brexit party press conference. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks at the launch of a report calling for a universal basic income to be piloted in the UK. As my colleague Richard Partington reports, although the report does not represent Labour policy, its publication is likely to be viewed as moving the party closer towards testing a form of UBI should it be voted into power. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 1pm: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, host talks aimed at restoring powering-sharing in Northern Ireland. 2pm: Rory Stewart, the new international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee. At some point today the government/Labour cross-party talks on Brexit will resume. And also at some point Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, will hold a meeting with May at which he is expected to tell her that Tory MPs want her to set out a timetable for standing down if there is no Brexit deal. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are under pressure to raise the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales after the Scottish parliament voted in favour of a new higher age of 12. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has urged reform across the UK after the UN\u2019s committee on the rights of the child (UNCRC) decided the global minimum at which a child can be prosecuted should be 14. The minimum age a child can be prosecuted for a crime in England and Wales is 10, and the EHRC told a UN review of the UK\u2019s track record on torture that the age of responsibility needed to be urgently raised to meet UN recommendations. David Isaac, the commission\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cIncreasing the age of criminal responsibility is crucial to stop very young children being exposed to the harmful effects of detention and to protect their future.\u201d Its intervention came as the Scottish parliament, which oversees Scotland\u2019s separate legal system, voted unanimously on Tuesday to raise the minimum age to 12, ending long-standing laws that set the age of criminal responsibility at eight. Under those long-standing rules, children aged between eight and 12 in Scotland could be referred to a special system known as children\u2019s hearings, separate from the adult court system, but whose rulings could still be used to give the child a criminal record. The Holyrood reform was criticised as not going far enough by the Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton, who has championed raising Scotland\u2019s age of responsibility to at least 14 in line with the UNCRC recommendations. An EHRC spokeswoman welcomed the debate in Scotland on the issue but said the commission supported raising it significantly higher across the UK in line with expert opinion and global norms. \u201cWe welcome the current debate about raising the age of criminal responsibility taking place in the Scottish parliament. This is essential to protect children and their futures and we hope that the UK and Welsh governments take note of it, and take similar steps in relation to the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales,\u201d she said. Describing the previous rules as medieval, Cole-Hamilton said the raising of the minimum age to 12 was still below current international norms and undermined the Scottish government\u2019s \u201csugar-coated and saccharin\u201d claims that Scotland was a world-leading pioneer in human rights. His concerns were broadly supported by the Scottish Green party and the former Scottish National party children\u2019s minister Mark McDonald, who now sits as an independent MSP. However, Scottish Labour and the Conservatives supported the Scottish government\u2019s stance after it promised to review the impact of the new higher age after three years, and set up an expert panel to do so. Maree Todd, the Scottish children\u2019s minister, said the right balance had been struck. \u201cIt is a radical, bold and ambitious reform which will introduce a significant cultural shift. The pace at which we are moving needs to command public confidence,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish government has dropped controversial plans to cut its taxes on aviation after Nicola Sturgeon declared last week the world faces a climate emergency. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said cutting air passenger duty would be incompatible with its new pledge to cut Scotland\u2019s carbon emissions to net zero by 2045. The Scottish government faced intense cross-party pressure to keep the levy in place after Sturgeon accepted recommendations from the UK committee on climate change (CCC) last week that Scotland should adopt a 2045 target date. Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, told the Guardian cutting the levy would undermine efforts to combat climate change by making it harder for Scotland to reduce its overall emissions. Keeping the tax in place \u201cwould help immensely with the emissions challenge there is in Scotland\u201d he said. The CCC recommended the UK government should aim for a UK-wide net zero target of 2050, five years later than Scotland. The CCC believes Scotland has far greater scope to sequestrate its CO2 emissions by planting forests and to capture and store CO2 in disused North Sea oil fields. Critics of the proposed aviation tax cut, which the Scottish National party had pledged to introduce in successive elections, said reducing the levy by 50% would increase CO2 emissions from aviation in Scotland by at least 60,000 tonnes and cut tax income by about \u00a3150m. That figure did not account for the sharp increase in flying which Scotland\u2019s airports hoped that would lead to; Scotland\u2019s enterprise agencies also provide subsidies to airlines such as Ryanair, and the government owns Prestwick airport, which is heavily indebted, and small airports in the Highlands and islands. The Scottish government has faced a long delay implementing the policy after running into unforeseen problems with EU rules on state aid but Ryanair and BA, and Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, had pressed the Scottish government to cut the levy. Cunningham announced the switch before a Scottish Labour party-sponsored debate on retaining air passenger duty in Holyrood tomorrow. She said the Scottish government\u2019s change of stance highlighted the need for all parties to support radical measures to reduce CO2 emissions, including a tax on parking spaces at workplaces which Labour opposes. Colin Smyth, Scottish Labour\u2019s transport spokesman, said this policy should have been reversed years ago. Patrick Harvie, the co-convenor of the Scottish Green party, said: \u201cGreens have led the case against this ill thought out tax giveaway from the moment it was first proposed, so we very much welcome the Scottish government\u2019s huge U-turn.\u201d The Greens will be pressing for an even tougher net zero target date of 2040, tabling amendments to the new climate bill going through Holyrood. Gordon Dewar, the chief executive of Edinburgh airport, was furious about the decision, accusing Scottish ministers of hypocrisy for continuing to support Prestwick airport, which owes the taxpayer more than \u00a340m.
