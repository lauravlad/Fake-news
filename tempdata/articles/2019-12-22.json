Many groups have called for this, and I am sure it will be welcomed. The strategy, we are told, will include housing, education and transport, with the benefits system being addressed in a green paper. Measures will \u201censure disabled people can lead a life of opportunity and fulfilment\u201d.</p> <p>If the government wants to support disabled people in all aspects and phases of their lives, this strategy must do three key things. First, it must be developed across all government departments.

      "bodyText": "One Conservative party manifesto commitment that did not make it into the text of the Queen\u2019s speech (Report, 20 December) but which was mentioned in the background briefing notes is the government\u2019s pledge to publish a national strategy for disabled people in 2020. Many groups have called for this, and I am sure it will be welcomed. The strategy, we are told, will include housing, education and transport, with the benefits system being addressed in a green paper. Measures will \u201censure disabled people can lead a life of opportunity and fulfilment\u201d. If the government wants to support disabled people in all aspects and phases of their lives, this strategy must do three key things. First, it must be developed across all government departments. For example, until the Department for Work and Pensions radically improves the personal independence payment system, it will be impossible to improve the quality of life of many disabled people. Second, the government must implement promises made previously, such as the consultation on accessible housing, which had been announced to start in the autumn. Without access to something as fundamental as housing, the aims of the strategy are unlikely to be met.

Others think the solution is as simple as electing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a> leader, but never allowing him to appear anywhere except at bookmakers and never without mushy peas, curry sauce and saveloy dip smeared all round his mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can get all mushy peas in the chip shop opposite the cemetery,\u201d piped up Dan, hopefully. \u201cShall I ask them who their supplier is and then we can get masses of the bloody stuff ready to smear on Keir when victory is near?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d I explained, leading the activists out across the road towards De Beauvoir Place, now rebuilt from wartime bomb rubble. \u201cThe media and the opposition will demonise any Labour leader that Turds faces across the house.

Demons aren\u2019t real!\u201d exclaimed a spotty cynic, unaware that he was standing on the very site of the 1854 birthplace of Aleister Crowley\u2019s acolyte, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who conjured them all, one by one, and knew each of their secret and unholy names.</p> <p>\u201cNot far from here Mathers summoned Aamon, the Marquess of Hell, governor of 40 infernal legions, in the form of a wolf with a serpent\u2019s tail, retching forth flames,\u201d I told the incredulous Labour party activists. \u201cAnd when they walked south towards Arnold Circus Aamon took the shape of a man, so as not to cause commotion, but his mouth was full of dogs\u2019 teeth and he hid his head, suddenly that of a hawk, beneath a black hood. In the words of Mathers himself, \u2018Aamon telleth all things Past and to Come. He procureth feuds and reconcileth controversies between friends.\u2019 Put Aamon in charge. You cannot demonise a demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips\" title=\"\">Jess Phillips</a> instead?\u201d piped up an insolent youngster. \u201cShe\u2019d be a great match for Johnson in parliament. His cynicism and lies would look feeble before her passion and honesty and she\u2019s properly funny, rather than just saying things in Latin. And she\u2019s all over the detail, whereas he just wings it. And people trust anyone with a Birmingham accent, thinking them incapable of guile. It would play badly when Johnson bullies and patronises her too. The answer is staring us in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat use is this \u2018Aamon\u2019 of yours to the parliamentary Labour party,\u201d squawked another youth, \u201cand why is a demon a more logical choice than, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/28/angela-rayner-shadow-education-secretary-interview\" title=\"\">Angela Rayner</a> or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a>?\u201d</p> <p>And then I realised I was alone. The young socialists were drinking small sour drinks and sampling Japanese sharing plates somewhere. And I was on the pavement as it started to rain, shouting up at an obsolete golden chicken, perched atop a former Courage pub, now a Nando\u2019s. \u201cYou finally really did it. You maniacs.

Others think the solution is as simple as electing Keir Starmer leader, but never allowing him to appear anywhere except at bookmakers and never without mushy peas, curry sauce and saveloy dip smeared all round his mouth.\u201d \u201cYou can get all mushy peas in the chip shop opposite the cemetery,\u201d piped up Dan, hopefully. \u201cShall I ask them who their supplier is and then we can get masses of the bloody stuff ready to smear on Keir when victory is near?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d I explained, leading the activists out across the road towards De Beauvoir Place, now rebuilt from wartime bomb rubble. \u201cThe media and the opposition will demonise any Labour leader that Turds faces across the house. Best to meet the problem head on. The party should be led instead by an actual demon.\u201d \u201cCome on, Grandad! Demons aren\u2019t real!\u201d exclaimed a spotty cynic, unaware that he was standing on the very site of the 1854 birthplace of Aleister Crowley\u2019s acolyte, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who conjured them all, one by one, and knew each of their secret and unholy names. \u201cNot far from here Mathers summoned Aamon, the Marquess of Hell, governor of 40 infernal legions, in the form of a wolf with a serpent\u2019s tail, retching forth flames,\u201d I told the incredulous Labour party activists. \u201cAnd when they walked south towards Arnold Circus Aamon took the shape of a man, so as not to cause commotion, but his mouth was full of dogs\u2019 teeth and he hid his head, suddenly that of a hawk, beneath a black hood. In the words of Mathers himself, \u2018Aamon telleth all things Past and to Come. He procureth feuds and reconcileth controversies between friends.\u2019 Put Aamon in charge. You cannot demonise a demon.\u201d \u201cHow about Jess Phillips instead?\u201d piped up an insolent youngster. \u201cShe\u2019d be a great match for Johnson in parliament. His cynicism and lies would look feeble before her passion and honesty and she\u2019s properly funny, rather than just saying things in Latin. And she\u2019s all over the detail, whereas he just wings it. And people trust anyone with a Birmingham accent, thinking them incapable of guile. It would play badly when Johnson bullies and patronises her too. The answer is staring us in the face.\u201d \u201cWhat use is this \u2018Aamon\u2019 of yours to the parliamentary Labour party,\u201d squawked another youth, \u201cand why is a demon a more logical choice than, for example, Angela Rayner or even Lisa Nandy?\u201d And then I realised I was alone. The young socialists were drinking small sour drinks and sampling Japanese sharing plates somewhere. And I was on the pavement as it started to rain, shouting up at an obsolete golden chicken, perched atop a former Courage pub, now a Nando\u2019s. \u201cYou finally really did it. You maniacs. God damn you. God damn you all to hell.\u201d Extra London dates of Stewart Lee\u2019s latest live show, Snowflake/Tornado, have just been announced at the Southbank Centre in June and July, and it tours nationally from January. stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates",
