      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats are \u201cwithin a small swing of winning hundreds of seats\u201d, the party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, has claimed, as the main parties begin pushing out key messages before what is billed as the most volatile general election in living memory. Although the official campaign does not begin until parliament is dissolved next week, the near-certain passage through parliament of a bill calling a 12 December poll has prompted party election machines to swing immediately into action. MPs voted on Tuesday night to pass the bill, unblocking a long deadlock. It will now be sent to the Lords and is set to become law within days. While Swinson took to the airwaves to talk up her party\u2019s chances of making a significant breakthrough, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, insisted the Conservatives were the only party that could push through Brexit. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told broadcasters that Labour expected to confound the polls as it did in the 2017 election, and warned that Swinson\u2019s Lib Dems could go into coalition with the Conservatives. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve considered joining the Lib Dems to run as one of their candidates. It is understood the former attorney general and remain campaigner had talks with Lib Dem party officials where it was decided it would be better to run as an independent Conservative instead. A Lib Dem party source said they would have been happy to have him on board but he did not ultimately make the leap. They also believe he will follow a \u201csoft whip\u201d from the Lib Dems if he is re-elected, which means he might choose to vote with the group on Brexit and a number of other policies. The Lib Dems are not fielding a candidate in Grieve\u2019s Beaconsfield seat to give him a clear run at capturing remain voters in this ultra safe Tory stronghold, where he currently has a 24,000 majority. Grieve has blocked a no-deal Brexit in parliament through a range of legislative procedures and also backs a second referendum. He denies he approached the Lib Dems to discuss joining their ranks. Swinson rejected the idea of supporting either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in government and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message was resonating in \u201cseats with all sorts of permutations\u201d. She said the local elections in May showed that the party could win in areas beyond its current scope of 19 MPs, a total boosted by defections and a byelection win after the Lib Dems won 12 seats in the 2017 election. Challenged on whether she could really move the party into government from such a low base, Swinson said: \u201cThis is a volatile time in politics. Nobody needs to look at received wisdom or what\u2019s happened in the past. \u201cOur polling show that we are within a small swing of winning hundreds of seats, because the political landscape is so totally changed by what has happened in our country post-Brexit.\u201d Speaking on Sky News, Hancock said a vote for the Lib Dems or another party was \u201ca vote to put Corbyn in Downing Street and have more referenda and more blockage and delay\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Lib Dems have embarked on a high-risk strategy, in provoking an early general election with the Tories ahead in the polls, ostensibly on the grounds that it is \u201cour best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit\u201d (Parliament breaks deadlock with December 12 election, 30 October). They must know that the only way to do so is to work with Labour to ensure that the public can have a final say on any Brexit deal. This means dropping their insistence that Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cunfit to lead\u201d. After all, we have not done particularly well with recent leaders, who brought us death and destruction in Iraq and Libya, austerity, inequality and collapsed public services at home, a referendum on major constitutional change without appropriate safeguards, and obstinacy, lies and chicanery to subvert democratic oversight of their procedures. It means concentrating their electoral resources on seats where they can defeat the Tories.

It is, on the face of it, a curious decision.</p> <p>After all, Plaid has, like the SNP, an explicit pro-independence policy for Wales and Scotland, and the Greens also support national autonomy for both countries. (Their sister party, the Scottish Greens, are often more gung-ho for a referendum than Sturgeon.)</p> <p>Lib Dem officials at the Scottish parliament say the SNP is excluded from the party\u2019s thinking about possible pacts for one simple reason: the SNP are closer to getting Scottish independence than Plaid is for independence in Wales.</p> <p>Sturgeon made clear as she launched the SNP election campaign in Stirling on Wednesday morning that a second independence referendum will be central to her party\u2019s manifesto. Under Price\u2019s leadership, Plaid is much more explicit about its independence ambitions.</p> <p>The difference, say Lib Dem officials, is that Plaid\u2019s support has fallen by several points to 12% <a href=\"http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/2019/10/15/the-october-welsh-political-barometer-poll/\">in the few opinion polls carried out in Wales</a>, and so poses no threat, while the SNP dominates the polls in Scotland, and very much does.</p> <p>There is another reason. Top of the Lib Dem target list is the most marginal Westminster seat in the UK, that of North East Fife which was won by the SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins with an extraordinarily slender two vote margin. North East Fife was held by former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell for nearly 30 years and they\u2019d very much like it back.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c93f8f08cb84c60a1969\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:48:53.919Z\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn confirms he would allow second Scottish independence referendum, but not 'any time soon'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>\u2019s main lines of attack against Labour at the moment is the claim that <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> would submit the country to two referendums after the general election. This is how he put it <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-10-30/debates/EE676E39-9A59-47E9-B17A-E7D8FB1A2D11/Engagements\">at PMQs</a>. Johnson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Corbyn] also offers a political disaster, consigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums: another referendum on the EU because he cannot make up his mind what he thinks, flip-flopping this way and that; and another referendum on Scottish independence. Why on earth should the people of this country spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums thanks to the Labour party?</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour is committed to renegotiating Brexit and holding another referendum. As Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said in a briefing for journalists after PMQs, Labour would not agree to a Scottish independence election in 2020. But Corbyn has confirmed that he would be willing to agree to a Scottish independence referendum at some stage later. (For a Scottish independence referendum, Westminster has to allow it.) The Scottish Labour party used to be flatly opposed to a second independence referendum, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/john-mcdonnell-deepens-row-over-second-independence-poll\">Corbyn changed party policy on this during the summer.</a></p> <p>Speaking during a visit to Crawley Hospital in West Sussex this afternoon, Corbyn said he was \u201cnot in favour\u201d of another referendum on Scottish independence \u201cany time soon\u201d. But he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At a later stage, obviously under the terms of devolution, if the Scottish parliament demands it, then there could be, at a much later stage, a referendum. I make it very clear, we are against Scottish independence and we are certainly not in favour of any referendum in Scotland any time soon.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86a16310417e1569910902a5d0fee93687878cef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86a16310417e1569910902a5d0fee93687878cef/118_0_5630_3378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn (centre) during a visit to Crawley Hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn (centre) during a visit to Crawley Hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c8ea8f08d669cdaafcc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:31:41.348Z\">5.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the BBC\u2019s <strong>Mark D\u2019Arcy</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DArcyTiP/status/1189595521884872704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m hearing the election for Speaker will go ahead on Monday - largely because it is seen as impractical to wait until after the election, because it would then take too long to get a Speaker in place, when Parliament May have to move rather quickly</p>&mdash; Mark D&#39;Arcy (@DArcyTiP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DArcyTiP/status/1189595521884872704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c3668f08cb84c60a18fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:11:36.886Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to BuzzFeed\u2019s <strong>Alex Wickham</strong>, who has written<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/boris-johnson-election-nhs-winter-crisis\"> a good insider account of the Conservative election campaign</a>, some senior Tories put their chances of winning at between 50/50 and two thirds. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Senior Conservatives put their chances of forming a government on Dec. 13 at between fifty-fifty and two-thirds in favour.</p> <p>The path to a Johnson majority has been made slightly easier after he restored the whip to 10 of the 21 Tory rebels who opposed his Brexit plans last month. But the Tories still go into the election well short of a majority and likely to lose their foothold in Scotland as well as further seats to the Liberal Democrats in areas of England where support for EU membership remains strong.</p> <p>To win a majority healthy enough to comfortably pass his Brexit deal, Johnson would have to gain Labour seats far away from their usual target list \u2014 and with the added unknown factor of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party eating away at their vote in leave areas.</p> <p>The fear among Conservatives throughout the party is that they fall short and that parliament remains hung and deadlocked. The potential of Corbyn in Downing Street in coalition with the Scottish Nationalist party is a risk some Tories did not want to take. But there is a growing worry that, even if Johnson has the numbers to stay in Downing Street but the Commons remains at an impasse, the conversation will turn to another long Brexit extension and a second referendum as the only way to find a definitive answer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wickham says some Tories are summing up their mood as one of \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, while its various factions disagreed over when to go for an election, No 10 is united in the belief that it ultimately has the team and message to win. One Tory who spoke to BuzzFeed News talked about \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d \u2014 the idea that the choice facing the country was clear, an election to break the deadlock in Parliament was inevitable at some point, and that if voters genuinely preferred Corbyn, then so be it.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c18a8f08d669cdaafc5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T17:00:25.385Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaa56e403f9aee123dac3d703d04a330838a61db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa56e403f9aee123dac3d703d04a330838a61db/0_260_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon campaigning with Alyn Smith, the SNPs candidate for Stirling, in Stirling this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon campaigning with Alyn Smith, the SNPs candidate for Stirling, in Stirling this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db9c0b08f08d669cdaafc48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-30T16:57:59.470Z\">4.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to CNN\u2019s <strong>Luke McGee</strong>, Brexit party activists have been told not to say on social media where the party will be standing at the election, amidst rumours it may decide to not most seats, as originally planned, but just a handful. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/uk/live-news/brexit-boris-johnson-election-wednesday-dle-gbr-intl/h_a7f6ba0885b983a1bad1953b97cd6042\">McGee writes:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rumours are now circulating that the Brexit party will switch its focus from standing in every seat to concentrating on a handful of seats that they have a decent chance on winning.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, party campaigners were sent the following message, which has been seen by CNN. \u201cMessage from HQ ...

He told reporters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve now fought several referendums. I have respected the result of them all, win or lose; Nicola Sturgeon has never respected the result of any referendum, other than the illegal one in Catalonia.</p> <p>[As] we go forward from here Scottish Conservatives are promising a referendum free period ahead. Nicola Sturgeon is promising another two referendums. If we want to end that division, if we want to move on, we have to keep Scotland in the UK, and no more referendums.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon, who kicked off the Scottish National party\u2019s campaign on Wednesday at an event in Stirling at which newspaper reporters were not invited, would dispute Carlaw\u2019s claims she respected the result of the unofficial Catalan referendum in 2017. She backed the case for staging one in principle, but did not endorse the event itself.</p> <p>Previously deputy Scottish leader, Carlaw replaced Ruth Davidson after she resigned unexpected in August, partly in protest at Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, pending a leadership contest next year, but <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18000809.scots-tories-keep-ruth-davidson-duplicitous-election-leaflets/?ref=twtrec\">the party\u2019s campaign literature still promotes Davidson prominently.</a></p> <p>It sent out election letters to Tory voters signed by Davidson, a keen remain campaigner during the referendum, saying the threat of a second independence vote was a very real one. The A3 election leaflets Tory activists handed out in Perth on Wednesday did not name Carlaw once. Perth and North Perthshire is a key Tory target seat: the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart retained it with a wafer-thin majority of 21 votes, or 0.04%, over the Tories.</p> <p>Carlaw insisted that promoting Davidson prove the Tories had a strong team, which included both his predecessors \u2013 Davidson and Annabel Goldie, while sidestepping questions on whether he personally trusted Boris Johnson. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re absolutely delighted we have got former leaders that we\u2019re able to use in this campaign. I doubt the SNP will be using Alex Salmond.

Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue, but today, more than ever, it was dominated by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seems to have an overwhelming advantage.</p> <p>Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more emphatic than the PM.</p> <p>Corbyn also made it clear that he is going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson Brexit would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep.</p> <p>Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish. </p> <p>At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated. But it wasn\u2019t as catchy as Johnson\u2019s argument about Labour offering two referendums, which was just about true enough to register and stick as a key election message. (Labour are certainly promising a second Brexit referendum, which would fill some of the electorate with dread. Corbyn does not favour a second Scottish independence referendum, but he has not 100% ruled one out, and a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would probably end up agreeing to one.)</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s most lively attack lines were probably those he delivered against the SNP. It is widely assumed that the Tories will lose most of their seats in Scotland, and Ian Blackford had a good line when he said Johnson would be welcome in the country because he boosted SNP support. But, even if this is true, Johnson seemed to enjoy the chance to bang on about \u201cborders at Berwick\u201d.

The care her mother got always came after long delays. He says people who have to wait should be sympathised with and supported.</p> <p>Johnson says there are 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. It is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is all very well to side with Russia and make huge promises and flip-flop on the referendum. Leadership means standing up for the police, for the economy, for wealth creators. And above all, it means getting Brexit done.</p> <p>Corbyn says, coming from a PM who withdrew his own bill, that sounds a bit odd. He says Johnson should have tried to show some empathy.

It carries with it the implication for the breakup of the United Kingdom and I think also that the likely outcome particularly because of the role of the [European Research Group] in the party that we are going to end up at the end of transition, which is only a few months away now, in fact at risk of crashing out. The very thing Ed doesn\u2019t want.</em></p> <p><em>If the prime minister wins a working majority .. in six months we will be in very difficult and dangerous waters for our country.</em></p> <p><em>I will run as an independent.

Cuadrilla is facing a battle to keep its fracking projects on track in the UK at a time when public opinion is moving against the extraction of shale gas, with the Labour party threatening to ban the practice altogether.</p> <p>Her company also represents the Internet Association, the trade body for major tech companies including Uber, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Microsoft and Amazon. The organisation is attempting to influence the government\u2019s policies on online harms, the regulation of social media and taxes on digital companies \u2013 all of which are likely to feature in some form in the Conservative manifesto.</p> <p>There is no suggestion Wolf is breaking any rules by writing the Conservative manifesto while running a lobbying company representing major businesses, given her company makes regular declarations of its clients to the public lobbying registrar in line with current legal requirements.</p> <p>However, Francis Ingham, of the Public Relations and Communications Association, which represents many leading PR and lobbying agencies, but not Public First, said: \u201cCommunications professionals have a duty to avoid conflicts of interests. There is never an excuse.

Jeremy Corbyn has challenged Johnson to TV debates on what has effectively been the first full day of campaigning since MPs agreed that there should be an election on Thursday 12 December. (See 4.06pm.) The bill approving the election is still being debated by peers, but it is expected to clear the House of Lords without a hitch by the end of today. Amber Rudd and David Lidington, respectively the ex-home secretary and Theresa May\u2019s former de facto deputy, have both announced they are among an increasing number of sitting MPs who will quit at the coming election. The Liberal Democrats are \u201cwithin a small swing of winning hundreds of seats\u201d, Jo Swinson has claimed, as the main parties began pushing out key messages before what is billed as the most volatile general election in living memory. That is all from me for today. A colleague will be picking up the blog later for any breaking news. The disclosure from Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, that his party may agree to form pro-remain pacts with other anti-Brexit parties such as the Lib Dems in certain seats (see 4.52pm) raises the question about the role in Scotland of Westminster\u2019s largest anti-Brexit force: the Scottish National party. The Lib Dems are explicitly ruling out any deals with the SNP, even though Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party has 35 MPs now and could well have nearer 50 after election day. It is, on the face of it, a curious decision. After all, Plaid has, like the SNP, an explicit pro-independence policy for Wales and Scotland, and the Greens also support national autonomy for both countries. (Their sister party, the Scottish Greens, are often more gung-ho for a referendum than Sturgeon.) Lib Dem officials at the Scottish parliament say the SNP is excluded from the party\u2019s thinking about possible pacts for one simple reason: the SNP are closer to getting Scottish independence than Plaid is for independence in Wales. Sturgeon made clear as she launched the SNP election campaign in Stirling on Wednesday morning that a second independence referendum will be central to her party\u2019s manifesto. Under Price\u2019s leadership, Plaid is much more explicit about its independence ambitions. The difference, say Lib Dem officials, is that Plaid\u2019s support has fallen by several points to 12% in the few opinion polls carried out in Wales, and so poses no threat, while the SNP dominates the polls in Scotland, and very much does. There is another reason. Top of the Lib Dem target list is the most marginal Westminster seat in the UK, that of North East Fife which was won by the SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins with an extraordinarily slender two vote margin. North East Fife was held by former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell for nearly 30 years and they\u2019d very much like it back. One of Boris Johnson\u2019s main lines of attack against Labour at the moment is the claim that Jeremy Corbyn would submit the country to two referendums after the general election. This is how he put it at PMQs. Johnson said: [Corbyn] also offers a political disaster, consigning next year, which should be a wonderful year for our country, to two more referendums: another referendum on the EU because he cannot make up his mind what he thinks, flip-flopping this way and that; and another referendum on Scottish independence. Why on earth should the people of this country spend the next year, which should be a glorious year, going through the toxic, tedious torpor of two more referendums thanks to the Labour party? Labour is committed to renegotiating Brexit and holding another referendum. As Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said in a briefing for journalists after PMQs, Labour would not agree to a Scottish independence election in 2020. But Corbyn has confirmed that he would be willing to agree to a Scottish independence referendum at some stage later. (For a Scottish independence referendum, Westminster has to allow it.) The Scottish Labour party used to be flatly opposed to a second independence referendum, but Corbyn changed party policy on this during the summer. Speaking during a visit to Crawley Hospital in West Sussex this afternoon, Corbyn said he was \u201cnot in favour\u201d of another referendum on Scottish independence \u201cany time soon\u201d. But he went on: At a later stage, obviously under the terms of devolution, if the Scottish parliament demands it, then there could be, at a much later stage, a referendum. I make it very clear, we are against Scottish independence and we are certainly not in favour of any referendum in Scotland any time soon. From the BBC\u2019s Mark D\u2019Arcy According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, who has written a good insider account of the Conservative election campaign, some senior Tories put their chances of winning at between 50/50 and two thirds. He says: Senior Conservatives put their chances of forming a government on Dec. 13 at between fifty-fifty and two-thirds in favour. The path to a Johnson majority has been made slightly easier after he restored the whip to 10 of the 21 Tory rebels who opposed his Brexit plans last month. But the Tories still go into the election well short of a majority and likely to lose their foothold in Scotland as well as further seats to the Liberal Democrats in areas of England where support for EU membership remains strong. To win a majority healthy enough to comfortably pass his Brexit deal, Johnson would have to gain Labour seats far away from their usual target list \u2014 and with the added unknown factor of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party eating away at their vote in leave areas. The fear among Conservatives throughout the party is that they fall short and that parliament remains hung and deadlocked. The potential of Corbyn in Downing Street in coalition with the Scottish Nationalist party is a risk some Tories did not want to take. But there is a growing worry that, even if Johnson has the numbers to stay in Downing Street but the Commons remains at an impasse, the conversation will turn to another long Brexit extension and a second referendum as the only way to find a definitive answer. Wickham says some Tories are summing up their mood as one of \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d. Overall, while its various factions disagreed over when to go for an election, No 10 is united in the belief that it ultimately has the team and message to win. One Tory who spoke to BuzzFeed News talked about \u201cpositive fatalism\u201d \u2014 the idea that the choice facing the country was clear, an election to break the deadlock in Parliament was inevitable at some point, and that if voters genuinely preferred Corbyn, then so be it. According to CNN\u2019s Luke McGee, Brexit party activists have been told not to say on social media where the party will be standing at the election, amidst rumours it may decide to not most seats, as originally planned, but just a handful. McGee writes: Rumours are now circulating that the Brexit party will switch its focus from standing in every seat to concentrating on a handful of seats that they have a decent chance on winning. On Wednesday morning, party campaigners were sent the following message, which has been seen by CNN. \u201cMessage from HQ ... IMPORTANT. Please go DARK on social media. DO NOT respond to any questions about where we are standing, what the strategy or plan is from now. Things will be made clear to all PPCs very soon. #changepoliticsforgood.\u201d Adam Price, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader, has confirmed that his party may form a pact with other pro-remain parties to maximise their chances. In August Plaid Cymru and the Greens stood aside in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, which helped the Lib Dems win the seat from the Tories. Price said: The Brexit crisis has shown up Westminster to be totally unfit for purpose. The Conservatives and Labour are divided and are simply not offering the solutions we need. Plaid Cymru is a party of principle and we have consistently said that Wales is best served within the European Union. That is why, as Wales\u2019s leading remain party, we are open to working with others to secure our European future. Tory MPs have been criticised for jeering Jeremy Corbyn over his green tie, which he wore as a sign of respect to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, the Press Association reports. The Labour leader wore the garment for a House of Commons debate on Wednesday after the report into the disaster that killed 72 people was published. As relatives of those killed looked on from the public gallery, members from the Conservative benches mocked him for the bright tie. Theresa May, who was prime minister when the blaze took hold of the west London building in June 2017, could be seen admonishing them by stressing the tie was to mark the tragedy, PA reports. Asked to comment on the MPs\u2019 behaviour, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said: I think that\u2019s fairly contemptible. He was wearing a green tie as a mark of respect for the victims of the Grenfell disaster. I think those Tory MPs mocking his tie would be better supporting justice for the families and the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and those who died in similar conflagrations and to deliver safety and protection for people living in tower blocks all over the country. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, the Commons standards committee has asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, to schedule a debate tomorrow to allow MPs to pass a motion approving the committee\u2019s recommendation for Labour MP Keith Vaz to be suspended for six months. The full text of Green\u2019s letter to Rees-Mogg is here (pdf). Michelle O\u2019Neill has said Sinn Fein is hoping to unseat \u201can architect of Brexit\u201d - DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds - as it aims to increase its number of MPs from seven to eight. As the Press Association reports, the Sinn Fein vice president said the December 12 general election will be about maximising the return of pro-Remain candidates. Standing alongside the party\u2019s North Belfast candidate John Finucane, O\u2019Neill said: We will stand in our seven constituencies in which we currently hold seats and we will stand in North Belfast to win that seat. We believe there is a real opportunity in North Belfast to oust someone who has been architect of Brexit, someone who has actively worked against the interests of people who live here on this island, and John Finucane can provide local representation but also will reflect Ireland\u2019s interests in all of this mess. Dodds had a majority of 2,081 over Sinn Fein in 2017. But at that election Dodds did not face a challenge from the Ulster Unionist party, which agreed to give the DUP a clear run to maximise the unionist vote. But this time the UUP intends to put up candidates in all 18 of Northern Ireland\u2019s constituency because it does not want to be seen to endorse the DUP\u2019s Brexit stance. Jeremy Corbyn is challenging Boris Johnson to face him in head-to-head televised debates during the election campaign, the Press Association reports. But it was unclear whether the Labour leader was willing to accept a challenge for a three-way discussion from Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. After PMQs, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman told journalists: As we demanded of Theresa May and she refused to agree, we would challenge Boris Johnson to agree today to head-to-head TV debates in this campaign. But when asked about a three-way discussion with Swinson, the spokesman replied: We are in discussion with the broadcasters. But there are only two people who can be prime minister at the end of this campaign and I think the British public have a clear right to see them debate head-to-head on TV and hear their cases. The number of MPs who have said they are standing down has now reached 57. Sir Alan Duncan, the former Foreign Office minister, is the latest to announce his departure. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about two of the most prominent departures, the former Tory work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd and the former \u201cde facto deputy prime minister\u201d David Lidington. As the Mail\u2019s Jack Doyle revealed, Mark Spencer, the Tory chief whip, sent a letter to Rudd today saying he was not willing to restore the whip to her because he did not trust her not to criticise the prime minister again. He told her: I appreciate that you surrendered the whip in an act of solidarity [with the 21 fellow Tories who had had the whip withdrawn] but I am of the view that the receipt of the whip is an honour, not a right, and as such it cannot be discarded or returned at will if it is to have any meaning. The Scottish Tories will run a \u201cdecisive and determined\u201d election campaign promising voters there will be a \u201creferendum free period ahead\u201d, the party\u2019s interim leader Jackson Carlaw said. Speaking as the Scottish Tories launched its campaign in Perth, Carlaw said his was the only party pledging no more referendums, in contrast to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s support for a fresh EU poll and a second Scottish independence vote next year. He told reporters: We\u2019ve now fought several referendums. I have respected the result of them all, win or lose; Nicola Sturgeon has never respected the result of any referendum, other than the illegal one in Catalonia. [As] we go forward from here Scottish Conservatives are promising a referendum free period ahead. Nicola Sturgeon is promising another two referendums. If we want to end that division, if we want to move on, we have to keep Scotland in the UK, and no more referendums. Sturgeon, who kicked off the Scottish National party\u2019s campaign on Wednesday at an event in Stirling at which newspaper reporters were not invited, would dispute Carlaw\u2019s claims she respected the result of the unofficial Catalan referendum in 2017. She backed the case for staging one in principle, but did not endorse the event itself. Previously deputy Scottish leader, Carlaw replaced Ruth Davidson after she resigned unexpected in August, partly in protest at Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, pending a leadership contest next year, but the party\u2019s campaign literature still promotes Davidson prominently. It sent out election letters to Tory voters signed by Davidson, a keen remain campaigner during the referendum, saying the threat of a second independence vote was a very real one. The A3 election leaflets Tory activists handed out in Perth on Wednesday did not name Carlaw once. Perth and North Perthshire is a key Tory target seat: the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart retained it with a wafer-thin majority of 21 votes, or 0.04%, over the Tories. Carlaw insisted that promoting Davidson prove the Tories had a strong team, which included both his predecessors \u2013 Davidson and Annabel Goldie, while sidestepping questions on whether he personally trusted Boris Johnson. He said: We\u2019re absolutely delighted we have got former leaders that we\u2019re able to use in this campaign. I doubt the SNP will be using Alex Salmond. I doubt the Labour party will be using Kezia Dugdale. Brexit day has now officially been changed, in UK law, from 31 October 2019 to 31 January 2020. Although the Brexit extension was agreed with the EU earlier this week, the government still had to change the date of \u201cexit day\u201d set out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act for EU law to continue to apply until the new exit date. Ministers have now just done this, by approving the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019. James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, was the person who signed it. Under the Act, ministers can change the exit date in the legislation without the need for a vote in parliament. There was a vote the last time it got changed, but that was because Theresa May agreed to hold one in response to a request from Tory Brexiters. Overseas voters have been advised to consider finding a proxy voter for December\u2019s snap general election because of the risks their postal votes may not arrive in time. The Association of Electoral Administrators, the body which represents the UK\u2019s returning officers and other election staff, said there were logistical challenges in getting postal ballots printed and sent out in time. After MPs voted last night to stage the election on 12 December, it has now officially recommended that option. The Cabinet Office has advice on how to apply on its website, and says an overseas voter can ask anyone to be their proxy, as long as they\u2019re able to vote. A number of councils began floating this option some weeks ago after the threat of a snap election gained traction: Tower Hamlets and Islington councils in London were amongst a number who began contacting overseas voters by email in September raising this option. Postal ballot packs cannot be sent out until all the candidates have been confirmed. The registration deadline is 14 November while the deadline to register for a vote is 25 November. Only a few printers around the UK are contracted to produce ballot papers and postal ballot forms, adding to the pressure. The Royal Mail will also be over-stretched by Christmas post, without factoring in any bad winter weather. The AEA said: Our members have been actively working on provisional polling station bookings, alerting temporary staff and working with printers to agree orders for poll cards and postal vote packs. Election teams will now be working extended hours across seven-day weeks to make sure that the polls on 12 December and subsequent counts go smoothly. As always, we will be working with our partners at the Cabinet Office, Electoral Commission, Royal Mail and more widely to ensure that our members are kept fully supported and up to date. As postal vote packs cannot be printed until candidate nominations close in the middle of November, it may be prudent for UK voters living overseas to consider setting up a proxy vote to have someone they trust vote on their behalf on 12 December. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story about the opening of the Grenfell Tower debate. I won\u2019t be covering the rest of the debate, and I will be turning back now to general election developments. Turning to the \u201cstay put\u201d doctrine, May says this doctrine had been developed for good reasons. The problem was, there was no flexibility in implementing this, she says. She says firefighters should get training to ensure that they know when and when not to enforce \u201cstay put\u201d. She says one father survived the fire because he ignored advice to stay put. Labour\u2019s Andrew Slaughter asks May if she accepts that Grenfell Tower would have benefitted from sprinklers. Should they be fitted in all new tower blocks, and retrofitted in old ones? May says the Lakanal House report did not say sprinklers should be obligatory. May praises the bravery of the firefighters who attended the fire. But she says it is clear from the report that there are problems with the way the fire service worked that need to addressed. The emergency services must be able to work together, she says. She says, as home secretary, she oversaw the JESIP project that was intended to address this. But the report shows that there were still problems. May says she has been struck by the care that the Grenfell Tower community have shown for each other. She says others have a lot to learn from this. She says people living in the tower were raising concerns about its safety well before the fire. But those concerns were ignored, she says. She says this was one of the most shocking aspects of what happened. She says housing ministers, including Alok Sharma, now international development secretary, worked on a plan to ensure people in social housing have their concerns heard. She was the government has been working on a green paper on this. She urges the government to publish this as soon as possible. Labour\u2019s Karen Lee asks May if it is acceptable that the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have not been properly rehoused. May says, in the early stages, the work to find permanent homes for survivors did not go fast enough. She says she accepts that the survivors think the government has not done enough. But every effort will be made to support these families, she says. She says it is not just housing; mental health support is important too, she says. Theresa May, the former prime minister who set up the Grenfell Tower inquiry, is speaking now. She thanks Boris Johnson for the serious tone of his speech, and pays tribute to the dignity and fortitude shown by the survivors in their fight for justice. He says it cannot have been easy for the survivors to give evidence to the inquiry. And he thanks Sir Martin Moore-Bick for his report. It is detailed, and shocking, she says. Corbyn says, although Boris Johnson spoke about building a beautiful memorial to the victims of the fire, the real memorial will be a properly funded fire service and having people living in safe buildings. Corbyn says the night of 14 June 2017 will never be forgotten. And he pays tribute to the Kensington MP, Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad, who had to respond to the fire only days after being elected to parliament. Corbyn says government cuts have degraded the fire service. And Boris Johnson was involved when he was mayor of London. As mayor of London, the now prime minister was at the forefront of the cuts to our fire service. In the eight years that he was mayor, the London fire brigade was required to make gross savings of over \u00a3100m, cutting of 27 fire appliances, 552 firefighters, 324 support staff, two fire rescue units, three training appliances and closing ten London fire stations. Corbyn says it is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the \u201cstay put\u201d policy has not been reviewed. He says concerns have been raised about this for years, including by the Fire Brigades Union, but the government has dragged its feet. Corbyn says firefighters were not to blame for the fire. While this phase of the report makes criticism of the London fire brigade we should remember; it was not firefighters that deregulated building safety standards. It wasn\u2019t firefighters who ignored the concerns of tenants. It wasn\u2019t firefighters who ignored a coroner\u2019s report and failed to put sprinklers in high rise blocks and it wasn\u2019t firefighters who put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower. Corbyn says we are not seeing urgent action from government. Councils know that if they spend money removing cladding they may not get compensation from government, and other services may suffer. Grenfell Tower would not have happened to wealthy Londoners, he says. Corbyn criticises the government for failing to learn the lessons from previous high-rise fires, particularly the Lakanal House fire and the Shirley Towers fire. He criticises the fact that some Grenfell Tower survivors are still living in temporary accommodation. Labour\u2019s David Lammy says many people believe what happened at Grenfell Tower amounted to corporate manslaughter. Corbyn says he hopes ministers will have heard the point Lammy made. There has be be justice, he says. He says it may be for the courts to find out if people installed cladding that they knew to be dangerous. He says the government should not stand in the way of that. Labour\u2019s Jim Fitzpatrick says many in the media have been targeting the fire brigade. They should be waiting for the big picture to emerge, he says. Corbyn thanks Fitzpatrick for what he said. He says Fitzpatrick is a former fireman. He says the media should be \u201ccautious\u201d about throwing blame around, because there is another report to come. Corbyn says he has been on a number of the walks for Grenfell. He has been on many marches on his life, he says. But he has never been on anything as poignant as this \u2013 people walking silently past what is left of the Grenfell Tower. He says, as the march went passed the fire station, it was clear how much respect people have for the firefighters. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He starts by thanking Johnson for the serious tone of his speech. He says many of the survivors are in the gallery watching. For them, this is another day for horrid memories, he says. He says he remembers visiting the tower himself afterwards. This was a tragedy, he says. But it was an avoidable tragedy, he says. All the survivors deserve a new home in the UK, he says. Johnson says the government will continue to support the affected families \u201clong after the television cameras are gone\u201d. He says it will ensure a beautiful and appropriate memorial is built to the families. The government will also ensure that regulations are tightened up in line with the recommendations. He says he is personally committed to ensuring that the lessons do not get forgotten. The survivors had every reason to hide away. But instead they have fought for the truth, and dedicated their lives to ensuring that those who died will always be remembered. He says the truth will out, justice will be done, and Grenfell Tower, and the people who called it home, will never be forgotten. Johnson says the report will be \u201charrowing\u201d for survivors. But he says he hopes it will show them that Sir Martin Moore-Bick is determined to get at the truth. Johnson says he has never met any firefighter anything less than totally committed to public safety. He says he will ensure the lessons of Grenfell Tower are accepted. Where Moore-Bick says the government should take responsibility for fire safety, the government will legislate. And he says the government will accept all the report\u2019s recommendations for central government. Johnson says it is easy for MPs to have 20/20 hindsight. But they do not have to run into fires like firefighters, he says. Labour\u2019s Rushanara Ali asks if Johnson regrets the cuts the fire services he implemented as London mayor. And does he accept that the regulators have had their powers reduced by the government. Johnson says the fire service arrived on the scene within minutes. He says today\u2019s report does not make any criticism about resources. Johnson says the fire presented an unprecedented challenge for the fire service. He says Moore-Bick does not question the actions of any of the rank and file firefighters at Grenfell Tower. Moore-Bick said they showed courage and \u201cselfless devotion to duty\u201d as they faced choking smoke and temperature up to 1,000 degrees, he says. But the report says the firefighters were faced with a situation for which they had not been properly prepared, he says. He says the report says there was a serious failure of stated policies. The failure to order an evacuation of the fire after it was clear the fire was out of control probably led to the deaths of people who could have been saved, the report says. Johnson says fire procedure in blocks of flats is based on the \u201cstay put\u201d policy. In most circumstances this is the best policy. But at Grenfell Tower that was not the case. By 1.30am it was clear compartmentalisation (the theory that a fire will be contained) had failed. By 1.50am it was not too late to evacuate. But senior officers could not conceive of a situation in which compartmentalisation might not work. By the time an evacuation was ordered, the tower\u2019s single staircase was filled with impenetrable smoke. Johnson says the report is clear that the cladding was responsible for the fire escalating in the way that it did. It was because of the cladding that a routine fire ended up killing so many people. He says Moore-Bick is clear that the cladding that was installed contravened building regulations. Labour\u2019s David Lammy asks what the government is being done to help people who are still living in flats with this cladding. Johnson says the government has allocated money to remove this cladding. He accepts that progress on getting rid of it has not been as fast as he would like. All buildings owned by central or local government have had this removed, or at least have had the removal work scheduled. But in the private sector progress is slower, he says. Matthew Offord, a Conservative, asks what will happen to owners who do not remove the cladding by the June 2020 deadline. Johnson says the government is planning to name them. The people in those blocks are safe, because of 24 hour patrols. But the government needs to go further, he says. He says the government will take action to force owners to remove this cladding. Johnson says this stage of the inquiry looked at what happened. The next stage will look at why it happened. That will consider, among other things, why concerns raised by residents were ignored. Johnson says the government will allow time for MPs to debate the report at a later point, when they have had time to read it. Johnson says for too long those living in Grenfell Tower had their voices ignored \u2013 before the fire, and after. He says when firefighters were first called to Grenfell Tower, after a fire started by a faulty fridge, they thought it was a routine call. But the fire expanded rapidly. Within 45 minutes it was clear that the inferno was out of control. He says there were almost 300 people in the tower, 72 of whom died. Many people who lived together died together, he says. And those who survived saw everything they owned reduced to dust and ash, he says. Johnson says Theresa May ordered an inquiry soon afterwards. She was determined that the survivors would not have to wait years for justice. Today Sir Martin Moore-Bick has published the first report from his inquiry, Johnson says. He says it is almost 1,000 pages long. The full report is available here. And an executive summary is here (pdf). Boris Johnson is now opening a three-hour debate on the first report from the Grenfell Tower. Our main story about the report is here. John Bercow is now thanking his staff, and his wife and children for their support. His voice briefly cracks with emotion, and afterwards there is a brief round of applause. He announces that Tricia Hillas, the canon pastor at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, has been appointed as the next Speaker\u2019s chaplain. He says he is delighted that she will be the second BAME person to take up that role. She will succeed Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who has been appointed bishop of Dover. UPDATE: This is from St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Richard Benyon, a Conservative, says Boris Johnson once said there was more chance of his being decapitated by a frisbee than becoming PM. He urges Johnson to continue the UK\u2019s strong record on ocean conservation. Johnson praises Benyon\u2019s own record on this topic. John Bercow admits he is \u201cstretching time\u201d but he is going to take two more MPs. He calls Labour\u2019s Ronnie Campbell, who starts by saying Bercow is the best Speaker he has seen in his time in parliament. Campbell asks about the Waspi women (women who have lost out by increases in the state pension age for women, which were not well advertised in advance). Johnson says he is looking at what more can be done. But it is a very difficult issue, he says. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg We\u2019ve got six more weeks of this. Sometimes PMQs is used as an opportunity for a forensic analysis of a particular issue, but today, more than ever, it was dominated by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn rehearsing their election sloganising. And neither leader seems to have an overwhelming advantage. Corbyn focused on the NHS in all his questions. Traditionally this has been Labour\u2019s strongest electoral territory and Corbyn had Johnson on the defensive throughout. His arguments about NHS underfunding and increasing waiting lists were more persuasive than Johnson\u2019s \u201call is fine\u201d bravado, and Johnson was confounded when Corbyn started talking about an individual case, because Corbyn sounded more emphatic than the PM. Corbyn also made it clear that he is going to spend much of the time claiming that a Johnson Brexit would open the door to the further marketisation and privatisation of the NHS. Whether this is wholly true is contestable, but it is a fear that registers with people, and may work well on the doorstep. Johnson was weak on the actual details of how the NHS works. But his attack lines against Corbyn \u2013 accusing him of sweeping anti-Americanism, and wholesale hostility to the involvement of private firms in the NHS (even though many NHS services are privately provided anyway \u2013 were much more powerful than anything Theresa May threw at Corbyn, and delivered with relish. At the end of the exchanges Corbyn and Johnson both segued into wider themes. Corbyn\u2019s line about the election providing a once in a lifetime opportunity for change resonated. But it wasn\u2019t as catchy as Johnson\u2019s argument about Labour offering two referendums, which was just about true enough to register and stick as a key election message. (Labour are certainly promising a second Brexit referendum, which would fill some of the electorate with dread. Corbyn does not favour a second Scottish independence referendum, but he has not 100% ruled one out, and a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would probably end up agreeing to one.) Johnson\u2019s most lively attack lines were probably those he delivered against the SNP. It is widely assumed that the Tories will lose most of their seats in Scotland, and Ian Blackford had a good line when he said Johnson would be welcome in the country because he boosted SNP support. But, even if this is true, Johnson seemed to enjoy the chance to bang on about \u201cborders at Berwick\u201d. (See 12.35pm.) Labour\u2019s Karen Buck asks how Johnson can justify spending \u00a32bn on no-deal Brexit planning. Johnson claims that under Labour\u2019s Brexit plan the UK would have to spend an extra \u00a31bn a month to stay in the EU. (This is misleading. Because of the transition, even if the UK were leaving the EU at the end of the month, it would still be contributing to the EU as it is now.) UPDATE: Rather than \u201cmisleading\u201d, it would be better to say this was just untrue. The Full Fact factchecking website explains why here. Steve Baker, a Conservative, says thousands of his constituents in Wycombe have relatives living near the line of control in Kashmir. Johnson says this is a serious issue. But it is a matter for India and Pakistan, he says. He says it is not for the UK to decide what the solution must be. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan says fireworks can cause great disturbance to people and livestock. The Scottish government carried out a consultation that showed people favour greater controls. Does Johnson agree? Johnson says the law should strike a balance. He says animal welfare is important. And Brexit will allow the government to introduce more animal welfare measures. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips says it is a delight to see Bercow\u2019s children in the gallery. She knows Bercow takes his responsibilities as a parent seriously. \u201cAnd now to the prime minister,\u201d she goes on, in a clear jibe at Johnson\u2019s own record as a parent. She asks for an assurance that schools will be properly funded, so that they do not have to close early (a problem in Phillips\u2019 constituency). Johnson says his government will fund schools properly. Phillips\u2019 son will have a great future under them, he says. Nigel Evans, the Tory MP, says that as a former deputy Speaker he wants to pay tribute to what John Bercow did for LGBT rights. He says a survey last week showed that the Ribble Valley (Evans\u2019 constituency) is the happiest place in Britain. A Tory election victory will make them happier. And will Johnson deliver the Brexit people want. Johnson says he will, and he promises more police officers too. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, also offers his best wishes to John Bercow. He says he hopes Bercow enjoys his retirement. Bercow will always be welcome in Scotland, he says. And Blackford wishes England all the best for the rugby on Saturday. He says the PM\u2019s Brexit will take a wrecking ball to the economy and cost it up to \u00a370bn. The PM is willing to throw Scotland under his big red bus to deliver Brexit, he says. Johnson says the greatest damage that can be done to the Scottish economy would come from the SNP\u2019s plan for independence. That would break up the most successful political partnership in history. The SNP have a crackpot plan for borders at Berwick, he says. And the SNP would hand back control of Scottish fisheries to Brussels, just at the point where control is coming back to the UK. Blackford says it is PMQs, not the time for a \u201crant\u201d from the PM. He says Johnson will be welcome in Scotland; every time he comes up, he drives up support for the SNP. The SNP is the only party standing up for Scotland\u2019s interests. Only a vote for the SNP will secure an escape route from Brexit, he says. And it will secure Scotland\u2019s right to protect its future. Johnson says Blackford rants himself. And he says the SNP wants to conceal its record. It is not running health or education well. And if good things are happening in Scotland, it is thanks to Scottish Conservatives. He says they can be relied upon to keep the union together. Corbyn says he is surprised Johnson can keep a straight face when his government has cut so much from the Welsh budget. He says anyone who has tried to get a GP appointment will know the problems. He quotes from a letter from Gillian, who says her mother died as a direct result of the GP shortage. The care her mother got always came after long delays. He says people who have to wait should be sympathised with and supported. Johnson says there are 17,300 more doctors and 17,000 more nurses since 2010. It is time to differentiate between the politics of protest and the politics of leadership. It is all very well to side with Russia and make huge promises and flip-flop on the referendum. Leadership means standing up for the police, for the economy, for wealth creators. And above all, it means getting Brexit done. Corbyn says, coming from a PM who withdrew his own bill, that sounds a bit odd. He says Johnson should have tried to show some empathy. GPs are in short supply. The NHS has suffered its longest spending squeeze ever. He says this election is a once-in-a-generation chance to end underfunding in the NHS. The NHS is up for grabs in a Trump-style trade deal, he says. It is up for grab by US corporations. Isn\u2019t the truth that his government is planning to sell out the NHS? Johnson says he agrees there is a stark choice. It is between economic catastrophe under Labour, which would spend \u00a3196bn on nationalisations. And there would be a political catastrophe under Labour too. There would be two referendums, on Brexit and on Scotland. The UK would suffer \u201ctoxic torpor\u201d. He says his government will invest in schools and education and infrastructure. That is what he is going to deliver. And he will deliver a fantastic future. That is the choice: \u201cdrift and dither\u201d under Labour, or a brighter future under the Tories. Corbyn says of course the NHS needs to import medicines. He just wants it to be done openly. He does not approve of secret talks. Patients are waiting longer for cancer treatment, he says. Why can\u2019t Johnson put the necessary resources into the NHS. Corbyn asks why NHS privatisation has doubled under this government. Nearly \u00a310bn is spent on the NHS under this government. Johnson says, if Corbyn is saying that he does not want dentists and Macmillan nurses to work with the NHS, he is \u201cout of his mind\u201d. Corbyn should pay tribute to the hard work of NHS staff. He should not talk down their achievements. He says a strong economy supports the NHS. Corbyn would wreck that. Corbyn says we should not have private companies like Virgin Health suing the NHS. NHS money should not go into making people richer. Why has the number of people waiting for an operation reached a record high? Johnson says the NHS is working harder and achieving more. He says the SNP government negotiated a much higher price for the cystic fibrosis drug than did NHS England. If people want to know what a Labour NHS would look like, look at Wales. Targets there are routinely missed, he says. Corbyn says he welcomes the cystic fibrosis drug decision. But we have not been told what the deal actually was. He says, although Johnson talks of 40 new hospitals, the real figure is just six. He says the US wants full market access to the NHS. While the government is having secret meeting with US corporations, patients here are suffering. Why has the number of patients waiting longer for urgent NHS treatment tripled over the last nine years? Johnson says waiting lists are improving. He says Corbyn should not be claiming credit for the cystic fibrosis drug decision. The drug company involved is American. Is Corbyn really saying the NHS should not be talking to companies like that? Jeremy Corbyn pays his own tribute to John Bercow. He says Bercow has stood up for parliament. He says Labour hopes to form a government and expects to be held to account. Bercow has also done his bit to open up parliament, Corbyn says. He has changed some of the strange customs, and has promoted diversity. And he has tried to change the Commons from being a gentlemen\u2019s club and turn it into a democratic institution. Corbyn says the PM\u2019s sellout deal with Donald Trump will mean more NHS money going into private profit. He says the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation showed the health service has been repeatedly discussed with US officials. Why does Johnson say the NHS is not on the table? Because it is not on the table, says Johnson. He pays tribute to the way the NHS has recently made a cystic fibrosis drug available. The NHS is getting more money because the economy has been growing under the Tories, he says. Johnson confirms that the scheme for giving grants to thalidomide victims, which is due to end soon, will be reviewed with a view to it continuing. Labour\u2019s Alan Whitehead asks about the news that the Tory manifesto will be written by a lobbyist for the fracking industry. Johnson says the government will soon make an announcement about fracking. But this government yields to no one in its enthusiasm to cut carbon emissions, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying that after PMQs he will open the debate on the Grenfell Tower fire report. He goes on to pay tribute to John Bercow, the Speaker, saying this is his last PMQs. He says Bercow has peppered the chamber with comments like some tennis player machine. (Bercow is a huge tennis fan, and an accomplished player himself.) He says he disagrees with some of Bercow\u2019s innovations as Speaker. But Bercow has done more than anyone since Stephen Hawking to \u201cstretch time\u201d in the chamber. (See 12.03pm.) From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike PMQs is about to start. It is only Boris Johnson\u2019s third PMQs since he became prime minister in July. Here is an interesting question from below the line. Psephologists will tell you that there is a minor incumbency advantage in election; ie, sitting candidates do better all other factors considered than new candidates, because voters know who they are. However, the impact is marginal. And since both the Conservatives and Labour have broadly similar numbers of MPs standing down, it is hard to see this factor making a difference. Some of the MPs standing down represent very safe seats. But in places like Putney, which is 35th on a list of Labour target seats and where Justine Greening is standing down, and Ashfield, 10th on a list of Tory target seats and where Gloria De Piero is standing down, the departure of an incumbent might arguably make a bit of a difference. Here is an up-to-date list of MPs standing down from the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard. What is probably more significant is how these departures will affect the composition of the parliamentary Conservative party and the parliamentary Labour party after the election. There are clearly some people around Boris Johnson who want to purge his party of remainers like Philip Hammond. And, in Labour, replacing centrists with leftwingers who back the Corbyn project has long been an ambition of those in the leader\u2019s circle. It is too early to be know quite to what extent both these parties will be transformed after the election, but in both parties the post-election centre of gravity will probably be in a slightly different place. You can read all of the Guardian\u2019s election 2019 coverage here, including my colleague Dan Sabbagh\u2019s analysis of the latest polling. And here are three other articles from today\u2019s papers about the polling situation. Prof Sir John Curtice, the BBC\u2019s lead polling expert, says in an article in the Times (paywall) Boris Johnson cannot afford not to achieve a majority. If the substantial net swing from Labour to Conservative in the present polls were to be realised at the ballot box, there are nearly 50 Labour seats that would fall into the Tory column. Winning those would more than compensate for losses elsewhere. Moreover, they are disproportionately located in the north of England and the Midlands, where many a voter backed leave, though, at 55%, the average support for leave in these seats was only somewhat above the 52% vote across the country as a whole. But while Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes rest on taking Labour seats, the principal foundation underpinning his lead over Mr Corbyn\u2019s party is not any marked success in winning over Labour votes. Rather it rests on his success in squeezing support for the Brexit party ... Above all, this is a contest that Mr Johnson cannot afford to emerge from without an overall majority. Biggest party in a hung parliament will not do. In that event, Labour will potentially be able to look to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP for support \u2013 for they all want to stop Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in its tracks. The academic Matthew Goodwin says in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) that it is possible for Johnson to win a majority. One crucial piece of the puzzle is in Labour leave seats. Two years ago, Theresa May won only six of these seats and so found herself unable to compensate for losses elsewhere. This time around, Johnson will have to do much better. If his invasion of Labour Brexit territory can go as far as Wolverhampton North East, which was last Tory in 1987, or Stoke-on-Trent North, which has never been held by the Conservatives in the postwar era, a wave of other pro-Brexit Labour seats will likely turn blue, from Dudley North to Barrow and Furness, from Ashfield to Bishop Auckland. A strong majority would surely follow. Consolidating the leave vote would be made infinitely easier were the Brexit party to stand down, or the two parties to form some kind of pact. May did manage to squeeze the Ukip vote down to less than 2%. Farage is polling at about 10%. Sebastian Payne and John Burns-Murdoch in the Financial Times (paywall) say Boris Johnson is in much the same position as Theresa May was at the start of the 2017 campaign. An analysis by the Financial Times of the opinion polls suggests Mr Johnson\u2019s party is facing an electoral landscape hardly changed since the 2017 election was called. Labour was polling on 25% on Tuesday, exactly the same level as when Mrs May called her snap vote. Worryingly for Mr Johnson, however, the Conservatives are significantly further behind than at the start of the last campaign. Whereas the Tories were polling 44% on the day the previous election was called, they are currently projected to garner 36% share of the vote. The political circumstances mirror those of Mrs May who was seeking to win a majority to secure a Brexit deal; Mr Johnson is doing so to achieve the same goal. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, on tactical voting. (See 10.32am.) Boris Johnson is on course to win a Commons majority unless remain voters work tactically to block a Tory victory and ensure an EU-backing leadership, according to research. As PA Media reports, the Conservatives would achieve a majority of 44 if no tactical voting took place but anti-Brexit voters could scupper this, according to a study by the Best for Britain campaign. If fewer than a third of remain voters (30%) used their vote tactically they could swing the election to deny the prime minister and to secure a remain majority of four. The research by the anti-Brexit campaign was based on seat-by-seat analysis of 46,000 people over September and October and was released this morning, PA reports. The study does not seem to be online yet, but when it goes up, I will post a link. Now we\u2019re up to 51 MPs standing down. (See 10.04am.) Amber Rudd, the former Conservative work and pensions secretary, who sits as an independent, has announced that she won\u2019t stand as a candidate at the election. Rudd had been talking about possibly standing as an independent (see 9.43am.) But, in an interview with the Evening Standard (edited by her Tory ally, the former chancellor George Osborne), she hinted that she might try to return in the future. She said: I\u2019m not finished with politics, I\u2019m just not standing at this election. Rudd also insisted that her relations with Boris Johnson were good. She told the paper: I spoke to the prime minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago. I\u2019m really confident of my position. I will be leaving the House of Commons on perfectly good terms with the prime minister and I want him to succeed. That is not how it was a few weeks ago. When she resigned from cabinet in early September, Rudd accused Johnson of \u201can assault on decency and democracy\u201d because he had removed the whip from the 21 Tories who rebelled over Brexit. She also said she did not think Johnson was seriously committed to getting a Brexit deal. That judgment is now looking rash, in the light of the fact that Johnson did manage to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that passed its second reading in the Commons, although it is arguable that Johnson committed properly to a deal only when rebels like Rudd made it clear to him that a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable to parliament. The Labour MP Adrian Bailey, 73, who represents West Bromwich West, has also announced he is standing down, the Express and Star reports. Gavin Freeguard from the Institute for Government, who is keeping a tally, says Bailey\u2019s decision takes the number of MPs leaving parliament to 49 \u2013 although his table does not include Patrick McLoughlin (see 9.59am), and so there are now at least 50 MPs leaving. The Tory MP Sir Patrick McLoughlin, a former chief whip and former transport secretary, has announced that he is standing down. He is the only former miner in the Conservative parliamentary party and got involved in Tory politics after he was one of the miners who carried on working during the 1984-85 strike. Aged 62, the MP for the Derbyshire Dales has been in parliament since 1986. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Last night, as my colleague Peter Walker reports, the Tories announced that 10 of the MPs who had the whip withdrawn after rebelling on Brexit were being readmitted to the parliamentary party. But the list did not include Amber Rudd, who voluntarily resigned the whip when she resigned as work and pensions secretary, also in protest over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy. This morning on the Today programme, Nick Robinson said he had heard Rudd was coming back to the party. But it seems the situation is not straightforward. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. One problem might be that Rudd has already told her constituents that she does not want to stand again in Hastings and Rye, where she had a majority of only 346 at the last election. In recent interviews, she said she might stand as an independent somewhere else, but she has not committed herself to a particular constituency. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, will ask the UK government for a section 30 order to proceed with planning a second independence referendum before the end of this year, despite the general election. Speaking to the National newspaper, her spokesman insisted she would make the request this \u201ccalendar year\u201d, saying: As the first minister has made clear, we will be demanding the transfer of power for a referendum before the end of this calendar year. Independence will be at the very heart of this election campaign, and another win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland\u2019s right to choose its own future. This assurance comes despite practical concerns about when exactly Boris Johnson\u2019s government would be able to respond to the request, given that the Commons will shortly be dissolved and no policy announcements are made during the campaign period. Meanwhile, the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has left open the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: \u201c31 January is the next threat if you like for a no-deal Brexit, that\u2019s the next deadline.\u201d Jack added: \u201cWe have a deal which we\u2019re going to put in our manifesto and we\u2019re asking people to give us a mandate to put that deal through and that will bring the matter to a conclusion\u201d. In his Today interview, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked if drug pricing would be on the agenda in trade talks with the US after Brexit. The question was prompted by the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation saying drug pricing has been discussed at meetings between UK and US officials. Hancock said drug prices would be \u201coff the table\u201d in a future trade deal. Asked why it had come up in talks, as Dispatches revealed, he replied: It is off the table. There has been no agreement and no formal meetings. There is no mandate for how these trade talks will happen. He also said it was \u201cagainst the government\u2019s policy to make any changes to drug pricing\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. It may feel like the first full day of the 2019 election campaign, but the legislation for the December poll has not cleared parliament yet and the Commons is still sitting. Here are the items on the agenda for the day. 10am: The first report from the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire is published. 10am: The anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign publishes research intended to assist anti-Brexit tactical voting at the election. 11am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, launches the SNP\u2019s general election campaign at an event in Stirling. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: Johnson is expected to make a statement to MPs about the Grenfell Tower fire report. There will then be a three-hour debate on the report. After 3.30pm: Peers begin their debate on the early parliamentary general election bill. It is due to clear all its Lords stages today. In theory, peers could amend the bill but in reality, given that the House of Commons has agreed to an early election with the backing of all the main parties, it is very hard to imagine circumstances in which unelected peers would want to tamper with this legislation. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was asked if he would like to apologise on behalf of the Conservative party for breaking their \u201cdo or die\u201d promise that Brexit would take place on 31 October. He told the Today programme: No. Because it\u2019s parliament that\u2019s blocked delivering Brexit. Asked if he could clear up whether Amber Rudd would be a Tory candidate in the election, Hancock said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not in the whips office.\u201d He said he considers Rudd a good friend, adding: \u201cAmber chose to resign from the Conservative party,\u201d, before adding: \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is the Conservative party is at its best when we\u2019re a broad church.\u201d He was questioned over his previous statements regarding a general election, after he said that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t want to do it\u201d and it was \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d. \u201cWell I\u2019m certainly not yearning for a general election and haven\u2019t been, but its the only way to move the country forward,\u201d the MP, who has a 17,000 majority in West Suffolk, said, adding: \u201cWe have to respect the result of the referendum because we\u2019re democrats.\u201d Asked if he thought the public could punish the Tories for not delivering Brexit this year: I don\u2019t think anyone in this country thinks that that Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t been doing everything he possibly can to deliver on Brexit. He was the architect of the campaign to leave and he\u2019s now succeeded in getting a new deal with the EU, which many people said was impossible. It\u2019s parliament that has blocked delivering Brexit and that\u2019s why we need a general election. Parliament was given the vote and chose to delay. He said the Tory party had an \u201coptimistic, positive one nation agenda rooted in the centre ground of British politics\u201d, and that this was not the case in 2017. On what the party is offering voters, Hancock said: What we\u2019re proposing is to be able to deliver Brexit on a deal, and then to be able to get on to the NHS, to having 20,000 more police, to the increases in spending on schools and strengthening school standards, on to strengthening the environment, and all the other things on the domestic agenda that only we can deliver, because it\u2019s only by having a majority in parliament we\u2019ll be able to move beyond all the things that have blocked this from all happening in the last few years. Asked if he had doubts about a general election, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Lib Dems \u201cwent into coalition with the Tories basically and the SNP jumped ship\u201d. Meanwhile, no deal was taken off the agenda. Bring it on, let\u2019s have a go, despite it being December and cold and dark .. we\u2019re going to have a real go at this and I think we\u2019ll win. I think we\u2019ll have a majority government by Christmas, so I can\u2019t think of a better Christmas present. Asked on the Today programme about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal popularity, McDonnell pointed towards Boris Johnson\u2019s own ratings and said the Labour leader was \u201cone of the best campaigners I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He said Labour in government would make sure there is a \u201csensible, Brexit option\u201d in contrast to the \u201cdisaster\u201d deal being offered by the Conservatives, but also give people the option to remain. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, let the people decide.\u201d On the possibility of deciding to go forward as an overtly pro-remain party, McDonnell said: \u201cWe\u2019re a much more democratic party than that.\u201d He added there would be \u201ca range of views\u201d in Labour, \u201clike every political party\u201d, confirming the party would seek to convey a nuanced message on doorsteps. The basic principle for us, not like the Lib Dems who are just saying \u2018we\u2019re just going to revoke, that\u2019s it\u2019, not like the Tories who are saying \u2018we\u2019re going to foist upon you virtually a no deal to damage the economy\u2019, we\u2019re saying \u2013 democracy, let the people decide. On the possible ending of EU freedom of movement laws, McDonnell said the UK needed immigration into the country. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an immigration policy which has as much freedom of movement as possible.\u201d McDonnell turned his fire on to the government at the end of the interview. People aren\u2019t mugs out there. They\u2019ve listened to these Tories, they\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done over this near decade to our public services, they\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve done to their living standards and quite honestly, most of them will never forgive them for what they have done. Upon the reinstatement of 10 Tory rebels who had the whip removed after backing legislation criticised as delaying Brexit, the Today programme has been speaking to former minister Ed Vaizey \u2013 who has returned \u2013 and Dominic Grieve, who has not. Asked what he had to be welcomed back to the fold, Vaizey said: I had an argument with the prime minister about no deal, and I voted against him to try and get no deal off the table but I have voted with the government ever since. Not because I was sucking up to the prime minister to try to get the whip back but because I wasn\u2019t having arguments with him about his deal or the programme motion and timetable for his deal. So I suspect that is why I\u2019ve got the whip back and others haven\u2019t. Dominic has been a heroic figure in parliament. I\u2019m perhaps, you can either take it, weak or vacillating or pragmatic, depending on your glass half-full, glass half-empty perspective. Asked whether the Conservatives would be fighting the election as a narrow, ideological, factional party, he said: \u201cYes.\u201d Grieve, the former attorney general, said he had fundamental disagreements with Boris Johnson over his leadership and Brexit, and that he assumed the Tories would put a candidate up against him in his constituency of Beaconsfield. This deal is extraordinarily dangerous for the future of our country. It carries with it the implication for the breakup of the United Kingdom and I think also that the likely outcome particularly because of the role of the [European Research Group] in the party that we are going to end up at the end of transition, which is only a few months away now, in fact at risk of crashing out. The very thing Ed doesn\u2019t want. If the prime minister wins a working majority .. in six months we will be in very difficult and dangerous waters for our country. I will run as an independent. I\u2019ve made that decision. I have no idea what the outcome will be. Logically, I probably ought to lose. It\u2019s a very safe Conservative seat. And if normal loyalties prevail then a Conservative candidate will be elected against me. But I think my constituents are entitled to a choice. The Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, has said her party\u2019s \u201cstop Brexit\u201d message is resonating with remainers as she positioned herself as a future prime minister. She told the Today programme: People recognise our consistency and standing up for what we believe in. I don\u2019t think that the choice that we are being offered between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn is anywhere near good enough. Neither of those men are fit to lead our country and be prime minister. And I know there are millions of people out there who are longing for a positive alternative that is looking to the future. She said polling shows they are \u201cwithin a small swing\u201d of winning \u201chundreds of seats\u201d, citing the massive increase in seats for the SNP in 2015 as evidence of sudden swings. Asked if she was ruling out supporting either Johnson or Corbyn as prime minister, Swinson said: I can\u2019t be clearer. Neither Boris Johnson nor Corbyn is fit to be prime minister. Our country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister. Asked if she would be prepared to enter into some kind of informal deal with the Tories or Labour without those two men at the helm, she said they are parties that want to \u201cforce through Brexit on our country\u201d. She added: It\u2019s going to be bad for our country. And they both have that shared vision for the future. The Liberal Democrats have a different positive alternative vision for the future. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national co-ordinator, says it would be \u201cmadness to stick with things as they are\u201d and she claims that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Labour MPs, voters and \u201cmost of the public\u201d understand there is now an opportunity for fundamental change. \u201cPeople can no longer tolerate the incompetence and callousness, and I would say dishonesty, of this government,\u201d she told the Today programme. Asked if she will be giving advice on voting tactically, Parker said: We will be advising all of our members to get out there and campaign for Labour, wherever they are in the country. It\u2019s only a Labour government that will both end this Tory Brexit madness and end austerity and help us rebuild Britain. Ben Bradshaw, MP and senior Labour backbencher, said his party will do better in the election than some may think, and said Labour will be \u201ctotally united\u201d as candidates and MPs. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I actually think Labour will do much much better than the pundits and a lot of commentators are predicting. The reason that we thought the referendum was the best way is a democratic reason. In a binary issue like Brexit, the only way of resolving that with democratic legitimacy is to hold another referendum and Labour is the only party offering that now in the general election. That\u2019s why you have to vote Labour if you want to stop Brexit. Conservatives\u2019 manifesto being written by fracking lobbyist The Conservatives\u2019 election manifesto is being written by a lobbyist for the fracking company Cuadrilla and major internet companies such as Amazon and Facebook, raising concerns about whether her paying clients could influence the party\u2019s policies. Rachel Wolf is drawing up the Conservatives\u2019 platform for the general election while continuing to work as a partner at Public First, a business that lobbies ministers on behalf of the shale gas industry. Cuadrilla is facing a battle to keep its fracking projects on track in the UK at a time when public opinion is moving against the extraction of shale gas, with the Labour party threatening to ban the practice altogether. Her company also represents the Internet Association, the trade body for major tech companies including Uber, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Microsoft and Amazon. The organisation is attempting to influence the government\u2019s policies on online harms, the regulation of social media and taxes on digital companies \u2013 all of which are likely to feature in some form in the Conservative manifesto. There is no suggestion Wolf is breaking any rules by writing the Conservative manifesto while running a lobbying company representing major businesses, given her company makes regular declarations of its clients to the public lobbying registrar in line with current legal requirements. However, Francis Ingham, of the Public Relations and Communications Association, which represents many leading PR and lobbying agencies, but not Public First, said: \u201cCommunications professionals have a duty to avoid conflicts of interests. There is never an excuse. The PRCA code \u2013 to which all members are bound \u2013 is explicit in this regard.\u201d Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet minister with responsibility for the lobbying industry, said it was an \u201coutrage to democracy that the frackers, the tax avoiders and the zero-hour exploiters will have the biggest say when it comes to Tory policy\u201d. He pledged that a Labour government would strengthen lobbying regulations if it won the next general election. Full story is here: So, how are the parties selling themselves in these early days of the campaign that hasn\u2019t officially launched yet? Well, the announcement of the general election barely been made before the online campaigns kicked off with videos on social media. The indisputable winner of the first round is Labour, which not only has the best backing track (Invincible by US rapper Jonezen), but has also racked up the most views \u2013 1.2m at the time of writing \u2013 by a very large margin. Though points to the Lib Dems who didn\u2019t launch with a campaign video, but did launch a Bring It On campaign meme. Very late last night Owen Smith, Labour MP for Pontypridd, and the man who made a bid to topple Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2016, announced he would not be standing in the election. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news and won\u2019t there be a lot of it over the next six weeks? So, we\u2019re going to have an election, which means the politicians and party machines will be in overdrive trying to convince you of who to vote for. We\u2019ll bring you the news, the speeches, the campaign events, the pitches, the pictures and the gaffes from the campaign trail over the next six weeks. As for today, the Lords are expected to debate the early parliamentary general election bill at 3:30pm, giving the rubber stamp of approval to the 12 December election. Boris Johnson will face prime minister\u2019s questions at midday before a general debate on the Grenfell Tower inquiry. If the Lords pass Johnson\u2019s legislation, as is expected, parliament will sit for one more week before dissolving next Wednesday for a campaign of five weeks. Speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, Johnson argued that a \u201cnew and revitalised\u201d parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. \u201cWe are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,\u201d he told MPs. But he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be \u201ca tough election but we will do the best we can\u201d. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have \u201csliced and diced\u201d his Brexit legislation beyond recognition. In a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan. As always, you can get in touch with me on Twitter and via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com), I\u2019ll be at the helm for the next hour or so before handing over to my colleagues who will steer you through for the rest of the day.",

Corbyn then said Johnson\u2019s trade deal with Donald Trump would put more NHS money into private pockets, referencing the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation that showed the health service had been repeatedly discussed with US officials. Johnson denied the NHS was on the table and praised the way a cystic fibrosis drug had been made available. Corbyn said the US wanted full market access to the NHS and added that while ministers were meeting US corporations, waiting times for patients needing urgent treatment were three times longer than nine years ago. But Johnson said waiting times were improving. He added that the cystic fibrosis drug was made by a US company and asked Corbyn if the NHS should not talk to companies like that. Corbyn replied that medicines should be imported but it should be done openly, not in secret. He said patients were waiting longer for cancer treatment. Johnson retorted that Corbyn should be paying tribute to the hard work of NHS staff, not talking them down.

The party now advocates negotiating a softer deal within three months of coming to power \u2013 and then putting it to the public in a referendum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/nick-brown-joins-senior-labour-figures-vowing-back-remain\">Many Labour members and MPs</a>, not least the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, would like their party to go further, and embrace an all-out remain position. But Murray insisted that that would be a mistake.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the Labour party membership is remain, with varying degrees of intensity. About two-thirds of the 2017 Labour vote was remain. But that vote, as I keep reminding people, isn\u2019t big enough. The Labour vote as it stands needs to be larger \u2013 you have got to think about people who aren\u2019t voting Labour that voted leave.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cTo go from speculation to fact, we actually lost six seats at the last general election. Only six, but had we held them, Theresa May\u2019s deal with the DUP may not have stacked up. And they were all the leave-voting areas.\u201d</p> <p>Those six lost seats included Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South, while in many remain seats, such as Norwich South and Bristol West, Labour MPs saw their majorities increase significantly in 2017.</p> <p>Murray voted leave himself, he admits \u2013 and was disappointed that progressive voices were absent from the Brexit campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI personally voted leave, but the leave campaign unfortunately gives no warrant for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/06/labour-left-lexit-dead-members-leftwing-brexit\">Lexit</a> position, because it was dominated by this alliance of xenophobic nationalists and Thatcherite utopians. And they set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>Together with his old friend the senior Corbyn aide Seumas Milne, the recently sidelined chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, Murray is part of a group branded the \u201cfour Ms\u201d, regarded by remain campaigners as a block on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a referendum.</p> <p>Asked if he thinks of himself as part of a shadowy cabal manipulating the Labour leader, Murray said: \u201cI think \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m not maligning him \u2013 that was an invention of Alastair Campbell, because he\u2019s still got the old magic.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t take that seriously. For one thing, none of the four Ms are elected politicians, and in the end it\u2019s elected politicians who are going to decide these things. And Jeremy has advisers who don\u2019t begin with M who have as much influence as those that do.\u201d</p> <p>But he is unrepentant about the influence of his union. \u201cUnite has influence, and it should have influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate, and it has been rock solid in supporting JC from the very beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Murray has just published a book, The Fall and Rise of the British Left, placing Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour in a historic context.</p> <p>His influence alarms many centrist Labour MPs. Murray \u2013 a longtime member of the Communist party, who has in the past expressed <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031210230502/http:/www.communist-party.org.uk/articles/2003/march/10-03-03.shtml\">solidarity with North Korea</a> and praised aspects of Stalin\u2019s legacy \u2013 only joined Labour in 2016.</p> <p>Some also balk at the juxtaposition between his comfortable background (his grandfather was the governor of Madras, and he attended a minor public school) and the class struggle he espouses.</p> <p>But he insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour in a general election \u2013 never voted anything else. My joining Labour was largely motivated by the wishes of my union: that as its chief of staff I be in a place to help advance its political strategy, which requires being a member of the Labour party. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election removed any remaining doubts.\u201d</p> <p>He has some reservations, however, about some of the radical policies bubbling up from Labour\u2019s grassroots. Plans passed at the party\u2019s conference last month included \u201cintegrating\u201d public schools into the state system (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-labour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges\">under the slogan #AbolishEton</a>), and implementing eye-wateringly ambitious <a href=\"https://www.labourgnd.uk/agreed-conference-motion\">carbon reduction targets</a>.</p> <p>Murray sees little need for policy to \u201crush far ahead\u201d of the 2017 manifesto.</p> <p>Even once passed by the party\u2019s conference, policy motions are only included in the manifesto if agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes members of the national executive committee, the shadow cabinet and representatives of the trade unions.</p> <p>\u201cI think the 2017 manifesto \u2013 which I had no direct part in writing \u2013 was extremely well-judged and successful. And I\u2019d imagine when the clause V meeting convenes, that politicians and others there would want to look at good reasons why you would be doing something very different,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At Labour\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which Murray missed, because he was recovering from heart surgery \u2013 the chat in the bars and cafes was about who could replace Corbyn if, as even some of his staunchest supporters fear, Labour loses another general election.</p> <p>But he is convinced that such an outcome would not mean a return to the politics of New Labour. \u201cCorbynism\u2019s critics haven\u2019t really articulated an attractive alternative. And I think politics as usual \u2013 or politics as was usual from the mid-1980s until 2008, or maybe a bit later, because politics takes a while to catch up with economics \u2013 is not coming back anywhere in the world that I can see. And the main question is whether it\u2019s going to be a nasty authoritarian right wing that benefits, or radical progressive movements like the Labour party has become.\u201d</p>",

Murray voted leave himself, he admits \u2013 and was disappointed that progressive voices were absent from the Brexit campaign. \u201cI personally voted leave, but the leave campaign unfortunately gives no warrant for a Lexit position, because it was dominated by this alliance of xenophobic nationalists and Thatcherite utopians. And they set the tone.\u201d Together with his old friend the senior Corbyn aide Seumas Milne, the recently sidelined chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, Murray is part of a group branded the \u201cfour Ms\u201d, regarded by remain campaigners as a block on Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a referendum. Asked if he thinks of himself as part of a shadowy cabal manipulating the Labour leader, Murray said: \u201cI think \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m not maligning him \u2013 that was an invention of Alastair Campbell, because he\u2019s still got the old magic.\u201d He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t take that seriously. For one thing, none of the four Ms are elected politicians, and in the end it\u2019s elected politicians who are going to decide these things. And Jeremy has advisers who don\u2019t begin with M who have as much influence as those that do.\u201d But he is unrepentant about the influence of his union. \u201cUnite has influence, and it should have influence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Labour\u2019s biggest affiliate, and it has been rock solid in supporting JC from the very beginning.\u201d Murray has just published a book, The Fall and Rise of the British Left, placing Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour in a historic context. His influence alarms many centrist Labour MPs. Murray \u2013 a longtime member of the Communist party, who has in the past expressed solidarity with North Korea and praised aspects of Stalin\u2019s legacy \u2013 only joined Labour in 2016. Some also balk at the juxtaposition between his comfortable background (his grandfather was the governor of Madras, and he attended a minor public school) and the class struggle he espouses. But he insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve always voted Labour in a general election \u2013 never voted anything else. My joining Labour was largely motivated by the wishes of my union: that as its chief of staff I be in a place to help advance its political strategy, which requires being a member of the Labour party. And Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election removed any remaining doubts.\u201d He has some reservations, however, about some of the radical policies bubbling up from Labour\u2019s grassroots. Plans passed at the party\u2019s conference last month included \u201cintegrating\u201d public schools into the state system (under the slogan #AbolishEton), and implementing eye-wateringly ambitious carbon reduction targets. Murray sees little need for policy to \u201crush far ahead\u201d of the 2017 manifesto. Even once passed by the party\u2019s conference, policy motions are only included in the manifesto if agreed at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes members of the national executive committee, the shadow cabinet and representatives of the trade unions. \u201cI think the 2017 manifesto \u2013 which I had no direct part in writing \u2013 was extremely well-judged and successful. And I\u2019d imagine when the clause V meeting convenes, that politicians and others there would want to look at good reasons why you would be doing something very different,\u201d he said. At Labour\u2019s annual conference \u2013 which Murray missed, because he was recovering from heart surgery \u2013 the chat in the bars and cafes was about who could replace Corbyn if, as even some of his staunchest supporters fear, Labour loses another general election. But he is convinced that such an outcome would not mean a return to the politics of New Labour. \u201cCorbynism\u2019s critics haven\u2019t really articulated an attractive alternative. And I think politics as usual \u2013 or politics as was usual from the mid-1980s until 2008, or maybe a bit later, because politics takes a while to catch up with economics \u2013 is not coming back anywhere in the world that I can see. And the main question is whether it\u2019s going to be a nasty authoritarian right wing that benefits, or radical progressive movements like the Labour party has become.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green party are set to unveil a general election pact in which the parties would stand aside in certain seats to boost each others\u2019 chances. An announcement expected next week on the pact, which is a successor to the so-called progressive alliance discussed before the 2017 general election that achieved little mainly due to local parties\u2019 inability to agree who should stand down where. The 2019 incarnation does not include Labour and thus would have a necessarily limited scope, as Plaid Cymru has just four MPs and the Greens one. However, this variant has already had success, with Plaid and the Greens not standing candidates in August\u2019s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, allowing the Liberal Democrats a clearer run, helping them take the seat from the Conservatives. The three-party process is taking place under the umbrella of a grouping called Unite to Remain, whose directors include Jim Knight, a former Labour MP who is now a peer, and Jessica Simor, a prominent remain-supporting QC. When the campaign was formally launched earlier in the month, the Lib Dems\u2019 Heidi Allen, who announced on Tuesday she was standing down as an MP, said it hoped to cover 70 constituencies. This would involve the three parties standing down for each other and, in some places, not standing against strongly remain Labour candidates. Sources said a formal announcement was expected in the coming days, probably next week. One party source said there had been a meeting several weeks ago, but none more recently. \u201cI imagine a general election will concentrate people\u2019s minds and the process will now move fairly quickly,\u201d they said. One complication is that decisions have to be agreed by local activists. The three parties involved are notably decentralised, with constituency parties having considerable autonomy. The source said: \u201cThe hope is that with such an uncertain election, and the tight timetable, we can get people to agree more willingly.\u201d The 2017 plan ran into problems, mainly because of a perceived unwillingness of parties to give ground, especially Labour. The Greens subsequently expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again. But a Green spokeswoman said the party was committed to the process now: \u201cIt is right that political parties engage in grown-up discussions about how to best stop a deeply damaging Brexit. Our party is in talks about the potential to stand a single remain-supporting candidate in some seats in England and Wales, as was successfully done in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. No decisions have yet been made and any agreement will involve the relevant local parties.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Conservatives</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>The Conservatives have been obviously preparing for a general election since the summer. The signs were all there, even while Boris Johnson was insisting he did not want to go to the polls, with the appointment of Isaac Levido, a protege of Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, as campaigns director. Two women from a thinktank background, Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf, have been writing the party\u2019s manifesto for months. MPs have been hitting the phones canvassing, and special advisers are expecting to be assigned roles in Conservative party headquarters and on the campaign. \u201cWe are much more advanced than when Theresa May called her election in 2017,\u201d says one adviser.</p> <p>The party has had a bounce in membership since Johnson became prime minister but its ground campaign is traditionally less impressive than Labour\u2019s network of activists. However, it has a big war chest of donations built up, after raising more than \u00a35m in the second quarter of the year, and money is expected to be ploughed into social media and mailshots.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>Johnson\u2019s big slogan will be a promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by passing his deal through parliament, banking on weariness in the country about a further referendum. He will therefore ramp up his claims that parliament frustrated his efforts to implement Brexit before his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of 31 October, which he may be punished for failing to meet. Casting it as a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Johnson portraying himself on the side of the electorate, the Tories want to frame their leader as an anti-establishment candidate despite his privileged background and a lifetime spent in politics and the media.</p> <p>The prime minister will also want some focus on domestic policies, after May\u2019s 2017 campaign was criticised for promoting her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership at the expense of any eye-catching offers for voters. He will concentrate on law and order, believing this is a strong suit because the Tories are pledging more police officers. However, this backfired in 2017, when the opposition highlighted cuts to the police at a time when the country was reeling from terror attacks. Johnson has also been visiting hospitals and intends to promote his Vote Leave pledge to give another \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, although this is a risky ploy going head to head with Labour on their traditional turf. The campaign will also emphasise pledges on schools funding \u2013 despite this being another difficult area for the party in 2017 with voters unhappy about education cuts and years of austerity affecting the system.</p> <p><strong>Campaign<br></strong>The campaign is set to be directed from CCHQ by Levido, who helped deliver Scott Morrison\u2019s shock victory in Australia for the Liberals. However, the extent of Crosby\u2019s role is unclear. Crosby is an old friend and associate of the prime minister, having run his mayoral campaigns and Tory elections in both 2015 and 2017. However, the pair fell out over Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, during Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign and one Tory adviser said Crosby was expected to be more \u201chands-off\u201d this time.</p> <p>The campaign is likely to take inspiration from the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, with a big emphasis on social media. The party has already been trialling new methods of catching people\u2019s attention with badly-designed memes that get people talking and therefore amplify its message. Two New Zealanders in their 20s, Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, who used to work as contractors for Crosby, have been employed to improve the party\u2019s online operations, after a disastrous 2017 election when the Tories were outgunned by Labour in internet campaigning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c357a0e6e6d425a149e41184eafea62bc55c4b5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c357a0e6e6d425a149e41184eafea62bc55c4b5a/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Labour</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>Labour raised just over \u00a32m in donations in the second quarter of this year\u2013 but in 2017, the party\u2019s coffers were significantly boosted during the campaign by large one-off donations from the trades union Unite and a flood of smaller donations from grassroots members.</p> <p>The party has been pressing ahead with the re-selection of sitting MPs and selections in seats it hopes to win. The results have been a mixed bag but candidates backed by the leftwing Momentum have fared well, winning selections in Barry, Bury South and Poplar and Limehouse.</p> <p>In seats where no one has yet been selected, Labour rules give the national executive committee (NEC) wide discretion to impose candidates once a campaign is under way.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>Labour\u2019s Brexit position, hard-fought at its annual conference in Brighton last month, is that it will seek to negotiate a close future relationship with the EU27 and then put that deal to the public in a referendum.</p> <p>That would allow Corbyn\u2019s party to say to remainers that a Labour government will give them a referendum, while holding out the possibility of a Labour Brexit to leave voters.</p> <p>But the party will hope to shift the focus to transformative domestic policies, including its plans for a green new deal, and a significant increase in spending on public services.</p> <p>There will be a fierce internal debate about how much more radical the manifesto should be than in 2017. Grassroots members passed several radical policy motions in Brighton, including rejecting any caps or controls on migration, and incorporating private schools into the state system.</p> <p>Final decisions will be made at a so-called clause V meeting, which will include members of the party\u2019s governing national executive committee, as well as representatives of the unions and the Scottish and Welsh parties.</p> <p><strong>Campaign<br></strong>Labour honed its campaigning machine in 2017, combining large-scale public events to create buzzy footage for the TV news, with spiky social media material, much of it shared organically.</p> <p>The campaign will be jointly chaired by Andrew Gwynne, who played the same role in 2017, and close Corbyn ally Ian Lavery. The manifesto is expected to be drafted by Labour\u2019s policy chief Andrew Fisher, who has promised to stay on for a general election, despite tendering his resignation last month.</p> <p>At the party\u2019s Southside HQ in Victoria, where many Labour advisers will decamp for the campaign, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, is expected to play a central role, as will his strategic adviser, Seumas Milne.</p> <p>Murphy locked horns with Labour staffers in 2017 about how offensive Labour\u2019s campaign should be. Conversations have already been taking place in recent weeks about whether to circle the wagons around MPs whose seats are under threat or push resources into those constituencies Labour would need to gain to win a majority.</p> <p>The election will represent the first run-out for a new army of local \u201ccommunity organisers\u201d. John McDonnell has repeatedly highlighted them as a key part of the \u201csocial movement\u201d Labour wants to build, but some party veterans complain they are not sufficiently focused on campaigning or plugged into local party networks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4347105bbb2fd226bd41d7d0dff250c21aef4bd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4347105bbb2fd226bd41d7d0dff250c21aef4bd6/0_133_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The SNP appear to be in a strong position, with polling in their favour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SNP appear to be in a strong position, with polling in their favour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Scottish National party</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>Perhaps the most keen of all the political parties to hold a winter general election due to the forthcoming trial of former first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, which is due to take place next month.</p> <p>There is a feeling an earlier election would be beneficial because the political fall-out from the case is unknown and the ramifications so difficult to factor into an election strategy.</p> <p>Right now, the SNP appears to be in a strong position, with polling in its favour and the potential to take all 13 Tory seats in the north-east and the borders.</p> <p>Polling is also strong for another Scottish independence referendum \u2013 most recently at 50% \u2013 which once again will be their core election offer.</p> <p>Party finances are said to be in a decent position with membership fees paid by 120,000 people. SNP MPs also crowdfund for the party. In the second quarter of this year, they received \u00a3500,000, although the majority came from public money and not private donors. By comparison, in the same time period the Brexit party received \u00a31m from private individuals.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>The SNP thinks this is the perfect time to push for a second independence referendum. If it is asked to support a Labour minority government in some kind of post-election deal, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has already made clear another poll on independence is her primary demand.</p> <p>The party will push the case that Scotland is better off as an independent nation and that the country deeply opposes Brexit. Opposition to austerity, welfare reforms and tackling the Tories\u2019 \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration strategy are other topics expected to feature in the SNP election manifesto. It is also likely to continue their campaign for votes for 16-year-olds.</p> <p><strong>How they will campaign<br></strong>The SNP will go after the 13 Tory seats with gusto with an overall hope of getting their MP count from 35 and into the 50s in the Commons in a best-case scenario. A jewel in the crown would be swiping the seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson who holds East Dunbartonshire with a majority of 5,000. However, it faces a strong challenge from the Lib Dems in the most marginal seat in the country, North East Fife, which Stephen Gethins holds by a majority of just two. Swinson\u2019s party will also want to take the seat of the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber. It gets dark very early in December in the north of Scotland and bad weather is to be expected but since the SNP is pushing for a poll, it can be assumed they are not too concerned about campaigning in the elements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e7589c43e632b64a4ed2139e77d6e9a39c0ab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e7589c43e632b64a4ed2139e77d6e9a39c0ab9/0_242_7421_4453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Under Jo Swinson\u2019s leadership, the Lib Dems are raring to go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under Jo Swinson\u2019s leadership, the Lib Dems are raring to go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Liberal Democrats</h2> <p><strong>Preparedness<br></strong>As evidence by the fact it was a Lib Dem-instigated plan which unblocked the election process, the party is raring to go and hopes to make significant gains now it has accepted a second referendum seems impossible in this parliament.</p> <p>The Lib Dems are notably less well-resourced than the big two, with donations of \u00a34.2m in the past 12 months, about a third of those seen by Labour, and a quarter of the Conservative haul. But they do have an increasingly well-organised election machine and one energised by good results in May\u2019s local elections, where they gained 700-plus councillors, and the European elections saw them finish second, on nearly 20% of the vote.</p> <p>The party is also enjoying a real sense of momentum, growing in recent months from the 12-MP haul in the 2017 election to 19 now, a tally swelled by one byelection win and a series of defections from other parties. The final piece of the jigsaw is a new leader, with Jo Swinson taking over from Vince Cable in July, a choice largely welcomed by the party\u2019s MPs and members.</p> <p>The Lib Dem autumn conference in Bournemouth saw near-constant chatter about the number of seats the party could win in an imminent election, with predictions tending to start at about 40 and rise in accordance with ambition, excitement and the number of glasses of wine consumed.</p> <p>Many target seats will be in the southwest of England or in remain-minded urban seats such as several in leafy southwest London, or places such as Sheffield and Cambridge. The somewhat limited Lib Dem war chest will be offset by the fact the party\u2019s number of target seats, or those being defended, is smaller than for the Tories or Labour.</p> <p><strong>Policies<br></strong>Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit. There was a reason why Swinson insisted her party could only back an election if the government first shelved its withdrawal bill. The Lib Dems are the anti-leave party-in-chief, banking on outraged remain sentiment, plus a sense among voters that Labour is sitting on the fence, to propel them to significant gains.

      "bodyText": "Conservatives Preparedness The Conservatives have been obviously preparing for a general election since the summer. The signs were all there, even while Boris Johnson was insisting he did not want to go to the polls, with the appointment of Isaac Levido, a protege of Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, as campaigns director. Two women from a thinktank background, Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf, have been writing the party\u2019s manifesto for months. MPs have been hitting the phones canvassing, and special advisers are expecting to be assigned roles in Conservative party headquarters and on the campaign. \u201cWe are much more advanced than when Theresa May called her election in 2017,\u201d says one adviser. The party has had a bounce in membership since Johnson became prime minister but its ground campaign is traditionally less impressive than Labour\u2019s network of activists. However, it has a big war chest of donations built up, after raising more than \u00a35m in the second quarter of the year, and money is expected to be ploughed into social media and mailshots. Policies Johnson\u2019s big slogan will be a promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by passing his deal through parliament, banking on weariness in the country about a further referendum. He will therefore ramp up his claims that parliament frustrated his efforts to implement Brexit before his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline of 31 October, which he may be punished for failing to meet. Casting it as a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Johnson portraying himself on the side of the electorate, the Tories want to frame their leader as an anti-establishment candidate despite his privileged background and a lifetime spent in politics and the media. The prime minister will also want some focus on domestic policies, after May\u2019s 2017 campaign was criticised for promoting her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership at the expense of any eye-catching offers for voters. He will concentrate on law and order, believing this is a strong suit because the Tories are pledging more police officers. However, this backfired in 2017, when the opposition highlighted cuts to the police at a time when the country was reeling from terror attacks. Johnson has also been visiting hospitals and intends to promote his Vote Leave pledge to give another \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, although this is a risky ploy going head to head with Labour on their traditional turf. The campaign will also emphasise pledges on schools funding \u2013 despite this being another difficult area for the party in 2017 with voters unhappy about education cuts and years of austerity affecting the system. Campaign The campaign is set to be directed from CCHQ by Levido, who helped deliver Scott Morrison\u2019s shock victory in Australia for the Liberals. However, the extent of Crosby\u2019s role is unclear. Crosby is an old friend and associate of the prime minister, having run his mayoral campaigns and Tory elections in both 2015 and 2017. However, the pair fell out over Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, during Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign and one Tory adviser said Crosby was expected to be more \u201chands-off\u201d this time. The campaign is likely to take inspiration from the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, with a big emphasis on social media. The party has already been trialling new methods of catching people\u2019s attention with badly-designed memes that get people talking and therefore amplify its message. Two New Zealanders in their 20s, Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, who used to work as contractors for Crosby, have been employed to improve the party\u2019s online operations, after a disastrous 2017 election when the Tories were outgunned by Labour in internet campaigning. Labour Preparedness Labour raised just over \u00a32m in donations in the second quarter of this year\u2013 but in 2017, the party\u2019s coffers were significantly boosted during the campaign by large one-off donations from the trades union Unite and a flood of smaller donations from grassroots members. The party has been pressing ahead with the re-selection of sitting MPs and selections in seats it hopes to win. The results have been a mixed bag but candidates backed by the leftwing Momentum have fared well, winning selections in Barry, Bury South and Poplar and Limehouse. In seats where no one has yet been selected, Labour rules give the national executive committee (NEC) wide discretion to impose candidates once a campaign is under way. Policies Labour\u2019s Brexit position, hard-fought at its annual conference in Brighton last month, is that it will seek to negotiate a close future relationship with the EU27 and then put that deal to the public in a referendum. That would allow Corbyn\u2019s party to say to remainers that a Labour government will give them a referendum, while holding out the possibility of a Labour Brexit to leave voters. But the party will hope to shift the focus to transformative domestic policies, including its plans for a green new deal, and a significant increase in spending on public services. There will be a fierce internal debate about how much more radical the manifesto should be than in 2017. Grassroots members passed several radical policy motions in Brighton, including rejecting any caps or controls on migration, and incorporating private schools into the state system. Final decisions will be made at a so-called clause V meeting, which will include members of the party\u2019s governing national executive committee, as well as representatives of the unions and the Scottish and Welsh parties. Campaign Labour honed its campaigning machine in 2017, combining large-scale public events to create buzzy footage for the TV news, with spiky social media material, much of it shared organically. The campaign will be jointly chaired by Andrew Gwynne, who played the same role in 2017, and close Corbyn ally Ian Lavery. The manifesto is expected to be drafted by Labour\u2019s policy chief Andrew Fisher, who has promised to stay on for a general election, despite tendering his resignation last month. At the party\u2019s Southside HQ in Victoria, where many Labour advisers will decamp for the campaign, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, is expected to play a central role, as will his strategic adviser, Seumas Milne. Murphy locked horns with Labour staffers in 2017 about how offensive Labour\u2019s campaign should be. Conversations have already been taking place in recent weeks about whether to circle the wagons around MPs whose seats are under threat or push resources into those constituencies Labour would need to gain to win a majority. The election will represent the first run-out for a new army of local \u201ccommunity organisers\u201d. John McDonnell has repeatedly highlighted them as a key part of the \u201csocial movement\u201d Labour wants to build, but some party veterans complain they are not sufficiently focused on campaigning or plugged into local party networks. Scottish National party Preparedness Perhaps the most keen of all the political parties to hold a winter general election due to the forthcoming trial of former first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, which is due to take place next month. There is a feeling an earlier election would be beneficial because the political fall-out from the case is unknown and the ramifications so difficult to factor into an election strategy. Right now, the SNP appears to be in a strong position, with polling in its favour and the potential to take all 13 Tory seats in the north-east and the borders. Polling is also strong for another Scottish independence referendum \u2013 most recently at 50% \u2013 which once again will be their core election offer. Party finances are said to be in a decent position with membership fees paid by 120,000 people. SNP MPs also crowdfund for the party. In the second quarter of this year, they received \u00a3500,000, although the majority came from public money and not private donors. By comparison, in the same time period the Brexit party received \u00a31m from private individuals. Policies The SNP thinks this is the perfect time to push for a second independence referendum. If it is asked to support a Labour minority government in some kind of post-election deal, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has already made clear another poll on independence is her primary demand. The party will push the case that Scotland is better off as an independent nation and that the country deeply opposes Brexit. Opposition to austerity, welfare reforms and tackling the Tories\u2019 \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration strategy are other topics expected to feature in the SNP election manifesto. It is also likely to continue their campaign for votes for 16-year-olds. How they will campaign The SNP will go after the 13 Tory seats with gusto with an overall hope of getting their MP count from 35 and into the 50s in the Commons in a best-case scenario. A jewel in the crown would be swiping the seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson who holds East Dunbartonshire with a majority of 5,000. However, it faces a strong challenge from the Lib Dems in the most marginal seat in the country, North East Fife, which Stephen Gethins holds by a majority of just two. Swinson\u2019s party will also want to take the seat of the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber. It gets dark very early in December in the north of Scotland and bad weather is to be expected but since the SNP is pushing for a poll, it can be assumed they are not too concerned about campaigning in the elements. Liberal Democrats Preparedness As evidence by the fact it was a Lib Dem-instigated plan which unblocked the election process, the party is raring to go and hopes to make significant gains now it has accepted a second referendum seems impossible in this parliament. The Lib Dems are notably less well-resourced than the big two, with donations of \u00a34.2m in the past 12 months, about a third of those seen by Labour, and a quarter of the Conservative haul. But they do have an increasingly well-organised election machine and one energised by good results in May\u2019s local elections, where they gained 700-plus councillors, and the European elections saw them finish second, on nearly 20% of the vote. The party is also enjoying a real sense of momentum, growing in recent months from the 12-MP haul in the 2017 election to 19 now, a tally swelled by one byelection win and a series of defections from other parties. The final piece of the jigsaw is a new leader, with Jo Swinson taking over from Vince Cable in July, a choice largely welcomed by the party\u2019s MPs and members. The Lib Dem autumn conference in Bournemouth saw near-constant chatter about the number of seats the party could win in an imminent election, with predictions tending to start at about 40 and rise in accordance with ambition, excitement and the number of glasses of wine consumed. Many target seats will be in the southwest of England or in remain-minded urban seats such as several in leafy southwest London, or places such as Sheffield and Cambridge. The somewhat limited Lib Dem war chest will be offset by the fact the party\u2019s number of target seats, or those being defended, is smaller than for the Tories or Labour. Policies Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit. There was a reason why Swinson insisted her party could only back an election if the government first shelved its withdrawal bill. The Lib Dems are the anti-leave party-in-chief, banking on outraged remain sentiment, plus a sense among voters that Labour is sitting on the fence, to propel them to significant gains. A key moment at the party\u2019s conference was the decision to commit to revoking Brexit in the admittedly unlikely event they win a majority in the Commons. Other than that, the party will campaign on areas such as supporting the NHS, investment in public transport and an increased focus on the climate emergency. Campaign The Lib Dems are a traditionally localised party \u2013 to the regular annoyance of leaders past and present \u2013 but are also an increasingly slick campaigning machine. Expect daily TV shots of Swinson decamping from a shiny battlebus to deliver policy soundbites in a string of target seats. A novelty for the party will be the focus on the fight for new arrivals to take new seats, into which a fair amount of resources could be diverted \u2013 something which will not delight all party members. Key focuses will be Chuka Umunna, once of Labour, trying to take Cities of London and Westminster and ex-Tory Sam Gyimah in Kensington. Brexit party Preparedness The Brexit party led by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is untested at a general election but they are hoping to make significant inroads in Labour\u2019s heartlands in northern England, Midlands and along the Kent coast \u2013 the areas they believe are out of bounds for Conservatives. On the number of seats they might gain they estimate it could be \u201csomewhere in the teens\u201d to 50, however they continue their offer of a pact with the Conservatives in order to return as many leave-supporting MPs to Westminster as possible. In return the Brexit party will want a seat at the top table if they were needed to prop up a Tory majority government with a greater say over future negotiations. This offer has so far been rejected outright by No 10, despite Farage claiming that if they \u201cworked together they would be an unstoppable electoral force\u201d. Their finances are understood to be in a healthy state with money flowing in from former Tory donors and those who choose to give funds to both parties. They also take a significant amount from registered supporters who pay a \u00a325 one-off fee to join. Policies A central objective is delivering a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d, which is their term for a no-deal Brexit and emphasises the need for full freedom to trade around the world as well as a genuine extraction of the UK from EU institutions. Their doorstep pitch is also about wider political reform, including abolishing the House of Lords, proportional representation, reviewing the way the BBC works, abolishing inheritance tax and redirecting foreign aid. Expect to hear their other financial pledge trotted out in media interviews, which is that they would cancel HS2 and that saving, combined with no future payments for EU membership, would give \u00a3200bn back to the Treasury over the next few years. How they will campaign Money will be spent on a huge social media drive, creating viral videos and taking inspiration from American campaigning techniques including large, professionally produced rallies. Their ability to get through to voters with precision social media targeting is a source of pride for the party. However they admit they will need to combat the Conservative slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d, which they admit is extremely powerful and will appeal to their potential voters. They are already selling winter campaigning merchandise on their website, including a handy ice scraper. Ambitiously, for a first general election, they will campaign right across the country and have vetted 600 candidates so far. Green party Preparedness The Greens are by no means a rich party. In the past 12 months, total donations have been below \u00a3200,000 and a fall in their vote share in the 2017 election led to a drop in official funding for parliamentary activity, forcing them to resort to a public crowdfunder to avoid laying off staff. That said, the Greens have an increasingly sophisticated election operation, and one that has expanded as its local councillors have spread. At May\u2019s local elections, the party won 200 councillors, something the leadership put down to years of carefully-targeted effort. As a campaign machine, the Greens have the advantage of two eloquent and telegenic co-leaders in Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, an arrangement that is no longer mocked, as happened when Bartley first co-led with Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP. Policies The Greens\u2019 offer is a remain stance as strong as the Lib Dems, policies on the economy and social justice which they would argue are even more radical than Labour, plus an abiding commitment to tackling the climate emergency. The rueful half-joke about Green policies is that other parties spend several years mocking the ideas before quietly lifting them, as with Labour\u2019s interest in a universal basic income and the four-day working week. One paradox is that while the Greens have tried to expand their message beyond environmental issues, these are now high on the news agenda thanks to climate strikers such as Greta Thunberg and the actions of Extinction Rebellion. Campaign Lucas\u2019s seat of Brighton Pavilion is now fairly safe, with the 1,200 majority she had when she took it from Labour now expanded to well over 14,000.

Almost two-thirds of people agreed the climate emergency was the biggest issue facing humankind, with 7% disagreeing. The poll also asked if \u201cfossil fuel companies, whose products contribute directly to climate change, should help pay for the tens of billions in damages from extreme weather events?\u201d Two-thirds of people agreed, with 12% opposed. In terms of action to tackle the climate emergency, 81% of people backed planting more trees, 63% supported a Green New Deal \u2013 a large-scale, long-term investment in green infrastructure and jobs \u2013 and more than half said it was important to ban fracking.
