But that is exactly what May\u2019s transition period would do \u2013 the one she insists on calling an \u201cimplementation period\u201d even though there will be no concluded trade deal to implement, just more turmoil-filled negotiations taking us up to another mythological \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the end of the transition period.</p> \n   <p>The big difference would be that under an article 50 extension, the UK would continue to be represented in EU institutions, and continue to exercise a vote and veto (where unanimity is required) over new EU rules. Further, we would elect a new phalanx of MEPs, large numbers of whom would be Brexit supporters who would be robust in defending Britain\u2019s interests and in disrupting the EU\u2019s centralising plans.</p> \n   <p><strong>No backstop:</strong> The next huge point is that under the article 50 extension the UK would not be bound by the backstop protocol, which under May\u2019s deal would kick in on 1st January 2021. Instead, on 1st January 2021 we would just leave unencumbered. We would be able to negotiate for a trade deal with the EU with a strong hand, and our negotiating position would not be crippled by being prospectively or actually locked into the backstop as it would be under May\u2019s deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the Commons leading Tory Brexiters have welcomed Howe\u2019s article.

This deal saw the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs agree to support the government on all key votes, including the Queen\u2019s Speech and budgets. </p> \n   <p>- The combined total allocated to the South East, South West, East &amp; West Midlands and eastern England (\u00a3417m) is just \u00a33m below the \u00a3420 announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 budget for local authorities to fix potholes and renew bridges and tunnels in one year (2018/19). </p> \n   <p>- Using the latest population estimates from the Office for National Statistics, the pots of money can be roughly compared in terms of spending per person. </p> \n   <p>For example, if the total amount earmarked for north-east England (\u00a3105m) was spread across five of the region\u2019s largest towns - Darlington, Hartlepool, Gateshead, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees - the spending would be the equivalent of \u00a3142 per person. </p> \n   <p>If the total for north-west England (\u00a3281m) was spread across the five towns of Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport and Wigan, the spending works out at around \u00a3208 per person. </p> \n   <p>By contrast, if the \u00a333m earmarked for south-west England was allocated to the five towns of Bournemouth, Cheltenham, Poole, Stroud and Swindon, the equivalent total per person would be \u00a341. </p> \n   <p>And if the \u00a325m for eastern England was spread just across the five towns of Basildon, Bedford, Colchester, Luton and Southend, the spending equates to \u00a327 per head. </p> \n   <p>- The \u00a333m allocated to south-west England matches the \u00a333m the government has paid to Eurotunnel to settle a legal action over the award of Brexit contracts to ferry firms. </p> \n   <p>- The total package of \u00a31.6bn funding compares with a total of \u00a33bn in outstanding council tax owed to local authorities in England since 1993 (when the tax was introduced). The same local authorities collected a total of \u00a327.5bn of council tax for the year to March 2018.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-04T15:05:28.262Z\">at 3.05pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c7d3600e4b0f96cae7d9ea3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-04T14:32:53.725Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking on Salisbury, on a visit to mark the one-year anniversay of the novichok attakc, <strong>Theresa May</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I have seen today here in Salisbury is the tremendous spirit and resolve of the people of Salisbury.

But in a provocative new book, <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/rule-britannia\">Brexit and the End of Empire</a>, the academics <strong>Danny Dorling </strong>and <strong>Sally Tomlinson</strong>, strongly challenge this argument. They report:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because of different levels of turnout and numbers of registered voters, most people who voted leave - by absolute numbers - lived in southern England. Furthermore, of all those who voted leave, 59% were middle class (often labelled as A, B or C1), and only 41% were working class (labelled C2, D or E). The proportion of leave voters who were of the lowest two social classes (D and E) was just 24%. One of us published these statistics not long after the vote, in the British Medical Journal, but that did little to quell the middle-class clamour to \u2018blame the working class\u2019 ...</p> \n   <p>In short, then, Tory England voted Britain out. These were areas that had often loyally voted Conservative for decades, but economically were not doing anything like as well as other Tory areas, which cannot have seemed right to many people living there ...</p> \n   <p>Older, less well-off, less well-educated Tory Britain was where the most votes for Brexit were. It cannot be said often enough. It was not Sunderland or Stoke that swung it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c7cfbaae4b09dbe4be92238\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-04T10:25:09.142Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mujtaba Rahman</strong>, the former European commission official who writes Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy, has sent out his latest assessment. Like the Daily Telegraph (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/04/brexit-latest-news-admits-16bn-for-poorer-towns-to-be-spent-over-next-seven-years-politics-live?page=with:block-5c7cf536e4b0f96cae7d9bc2#block-5c7cf536e4b0f96cae7d9bc2\">10.04am),</a> he thinks Geoffrey Cox is struggling to negotiate the backstop assurances that Brexiters want. Rahman says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Alarmingly for Number 10, talks made slow progress last week, with both sides conceding \u201csubstantive gaps\u201d remain between the two. They continue to work on a package of measures which they hope will allow Cox to say \u201con the balance of probability\u201d the backstop is not indefinite, perhaps focusing more on an independent arbitration mechanism. But EU officials are clear that such a mechanism cannot be used to judge whether \u201calternative arrangements\u201d needed to supplant the backstop are effective, since this is ultimately a matter of EU law, which is the exclusive competence of the ECJ.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister might therefore need to go further; promising to stand down this summer might persuade more Eurosceptics to back her deal, as negotiations on a long-term trade agreement would be headed by her successor.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, in his conclusion, Rahman still argues that it is more likely than not that a deal will pass next week.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We now put the odds of May\u2019s tweaked deal passing the Commons next week at 55% (35% with no referendum; 20% with a referendum). We assign 20% to a softer Brexit; 10% to no-deal; 10% to a general election and 5% to a referendum without a deal). </p> \n   <p>Some ministers privately think May only has a slim chance of winning through this month, but might have a stronger one in June if she can frame the choice as one between her deal and no deal (in a way she cannot now do this month). All the same, Labour MP Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill blocking no deal would be revived. So May\u2019s ability to play the no-deal card MPs might depend on whether EU would grant a second extension.</p> \n   <p>If May fails to win Commons backing this month, a very different deal would likely return in June\u2014such as Common Market 2.0 or Norway Plus agreement based on membership of the Single Market and a customs union. The real prospect of that might just tip enough Eurosceptics into May\u2019s column this month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c7cf536e4b0f96cae7d9bc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-04T10:04:26.542Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/03/03/exclusive-attorney-general-abandons-time-limit-unilateral-exit/\">today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash (paywall)</a> <strong>Steven Swinford </strong>and<strong> Peter Foster</strong> says Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general who is leading government attempts to negotiated legally-binding assurances on the backstop with Brussels, has \u201cabandoned attempts to secure a hard time-limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-backstop-irish-border-important-deal1/\">Irish backstop</a>\u201d.

Downing Street rejected claims that this would amount to a \u201cbribe\u201d, but did not deny that the plan (actually, a variant of the \u201cUK shared prosperity fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations\u201d, promised in the 2017 Conservative party manifesto) was under consideration.</p> \n  <p>Today the announcement has arrived. And, in a statement <strong>Theresa May</strong> has partially linked it to Brexit. She says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For too long in our country prosperity has been unfairly spread. Our economy has worked well for some places but we want it to work for all communities.</p> \n   <p>Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change \u2013 that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control.</p> \n   <p>These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, as <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> points out in our overnight story, Labour MPs were queuing up last night to say that this announcement would not change their minds over Brexit.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/03/16bn-for-left-behind-towns-as-may-woos-labour-mps-to-back-brexit-deal\">\u00a31.6bn 'bribe' for poorer towns as May seeks Labour's backing for Brexit deal</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And this morning <strong>James Brokenshire</strong>, the housing and communities secretary, has been giving interviews about the announcement. What he has said confirms that this investment will probably end up having zero impact on the parliamentary dynamics over Brexit.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brokenshire confirmed that the government was committed to this spending whether or not MPs voted for May\u2019s Brexit deal. </strong>Asked if the money was coming whether or no the deal was passed, he said: \u201cYes.\u201d He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country. </p> \n   <p>But there is no conditionality in that sense. This funding is there to see that towns grow and that we are actually looking at what we need to do, which is seeing those areas really prospering and following through on what the prime minister has really believed in, that sense of leaving no part of our UK behind, and how this will help support that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the \u00a31.6bn was being spent over the next seven years.</strong> Asked over what period the money was being spent, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is through until 2026. So, in other words, you may have investments that will need to be put in place over a number of years. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This timescale does make \u00a31.6bn look a lot less impressive than it does in the headlines. It is not unusual for governments to aggregate the numbers when announcing spending programmes, by giving a total spend not an annual spend. This can be misleading, but normally the truth is buried somewhere in the small print of the announcement. However <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/16-billion-stronger-towns-fund-launched\">the press release sent to journalists yesterday</a> did not say over what period the \u00a31.6bn would be spent. Reporters had to make inquiries to get an answer.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brokenshire rejected claims that the investment did not amount to much. </strong>When this was put to him, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I actually fundamentally disagree.

It can make that difference on creating the jobs, actually putting the skills in place, and changing people\u2019s lives in a modern, positive economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>And he also dismissed claims that the new money would not even begin to compensate for the amount towns in the north have lost through other government cuts, such as reductions in grants to councils.</strong> He was asked about this tweet from the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, <strong>Gareth Snell.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gareth_snell/status/1102336505119473664\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The entire allocation for the West Midlands over four years is LESS than the total value of cuts faced by Stoke-on-Trent City Council alone over the same period.<br><br>This is a huge disappointment. <a href=\"https://t.co/6JZOVQ8nPq\">https://t.co/6JZOVQ8nPq</a></p>\u2014 Gareth Snell MP (@gareth_snell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gareth_snell/status/1102336505119473664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In response, Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think you are making a fundamental miscomparison between fundamental rates of money that councils will spend on their budgets each year, as contrasted with focused funds, transformative funds, to invest in skills, to invest in jobs, to invest in productivity, that actually then supplement the work of councils, and indeed other funds that we have in place. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post more on this as the day goes on.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>12.30pm: </em>Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, speaks at the Institute for Government.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>4pm:</em> Jon Thompson, the HM Revenue and Customs chief executive, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "The Police Federation of England and Wales has described Theresa May as \u201cdelusional\u201d after she insisted there was no direct correlation between police numbers and the incidence of knife crime. (See 4.49pm.) The row erupted as Sajid Javid, the home secretary, told MPs that the government would shortly consult on giving public bodies a new, statutory public health duty to tackle violent crime. (See 4.02pm.) Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassdor to the EU, has said Britain is not ready to face Brussels in the massively complex trade negotiations that will begin if Theresa May gets her Brexit deal through parliament. Speaking at the Institute for Government, he said: [The future trade negotiation] is a much bigger task for London - for Whitehall and Westminster - than the negotiation we have just been through. It\u2019s going to involve every department of state in depth from the top of those departments right down through the system ... You\u2019ve got to have confidence as chief trade negotiator, both at an official and ministerial level, that you have got a highly competent set of people in every area from aviation to energy to phytosanitary to competition to employment. In every area, you\u2019ve got to have vetted that team, know it\u2019s got the capabilities, know it\u2019s got the resources, know it\u2019s got the legal framework and the background and be at least as good as the team on the opposite side of the table. It isn\u2019t the case. We are not in that position. Ministers have pulled a financial services bill from the House of Commons, fearing the government was almost certain to be defeated on an amendment requiring Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man to clamp down on money laundering. The government has come under immediate pressure from its own MPs over a \u00a31.6bn funding boost for deprived English towns, as it emerged the guaranteed spending in some regions would amount to as little as 58p per person per year. Downing Street has hinted that the government is watering down what it is demanding from the EU in terms of new guarantees relating to the backstop. (See 1.15pm.) The head of the German federation of industries has claimed the British are \u201clost\u201d and has thrown doubt on Berlin\u2019s backing for a short Brexit extension, claiming an \u201ceconomy can live better with bad conditions than with uncertainty\u201d. The UK\u2019s construction industry slumped into contraction last month for the first time since freezing weather and snow brought cranes to a halt a year ago, as Brexit uncertainty delayed new building projects. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government needs to show much greater urgency in tackling climate change, a cross-party committee of the Scottish parliament has said. The prime minister met the father of the novichok victim Dawn Sturgess, as part of a visit to Salisbury exactly a year after the nerve agent attack, the Guardian can reveal. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Labour has criticised Matt Hancock, the health secretary, for criticising the idea of treating knife crime as a public health issue this morning. (See 4.18pm.) In a statement the shadow policing minister Louise Haigh said: It is disturbing that the health secretary doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of his own government\u2019s strategy to tackle violent crime. Rather than taking real action to address the national knife crime epidemic that has arisen on its watch, the government\u2019s own strategy has been revealed to be nothing more than warm words. How can the Tory government possibly be serious about taking a public health approach when the health secretary doesn\u2019t even know about it? In response to a point of order earlier, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, strongly criticised the government\u2019s decision to postpone tonight\u2019s votes on the financial services bill. (See 11.55am.) The voters were only announced on Thursday last week, he said. He went on: It\u2019s a very odd state of affairs altogether. One can speculate as to why that may be so but it is a most unusual state of affairs and it is at the very least very discourteous to the House of Commons. It probably reflects a degree of anxiety and, if I may politely say so, perhaps just a little bit of inexperience. This is from the Sunday Times\u2019 political editor, Tim Shipman. As my colleagues Matthew Weaver and Helen Pidd report, Theresa May said today that there was \u201cno direct correlation\u201d between police numbers and knife crime. In response, the Police Federation of England and Wales claimed that May was \u201cdelusional\u201d on this issue. John Apter, its national chairman, said: Our prime minister is delusional, steadfastly refusing to acknowledge what is plain for everyone else to see, and in the face of a national crisis that is deeply concerning. Policing has been stripped to the bone and the consequences are clear, splashed across newspaper front pages and TV news bulletins - children being murdered on our streets. What makes this all the more sickening is that it was predicted. This is the true cost of austerity that we warned of but were ridiculed for doing so. Theresa May herself accused the Police Federation of \u2018crying wolf\u2019 when we highlighted our concerns. Those concerns have become a reality but still the prime minister fails to accept the harsh truth. What we need now is less talk and more action, fewer policies and more police officers - boots on the ground, out there on our streets making a real difference, protecting our youngsters. As the Guardian reported last month, under one idea being considered in Brussels the EU would not offer the UK a short extension, but instead a very long one, lasting 21 months. It was generally assumed at the time that Tory Brexiters would be horrified by this prospect. But, in an article for ConservativeHome, Martin Howe QC, a leading Brexiter lawyer and one of the \u201cstar chamber\u201d panel of lawyers set up by Brexiters to review the deal Geoffrey Cox negotiates with Brussels, says that a long article 50 extension would be \u201cmiles and miles better from a Leave perspective than May\u2019s appalling deal\u201d. Here are some of the arguments Howe advances to make his point. Transition period: A 21-month article 50 extension would lock the UK into having to obey EU laws across the board until 31st December 2020. But that is exactly what May\u2019s transition period would do \u2013 the one she insists on calling an \u201cimplementation period\u201d even though there will be no concluded trade deal to implement, just more turmoil-filled negotiations taking us up to another mythological \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the end of the transition period. The big difference would be that under an article 50 extension, the UK would continue to be represented in EU institutions, and continue to exercise a vote and veto (where unanimity is required) over new EU rules. Further, we would elect a new phalanx of MEPs, large numbers of whom would be Brexit supporters who would be robust in defending Britain\u2019s interests and in disrupting the EU\u2019s centralising plans. No backstop: The next huge point is that under the article 50 extension the UK would not be bound by the backstop protocol, which under May\u2019s deal would kick in on 1st January 2021. Instead, on 1st January 2021 we would just leave unencumbered. We would be able to negotiate for a trade deal with the EU with a strong hand, and our negotiating position would not be crippled by being prospectively or actually locked into the backstop as it would be under May\u2019s deal. In the Commons leading Tory Brexiters have welcomed Howe\u2019s article. This is from Steve Baker, deputy chair of the European Research Group. And this is from Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister. In response to Javid, Louise Haigh, the shadow Home Office minister, said MPs were shocked by the recent killings, which had added to the murders of hundreds of young people over recent years. She said there had been a 93% rise in young people being stabbed since 2012. This was a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d, she said. She said it required national leadership from the prime minister and from the home secretary. They should convene a crisis summit, she said. And she said Labour favoured a public health approach to knife crime. She said it was \u201cshocking\u201d to hear Matt Hancock criticise this approach on LBC this morning. (See 4.18pm.) She also said police cuts had contributed to the problem. The funding settlement for police was inadequate, she said. This is what Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on LBC this morning when it was put to him that Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has been arguing that knife crime should be seen as a public health issue. Hancock said: If you try to say that it\u2019s a public health issue that implies that it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. The criminals who are murderers, it\u2019s their fault, and that\u2019s got to be the starting point ... If [Khan] uses language meaning we\u2019ve got to take a broad approach to how we tackle it, fine. But actually I think if you try to say that knife crime is a public health issue, it implies that there aren\u2019t individuals who are personally responsible for these terrible crimes, and you\u2019ve got to start from the point of the perpetrator needing to be brought to justice. Hancock clearly had no warning that Sajid Javid was going to say the opposite in the Commons only a few hours later. In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has just said she welcomes what Sajid Javid said about making fighting violent crime a statutory public health duty. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the opposite in an interview this morning, she said. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is responding to an urgent question on knife crime now. He says after the terrible events this weekend he welcomes the chance to come to the Commons. All MPs will wish there was something simple they could do to stop this violence, he says. But he says there are no shortcuts. There is no one, single solution. Coordinated action is required, he says. First, there has to be a strong law enforcement response, he says. The police must have the confidence to use tools like stop and search. Second, the authorities must intervene early to stop young people getting involved in crime, he says. He says he has introduced a bill to introduce knife crime prevention orders. Third, the police must be given the resources to tackle serious violence, he says. He says police funding is being raised to record levels next year. The police will get up to \u00a3970m more. And on Wednesday he will listen to chief constables to listen to what they want. Fourth, he says the authorities must be clear how changing patterns of drug use are fuelling rising crime. He says he has launched an independent drugs misuse review. Fifth, he says all parts of the public sector should prioritise tackling serious violence. He says he will soon launch a consultation on a new statutory public health duty to combat violent crime and help protect young people. Javid floats plan to make fighting violent crime a new, statutory public health duty. He says this is an issue that transcends party politics. This is from the Press Association, explaining how the \u00a31.6bn stronger towns fund announced today (see 9.24am) compares to other government spending decisions. The \u00a31bn billion that has been allocated to specific regions of England, which will be spread over seven financial years to 2025/26, matches the amount of money the government agreed to provide over five years to the Northern Ireland executive as part of the deal it struck with the DUP in 2017. This deal saw the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs agree to support the government on all key votes, including the Queen\u2019s Speech and budgets. - The combined total allocated to the South East, South West, East &amp; West Midlands and eastern England (\u00a3417m) is just \u00a33m below the \u00a3420 announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 budget for local authorities to fix potholes and renew bridges and tunnels in one year (2018/19). - Using the latest population estimates from the Office for National Statistics, the pots of money can be roughly compared in terms of spending per person. For example, if the total amount earmarked for north-east England (\u00a3105m) was spread across five of the region\u2019s largest towns - Darlington, Hartlepool, Gateshead, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees - the spending would be the equivalent of \u00a3142 per person. If the total for north-west England (\u00a3281m) was spread across the five towns of Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport and Wigan, the spending works out at around \u00a3208 per person. By contrast, if the \u00a333m earmarked for south-west England was allocated to the five towns of Bournemouth, Cheltenham, Poole, Stroud and Swindon, the equivalent total per person would be \u00a341. And if the \u00a325m for eastern England was spread just across the five towns of Basildon, Bedford, Colchester, Luton and Southend, the spending equates to \u00a327 per head. - The \u00a333m allocated to south-west England matches the \u00a333m the government has paid to Eurotunnel to settle a legal action over the award of Brexit contracts to ferry firms. - The total package of \u00a31.6bn funding compares with a total of \u00a33bn in outstanding council tax owed to local authorities in England since 1993 (when the tax was introduced). The same local authorities collected a total of \u00a327.5bn of council tax for the year to March 2018. Speaking on Salisbury, on a visit to mark the one-year anniversay of the novichok attakc, Theresa May said: What I have seen today here in Salisbury is the tremendous spirit and resolve of the people of Salisbury. It has been a difficult year for them and particularly difficult for the immediate victims of the reckless attack that took place on the streets of Salisbury and the use of a chemical weapon, a nerve agent, on our streets. As the Press Association reports, May had private meetings in The Guildhall before visiting Salisbury Cathedral. She was shown around the cathedral, which dates back to 1220, by the Very Reverend Nicholas Papadopulos - the Dean of Salisbury - and Tricia Glass, deputy head guide. She was introduced to Gary Price, clerk of works, and viewed the cathedral\u2019s copy of Magna Carta in the 13th century Chapter House. Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, has been speaking at the Institute for Government today. As the Independent\u2019s Jon Stone reports, Rogers said that no one in the EU, or in the UK government, thought a no-deal Brexit would be an acceptable long-term solution. Rogers is the Cassandra of Brexit. He quit his job in Brussels after falling out with Theresa May\u2019s team in Downing Street. They thought his predictions in late 2016 about the Brexit process were too gloomy. In fact, as far as we can tell, they were mostly spot on, and, now outside the civil service, he has become one of the most astute commentators on what is going on. Listening to him at the IfG, the Financial Times\u2019 Stefan Stern said a future inquiry into Brexit would want to know why Number 10 ever let him go. But Rogers himself was asked if he thought there should be a public inquiry into the handling of Brexit in the future. As Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne reports, Rogers said he was not convinced such an inquiry would be productive. Much of what Rogers said reflected the arguments he has made in his various lectures on Brexit, one of which has been reprinted as a book. Payne has a good Twitter thread with the main points. My colleague Simon Jenkins thinks Theresa May has badly mishandled the decision to allocate \u00a31.6bn for poorer towns. Here is his First thoughts column on the subject. And this is how it starts. Theresa May\u2019s bung is like Donald Trump\u2019s wall. You give me my Northern Ireland border deal, she says to Labour, and I will give your people oodles of cash. Except that May has blown it. She has promised Labour MPs in the Midlands and north \u00a31.6bn, but they have not promised her the deal. She is apparently relying on the kindness of their hearts. How stupid is that? She is even offering them a similar deal on workers\u2019 rights, again with no reciprocity. She showered a billion on the DUP, and now look how it treats her. Will she not learn? There are three urgent questions in the Commons today, two of which are from Labour frontbenchers attacking decisions taken Chris Grayling, who is now transport secretary. But Grayling won\u2019t be replying to either of them. These are from the official Labour whips account. After the three UQs there will be two statements. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has tweeted his own response to today\u2019s Daily Telegraph story. (See 10.04am.) Downing Street did not exactly knock the story down. (See 1.15pm.) But Cox is dismissing the story as misleading. And here is a summary of the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Downing Street hinted that the government has abandoned hopes of getting the EU to agree to either a time-limit to the backstop, or a unilateral exit mechanism. Asked about the Telegraph splash on this topic (see 10.04am), Theresa May\u2019s spokesman told journalists: The attorney general continues to pursue legally-binding changes to the backstop that are necessary to ensure that the EU cannot hold the UK in it indefinitely ... We are now at a particularly critical stage in these negotiations and the AG\u2019s work is focused on securing legally-binding changes to the backstop. What is significant about this answer is the spokesman did not say the government was still seeking either a \u201clegally-binding time limit to the existing backstop\u201d, or a \u201clegally-binding unilateral exit clause to that backstop\u201d. But these are two possible demands May did set out when she addressed MPs in mid February about the changes to the withdrawal agreement she was seeking. The spokesman also said that the UK was \u201cdefinitely making progress\u201d in the talks with the EU. But he added: \u201cThere definitely remains more work to be done.\u201d Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will be returning to Brussels on Tuesday for more talks about the backstop, the spokesman said. Asked if May herself had any plans to go to Brussels this week, the spokesman said there was \u201cnothing in the diary at the moment\u201d The spokesman said that May still wanted the UK to leave the EU on 29 March and that, if MPs passed a Brexit deal by 12 March, the government would be able to pass the required legislation in time. The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision to postpone a vote planned for this evening on an amendment to the financial services bill intended to introduce tax transparency in overseas territories. (See 11.55am.) The spokesman said: Thanks to UK leadership, all crown dependencies and overseas territories with financial centres are committed to global tax transparency standards, including the exchange of information to help investigate tax evasion. However, crown dependencies are separate jurisdictions with their own democratically-elected governments. They are responsible for their own fiscal matters. Given the beneficial ownership amendments were tabled on Thursday, it is only right that their implications are given proper and thorough consideration. The spokesman said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, not Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, will make a Commons statement later about the government\u2019s settlement with the transport firm Eurotunnel. (See 12.14pm.) The spokesman said that the \u00a31.6bn stronger towns fund money announced today (see 9.24am) would be in addition to the UK shared prosperity fund, the details of which will be announced \u201cshortly\u201d. The spokesman said Sajid Javid, the home secretary, would be speaking about knife crime when he holds a meeting with chief constables on Wednesday. Asked about the killing of two teenagers in separate knife attacks at the end of last week, the spokesman said: These are shocking and upsetting crimes and our sympathies are with the families and friends of the victims. The crimes are a stark reminder that there is more to do to tackle the violence on our streets. May is visiting Salisbury today, to mark the one-year anniversary of the novichok poisoning attack, the spokesman said. He said she would be \u201cexpressing her great admiration for the resilience which the community has shown in response to the attack a year ago.\u201d He also described the decision to illustrate a tweet from the PM\u2019s Twitter account about Salisbury with a picture of Bath (see 10.58am) was \u201ca human error\u201d that was corrected as soon as it was flagged up. And if the most surprising news from the lobby was about the financial services bill (see 11.55am), the announcement that caused most amusement was the news that a government statement on the Eurotunnel settlement will be made in the Commons this afternoon, not by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, but by Matt Hancock, the health secretary. The settlement was partly about provisions in place to ensure the UK can still import medicines smoothly in the event of a no-deal Brexit, so Hancock does have a role. But it was predominantly an issue for the Department for Transport. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Grayling is being benched this afternoon because he is considered a liability. The Eurotunnel settlement on Friday was seen as confirmation that he is a minister with a reverse Midas touch, and it led to renewed calls for his resignation. Even the New York Times has taken to running stories about Grayling being a disaster. A correction at the end of its article published yesterday says it all. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the amount that a Labour party\u2019s report claimed Chris Grayling misadventures had cost British taxpayers. It is 2.7 billion pounds, not 2.7 million. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The most dramatic news came, not from the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, but from a tweet read by journalists while the meeting was going on. The spokesman effectively confirmed that the financial services (implementation of legislation) bill debate planned for tonight has been pulled. He said an amendment to the bill requiring overseas territories to introduce registers of beneficial ownership for companies within their jurisdiction needed proper consideration. But in practice ministers have postponed the vote because the government was going to lose the vote on the amendment. Ministers take surprise decision to delay a vote on the financial services bill because they face defeat on an amendment saying overseas territories should have to enforce new tax transparency rules by the end of 2020. This announcement will reinforce claims that the government is so weak that it can barely get its legislation through the Commons. This bill is one that needs to be passed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This is from Jonathan Reynolds, a shadow Treasury minister. Theresa May was tweeting about Salisbury this morning. But, as my colleague Jim Waterson points out, she used the wrong picture. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. The commentary about the stronger towns fund announced by the government today (see 9.24am), and its impact on the the Brexit parliamentary arithmetic, is premised on the notion that it was Labour-voting constituencies in the north that swung the vote for leave. But in a provocative new book, Brexit and the End of Empire, the academics Danny Dorling and Sally Tomlinson, strongly challenge this argument. They report: Because of different levels of turnout and numbers of registered voters, most people who voted leave - by absolute numbers - lived in southern England. Furthermore, of all those who voted leave, 59% were middle class (often labelled as A, B or C1), and only 41% were working class (labelled C2, D or E). The proportion of leave voters who were of the lowest two social classes (D and E) was just 24%. One of us published these statistics not long after the vote, in the British Medical Journal, but that did little to quell the middle-class clamour to \u2018blame the working class\u2019 ... In short, then, Tory England voted Britain out. These were areas that had often loyally voted Conservative for decades, but economically were not doing anything like as well as other Tory areas, which cannot have seemed right to many people living there ... Older, less well-off, less well-educated Tory Britain was where the most votes for Brexit were. It cannot be said often enough. It was not Sunderland or Stoke that swung it. Mujtaba Rahman, the former European commission official who writes Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy, has sent out his latest assessment. Like the Daily Telegraph (see 10.04am), he thinks Geoffrey Cox is struggling to negotiate the backstop assurances that Brexiters want. Rahman says: Alarmingly for Number 10, talks made slow progress last week, with both sides conceding \u201csubstantive gaps\u201d remain between the two. They continue to work on a package of measures which they hope will allow Cox to say \u201con the balance of probability\u201d the backstop is not indefinite, perhaps focusing more on an independent arbitration mechanism. But EU officials are clear that such a mechanism cannot be used to judge whether \u201calternative arrangements\u201d needed to supplant the backstop are effective, since this is ultimately a matter of EU law, which is the exclusive competence of the ECJ. The prime minister might therefore need to go further; promising to stand down this summer might persuade more Eurosceptics to back her deal, as negotiations on a long-term trade agreement would be headed by her successor. But, in his conclusion, Rahman still argues that it is more likely than not that a deal will pass next week. We now put the odds of May\u2019s tweaked deal passing the Commons next week at 55% (35% with no referendum; 20% with a referendum). We assign 20% to a softer Brexit; 10% to no-deal; 10% to a general election and 5% to a referendum without a deal). Some ministers privately think May only has a slim chance of winning through this month, but might have a stronger one in June if she can frame the choice as one between her deal and no deal (in a way she cannot now do this month). All the same, Labour MP Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill blocking no deal would be revived. So May\u2019s ability to play the no-deal card MPs might depend on whether EU would grant a second extension. If May fails to win Commons backing this month, a very different deal would likely return in June\u2014such as Common Market 2.0 or Norway Plus agreement based on membership of the Single Market and a customs union. The real prospect of that might just tip enough Eurosceptics into May\u2019s column this month. In today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash (paywall) Steven Swinford and Peter Foster says Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general who is leading government attempts to negotiated legally-binding assurances on the backstop with Brussels, has \u201cabandoned attempts to secure a hard time-limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop\u201d. Their story goes on: Ministers briefed on Geoffrey Cox\u2019s approach said those aims, which represent the central demands of Eurosceptics, are considered too \u201cblunt\u201d and have been rejected by the European Union. Some cabinet ministers are already resigned to the Prime Minister losing a second meaningful vote on her deal amid concerns that changes to the backstop secured by Mr Cox will not be sufficient to win round Brexiteers. The attorney general is understood to be focusing on securing an enhanced \u201carbitration mechanism\u201d that allows the UK or the EU to provide formal notice that the backstop should come to an end. The EU is, however, resisting demands by British negotiators for an \u201cindependent\u201d arbitration panel, outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. When James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary, was asked if this was correct in his Today programme interview, he replied: The attorney general continues with his work to ensure that we get legally binding changes to ensure that we are not locked in the backstop. Brokenshire also said Cox would be \u201cback to Brussels this week to continue the discussions to make sure that we can get those legal changes\u201d. Ominously for the government, Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents the 50 or more Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, told the Telegraph that if its report was accurate, the Cox concession would not satisfy MPs. Baker said: This seems to indicate a satirical approach to fulfilling the Brady amendment which the government whipped for. The Brady amendment required that you replace the backstop with alternative arrangements. That\u2019s light years away from tweaking arbitration mechanisms. Nevertheless I don\u2019t want to pre-judge the work of the star chamber. A man has been charged with assault after Jeremy Corbyn was egged during a visit to a north London mosque, the Press Association reports. The Metropolitan police said John Murphy, 31, from Barnet, was charged in the early hours of Monday morning and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday March 19. Murphy allegedly screamed \u201cWhen you vote you get what you vote for\u201d as he came from behind and smacked Corbyn with an egg. Corbyn continued with his planned programme of constituency events at the Finsbury Park Mosque and Muslim Welfare House. He was unharmed and left with a police escort at around 6.30pm. Here is Gloria De Piero, the Labour MP for Ashfield, making the same point about the stronger towns fund as Gareth Snell. A few weeks ago it emerged that the government was planning to announce a big regional investment that would benefit in particular constituencies in the north that backed leave and vote Labour. The prospect of this money being available might help to persuade Labour MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, it was suggested. Downing Street rejected claims that this would amount to a \u201cbribe\u201d, but did not deny that the plan (actually, a variant of the \u201cUK shared prosperity fund, specifically designed to reduce inequalities between communities across our four nations\u201d, promised in the 2017 Conservative party manifesto) was under consideration. Today the announcement has arrived. And, in a statement Theresa May has partially linked it to Brexit. She says: For too long in our country prosperity has been unfairly spread. Our economy has worked well for some places but we want it to work for all communities. Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change \u2013 that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control. These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them. But, as Jessica Elgot points out in our overnight story, Labour MPs were queuing up last night to say that this announcement would not change their minds over Brexit. And this morning James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary, has been giving interviews about the announcement. What he has said confirms that this investment will probably end up having zero impact on the parliamentary dynamics over Brexit. Brokenshire confirmed that the government was committed to this spending whether or not MPs voted for May\u2019s Brexit deal. Asked if the money was coming whether or no the deal was passed, he said: \u201cYes.\u201d He went on: This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country. But there is no conditionality in that sense. This funding is there to see that towns grow and that we are actually looking at what we need to do, which is seeing those areas really prospering and following through on what the prime minister has really believed in, that sense of leaving no part of our UK behind, and how this will help support that. He said the \u00a31.6bn was being spent over the next seven years. Asked over what period the money was being spent, he said: It is through until 2026. So, in other words, you may have investments that will need to be put in place over a number of years. This timescale does make \u00a31.6bn look a lot less impressive than it does in the headlines. It is not unusual for governments to aggregate the numbers when announcing spending programmes, by giving a total spend not an annual spend. This can be misleading, but normally the truth is buried somewhere in the small print of the announcement. However the press release sent to journalists yesterday did not say over what period the \u00a31.6bn would be spent. Reporters had to make inquiries to get an answer. Brokenshire rejected claims that the investment did not amount to much. When this was put to him, he replied: I actually fundamentally disagree. If you look at the investment that could to into particular towns, the areas that need it most, this money can be transformative. It can make that difference on creating the jobs, actually putting the skills in place, and changing people\u2019s lives in a modern, positive economy. And he also dismissed claims that the new money would not even begin to compensate for the amount towns in the north have lost through other government cuts, such as reductions in grants to councils. He was asked about this tweet from the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, Gareth Snell. In response, Brokenshire said: I think you are making a fundamental miscomparison between fundamental rates of money that councils will spend on their budgets each year, as contrasted with focused funds, transformative funds, to invest in skills, to invest in jobs, to invest in productivity, that actually then supplement the work of councils, and indeed other funds that we have in place. I will post more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, speaks at the Institute for Government. 2.30pm: James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 4pm: Jon Thompson, the HM Revenue and Customs chief executive, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary when I finish, at about 5.30pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Drug consumption rooms should be piloted in an effort to reduce the record number of drug-related deaths in the UK, the Labour party has said. DCRs are supervised medical facilities present in seven European countries where drug addicts can take illicitly obtained heroin and cocaine safely, as well as being directed to social, health and recovery services. There have been no recorded deaths in a DCR. Calls for their introduction have grown following sustained increases in drug-related deaths, with 4,678 people dying in Britain in 2017. The government has faced criticism for cutting funding for addiction services while pursuing a criminal justice approach to drug use at a time when other countries are increasingly adopting public health approaches. In Portugal, the decriminalisation of drug use caused a steep fall in the drug death rate, which now stands at one-10th of that of the UK. Carolyn Harris, Labour\u2019s drugs policy spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe need to be brave and support drug addicts and misusers into recovery, but the current approach stifles progress. \u201cDrug consumption rooms take people off the streets and to somewhere they can be engaged in treatment to try to help them with their addictions. \u201cThe government\u2019s ideological approach to drugs since they took office in 2010 has been plagued with irresponsible cuts that have seen the UK become the drug overdose capital of Europe. It is time to consider all of the options based on what is most effective to reduce harm. \u201cI believe the government is being overcautious in not considering DCRs as a way to protect us all from the harms of public drug use, and we support pilot schemes to ensure we have sufficient evidence for any future approach.\u201d There were 934 drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2017 and members of the Scottish parliament have voted to introduce a DCR in Glasgow to address spiralling deaths, rising HIV levels and common street using in the city. However, the Home Office blocked the proposal, citing fears over the implied acceptance of criminality despite acknowledging the potential public health benefits of DCRs, also known as overdose prevention centres. Labour\u2019s campaign for drug policy reform announced on Monday that a series of public meetings will be held around the country, including in Belfast, Glasgow, Liverpool and Swansea, to provide a forum for members to debate and influence party policy. Harris welcomed the new campaign, co-founded by the MPs Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, saying it represented how the party is moving towards an evidence-based approach on drug policy. \u201cThere are ways we can do things differently within existing legislation, such as drug safety testing, and it is good that party activists want to get involved in debating how Labour policy on drugs can better serve the people we seek to represent,\u201d she said. The campaign\u2019s expert working group, which includes the former lord chancellor Charles Falconer and Prof Fiona Measham, the founder of the UK drug testing service, will use the public meetings to inform a set of recommendations the group will present to the shadow cabinet for consideration. Debbonaire, the MP for Bristol West, said: \u201cThis campaign is about opening up the debates on drug policy to all Labour members and supporters, and the people we aim to serve.\u201d The Sunday Times reported that at least 10 chief constables would support plans to open DCRs in their areas.
