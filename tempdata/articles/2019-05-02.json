Is he a menace to national security, or is he the innocent victim of a toffs\u2019 stitch-up? For an answer we may have to await a future memoir from one of the participants in this episode. But even then, the essence of a leak is deniability. The wink, the nod, the \u201cI could not possibly say \u2026 or ask me and watch if I smile\u201d, followed by a ring-round to substantiate.</p> <p>What is clear is that Williamson was accused by the prime minister of leaking a National Security Council discussion of the Chinese corporation Huawei\u2019s involvement in the 5G mobile phone network, was found guilty and was sacked. This was done before he was put in a position to prove his innocence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the case of the ministerial code, redress is in the hands of the prime minister. She can sack whoever she wants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reality is that the former defence secretary had become a loose cannon waiting to be fired. He was notorious for deploying his press contacts ruthlessly, not least against cabinet colleagues. These included the chancellor Philip Hammond and his deputy Liz Truss. The cannon blew up in his face.</p> <p>One of the last straws may have come as a result of Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-gavin-williamson-hms-queen-elizabeth-pacific-south-china-sea-defence-a8774076.html\" title=\"\">overriding</a> of his announcement that the new aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth, would go to the South China Sea, a high-profile decision for the NSC, and one that led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/16/gavin-williamson-defence-minister-china-visit-gaffes-conservative-anger\" title=\"\">cancellation</a> of Hammond\u2019s trip to Beijing. When Williamson heard of it, I am reliably told he scrawled \u201cFuck the prime minister\u201d on an official piece of paper. As it spread round the office, it is hard to believe such gossip did not speed its gleeful way to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill.

      "bodyText": "Is Gavin Williamson a disloyal rat, or is he a Tory Julian Assange, a valiant champion of open government in an age of secrecy? Is he a menace to national security, or is he the innocent victim of a toffs\u2019 stitch-up? For an answer we may have to await a future memoir from one of the participants in this episode. But even then, the essence of a leak is deniability. The wink, the nod, the \u201cI could not possibly say \u2026 or ask me and watch if I smile\u201d, followed by a ring-round to substantiate. What is clear is that Williamson was accused by the prime minister of leaking a National Security Council discussion of the Chinese corporation Huawei\u2019s involvement in the 5G mobile phone network, was found guilty and was sacked. This was done before he was put in a position to prove his innocence. The reality is that the former defence secretary had become a loose cannon waiting to be fired. He was notorious for deploying his press contacts ruthlessly, not least against cabinet colleagues. These included the chancellor Philip Hammond and his deputy Liz Truss. The cannon blew up in his face. One of the last straws may have come as a result of Theresa May\u2019s overriding of his announcement that the new aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth, would go to the South China Sea, a high-profile decision for the NSC, and one that led to the cancellation of Hammond\u2019s trip to Beijing. When Williamson heard of it, I am reliably told he scrawled \u201cFuck the prime minister\u201d on an official piece of paper. As it spread round the office, it is hard to believe such gossip did not speed its gleeful way to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. There is no membrane as leaky as that between top Whitehall officials. Even so, Sedwill\u2019s predecessor, Gus O\u2019Donnell must be right in telling the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the NSC leak was not of an \u201cofficial secret\u201d and not therefore a matter for police investigation and possible prosecution. A leak of a cast list \u2013 five ministers against the prime minister \u2013 rather than information or secrets from the NSC hardly constitutes a threat to national security. Williamson\u2019s breach was of the ministerial code. The code states that \u201cthe principle of collective responsibility requires that ministers should be able to express their views frankly, in the expectation that they can argue freely in private while maintaining a united front when decisions have been reached\u201d. But this is a political matter. Breaches are legion. A conversation is not an official secret or a threat to national security, a concept ludicrously overblown in the past. In the case of the code, redress is entirely in the hands of the prime minister. She can sack whoever she wants. May must bear a share of the blame. She should never have appointed Williamson. He had no experience of departmental office, and behaved like Donald Trump in khaki. He loved chatting to journalists with links to the Conservative party, and admitted to talking to the Daily Telegraph for 11 minutes after the NSC debate with May. He must have known he was dining with the devil. He might claim to have been discussing Spurs\u2019 chances in the cup, but pull the other one. While the defence ministry was as appalled to be led by Williamson as the Foreign Office was by Boris Johnson, he had his uses. He was single-minded in his spats with Hammond over money, and with Sedwill over the relative priority of cybersecurity and conventional weaponry.

The government wheeled out the second most important member of the cabinet, <strong>David Lidington</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, to respond, which can be seen as an indication of how seriously it is taking this matter. But, despite the best efforts of the opposition, this did not feel like a crisis that is escalating. </p> <p>Here are the main points. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Lidington said that the government considered the matter closed and that it was not planning to refer the matter to the police for an investigation as to whether Gavin Williamson broke the Official Secrets Act.</strong> He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The unauthorised disclosure of any information from government is serious and especially so from the National Security Council. </p> <p>The prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary [Sir Mark Sedwill] does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police, but we would of course cooperate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lidington\u2019s comment about the government being willing to cooperate with any police inquiry was probably superfluous because the police themselves have said that, without an referral from the Cabinet Office, there won\u2019t be an investigation in the first place. This is what <strong>Cressida Dick,</strong> the Metropolitan police commissioner, told reporters this morning, around the time the UQ was taking place.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not going to comment on that particular case suffice to say if the Cabinet Office were to send us a referral at any point that relates to apparent official secrets or leaks we would assess that. We would scope it and we would go through a very formal gateway process before working on any investigation. </p> <p>The gateway process has been in place for about six years and a formal decision would be taken by the deputy commissioner but that is hypothetical because we have not had any referral from the Cabinet Office. </p> </blockquote> <p>She said said that if other people made a complaint relating to official secrets, the Met would look at it, but she said the formal process involved a referral from the Cabinet Office. Asked if police needed permission from the government to launch an inquiry, she said any official secrets would be owned by them and they would hold any evidence relating to them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is sitting in the government. We as the police when considering whether there is an appropriate criminal investigation or not will have to be party to that material. At the present time we are not in possession.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Lidington refused to say whether he thought Williamson did or did not break the law. </strong>Asked about this, he told the SNP\u2019s <strong>Stewart McDonald</strong>:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is not a judgment that I or any other minister in any government can make. Whether a criminal offence has been committed is a matter of independent prosecution authorities and ultimately for the courts. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Lidington also told MPs repeatedly that the government was not planning to refer this matter to the police for an adjudication on this.</p> <ul> <li><strong>But he also played down suggestions that Williamson did break the Official Secrets Act.</strong> When the Tory former cabinet minister <strong>Oliver Letwin </strong>put it to him that there was no leak of classified information in this case, Lidington said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush to make that assumption because normally all papers that are considered by the national security council are at an extremely high level of classification.\u201d But he want on to argue that what mattered was that there had been a leak in the first place.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But the key point here ... is that the issue at stake here was less the substance of the material that was disclosed than the principle of a leak from the national security council itself. Because the fact of that leak, that breach of confidentiality having taken place, is what puts at risk the mutual trust which is essential for all ministers and advising attending those meetings.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Lidington said that Williamson did not have to have broken the law for his sacking to be justified.</strong> He stressed that what led to Williamson losing his job was that Theresa May concluded she no longer had confidence of him. He said this was not the same meeting the burden of proof required to show the Official Secrets Act had been broken. <ul> <br> </ul></li> <li><strong>Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, strongly criticised May for sacking Williamson but not being willing to order a criminal investigation that might determine his guilt or innocence. </strong>Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of [Williamson] has protested his innocence. Therefore this matter cannot be, as the prime minister says, closed. </p> <p>The essential point here is the prime minister has sacked the secretary of state for defence because she believes there is compelling evidence that he has committed a crime. But despite that, she does not believe he should face a criminal investigation - where is the justice in that? </p> <p>In what world is it acceptable that the prime minister should be the arbiter of whether a politician she believes is guilty of criminal conduct in office should face a criminal investigation?</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Some Tory MPs complained strongly about the way May has treated Williamson.</strong> During the UQ <strong>Sir Edward Leigh</strong> said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this country we believe in natural justice ... As a matter of natural justice, how is the former defence secretary now going to be given an opportunity to prove his innocence?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Desmond Swayne</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outside this house [Williamson] is being called a liar. And inside this house a number of honourable members have implied as much. Natural justice demands that the evidence be produced so that his reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed, doesn\u2019t it?</p> </blockquote> <p>And<strong> Peter Bone </strong>said he thought Williamson has been the victim of a \u201ckangaroo court reaching a decision in secret\u201d. Leigh, Swayne and Bone are all rightwing Brexiters who would not be near the top of a list of May loyalists.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-02T15:14:31.578Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ccac9d38f08f8a8c7947824\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-02T10:44:02.697Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bombardier </strong>is to sell its aerostructures business in Belfast, the company has announced.

Sometimes it is not quite as edifying as people assume.</p> <p>So it is worth flagging up an exchange on the Today programme earlier between <strong>Nick Robinson</strong>, the Today presenter and the former BBC political editor, and <strong>Tom Newton Dunn</strong>, the Sun\u2019s political editor, in which they discussed how the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford might have got his story about the National Security Council\u2019s Huawei story.</p> <p>Robinson suggested that, to get a story like this, a journalist would not have to be told directly and outright by a minister what happened. They might instead by able to infer it from the minister not disagreeing with a proposition put to him, or her. Newton Dunn agreed. And he went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how it would have happened, whoever the leaker was, if it was Gavin Williamson, who we\u2019ve all suspected it was in Westminster. We\u2019ve done this for a while. That\u2019s exactly how the conversations go. You don\u2019t ring up a minister and say, \u2018Will you leak this to me?\u2019 You say to him, \u201cIf I were to write, and I think that this happened, would I look particularly silly?\u201d And then the minister says to you, \u201cI don\u2019t think you look silly, Tom, at the best of times\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Gavin Williamson will received a payoff of around \u00a317,000 after he was sacked as defence secretary, it has emerged. Rory Stewart, the new secretary of state for international development, has reiterated his support for the government\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid. More than 600,000 EU citizens have already applied to stay in the UK post-Brexit, Home Office figures reveal. Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed the Scottish government will rethink plans to cut air travel taxes after agreeing to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2045. That is all from me for this afternoon. If there is any important breaking news later, a colleague will reactivate this blog. This evening we will be running a separate live blog for the local elections. It is due to launch at 9.30pm, and you will be able to find it here. Colleagues will be writing it during the night, and I will be in at 6am tomorrow morning to pick it up and carry it through all Friday. This is from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. This firms up what David Lidington was hinting in the Commons earlier. (See 12.37pm.) In response to a request from a reader .... here are some dogs at polling stations. The Scottish Conservative conference takes place tomorrow. It will be the moment when Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, returns to frontline politics after her maternity leave, and in an interview to mark that, Davidson said she hoped the government and Labour would compromise in the Brexit talks. She told STV: I think at the moment there are conversations going on between Labour and the Conservatives in London. The mood music that is coming out of that room is that there may well be a breakthrough this week and I really want to see it, because we know more than anyone in Scotland that sometimes the divisions after referenda are bigger than the divisions before, and we\u2019ve got into really entrenched positions. My view through all of this is that we\u2019re going to have to meet somewhere in the middle - between the people who want to overturn the referendum and re-run it and those who want a no-deal Brexit. There are no local elections in London, but Theresa May has been voting his afternoon at Sonning in her Maidenhead constituency. According to the Press Association, she did not respond when reporters asked if she would ask the police to investigate the Huawei leak. Gavin Williamson is not being asked to leave the privy council, according to briefing notes carried by an aide to David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and seen by a photographer. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. YouGov has released some polling today suggesting the Brexit party has a nine-point lead in the European elections. It is on 30%, ahead of Labour on 21%, the Conservatives on 13%, the Lib Dems on 10%, the Green and Change UK on 9% and Ukip on 4%. The Brexit party, which is led by Nigel Farage, is in many respects the successor party to the Farage version of Ukip that won the 2014 European elections. (The current Ukip is much more rightwing and Islamophobic.) But five years ago Ukip, which got 27% of the vote, was just two points ahead of Labour, on 25%, which in turn was just ahead of the Tories, on 24%. Gavin Williamson will received a payoff of around \u00a317,000 after he was sacked as defence secretary, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. Gavin Williamson has renewed his call for a police investigation into the Huawei leak, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has sought to defuse the row generated by Gavin Williamson\u2019s sacking from his post as defence secretary by playing down suggestions he might have broken the Official Secrets Act and rejecting calls for the matter to be referred to the police. But, as he answered a Commons urgent question on the subject, Lidington faced strong criticism from some Tory rightwingers who complained that Williamson had been subject to \u201ckangaroo court\u201d justice. (See 12.37pm.) Polls have opened for council and mayoral elections across England and Northern Ireland, with the Conservatives predicted to suffer significant losses to the Liberal Democrats and Labour. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary has faced fresh calls to resign as he defended the government\u2019s decision to spend around \u00a350m on scrapped contracts to provide ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking in the Commons, his Labour shadow Andy McDonald said: Every other week, MPs must debate the transport secretary\u2019s latest costly blunder. I am afraid that this will continue so long as the secretary of state remains in post. This country can no longer afford the secretary of state. Plaid Cymru has launched its EU election campaign with leader Adam Price using a speech to call for an independent Wales in Europe. Price said he wanted a future Wales to remain in the EU as a member state, saying Brexit only involved \u201cmoving power from one end of the Eurostar to the other.\u201d He went on: We are a party born of the Welsh nationalist tradition, most certainty. We seek independence for our country. But we want that independence so we can participate directly in the wider world, first and foremost as part of the European family of nations. Labour has moved the writ for the Peterborough byelection which will be held on Thursday 6 June. Climate change protests across the capital cost police an extra \u00a37m and put a \u201chuge strain\u201d on the force, Britain\u2019s most senior officer has said. As the Press Association reports, over 10 days in April, activists brought parts of London to a standstill, blocking Waterloo Bridge and Oxford Circus, staging a \u201cdie-in\u201d at the Natural History Museum, and gluing themselves to objects. At a Scotland Yard briefing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick revealed that the extra costs of policing the event ran to more than \u00a37m. The Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is to sell its wing-making operation, which employs 4,000 people in Northern Ireland, sparking concern among trade unions and MPs about the uncertain impact on highly skilled jobs. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has criticised Gavin Williamson over the Huawei leak. Speaking in the Scottish parliament she said: Obviously it is a matter for the police to determine what criminal investigations they take forward and what the progress of them might be. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on that but what I would say is politically, that as a politician, I think that it\u2019s reprehensible that there were leaks from the National Security Council and I think it is a sign of the complete dysfunction at the heart of the UK government. I think any minister that has been found guilty in such a way I think that they lose their job. All politicians in government should recognise the responsibility and the privileges we carry and should not be behaving in the way it Gavin Williamson appears was behaving - for their own selfish political ends. Stephen Parkinson, a former deputy head of the attorney general\u2019s office who is now senior partner at the law firm Kingsley Napley, says he does not expect the police to investigate Gavin Williamson. In a comment released to the media he explains: It is highly unlikely a criminal investigation will be opened. Such an investigation would need the backing of government and a view is likely to be taken that the public interest test has already been met by Williamson\u2019s dismissal. He has paid the price by losing his career. Earlier I quoted the Sun\u2019s political editor Tom Newton Dunn giving away tricks of the trade about how lobby journalists get ministers to \u201cleak\u201d information to them. (See 10.35am.) My colleague Gaby Hinsliff, a former political editor of the Observer, has also spilled the beans in a long and interesting Twitter thread starting here. It starts here. And this might be her most important post. Here are the main points from the urgent question about Gavin Williamson. The government wheeled out the second most important member of the cabinet, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, to respond, which can be seen as an indication of how seriously it is taking this matter. But, despite the best efforts of the opposition, this did not feel like a crisis that is escalating. Here are the main points. Lidington said that the government considered the matter closed and that it was not planning to refer the matter to the police for an investigation as to whether Gavin Williamson broke the Official Secrets Act. He told MPs: The unauthorised disclosure of any information from government is serious and especially so from the National Security Council. The prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary [Sir Mark Sedwill] does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police, but we would of course cooperate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary. Lidington\u2019s comment about the government being willing to cooperate with any police inquiry was probably superfluous because the police themselves have said that, without an referral from the Cabinet Office, there won\u2019t be an investigation in the first place. This is what Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told reporters this morning, around the time the UQ was taking place. We are not going to comment on that particular case suffice to say if the Cabinet Office were to send us a referral at any point that relates to apparent official secrets or leaks we would assess that. We would scope it and we would go through a very formal gateway process before working on any investigation. The gateway process has been in place for about six years and a formal decision would be taken by the deputy commissioner but that is hypothetical because we have not had any referral from the Cabinet Office. She said said that if other people made a complaint relating to official secrets, the Met would look at it, but she said the formal process involved a referral from the Cabinet Office. Asked if police needed permission from the government to launch an inquiry, she said any official secrets would be owned by them and they would hold any evidence relating to them. It is sitting in the government. We as the police when considering whether there is an appropriate criminal investigation or not will have to be party to that material. At the present time we are not in possession. Lidington refused to say whether he thought Williamson did or did not break the law. Asked about this, he told the SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald: That is not a judgment that I or any other minister in any government can make. Whether a criminal offence has been committed is a matter of independent prosecution authorities and ultimately for the courts. But Lidington also told MPs repeatedly that the government was not planning to refer this matter to the police for an adjudication on this. But he also played down suggestions that Williamson did break the Official Secrets Act. When the Tory former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin put it to him that there was no leak of classified information in this case, Lidington said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush to make that assumption because normally all papers that are considered by the national security council are at an extremely high level of classification.\u201d But he want on to argue that what mattered was that there had been a leak in the first place. But the key point here ... is that the issue at stake here was less the substance of the material that was disclosed than the principle of a leak from the national security council itself. Because the fact of that leak, that breach of confidentiality having taken place, is what puts at risk the mutual trust which is essential for all ministers and advising attending those meetings. Lidington said that Williamson did not have to have broken the law for his sacking to be justified. He stressed that what led to Williamson losing his job was that Theresa May concluded she no longer had confidence of him. He said this was not the same meeting the burden of proof required to show the Official Secrets Act had been broken. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, strongly criticised May for sacking Williamson but not being willing to order a criminal investigation that might determine his guilt or innocence. Watson said: In response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of [Williamson] has protested his innocence. Therefore this matter cannot be, as the prime minister says, closed. The essential point here is the prime minister has sacked the secretary of state for defence because she believes there is compelling evidence that he has committed a crime. But despite that, she does not believe he should face a criminal investigation - where is the justice in that? In what world is it acceptable that the prime minister should be the arbiter of whether a politician she believes is guilty of criminal conduct in office should face a criminal investigation? Some Tory MPs complained strongly about the way May has treated Williamson. During the UQ Sir Edward Leigh said: In this country we believe in natural justice ... As a matter of natural justice, how is the former defence secretary now going to be given an opportunity to prove his innocence? Sir Desmond Swayne said: Outside this house [Williamson] is being called a liar. And inside this house a number of honourable members have implied as much. Natural justice demands that the evidence be produced so that his reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed, doesn\u2019t it? And Peter Bone said he thought Williamson has been the victim of a \u201ckangaroo court reaching a decision in secret\u201d. Leigh, Swayne and Bone are all rightwing Brexiters who would not be near the top of a list of May loyalists. Bombardier is to sell its aerostructures business in Belfast, the company has announced. As the Press Association reports, a statement by the Canadian manufacturing giant confirmed rumours which had been circulating at the plant in Northern Ireland. A statement issued in Montreal said: As the company moves to optimise its global manufacturing footprint, Bombardier will pursue the divestiture of the Belfast and Morocco aerostructures businesses. These are great businesses with tremendous capabilities. The UQ is now over, but Tom Watson is raising a point of order. He says Lidington said it was for the police to investigation. But the Metropolitan police have said this morning they cannot investigate unless the information is shared with them. Watson was referring to this. I will post a summary of what we\u2019ve learnt from the Williamson exchanges shortly. Bob Seely, a Conservative, says David Lidington told MPs last week that Huawei was a private company. Isn\u2019t that a half-truth, he says. Isn\u2019t it part of the Chinese state? Lidington says Huawei is owned by its workers and so it is a private company. But he accepts that it is required to collaborate with the Chinese state. He says the government wants to ensure diversity of supply. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks if a leak from the NSC is not a breach of the Official Secrets Act, what is? Lidington says there are various tests that apply in deciding if the OSA has been broken. It depends on the category of information involved. Back in the Commons Plaid Cymru\u2019s Ben Lake asks if the government would refer this to the police if it thought the law had been broken. Lidington says the cabinet secretary considered this carefully, and chose not to refer it to the police. Turning away from the UQ for a moment, this is from the BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw. Peter Bone, a Tory Brexiter, says Williamson has said on the lives of his children he did not leak this information. This seems to be a kangaroo court, he says. He says Andrew Mitchell was forced to resign as chief whip after a row with a police officer, but what he said was subsequently found to be true. (That is a very partial account of the Mitchell affair, which did result in Mitchell losing a libel case.) Lidington repeats the point about May deciding she no longer had confidence in Williamson. Greg Hands, a Conservative, says the ministerial code does not even mention the NSC. Lidington says the NSC is a cabinet committee, so it is covered by what the code says about cabinet. Lidington says, if the cabinet secretary had found prima facie evidence that the law had been broken, he would have come to a different judgment about referring this to the police. He says there is a difference between the test for the law being broken, and falling below the required standard for ministerial confidentiality. Steve Baker, a Conservative Brexiter, says the principles of good government must be upheld. But does this mean we won\u2019t see breaches of collective responsibility that undermine the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiating positions? Baker is referring to cabinet pro-Europeans telling journalists about their opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Lidington says ministers should accept collective cabinet responsibility. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, says outside this house Williamson is being called a liar. And some MPs are implying as much. He says natural justice requires that Williamson be allowed to defend his reputation, or see it destroyed. Lidington says he has chosen his language with care. May sacked Williamson because she no longer had confidence in him, he says. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says MPs will feel sorry for Williamson. You cannot prove yourself innocent in a kangaroo court. And he says Lidington was wrong to say this was not a matter for the attorney general. The attorney general would have to agree any prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Lidington says it is right to say that the attorney general would have to approve a prosecution under the OSA. But he cannot trigger an inquiry. And he repeats his point about the fact of the leak being more important than the substance of what it involved. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says in this country people believe in natural justice. How can Williamson prove his innocence? Lidington says Williamson has not been accused of an offence. But he has lost the confidence of the PM. Anna Soubry, the Change UK MP, says this episode represents \u201cthe complete disintegration of this government\u201d. It marks someone abandoning all honour for personal advantage. She says, no ifs, not buts, this matter has to go to the police. Will the government fully cooperate with that police investigation? Lidington says, if the police consider that is necessary, the government will give full cooperation. Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former Cabinet Office minister, says on this occasion there does not seem to have been a leak of classified information. Lidington says he cannot be sure. NSC papers are classified. But in this case it was less the substance of the leak than the fact that the leak took place. Leaks of this kind undermine trust, he says. And the UK\u2019s allies rely on that trust too. Lidington says the fact there was a leak from the NSC was more important than the substance of the leak. Labour\u2019s Kevan Jones asks if the attorney general has been asked if the Official Secrets Act was broken. Lidington says this was not a matter for the attorney general. It was for the PM to decide whether the ministerial code was broken. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald says this is a disgraceful episode. He praises the PM for acting quickly, but he says it is not for her to say that this matter is closed. In her letter the PM said Williamson did not cooperate with the leak inquiry as satisfactorily as others did. What does this mean? Does Williamson have a future in the Conservative party? Will he be able to be a candidate again? And will he have his CBE removed? And has the Official Secrets Act been broken? Lidington says it is not for him to say if the OSA has been broken. That would be a matter for prosecuting authorities and for the courts. Lidington says it is not for the government to say whether or not the Official Secrets Act was broken. On the investigation, he says he will not go beyond what was in May\u2019s letter. MPs will know that May had a close working relationship with Williamson. (He helped organise her leadership campaign.) So she would not have done what she did without compelling evidence, he says. On Williamson\u2019s honour, Lidington says this is a matter for an independent committee. He concludes by saying that Williamson has lost a job he loved. Lidington is responding to Watson. He says Watson has raised various different issues. On Huawei, he says once the government has made a decision about 5G, it will announce it to the Commons. Its priorities will be security of the network, resilience and diversity of supply, he says. On the inquiry, he says the ministerial code says ministers only remain in office as long as they retain the confidence of the PM. She is the ultimate judge of that, he says. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, says the PM has accused Williamson of being responsible for the leak. But Williamson has denied it. Only one of them can be right. He says this was the \u201cmost brutal sacking\u201d he can recall. He says May has sacked Williamson because of \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d he committed a crime. But she does not want a criminal investigation. That cannot be right, he says. He says this matter cannot be considered closed. Watson says Huawai leak affair cannot be considered closed. He asks if there were any leaks from the leak inquiry. And he asks whether the Huawei decision was sound. The UK\u2019s five eyes intelligence partners (the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) do not consider it is right for the UK to allow Huawei a role in building 5G infrastructure. Speaking out about this is unprecedented, he says. He asks if Lidington is confident the Huawei decision keeps the UK safe and protects our relationship with our allies. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, is responding to the UQ about Gavin Williamson. He says the National Security Council was set up in 2010, partly as a result of lessons learnt from the Iraq war. It takes decisions crucial to national security, he says. He says it is inconceivable now that the country could go to war without the NSC having a very full discussion about the decision, with access to full papers and legal advice. It is vital that its proceedings are confidential, he says. He says May set out her conclusions yesterday. Any leak from the NSC is particularly serious, he says. He says the PM now considers this matter closed and the cabinet secretary does not consider it necessary to refer this to the police. But if the police want to investigate, the government will cooperate. He says he will not comment on personnel, and will not go into details. Like people who make sausages, journalists who create news would sometimes rather the public did not know exactly what was involved in the production process. Sometimes it is not quite as edifying as people assume. So it is worth flagging up an exchange on the Today programme earlier between Nick Robinson, the Today presenter and the former BBC political editor, and Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun\u2019s political editor, in which they discussed how the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford might have got his story about the National Security Council\u2019s Huawei story. Robinson suggested that, to get a story like this, a journalist would not have to be told directly and outright by a minister what happened. They might instead by able to infer it from the minister not disagreeing with a proposition put to him, or her. Newton Dunn agreed. And he went on: I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how it would have happened, whoever the leaker was, if it was Gavin Williamson, who we\u2019ve all suspected it was in Westminster. We\u2019ve done this for a while. That\u2019s exactly how the conversations go. You don\u2019t ring up a minister and say, \u2018Will you leak this to me?\u2019 You say to him, \u201cIf I were to write, and I think that this happened, would I look particularly silly?\u201d And then the minister says to you, \u201cI don\u2019t think you look silly, Tom, at the best of times\u201d. And that\u2019s the code we talk in. Or sometimes they say, \u201cYou do look particularly silly much of the time\u201d. That\u2019s the code. And that\u2019s how it would have happened. Gavin Williamson has admitted talking to Swinford for 11 minutes after the NSC meeting. But he denies telling Swinford what happened. It is possible that Williamson could both be the source of Swinford\u2019s information, and that Williamson genuinely believes he did not actively give away any secrets because he never said anything specific. The curtains were drawn and two cars were on the drive at Gavin Williamson\u2019s constituency address in a leafy area of south Staffordshire this morning, the Press Association reports. But there was no answer from anybody on the doorstep at the detached property. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has said that it is not up to the government to decide whether there is a criminal investigation into Gavin Williamson. Speaking at a World Press Freedom Day forum at the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Hunt said: Let me say that, when it comes to issues like whether there should be a police investigation or not, there\u2019s a very, very important principle of our system that those decisions are not made by politicians, they are made independently by police. And that has to be the correct way forward in this situation. But Lord Dannatt, the former head of the army, questioned Gus O\u2019Donnell\u2019s claim that the leak was not a breach of the Official Secrets Act. (See 9.21am.) Dannatt said: Gus O\u2019Donnell has just said on this programme that he does not regard [this] as a breach of the Official Secrets Act. I think that\u2019s probably a moot point, given that the material in question that was being discussed came from the National Security Council. When it was put to Dannatt that Gavin Williamson had to deny being the source of the leak because otherwise he might face jail, Dannatt agreed. He said: I think that\u2019s probably why he is protesting it, because I think he has to protest his innocence over this, otherwise he is laying himself open to potential criminal prosecution. Dannatt said that he spoke to Williamson last night, and Williamson was \u201cvery much protesting his innocence\u201d. Dannatt also described this a \u201ca personal tragedy\u201d and paid tribute to Williamson\u2019s record as defence secretary. It\u2019s a very difficult brief, people take quite some time to learn it, and he has got to grips with it pretty well over the last 18 months. He got \u00a31.8bn extra in the budget last year and was continuing to argue the case for more resources in the spending review and he was fighting his corner. Yes, he made some mistakes, he made some gaffes, and said some things that he probably regretted, but on the whole he was doing a good job. This is what Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, told the Today programme about Gavin Williamson\u2019s offence being a breach of the ministerial code, not necessarily a breach of the Official Secrets Act. (See 9.04am.) The cabinet secretary is saying, \u2018Look, this is a matter for the violation of the ministerial code. It is not a breach of the Official Secrets Act, putting people\u2019s lives at risk.\u2019 That is why it is a matter for the prime minister to decide does she want this person in her political team when faced with this evidence? And she\u2019s basically decided that he is not the Lionel Messi of the cabinet and she can do without him. \u201cNot the Lionel Messi of the cabinet\u201d is a polite way of saying was a dud as defence secretary. That is certainly a common view at Westminster \u2013 my colleague Matthew Weaver has a good round-up of some of Williamson\u2019s mishaps in the role here \u2013 although it is worth pointing out that in his previous job, as chief whip, Williamson was seen as highly effective. There will be a second urgent question in the Commons after the Gavin Williamson one. Last night, after announcing that Gavin Williamson was being sacked as defence secretary for the Huawei leak from the National Security Council, Downing Street said it considered the matter \u201cclosed\u201d. You can read all the details in our overnight splash. But the opposition parties have got other ideas; they are pushing for a criminal inquiry. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, was on the Today programme this morning making this argument. He said: This is about the law applying equally and to everyone. We have had high-profile civil servants go to jail for breaching the Official Secrets Act. The logic of the prime minister\u2019s letter is she says she has compelling evidence that suggests he has done the same. He is denying it and he has the right to clear his name - the way to do that is a criminal inquiry if confidential information has leaked. The Liberal Democrats are making the same argument. This is what Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said last night: This story cannot begin and end with dismissal from office. What is at stake is the capacity of our security services to give advice at the highest level. This must now be referred to the Metropolitan police for a thorough criminal investigation into breaches of the Official Secrets Act. There are different views on whether or not Williamson, assuming he was responsible for the leak, might have broken the Official Secrets Act. On the Today programme this morning Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, said Williamson\u2019s offence was breaking the ministerial code, not breaking secrecy laws. But Lord Dannatt, a former head of the army, told the same programme a few minutes later that he did not necessarily accept this. We\u2019ll here more on this in the Commons at 10.30am, because it has just been announced that Labour has been granted an urgent question on this. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: Theresa May holds a meeting with her Icelandic counterpart, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. 10.30am: Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, asks an urgent question in the Commons about the sacking of Gavin Williamson. After 11am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement about next week\u2019s Commons business. Of course, there are also local elections today in England and Northern Ireland. If you are commenting on them in the comments, please do not say anything about how you, or anyone else, cast their vote. Under electoral law it is an offence to publish \u201cany statement relating to the way in which voters have voted at the election where that statement is (or might reasonably be taken to be) based on information given by voters after they have voted\u201d. But we are interested in hearing about the elections in your area. You could just say you expect X to do very well ... As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary Theresa May sacked for allegedly leaking secret information, will receive a payoff and is unlikely to face a police inquiry, it emerged on Thursday. Williamson will be given a lump sum of around \u00a317,000 after his dramatic removal from the government following a cabinet inquiry. As a former defence secretary, Williamson is entitled to the normal severance settlement enjoyed by any cabinet minister, No 10 said, which is three months of his annual salary of \u00a367,505. The inquiry concluded he was the source of leaked details about a National Security Council (NSC) decision to allow the Chinese firm Huawei to play a role in the UK\u2019s 5G network. Williamson continues to deny that he was behind the leak, and claims he would be \u201cabsolutely exonerated\u201d if there was a police investigation. Despite demands from Labour, May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, told the House of Commons the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, who conducted the investigation, had decided that he would not refer the matter to the police. Some Tories have voiced concerns over the sacking of Williamson. \u201cThe prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police,\u201dLidlington said. Speaking in response to an urgent question in the Commons, he insisted that it was up to the police whether to launch an investigation. \u201cWe would of course co-operate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary,\u201d he said. But the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, contradicted him, saying a formal investigation would have to involve a referral from the Cabinet Office. Asked whether police needed permission from the government to launch an inquiry, she said any official secrets would be owned by the government and it would hold any evidence relating to them. \u201cIt is sitting in the government. We, as the police, when considering whether there is an appropriate criminal investigation or not will have to be party to that material. At the present time we are not in possession,\u201d she said. Asked whether it was, on the face of it, a breach of the Official Secrets Act, Dick said police would seek advice at an early stage from the Crown Prosecution Service to establish that. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the government was trying to shut down legitimate questions about possible criminal activity by a minister before a police inquiry had been launched. \u201cIn response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of, [Williamson] has protested his innocence.

He said he would welcome a police inquiry, which he said would have \u201cabsolutely exonerated\u201d him. Among Tory MPs who complained about the way May treated Williamson was Sir Edward Leigh, who said: \u201cIn this country we believe in natural justice ...

A further 20% of British people believed the costs and benefits were about equal, while 16% were not sure. The findings contradict the assumption that Britain is more hostile to immigration than its European neighbours are. Britain was seen as taking a hardline and less compassionate response to the 2015 European migration crisis, while many argue concerns over immigration were the key driving force behind the Brexit vote. But experts have detected a softening in attitudes towards immigration since that vote, which could in part be influenced by the prospect of the end of freedom of movement and the dramatic drop in net migration to the UK from EU countries, which in the last figures dropped to its lowest level since 2009. In all, only 37% of Britons feel the costs of immigration outweigh the benefits \u2013 lower than in any other big European country apart from Poland. By comparison, 50% of Italians believe the net impact of immigration is negative, as well as 49% of Swedes and 42% of French and 40% of Germans. The findings come weeks before the European parliament elections, where populist, anti-immigrant forces are projected to perform well across Europe. Nigel Farage, whose anti-migrant \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster came to symbolise the leave message in the 2016 EU referendum, is returning to politics with his Brexit party, while his former party, Ukip, continues to campaign on immigration issues. However, the UK portion of the global YouGov survey suggests anti-immigrant messaging is unlikely to work across the party divide. While only 3% of Ukip voters thought benefits outweighed costs, this compared with 15% of Conservative voters and 42% who voted Labour. The survey also suggested men were most open to the benefits of immigration, with 32% saying the overall the impact was positive, compared with 24% of women. Sunder Katwala, the director of the identity and integration thinktank British Future, which last year published The National Conversation, a report on immigration in the UK, said studies were showing Britain was on the \u201cglass half full\u201d end of the debate. \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing body of evidence that attitudes, having been very sceptical, are becoming softer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe salience of immigration has dropped significantly and there\u2019s also been a warming up of attitudes.\u201d Katwala said a softening of attitudes had been noticed by politicians and as a result the likes of Farage had changed tone ahead of the European elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nuance in British attitudes.

Some people are more empathetic because they see stories like Windrush, they see that the 3 million Europeans in the UK aren\u2019t just a statistic but the people we see on television worried about whether they\u2019re allowed to stay.\u201dThe survey shows Britons are particularly supportive of migrants, either unskilled or qualified professionals, if they have a job offer in advance. Forty-one per cent of Britons agreed that unskilled labourers arriving in the UK with a job offer were good for the country, a higher proportion than in all other major EU nations apart from Spain. Similarly, Britons showed the highest level of support than any country surveyed for qualified professionals coming to the UK with a job offer, with 80% agreeing they were good for the country \u2013 compared, for example, with just 56% of French respondents. Conversely, Britons are less supportive than other western nations in the survey of migrants arriving without a job in search for work. Only 14% of Britons thought unskilled labourers coming to the UK to search for work were good for the country, with only Sweden and Germany showing lower levels of support for this kind of migrant. Britons also appeared relatively hostile to refugees. Only 29% of Britons thought people fleeing war or persecution were good for the country, less than any other EU or anglophone country in the survey. Almost half of Canadians (45%) and French (44%), in contrast, expressed support for refugees. UK respondents also showed the lowest level of support of all countries surveyed for migrants coming to join family members who already live here, with just 22% of respondents thinking this was good for the country, compared with 56% of Polish respondents who, among the EU and anglophone countries, showed the highest level of support.",

I have anxiety and PTSD. I am \u2013 and I cannot say this strongly enough \u2013 exhausted. I do not feel safe policing London\u2019s streets and, moreover, increasingly I do not feel that people in London are safe. Just last night, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/02/boy-believed-to-be-aged-15-dies-after-being-stabbed-in-east-london\" title=\"\">another double stabbing in east London</a>, resulting in the death of a 15-year-old boy.</p> <p>It\u2019s all well and good vaguely debating \u201ccuts\u201d, but on the frontline of service, those things have real meaning. In the borough I am stationed in \u2013 much like other boroughs \u2013 where there is a population of about 250,000 people, there are on average 10 police officers for the entire area to respond to emergency calls per shift. Only two or three of them can drive on blue lights. Crucially, very few staff carry Tasers. With a big incident, such as a stabbing, it\u2019s not unusual to have all of those 10 officers at one crime scene, meaning there is no one else to attend further 999 calls.</p> <p>I can expect, at the very least, to respond to at least two to three crimes involving knives a month, and that is being generous. Attackers have pulled knives on me. My colleagues \u2013 friends \u2013 have been stabbed in front of me. I\u2019ve found myself many times kneeling on the pavement holding parts of bodies together. We are simply not equipped: most of the time when a violent crime comes in, it\u2019s only hope that we can depend on. That somehow we can verbally talk a person down from further attacks, or that we can physically overpower them. Or that, miraculously, an officer with a Taser turns up.</p> <p>There has been, as evidenced by the recent and continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/15/sajid-javid-to-call-for-shift-in-mindset-to-tackle-knife\" title=\"\">knife-crime debate</a>, a steep upturn in the amount of calls we attend that involve a blade or even a gun. I don\u2019t mind admitting I\u2019m scared going out on these jobs. I realise it\u2019s part of my duty as a police officer, but the trouble is, I no longer feel we\u2019re in control.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/05/theresa-may-police-cuts-margaret-thatcher-budgets\" title=\"\">20,000 frontline cuts</a> don\u2019t even begin to cover the reality.

Should we try to section them, it can take even longer to locate a single bed, so we often end up at the other side of London, away from our borough. Frequently the person is then released an hour later, deemed to be fit, and we get another call from them the following night, at the same address, to deal with the same issue all over again. The system is broken.</p> <p>As for our own mental health, there isn\u2019t really time to recover. You\u2019re expected to go straight out on to the next job, sometimes on the same night, even if a situation is debilitating. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get an inspector or a sergeant who\u2019s half decent, and asks how you are. Often you think you\u2019re all right for a while. But it takes its toll eventually. I have PTSD from particular jobs \u2013 I get panicky, and I\u2019ve had periods of intense flashbacks \u2013 but when I asked my GP about being referred for help, he said I had to go through occupational health.
