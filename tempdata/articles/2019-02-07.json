      "bodyText": "The Department of Home Affairs has asked the Australian federal police to investigate how a confidential security agency briefing found its way into the Australian newspaper. Shortly after Scott Morrison declared the proposed refugee medical evacuation amendments to be \u201cstupid\u201d legislation \u201cwritten by people who haven\u2019t got the faintest idea how this works\u201d, parts of a confidential briefing based on Asio advice warning of its impact were published by News Corp. The advice, which the government has declined to release, despite its front-page publication and use in political attacks, is understood to have been prepared by the nation\u2019s spy agency and Australian Border Force for the home affairs department. It remains unknown if the reportedly \u201cclassified\u201d advice refers to the original Kerryn Phelps bill, or the amendments, which strengthen ministerial discretion. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has accepted a briefing from security agencies both about the practical implications of the crossbench bill, and about the impact of a separate proposal from the government setting up an independent medical review panel to vet medical transfers of asylum seekers from offshore detention. Labor currently supports the crossbench bill, and moving from that position would trigger a backlash in the caucus, but Shorten made it clear this week that he could change that stance and support the government proposition. The two architects of the crossbench bill, Phelps and the independent senator Tim Storer, have urged Labor to hold the line. Phelps said Labor and other parliamentarians should not \u201ccave in\u201d to Morrison\u2019s \u201cscare tactics and deliberate misinformation\u201d about their proposal. The government has been escalating attacks on the crossbench proposal all week, at least in part in an effort to avoid a defeat on the floor of the House when parliament returns next week. The last time a substantive vote was lost in the House was 1929, and an election was called the day after. Peter Dutton went on the offensive on Thursday, first declaring Shorten had been briefed by agencies about the implications of the Phelps bill, then acknowledging he hadn\u2019t, then declaring he should have been. After adjusting the first incorrect statement, Dutton said the Labor leader needed to explain why \u201che couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up to a briefing on national security\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor had \u201cread in the newspaper that Scott Morrison was going to offer us a briefing\u201d, with the article referring to \u201ca letter expected to be sent from the prime minister to the leader of the opposition\u201d. \u201cThe newspaper had it before Bill Shorten did,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you have a sensible conversation. \u201cAs I understand it we have now received the letter after we read about it \u2013 and we are considering what\u2019s in that letter.\u201d On the leak of the reportedly classified briefing, Bowen called it \u201ca very disturbing politicisation of our security agencies\u201d. \u201cSomebody gave a newspaper classified information,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cNow, there used to be a time when that was not the done thing. If somebody was caught giving classified briefings to a newspaper they had very serious consequences to pay. Under this government it appears that you are rewarded for it.\u201d The medical transfers bill is set to be dealt with in the House of Representatives when parliament resumes next week, after a frantic game of political cat and mouse to delay it reaching the chamber on the last sitting day last year. After amendments were added to the bill to give the minister the discretion to reject medical transfers on national security grounds, Labor gave its support to the bill, which, with the majority of crossbenchers, gives it the numbers to pass the House, despite the government\u2019s opposition. Under the amendments, the minister would have to tell the parliament the reason for rejecting the transfer, which would then be further reviewed by an independent medical panel for assessment. The government argues that would put too much power in the hands of doctors, at the expense of national security \u2013 although any evacuees would remain in detention in Australia, with the minister retaining ultimate control over who is released into the community. In an attempt to head off the coming battle and a potential historic defeat on substantial legislation, the prime minister announced that the government would establish a medical review panel to look at transfer cases, but that the decision would remain with the minister. The majority of crossbenchers have rejected that option, but Cathy McGowan, who indicated she would support the amended bill late last year, has said she will not make her final decision known until the bill comes to a vote.",

These include the Betfair Hurdle card at Newbury on Saturday, one of the most valuable meetings of the National Hunt season.</p> \n<p>Equine influenza is endemic in Britain\u2019s horse population, but vaccination against the disease is mandatory for thoroughbreds and most other breeds that are used competitively, such as eventers. As a result, outbreaks are extremely rare, but the fact that all three of the horses affected at McCain\u2019s stable had been vaccinated prompted immediate concern that a new strain of the disease could spread rapidly through the racing industry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f280d749-ddf2-4483-a6b4-71ca40898265\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>What is equine flu?</b></p>\n    <p>It is not unlike human flu with symptoms of coughing, nasal discharge and a fever but it\u2019s not normally fatal, with horses generally remaining infectious for up to 10 days.

It is rarely fatal, though it can lead to complications including pneumonia and some horses can take several weeks, or even months, to recover fully from an infection.</p> \n<p>As a result, an epidemic has the potential to cause massive disruption to a country\u2019s racing programme or even shut it down altogether.

      "bodyText": "All race meetings in Britain have been cancelled until next Wednesday at the earliest while the sport\u2019s governing body awaits test results from more than 100 stables that could have been exposed to equine influenza. Donald McCain\u2019s yard in Cheshire, where three cases of equine influenza in vaccinated horses were confirmed on Wednesday evening, sent a single runner to meetings in Ayr and Ludlow earlier that day, potentially exposing many more horses to the disease. The cancellations, ordered by the British Horseracing Authority, will cost the industry tens of millions of pounds and is the biggest loss of fixtures for reasons other than freezing weather since the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 when even the Cheltenham Festival was lost. It leaves trainers on tenterhooks with next month\u2019s renewal of the most important meeting of the year on the horizon. All four meetings scheduled in Britain on Thursday were abandoned following news of the positive tests, and in all at least 23 meetings will be lost as a result of the outbreak. These include the Betfair Hurdle card at Newbury on Saturday, one of the most valuable meetings of the National Hunt season. Equine influenza is endemic in Britain\u2019s horse population, but vaccination against the disease is mandatory for thoroughbreds and most other breeds that are used competitively, such as eventers. As a result, outbreaks are extremely rare, but the fact that all three of the horses affected at McCain\u2019s stable had been vaccinated prompted immediate concern that a new strain of the disease could spread rapidly through the racing industry. Equine influenza causes similar symptoms in horses to those suffered by humans; including fever, nasal discharge and a harsh, dry cough. It is rarely fatal, though it can lead to complications including pneumonia and some horses can take several weeks, or even months, to recover fully from an infection. As a result, an epidemic has the potential to cause massive disruption to a country\u2019s racing programme or even shut it down altogether. An outbreak in New South Wales in 2007 resulted in the closure of Sydney\u2019s racetracks from late August until early December, although this was in an unvaccinated racehorse population. McCain also sent a runner to Wolverhampton\u2019s meeting on Monday evening and all horses in the stables that competed on the card will be tested for equine influenza, along with all runners at the meetings at Ludlow and Ayr on Wednesday. This includes several from stables in Ireland, including five from the yard of Gordon Elliott, one of Ireland\u2019s most successful trainers.

David Morris, the chief executive of EDO NSW, called the decision \u201cmomentous\u201d and said it would be \u201cprofoundly influential\u201d in the approval of future fossil fuel projects. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how any future coal project avoids the judge\u2019s finding about this being the wrong time for it,\u201d he said. In his judgment, Preston explicitly cited the project\u2019s potential impact on climate change, writing that an open-cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley \u201cwould be in the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. \u201cWrong place because an open cut coal mine in this scenic and cultural landscape, proximate to many people\u2019s homes and farms, will cause significant planning, amenity, visual and social impacts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWrong time because the GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions of the coal mine and its coal product will increase global total concentrations of GHGs at a time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions. These dire consequences should be avoided. The project should be refused.\u201d In a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d hearing, the EDO had argued that the mine should be refused in part because of its impact on Australia\u2019s commitments to the Paris climate agreement. In his judgment, Preston noted that while there was \u201cno proscription\u201d on the approval of new emissions sources such as coalmines under the agreement, approval of the project \u201ccannot assist in achieving the rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions that are necessary\u201d to meet the goals of the agreement. \u201cIt matters not that the aggregate of the project\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions may represent a small fraction of the global total\u201d, he said. \u201cThe global problem of climate change needs to be addressed by multiple local actions to mitigate emissions by sources and remove greenhouse gases by sinks.\u201d He rejected GRL\u2019s argument that the project should be allowed because emissions from the mine would be abated by other emissions reductions schemes as \u201cspeculative and hypothetical\u201d. \u201cThere is no evidence before the court of any specific and certain action to \u2018net out\u2019 the GHG emissions of the project,\u201d he wrote in his judgment. \u201cA consent authority cannot rationally approve a development that is likely to have some identified environmental impact on the theoretical possibility that the environmental impact will be mitigated or offset by some unspecified and uncertain action at some unspecified and uncertain time in the future.\u201d The judgment also rejected the mine on the grounds of its visual impact and the social impact of factors such as dust and noise on the surrounding community. Morris said the ramifications would be felt by state and federal ministers and other decision makers who assess fossil fuel projects. \u201cThis is necessarily a case-specific judgment. It relates to this coalmine proposed in the Gloucester Valley,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt is persuasive, influential but it is not binding on any future decision. \u201cBut it will weigh heavily on the minds of decision makers.\u201d He said the judge\u2019s comment that the mine was being proposed at the \u201cwrong time\u201d was \u201capplicable to every fossil fuel project that\u2019s proposed in this country and internationally going forward.\u201d Morris said Australia was increasingly approaching a moment when approval of a fossil fuel project could be considered \u201cunreasonable\u201d. \u201cAnd unreasonableness is a ground of legal challenge,\u201d he said. Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie also welcomed the decision. \u201cThe NSW Land and Environment court has effectively ruled that coal \u2013 just like tobacco and asbestos \u2013 is bad for us,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to see the law catching up with the science. \u201cIf I was proposing to build a coal mine right now, I\u2019d be feeling pretty nervous.\u201d NSW planning minister Anthony Roberts was asked for the government\u2019s reaction to the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThat is the legal process and we respect the court\u2019s decision,\u201d he said. A spokesman for the NSW planning and environment department said the department was pleased the court had agreed with its recommendation on the proposed coal mine. He said the decision supported the current process of assessing developments on a case-by-case basis. In 2017, the independent planning commission rejected the mine because of its proximity to the town of Gloucester, its visual impact, and contravention of the city\u2019s zoning plans. \u201cThe judgment confirms the Department of Planning and Environment was correct in its decision to recommend refusal of the application to the Independent Planning Commission, and the Commission was correct to refuse the application,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThis decision shows NSW has a robust and transparent planning process that is delivering the best outcomes for the whole community.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A judge confirmed in a court filing on Thursday that federal prosecutors in New York are still investigating campaign finance crimes committed when Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump before he became president. US district judge William Pauley made the disclosure as he agreed to release, in several weeks\u2019 time, some court documents related to the search warrant that authorized last April\u2019s FBI raids on Cohen\u2019s home and office. Media organizations had requested access to the records. Pauley said some documents should stay secret because making them public could jeopardize aspects of its investigation, \u201cincluding those pertaining to or arising from Cohen\u2019s campaign finance crimes\u201d. In December, Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for crimes including tax evasion, fraud, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations that occurred when two women were paid to stay silent about affairs they claimed to have had with Trump. Cohen is scheduled to testify behind closed doors to committees on Capitol Hill later this month, and then is due to go to prison on 6 March. The judge authorized disclosure of portions of materials related to Cohen\u2019s tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen\u2019s conduct that did not result in criminal charges. Nine media organizations had cited high public interest and a right to access in requesting the records. The judge gave prosecutors until the end of the month to identify portions of the documents that should stay secret. Prosecutors, through a spokesman, declined comment. The judge said the search warrant applications and affidavits supporting them \u201ccatalogue an assortment of uncharged individuals and detail their involvement in communications and transactions connected to the campaign finance charges to which Cohen pled guilty\u201d. Pauley said prosecutors revealed to him that \u201cthese individuals include those cooperating with the government, those who have provided information to the government, and other subjects of the investigation\u201d. He said the search warrants do not detail the government\u2019s ongoing investigation as much as other documents including affidavits, but they \u201cenumerate topics of inquiry relating to the campaign finance charges\u201d. The judge added: \u201cAt this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the government\u2019s ongoing investigation. It would also unveil subjects of the investigation and the potential conduct under scrutiny, the full volume and nature of the evidence gathered thus far, and the sources of information provided to the government.\u201d Cohen pleaded guilty in August to two campaign violations and other crimes. One charge described a $150,000 payment to former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and another concerned a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels using a sham home equity loan before he was reimbursed through the Trump Organization using false invoices, court papers said. Cohen, in his plea, said that it was all done with the knowledge and at the direction of a \u201ccandidate for federal office\u201d, meaning Trump. News organizations in the legal action to unseal the documents included the New York Times, the Associated Press, and the parent companies of ABC and CBS News, CNN, the Daily News, the Wall Street Journal, Newsday and the New York Post.

There is an inexplicable assumption that I speak out on issues not because I believe in them, but to attract loathing so I can then play the victim. People have called my office to tell my staff I\u2019m a drama queen. People accuse me of always making it about gender, race and colour \u2013 as if that\u2019s not the constant subject of the abuse. But most of all they want to grind me down. And sometimes it works. The cries of \u201cit\u2019s just social media\u201d and \u201cignore the trolls\u201d just don\u2019t ring true to me any more, even when they come from well-meaning allies. Social media is as real as the \u201creal world\u201d. There are actual people behind every offensive comment. And I am only human. Their name calling, vicious insults and threats do hurt. It also hurts to hear good people unwittingly perpetuate the idea that I should stay silent because \u201cresponding only emboldens them\u201d. The idea that people like me, who in some people\u2019s eyes can\u2019t be \u201creal\u201d Aussies, should just continue their work stoically and feign indifference to the volleys of abuse that come our way, denies us our agency to feel just like anyone else does. But doing nothing causes harm. Exposing the messages and the messengers lays bare what so many of us experience more and more. It helps others to speak out. It helps build a community of supporters who make it harder for bullying behaviour to continue. I\u2019m not usually afraid to say what is right, but sometimes I\u2019ve wanted to crawl into bed and not get up. I\u2019ve thought of doing exactly what the haters want \u2013 shutting up. For the first time, I\u2019ve seriously considered the question: Is it really worth it? But when I meet people in the community, particularly young women of colour, who tell me they couldn\u2019t consider a career in public life because they see the abuse that this would open them up to, I know shutting up isn\u2019t an option. Our parliaments already lack the gender and cultural diversity of our streets and suburbs. Giving in to the abusers will only make it worse. Creating a more civil discourse is incumbent on everyone. Don\u2019t turn a blind eye to racist and sexist abuse on social media; use your privilege to intervene. Join calls for social media platforms to take a far more active role in policing their platforms. Ultimately, we need to dismantle the perception that the relative anonymity of the internet entitles people to get away with violent and abusive hate speech without consequences. Keeping an artificial divide between the virtual and the real only emboldens bad behaviour. We on the receiving end live in the real world, same as you. \u2022 Mehreen Faruqi is Australian Greens senator for NSW",

      "body": "<p>Claudio Ranieri is a man in a hurry. Fulham\u2019s manager will be unhappy if he sees his team playing like a bad Manchester City tribute act for the rest of the season. With Premier League survival on the line, the Italian is running out of patience. Questions about his philosophy elicit a measured but pointed response and Ranieri\u2019s message was clear before Fulham host Manchester United on Saturday: the time for learning is over.</p> <p>While Ranieri delivered a few nice lines about grit and determination, saying that Fulham need \u201csoldiers who have to fight until the end\u201d against United, it was when he turned his thoughts to tactical concerns that his frustrations became more apparent. His demand that his players get the ball forward quickly sounds reasonable enough, but the challenge is forcing a rapid shift in mentality in a group who spent three years learning a different style of football under Slavisa Jokanovic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/29/fulham-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">Aleksandar Mitrovic at the double as Fulham fightback stuns Brighton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fulham, seven points below 17th-placed Burnley and yet to win away, are surely destined to drop back into the Championship unless they trust in Jokanovic\u2019s successor. Yet some of the noises are unconvincing. For instance, it was interesting to hear Tom Cairney observe that Fulham are a team who \u201chave got to pass the ball\u201d after the midfielder played a crucial role last month in the thrilling comeback win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. \u201cWe can\u2019t really outfight teams,\u201d Cairney said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t big enough. We aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>Ranieri, who has not won away in the Premier League since April 2016, has other ideas. \u201cI love when we keep possession but look forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI get crazy when we keep possession and go back to our goalkeeper, because the opponent\u2019s goal is the other side. Keep possession, go forward. Don\u2019t keep possession and go back. If we are maybe 30 metres from the opposition goal and we go back, pass the ball to the goalkeeper, who makes a long kick and we arrive in the middle of the pitch. Why?\u201d</p> <p>Ranieri, who has struggled to inspire an improvement since his appointment in November, considered that Fulham had flourished with a patient style in the past. \u201cLast season they were one of the best teams, they kept possession,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end they had to buy Aleksandar Mitrovic, who scored goals. A lot of matches they won 1-0, 2-1. It was a battle. Now there are better teams. If you keep possession and you don\u2019t score, sooner or later you are too spread out and you concede a goal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He continued along that theme and accepted it is not easy to change a team\u2019s tactics in such a short space of time. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cThe more intelligent think: \u2018OK, I have the ball, I have to pass forward.\u2019 Who is not intelligent pass the balls horizontally and we lose the ball and give the counterattack to them.\u201d</p> <p>While Ranieri arrived in west London with a reputation as a miracle worker after winning the Premier League with Leicester in 2016, there was no sign of any magic during last week\u2019s lifeless defeat at Crystal Palace. Ryan Sessegnon, their brilliant teenage winger, was an unused substitute and supporters were alarmed to see Cairney toiling on the right of a front three.</p> <p>Ranieri believes that Sessegnon needs more nastiness and he sounds unlikely to entrust Cairney with a role in the middle against United, especially if he persists with a 3-4-3 system.</p> <p>\u201cI like Cairney but I want him more forward,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI don\u2019t like when he comes back because if he comes back, I don\u2019t have anybody in front. I want him between the lines. He can make the difference. He can make the last pass. He can shoot a goal. He can make a cross.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/feb/07/the-premier-league-title-race-and-savehakeem-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">The Premier League title race and #SaveHakeem \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fulham\u2019s only chance against Palace stemmed from Cairney drifting inside and picking out Joe Bryan, whose cross deserved a better finish from Mitrovic. \u201cHe starts from outside to come inside,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cJuan Mata does the same. The two at Manchester City, Silva, Mahrez, they always come in the middle. He can make some difference there.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s comfortable when he plays free. When you\u2019re in the middle and lose the ball you have to work hard to regain the ball. In that position, he stops. No. That\u2019s no good. In that position you can win or lose the match, in the centre of midfield.\u201d</p> <p>Cairney\u2019s difficulty to fit in epitomises Fulham\u2019s plight. They spent heavily last summer and made further additions last month, bringing in Havard Nordtveit, Ryan Babel and Lazar Markovic, but confusion reigns. Ranieri is still trying to create a new identity. He has 13 games to make it work and the clock is ticking.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Claudio Ranieri is a man in a hurry. Fulham\u2019s manager will be unhappy if he sees his team playing like a bad Manchester City tribute act for the rest of the season. With Premier League survival on the line, the Italian is running out of patience. Questions about his philosophy elicit a measured but pointed response and Ranieri\u2019s message was clear before Fulham host Manchester United on Saturday: the time for learning is over. While Ranieri delivered a few nice lines about grit and determination, saying that Fulham need \u201csoldiers who have to fight until the end\u201d against United, it was when he turned his thoughts to tactical concerns that his frustrations became more apparent. His demand that his players get the ball forward quickly sounds reasonable enough, but the challenge is forcing a rapid shift in mentality in a group who spent three years learning a different style of football under Slavisa Jokanovic. Fulham, seven points below 17th-placed Burnley and yet to win away, are surely destined to drop back into the Championship unless they trust in Jokanovic\u2019s successor. Yet some of the noises are unconvincing. For instance, it was interesting to hear Tom Cairney observe that Fulham are a team who \u201chave got to pass the ball\u201d after the midfielder played a crucial role last month in the thrilling comeback win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. \u201cWe can\u2019t really outfight teams,\u201d Cairney said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t big enough. We aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d Ranieri, who has not won away in the Premier League since April 2016, has other ideas. \u201cI love when we keep possession but look forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI get crazy when we keep possession and go back to our goalkeeper, because the opponent\u2019s goal is the other side. Keep possession, go forward. Don\u2019t keep possession and go back. If we are maybe 30 metres from the opposition goal and we go back, pass the ball to the goalkeeper, who makes a long kick and we arrive in the middle of the pitch. Why?\u201d Ranieri, who has struggled to inspire an improvement since his appointment in November, considered that Fulham had flourished with a patient style in the past. \u201cLast season they were one of the best teams, they kept possession,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end they had to buy Aleksandar Mitrovic, who scored goals. A lot of matches they won 1-0, 2-1. It was a battle. Now there are better teams. If you keep possession and you don\u2019t score, sooner or later you are too spread out and you concede a goal.\u201d He continued along that theme and accepted it is not easy to change a team\u2019s tactics in such a short space of time. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cThe more intelligent think: \u2018OK, I have the ball, I have to pass forward.\u2019 Who is not intelligent pass the balls horizontally and we lose the ball and give the counterattack to them.\u201d While Ranieri arrived in west London with a reputation as a miracle worker after winning the Premier League with Leicester in 2016, there was no sign of any magic during last week\u2019s lifeless defeat at Crystal Palace. Ryan Sessegnon, their brilliant teenage winger, was an unused substitute and supporters were alarmed to see Cairney toiling on the right of a front three. Ranieri believes that Sessegnon needs more nastiness and he sounds unlikely to entrust Cairney with a role in the middle against United, especially if he persists with a 3-4-3 system. \u201cI like Cairney but I want him more forward,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI don\u2019t like when he comes back because if he comes back, I don\u2019t have anybody in front. I want him between the lines. He can make the difference. He can make the last pass. He can shoot a goal. He can make a cross.\u201d Fulham\u2019s only chance against Palace stemmed from Cairney drifting inside and picking out Joe Bryan, whose cross deserved a better finish from Mitrovic. \u201cHe starts from outside to come inside,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cJuan Mata does the same. The two at Manchester City, Silva, Mahrez, they always come in the middle. He can make some difference there. \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable when he plays free. When you\u2019re in the middle and lose the ball you have to work hard to regain the ball. In that position, he stops. No. That\u2019s no good. In that position you can win or lose the match, in the centre of midfield.\u201d Cairney\u2019s difficulty to fit in epitomises Fulham\u2019s plight. They spent heavily last summer and made further additions last month, bringing in Havard Nordtveit, Ryan Babel and Lazar Markovic, but confusion reigns. Ranieri is still trying to create a new identity. He has 13 games to make it work and the clock is ticking.",

I have never had the \u2026 well, we\u2019ll use the word \u201cpleasure\u201d for now \u2026 of travelling on this or any other airline (on the grounds that humans \u2013 and I really can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be flying in anything other than the occasional childhood dream). So I thoroughly enjoyed this anatomisation of the no-frills Irish airline, which seemed to exist for no grander purpose \u2013 and why should it? \u2013 than to boggle at the man who, in essence, created it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/michael-oleary\" title=\"\">Michael O\u2019Leary</a>.</p> <p>What a piece of work is man. Particularly this man. For he is the one who looked at the airline that began as a relatively conventional one in 1985. It flew from places you had heard of to other places you had heard of and offered food, drink, plentiful access to toilets and all the other niceties of life for a reasonable price \u2013 and ran at a loss to do so. Then it said: \u201cNo. Take away everything but the seats and the pilot. And let me think about the seats. And the pilots.\u201d</p> <p>It revolutionised the industry. People who had once saved all year to go on an annual foreign holiday were, by the end of the 90s, seasoned travellers. If you wanted to get from A to B (or a few kilometres outside B and then a coach) for the lowest possible price, O\u2019Leary was your guy. And if he was occasionally a guy who seemed to have the same whiff of contempt for customers as the criminal does for his docile marks, well \u2013 it was only a couple of tenners from Dublin to Stuttgart-adjacent, so what did it matter?</p> <p>If you want anything more than your seat, of course, you have to pay extra.

      "bodyText": "How much you enjoyed this offering from Channel 5 (Ryanair: Britain\u2019s Most Hated Airline? \u2013 you pay extra for the question mark) will, I suspect, correlate closely with how much you have travelled on Ryanair. I have never had the \u2026 well, we\u2019ll use the word \u201cpleasure\u201d for now \u2026 of travelling on this or any other airline (on the grounds that humans \u2013 and I really can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be flying in anything other than the occasional childhood dream). So I thoroughly enjoyed this anatomisation of the no-frills Irish airline, which seemed to exist for no grander purpose \u2013 and why should it? \u2013 than to boggle at the man who, in essence, created it: Michael O\u2019Leary. What a piece of work is man. Particularly this man. For he is the one who looked at the airline that began as a relatively conventional one in 1985. It flew from places you had heard of to other places you had heard of and offered food, drink, plentiful access to toilets and all the other niceties of life for a reasonable price \u2013 and ran at a loss to do so. Then it said: \u201cNo. Take away everything but the seats and the pilot. And let me think about the seats. And the pilots.\u201d It revolutionised the industry. People who had once saved all year to go on an annual foreign holiday were, by the end of the 90s, seasoned travellers. If you wanted to get from A to B (or a few kilometres outside B and then a coach) for the lowest possible price, O\u2019Leary was your guy. And if he was occasionally a guy who seemed to have the same whiff of contempt for customers as the criminal does for his docile marks, well \u2013 it was only a couple of tenners from Dublin to Stuttgart-adjacent, so what did it matter? If you want anything more than your seat, of course, you have to pay extra. O\u2019Leary has always been very \u2013 one could almost say monstrously \u2013 clear about that. That coach from beyond point B, for example. Your baggage. Food. Drink. At one point, he even tried to take out the seats and have a standing-room-only fare. Tales of appalling rudeness to those who dared complain abounded. One woman, who was charged \u20ac300 for Ryanair to print out the boarding pass she had forgotten, was told to forget about a refund. The general tone, and possibly even a direct quote from his email, was that \u201cit was your fuck-up\u201d, she said. His staff were treated no better than his passengers. O\u2019Leary refused until very recently to have any truck with unions. To encourage quick turnarounds between flights, attendants were only paid for time in the air. They had sales targets to meet for everything that could possibly be loaded on to a trolley and pushed down the aisle. As the tales of horror mounted up, however, you realised that his real genius lay in stripping out the inefficiencies caused by modern customer relations. The degree of effrontery required in capitalism has traditionally been mitigated by PR flimflam, cant, the smoke-and-mirrors of unswervingly polite, on-message staff and an unyielding pretence by those at the top that everything is done by Them in the holistic service of Us. We hope this is so, and they continue to humour us after their commercial stratagems have been successful by not rubbing our noses in the fact that we have just been ruthlessly exploited, in order to maximise their exploitation chances next time round too. It works, but it is not perfectly efficient; you do have to give the customers a little something to keep the wheels of illusion oiled. If you don\u2019t bother with the illusion, you get to keep everything. This worked seamlessly for O\u2019Leary and \u2013 bar a slight hiccup last year when particularly bad press and his hated pilots getting their unions recognised combined to affect share price \u2013 looks like it will go on working pretty well for the foreseeable future. Despite all this, Ryanair remains a \u20ac1bn business, flying 140 million people a year almost to their destinations, with the capacity to fly another 60 million if and when it wants to and enough sadomasochists decide that they do, too.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou put Viv anywhere around the goal and she will score,\u201d said the Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro after his star striker Vivianne Miedema had taken her goal tally to 25 for the season, her double strike either side of the break having given Arsenal victory over Manchester United and ensured safe passage to the Continental League Cup final. United did not make life easy for the home side. \u201cThey\u2019re a team that take a lot of risks, that press, that release players out of midfield,\u201d said Montemurro. \u201cBut they left a lot of gaps and we were finding them in the middle and able to expose them.\u201d Casey Stoney\u2019s Manchester United have won four of five games against Women\u2019s Super League opposition this season \u2013 the blip was against Reading in August. However, the trip to Borehamwood to play five-time league cup winners Arsenal offered a much bigger test of how they will fare should they be promoted to the top division. It was one in which Stoney felt they acquitted themselves well. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of them,\u201d she said. \u201cAt 2-0 down they could have collapsed or gone away but they didn\u2019t, they got stronger, they fought. We\u2019re seven months in, we\u2019ve got a very young team and we\u2019ve just gone and lost 2-1 to Arsenal. It was a great test for our players tonight.\u201d The Gunners took the opportunity to rest weary legs on Sunday at Crawley Wasps, relying on youngsters to secure their FA Cup fifth round berth, but Manchester United\u2019s weekend trip to Brighton gave no room to rotate. However, if anything the visitors started the brighter side. A Katie Zelem free-kick slipped towards Alex Greenwood but Arsenal bodies got in the way. Two minutes later Jess Sigsworth was through on the right only for Emma Mitchell and Louise Quinn to crowd her enough to force her to shoot across goal. It was a touch of individual class from Arsenal that broke the deadlock on 18 minutes, Dominique Bloodworth sliding a delightful ball through to Miedema, who slotted past Siobhan Chamberlain.

Playing furthest forward James was a little isolated, a mazy run across the edge of the box a glimpse of her talent before she was taken off in the second half. With heads unbowed Manchester United pushed for a leveller, but their drive forward left space at the back and on 50 minutes Beth Mead\u2019s cross from the left was cleared to the feet of Miedema, who again made no mistake, sweeping the ball past Chamberlain. From there Arsenal took control, a Mead header stinging the crossbar before being headed clear by Millie Turner. Then Bloodworth struck from 40 yards but her effort sailed narrowly over the bar.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United manager Casey Stoney speaks. We were disappointed with our first-half display. The players that came on made a difference, I have said to the players I am proud of them. Losing 2-1 is no discredit to them. I would live to have seen more [decisions] in our favour but I would say that; I am the manager...The step up is the intensity, their movement and the way they rotated. They will learn loads and they worked so hard...We are are where were, we want to get promoted and compete in the WSL. Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro speaks. It\u2019s a semi-final, we expected it to be difficult. It\u2019s about finding the way to control the game. We had to drag them out and break them down. We showed a little bit of inconsistency, but all credit to Manchester United\u2026the idea is to put Vivianne into positions she will put the ball away, she is so clinical...we are still on a growing curve, we are still a bit off. Some post-match words from Arsenal captain Kim Little and goalscorer Vivianne Miedema. Little: \u201cIn the second half we were disappointing, it can be like that in a cup game. We are through to the final which we are happy with. Miedema: \u201cWe created a lot of chances, even if we didn\u2019t play well. I am happy to score goals and be in the final.\u201d Little: \u201cIt\u2019s the same final as last year, we aim to win everything.\u201d Miedema: \u201cI don\u2019t care who scores the goals. We just want to win the title.\u201d As so often this season, Vivianne Miedema has been the difference between two teams who didn\u2019t look a division apart for too much of that game. Bramall Lane and Manchester City in the final await. 90+3 min: Arsenal look to be seeing this one out. United a little tired by now, and Van de Donk tries to keep the ball in the corner. One last chance for United? No, there will not be one of those? 2-1 to the Arsenal. 90+2 min: United going long for their goal, against Arsenal\u2019s big defenders, whose strength is keeping the Championship team at bay. Greenwood\u2019s cross is hopeful rather than expectant. 90 min: United fans roaring for an equaliser, as their team pushes up to chase down Arsenal\u2019s attempts to calm the game down. There will be three minutes of time added on. 88 min: Kim Little has been awarded the player of the match award; her quiet mastery of midfield is what gave Arsenal a grip for so long. 86 min: United now piling it on and Sigsworth, restored to the centre, takes a shot at goal that is a little disappointing in the circumstances. 85 min: By the way, the Barmy Army are back and singing. The Wetherspoons can wait. A real roar as Hanson forces a corner for United. Greenwood takes, and it is hacked clear by Arsenal. A shot from Hanson is deflected into the path of Molly Green. Her finish catches Van Veenendaal offguard. A lifeline, and Casey Stoney\u2019s change has her team back into the game. 82 min: On the sidelines, Casey Stoney is, well, stone-faced. Her team are underdogs here but they have been taught something of a lesson. Final United change: on comes Arnot for Galton. A final throw of the dice for what looks a tired team. 80 min: The crowd announced - 1832 - not bad at all. Far bigger than Alan Zelem used to play in front of. 78 min: The referee is wearing a coloured bib tonight. The reason for that is she won\u2019t clash with United\u2019s dark blue shirts. You don\u2019t get that from Mike Dean. 76 min: Arsenal change: on comes Veje for McCabe. Veje was rather impressive against Reading the other week. 74 min: Arsenal turning the screw, and United make another change. Off comes Harris for Toone, the former City player; she won\u2019t be playing against her old club in the final, it seems more than likely. 72 min: Beth Mead, who has been outstanding, forces a save from Chamberlain, who has kept well on a busier night than normal. 70 min: Woodwork! Van de Donk plays in Miedema, who crosses for Mead, whose header was goalward until it came off the head of Turner. She had little idea of how that was achieved. 69 min: Hanson, lively since she came on, cuts in from the right on to her left, but her shot\u2019s angles are all wrong and drift into the Hertfordshire twilight. 68 min: Hanson has moved to the right with Sigsworth pushed into the middle. And there is something of a penalty claim as the ball hits what looked like a hand. No luck for the visitors, though. 66 min: Arsenal\u2019s fans out-singing the United Barmy Army now. It\u2019s a long walk to the station from here, though the M1 is not far away. 65 min: Sub for United: Kirsty Hanson for Lauren James, who can be reunited now with that troublesome earring. 63 min: McCabe fouls Sigsworth, who is still full of running. Zelem\u2019s ball into the box is again disappointing. Shades of dad\u2019s goal-kicks there. 61 min: Like that first Arsenal goal from Miedama, it came at a time when United seemed capable of forcing something. Dalton, perhaps in frustration, takes out two as United\u2019s next attack breaks down, Mead and Van de Donk. Mead again gets down the left. Her cross is deflected into the path of the Dutch poacher, who calmly cuts into a position from which she finishes calmly. 59 min: Mead, who has always been open on the left, starts an attack. Mitchell, on the overlap as Mead pulls away defenders, puts in a cross that is hurriedly cleared. 57 min: Arsenal pressurising as United sit back on the edge of their area. Their game is being played on the break. 55 min: England manager Phil Neville is in the crowd; United fans were singing about him and sister Tracey before. Meanwhile, Arsenal\u2019s Williamson steps forward to shoot over. 53 min: The game going from one end to the other here. Neither side with much control of matters. Sigsworth makes a mazy run to the edge of the Arsenal box and is chipped towards James, only to be blocked. 51 min: An Arsenal corner is aimed at Quinn but misses as Dalton deflects it behind instead. The second corner is poor and makes its way to James on the break. Eventually, she gets a shot on goal. Like too many of United\u2019s efforts, it\u2019s from too far out. 49 min: Arsenal on the attack through Miedema down the left, and her pass comes into the centre, for Beth Mead to strike. Decent save from Chamberlain, but a reminder of the superior attacking class of the holders. 47 min: Early shot for United, as Lauren James cuts in from the left and booms one over the bar. Then Sigsworth down the right causes more problems with a couple of crosses that are hurriedly cleared. 46 min: Arsenal get it back underway, and it seems to be their turn to begin by pressing high up the pitch. Here come the teams again, with Arsenal slightly delayed in arriving. It is a little chilly out there. Vivianne Miedema\u2019s goal the difference, and it also changed the game. United had been the better team but it meant Arsenal could relax and the visitors lost a bit of confidence. By the end of the half, a gulf in class and experience was apparent. 45 min: Arsenal pushing for another before the break. McCabe and Van de Donk were queuing up but the eventual shot was straight at Chamberlain. United force a late corner through Lauren James. It is cleared, for the final action of the half. 44 min: Van de Donk launched one of those flying tackles you need to make or else face the consequences. She did make it, to sighs of Arsenal relief. 43 min: Zelem has to come across to make a superb defensive block when an Arsenal goal looked certain. Martha Harris does similar as Arsenal try to follow that second ball. It is cleared eventually by a grateful by goalkeeper Chamberlain. 41 min: Arsenal well in control without looking totally dominant. They haven\u2019t been able to play the ball from the back as they usually like, but still United have struggled to create anything like as much danger as they did in the opening minutes. 38 min: United do look tired now, and maybe little emotional. Miedema is hacked to the ground by Amy Turner, who went through the back. No yellow card, which seems odd. 37 min: Lauren James is back on - earring removed and put in the valuables box, no doubt. 36 min: United down to ten as Lauren James has been asked to leave the field to remove an earring. And she is struggling to do so. In the meantime, Turner\u2019s header from a corner is too near Van Veenendaal. 34 min: Re: the Barmy Army and the Gunners\u2019 fans, it sounds like a great atmosphere, better than many a lower league game, and Premier League for that matter. Louder than the Emirates on a Saturday 3pm, perhaps. 33 min: McCabe\u2019s free-kick was poor and United counter in numbers. Not quick enough, though, as Arsenal pile back. When Greenwood shoots, she has been pushed too far out to threaten. Her shot ends up amid the Barmy Army. 31 min: Turner and McCabe collide and the decision, awarded as a United foul and a yellow card to Millie Turner, was harsh. 29 min: Sigsworth, who has been quiet since the goal, gets the ball out to Harris whose cross is decent but claimed quite easily by Arsenal\u2019s keeper. 27 min: Arsenal have pushed forward from what was a deep block - sorry, Graeme Souness - in the early stages. The holders looking far more relaxed. 25 min: Another panic in the United box, and it takes a Miedema foul on Zelem to lift Arsenal\u2019s pressure. 24 min: To be fair to United\u2019s Barmy Army, their noise level continues to impress. That away end at Boreham Wood feels a long way away from the rest of the stadium. 21 min: The stuffing rather knocked out of United at the moment: they allow Bloodworth time to play another pass to Miedema. 19 min: A harsh lesson for United, who had been defending rather high and left space. Dominique Bloodworth\u2019s pass was superb, and let Miedema score her 11th goal in this competition alone. She has, let us not forget, already scored the most ever goals in a WSL season, after just 13 matches. A great move, a simple move, as Bloodworth\u2019s pass finds Miedema to slot home with a toe poke - a toe bung in Mancunian terms. Class showed there. 17 min: Some pushing n\u2019 shoving ahead of the corner. Sigsworth - from Greenwood\u2019s kick - climbs high to head wide. 16 min: Another United attack, this time Greenwood buzzing onwards. Great energy from the visitors against the title favourites. Then Sigsworth forces Mitchell into conceding a corner. 14 min: Close for United. Jess Sigsworth makes another run down the right flanks and fires in a shot just wide of the post. 13 min: More good hustling from United forces Molly Green into an error but Arsenal then manage to go forward so that Miedema can force a save from Chamberlain. 11 min: Good work in United\u2019s midfield, composed stuff, finds Sigsworth in a decent position on the flank, and another foul by Arsenal in a dangerous area. Greenwood takes the kick, no, Katie Zelem takes, with some venom, and Sigsworth rather got in the way of that. 9 min: A poor goal kick, too low, from United keeper Chamberlain actually results in a United attack but Van Veenendaal, the Gunners keeper, is alert to it. 7 min: United not overawed, it seems. Lauren James and Martha Harris working hard down the flank. James, the 17-year-old, looking to show up her old club. 5 min: United pressing up the pitch with Greenwood leading the charge, and Arsenal unable to settle. A foul on Sigsworth sets up a dead-ball chance. It\u2019s taken short to Turner, before Arsenal clear. 4 min: Close! McCabe drills one just over after linking up with Miedema. An early sighter. 2 min: A cagey start from the kick-off, though Arsenal have settled into a possession game. Greenwood, United\u2019s captain, is playing in midfield, and concedes an early foul. The sound from the Hertfordshire faithful is one of those songs that uses Earth, Wind and Fire\u2019s September, while the Barmy Army\u2019s \u201cManchester La La La\u201d can be heard loud and clear. And a bit of \u201cRed Army\u201d, too. The teams have taken to the field at Boreham Wood, home of Arsenal Women, representative teams and a No Deal Brexit. There may be a good reason behind this - perhaps they don\u2019t trust their followers to behave themselves - but seems odd that neither Arsenal nor Manchester United\u2019s official accounts are tweeting about this match. Gunnersaurus is there, anyway. Coaches Joe Montemurro and Casey Stoney have been talking. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it in our stride, we respect each team we play against,\u201d said Arsenal coach Montemurro. Stoney is fired up but realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s our biggest test, it\u2019s a test we want, Arsenal are up there as one of the best teams in Europe. We know it\u2019s a one-off game and we will try and have a go. They have the league\u2019s top goalscorer. Will we dominate the way we have been? We know we won\u2019t.\u201d Word on Katie Zelem, Manchester United\u2019s midfielder, who headed back to England after a spell at Juventus: I used to watch her father, Alan Zelem, play in goal for Macclesfield Town in the late-1980s. He was, as they say, a decent shot-stopper and a town hero, but my recollection is of him being quite small for a goalkeeper, not exactly great at goal-kicks and his rather high-pitched voice. A few of us at school used to attempt Alan Zelem impressions. Here\u2019s the aforementioned Barmy Army. Great story here from Suzanne Wrack. Unfortunately, this is the big story in the women\u2019s game today. Here\u2019s a reminder of what happened last night. Manchester United: Chamberlain, Harris, A. Turner, M. Turner, Smith, Greenwood (c), Zelem, Green, James, Galton, Sigsworth Subs: Ramsey, Roberts, Palmer, Devlin, Toone, Arnot, Hanson Arsenal: van Veenendaal; Arnth, Williamson, Quinn, Mitchell; Bloodworth, Little, Van de Donk; Mead, Miedema, McCabe Subs: Peyraud-Magnin, Veje, Kuyken, Grant, Filis, Hazard The final of this season\u2019s competition will either be a Manchester derby, or a rerun of last year\u2019s final, when Arsenal won the trophy for the fifth time when beating City. Only City, twice winners, and Arsenal have ever actually won this trophy, so a United win tonight presents the chance of a novelty. Manchester United may be the nascent moneybags team, but Arsenal, should they win their game in hand on leaders City, have the WSL within their grasp and have to be overriding favourites. United, even though they have a couple of games in hand on the rest of the chasers, are fourth in the Championship though they have lost just once season in the league and just once in the round-robin stages of this competition. Arsenal have a perfect record in in the \u2018Conti Cup\u2019, including a 9-0 walloping of Lewes. But how about the red-hot atmosphere that awaits Arsenal from away fans? \u201cCasey\u2019s at the wheel,\u201d sing United\u2019s Barmy Army, appropriating the Stone Roses song used for both Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and now Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, for Casey Stoney, coaching against the club she served for two years. And how about these anthems, as taken from United\u2019s official website? \u2018Ooh ah, Martha Harris, ooh ah, a little bit more; Ooh ah, Martha Harris, you\u2019re the one we\u2019re singing for.\u2019 \u2018Woooahhh, we got Leah Galton; woooahhh, super Leah Galton; woooahhh, she never gives the ball awayyy.\u2019 \u2018Gonna score, she\u2019s gonna score, Jess Sigsworth\u2019s gonna score; how she scores them I don\u2019t know, with her head or with her toe; all I know is Siggy\u2019s gonna score.\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s our Scots girl at the back, turns defence into attack; down the left or down the right, Kirsty Smith is dynamite.\u2019 \u2018Kirsty Kirsty Kirstyyyyy, Kirsty Hanson of MUFC; with a jink and a trick, she is skilful and quick; and she\u2019s Hanson of MUFC.\u2019",

Rapper 21 Savage arrested by US immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abraham-Joseph has lived in Atlanta since 2005, having arrived legally in the US at the age of seven. He is considered part of the city\u2019s rap royalty along with Young Thug, Future, Migos and 2 Chainz.</p> <p>But on the morning of Super Bowl Sunday last weekend, he was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents and threatened with deportation.</p> <p>According to Ice, Abraham-Joseph is a citizen of the UK who failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa.</p> <p>On Tuesday, he confirmed he had been born in Britain. </p> <p>Because he has lived in the US so long and has immediate relatives with legal status, he can seek to challenge the removal procedure via an immigration judge.</p> <h2>Why was he detained?</h2> <p>Ice claimed Abraham-Joseph carried a felony drug conviction from 2014, which is enough reason to place an undocumented person in Georgia under arrest and begin removal procedures.</p> <p>Abraham-Joseph\u2019s lawyer, Charles H Kuck, contradicted this in a statement to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SincerelyAde/status/1092528991502782465\">BuzzFeed News</a>. He said that the arrest is \u201cbased upon incorrect information about prior criminal charges\u201d. Kuck maintains that the arrest serves no other purpose than to unnecessarily punish and intimidate Abraham-Joseph.

      "bodyText": "Rapper 21 Savage was due to attend the Grammy awards ceremony on Sunday. He has been nominated for two awards including Record of the Year for his Post Malone collaboration, Rockstar. It was expected to be the crowning moment of a momentous year for the rapper, in which his second album, I Am &gt; I Was, debuted at No 1. But instead of being fitted for suits, the rapper, whose given name is She\u2019yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, is currently in custody in the US. His manager, Stone Mound Meezy, says the he is being held on \u201clockdown\u201d 23 hours a day with no television and minimal outside contact. It seems unlikely he will be able to attend the ceremony. Abraham-Joseph has lived in Atlanta since 2005, having arrived legally in the US at the age of seven. He is considered part of the city\u2019s rap royalty along with Young Thug, Future, Migos and 2 Chainz. But on the morning of Super Bowl Sunday last weekend, he was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents and threatened with deportation. According to Ice, Abraham-Joseph is a citizen of the UK who failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa. On Tuesday, he confirmed he had been born in Britain. Because he has lived in the US so long and has immediate relatives with legal status, he can seek to challenge the removal procedure via an immigration judge. Why was he detained? Ice claimed Abraham-Joseph carried a felony drug conviction from 2014, which is enough reason to place an undocumented person in Georgia under arrest and begin removal procedures. Abraham-Joseph\u2019s lawyer, Charles H Kuck, contradicted this in a statement to BuzzFeed News. He said that the arrest is \u201cbased upon incorrect information about prior criminal charges\u201d. Kuck maintains that the arrest serves no other purpose than to unnecessarily punish and intimidate Abraham-Joseph. Ice did not respond to requests for comment. The legal ins and outs of his case are complicated and it is still unclear what rights he may have. Matt Cameron, an immigration lawyer in Massachusetts who has been following the case closely said he is concerned about the timing of the arrest, which came after Abraham-Joseph performed a new song on Jimmy Kimmel in which he criticizes the Trump administration\u2019s child separation policy. \u201c[Ice] makes the decisions of how and when they pick people up,\u201d Cameron said. Amy Gottlieb, associate regional director of the American Friends Service Committee and the wife Ravi Ragbir, has also questioned the timing of the arrest. \u201cThere is evidence that Ice has retaliated against some immigrants who have been outspoken about government policy, including Ravi \u2026 it would lead me to seriously question the motivation of [Abraham-Joseph\u2019s] arrest.\u201d What happens next? If Abraham-Joseph does have a prior felony charge, as Ice claims, the chances that he would be able to remain in the US are slim. US immigration and criminal law interweave creating a complex legal landscape. \u201cA drug conviction can obliterate the ability of a person to stay in the US,\u201d said Benita Jain, a supervising attorney of Immigrant Defense Project. Kuck has argued that Abraham-Joseph\u2019s undocumented status is, like that of Dreamers, a product of his family\u2019s choices. \u201cAs a minor, his family overstayed their work visa, and he, like almost 2 million other children, was left without legal status through no fault of his own,\u201d Kuck\u2019s statement says. \u201cIce has not charged Mr Abraham-Joseph with any crime \u2026 This is a civil law violation, and the continued detention of Mr Abraham-Joseph serves no other purpose than to unnecessarily punish him and try to intimidate him into giving up his right to fight to remain in the United States.\u201d In 2017, he filed for a special nonimmigrant U Visa which is set aside for victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and cooperated with police investigations while living in the US. His application may be related to when he was shot six times on his 21st birthday in 2013. If, as his lawyer says, he does not have a felony charge on his record, or if he had a charge that has been sealed and vacated, then he may be allowed to remain in the US while his visa application is processed. However, it may take a decade to come through, as United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) can only accept a maximum of 10,000 U Visa applications per year and it has a huge backlog. As of 2017, it had more than 190,000 cases pending. There are about 4.2 million black immigrants in the US and 619,000 are undocumented. Black Lives Matter is filing an online petition to free 21 Savage, with over 330,000 signatures so far. Fans have reacted with surprise to the news of his potential deportation \u2013 and an inevitable torrent of memes about Savage\u2019s British identity.

      "body": "<p>Facebook banned four ethnic armed Myanmar-based groups from its site this week, in its latest effort to reckon with its role in the violence in that nation. But the tech giant\u2019s decision is drawing criticism from local civil society and human rights groups who warn that the move appears ill-considered and inconsistent with international law. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Facebook announced in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/02/dangerous-organizations-in-myanmar/\">blogpost</a> that it had designated four separatist groups \u2013 the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Kachin Independence Army and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army \u2013 as \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d.</p> <p>That designation, which Facebook applies to \u201corganizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence\u201d \u2013 ie terrorist groups and criminal cartels \u2013 brings with it not just a ban on the group itself, but a ban on \u201call related praise, support and representation\u201d of the groups, according to the company\u2019s rules.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clear evidence that these organizations have been responsible for attacks against civilians and have engaged in violence in Myanmar, and we want to prevent them from using our services to further inflame tensions on the ground,\u201d Facebook said in explaining the bans. \u201cIn an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or engage in violence to have a presence on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook has faced significant pressure to be more proactive in Myanmar, after it failed to take action against hate speech and incitement amid a peak in violence against the Rohingya minority that began in 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/20/facebook-rohingya-muslims-myanmar\">Facebook bans Rohingya group's posts as minority faces 'ethnic cleansing'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the action on the four ethnic armies this week has raised more questions about the way the company plans to handle the spread of hate on its platform than it answered.</p> <p>\u201cHow was the decision made? What was the process? And who oversees these kind of decisions?\u201d asked Myat Thu, a research advisor for the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a civil society group in Yangon. \u201cThis is a perfect example of why Facebook should have Myanmar [Burmese] speaking staff. A blogpost in English does not constitute adequate information.\u201d</p> <h2>A catastrophic track record in Myanmar</h2> <p>For Facebook, Myanmar has represented extreme success \u2013 and catastrophic failure. Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis\">dominates</a> the country, with 20 million users in a country of 53 million, and for most people in Myanmar, Facebook simply is the internet.</p> <p>But the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/06/facebook-admits-it-has-not-done-enough-to-quell-hate-in-myanmar\">failed to take timely action</a> when its platform was used by Buddhist extremists to inflame hatred and violence against the Rohingya minority in 2017. Even as the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, was carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, Facebook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/20/facebook-rohingya-muslims-myanmar\">designated a Rohingya insurgent group</a>, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, as a dangerous organization, while taking no action against the Tatmadaw.</p> <p>It took until August 2018 \u2013 a year after 25,000 Rohingya were killed by Myanmar\u2019s army and allied Buddhist militias and 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee the country \u2013 for Facebook to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/27/facebook-removes-accounts-myanmar-military-un-report-genocide-rohingya\">ban Tatmadaw leaders</a> from its platform. Facing growing public pressure, the company also commissioned and published an independent <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/\">Human Rights Impact Assessment</a> on the role its services were playing in the country and committed to hiring 100 native Burmese speakers as content moderators.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s moves signaled further action against violent actors using Facebook in Myanmar, the platform said in its announcement. But Facebook\u2019s action on the four ethnic armed organizations was \u201cfrenetic\u201d and a result of \u201coverreacting to their past failure\u201d, Ko Maw Htun Aung, the founder of a Yangon-based social policy thinktank, told <a href=\"https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/facebook-bans-dangerous-armed-groups-myanmar-platform.html\">The Irrawaddy</a>, a local media outlet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/06/facebook-admits-it-has-not-done-enough-to-quell-hate-in-myanmar\">Facebook admits failings over incitement to violence in Myanmar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And its consequences may be severe, human rights observers warn. There are more than a dozen recognized ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, many of which have been engaged in armed struggle against the military for ethnic or national self determination for decades.</p> <p>By deeming these four armies as \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d, Facebook was \u201ctipping the scales\u201d toward the military and providing \u201ca big boost for the government\u201d, one human rights observer told the Guardian.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s policy could have a disparate impact on free expression for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities because the armed forces and government control state media, while minority groups relied on Facebook to distribute their messages, echoed Nay San Lwin, campaign coordinator for the Free Rohingya Coalition.</p> <p>\u201cAs Facebook said no one can praise, support or represent these four groups, the same things should apply for Tatmadaw too,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Myat Thu from the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network raised concerns that the bans will \u201ccreate a vacuum that, if not managed with care, could fuel disinformation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook is removing pages that have long been recognized as the official presence for these groups and gained legitimacy as such,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to create a lot of confusion for journalists and political analysts here, who have relied on these pages for information.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/12/facebook-among-firms-named-on-myanmar-human-rights-dirty-list\">Facebook among firms named on Myanmar human rights 'dirty list'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To many of these observers, Facebook\u2019s decision was especially baffling since it seemed to run counter to the recommendations of the Human Rights Impact Assessment it had commissioned itself.</p> <p>That report recommended that the company \u201calign Facebook\u2019s definition of a terrorist organization with international standards\u201d by \u201cexclud[ing] organizations considered to be legitimate combatants in conflict, such as officially recognized ethnic armed organizations (EAOs)\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis recommendation is particularly relevant in a context like Myanmar, where there is a history of toxic nationalism and state-mandated violent oppression of ethnic groups, as well as the presence of multiple legitimate secession movements,\u201d the report stated.

      "bodyText": "Facebook banned four ethnic armed Myanmar-based groups from its site this week, in its latest effort to reckon with its role in the violence in that nation. But the tech giant\u2019s decision is drawing criticism from local civil society and human rights groups who warn that the move appears ill-considered and inconsistent with international law. On Tuesday, Facebook announced in a blogpost that it had designated four separatist groups \u2013 the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Kachin Independence Army and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army \u2013 as \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d. That designation, which Facebook applies to \u201corganizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence\u201d \u2013 ie terrorist groups and criminal cartels \u2013 brings with it not just a ban on the group itself, but a ban on \u201call related praise, support and representation\u201d of the groups, according to the company\u2019s rules. \u201cThere is clear evidence that these organizations have been responsible for attacks against civilians and have engaged in violence in Myanmar, and we want to prevent them from using our services to further inflame tensions on the ground,\u201d Facebook said in explaining the bans. \u201cIn an effort to prevent and disrupt offline harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or engage in violence to have a presence on Facebook.\u201d Facebook has faced significant pressure to be more proactive in Myanmar, after it failed to take action against hate speech and incitement amid a peak in violence against the Rohingya minority that began in 2017. But the action on the four ethnic armies this week has raised more questions about the way the company plans to handle the spread of hate on its platform than it answered. \u201cHow was the decision made? What was the process? And who oversees these kind of decisions?\u201d asked Myat Thu, a research advisor for the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a civil society group in Yangon. \u201cThis is a perfect example of why Facebook should have Myanmar [Burmese] speaking staff. A blogpost in English does not constitute adequate information.\u201d A catastrophic track record in Myanmar For Facebook, Myanmar has represented extreme success \u2013 and catastrophic failure. Facebook dominates the country, with 20 million users in a country of 53 million, and for most people in Myanmar, Facebook simply is the internet. But the company failed to take timely action when its platform was used by Buddhist extremists to inflame hatred and violence against the Rohingya minority in 2017. Even as the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, was carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya, Facebook designated a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, as a dangerous organization, while taking no action against the Tatmadaw. It took until August 2018 \u2013 a year after 25,000 Rohingya were killed by Myanmar\u2019s army and allied Buddhist militias and 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee the country \u2013 for Facebook to ban Tatmadaw leaders from its platform. Facing growing public pressure, the company also commissioned and published an independent Human Rights Impact Assessment on the role its services were playing in the country and committed to hiring 100 native Burmese speakers as content moderators. Tuesday\u2019s moves signaled further action against violent actors using Facebook in Myanmar, the platform said in its announcement. But Facebook\u2019s action on the four ethnic armed organizations was \u201cfrenetic\u201d and a result of \u201coverreacting to their past failure\u201d, Ko Maw Htun Aung, the founder of a Yangon-based social policy thinktank, told The Irrawaddy, a local media outlet. And its consequences may be severe, human rights observers warn. There are more than a dozen recognized ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, many of which have been engaged in armed struggle against the military for ethnic or national self determination for decades. By deeming these four armies as \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d, Facebook was \u201ctipping the scales\u201d toward the military and providing \u201ca big boost for the government\u201d, one human rights observer told the Guardian. Facebook\u2019s policy could have a disparate impact on free expression for Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities because the armed forces and government control state media, while minority groups relied on Facebook to distribute their messages, echoed Nay San Lwin, campaign coordinator for the Free Rohingya Coalition. \u201cAs Facebook said no one can praise, support or represent these four groups, the same things should apply for Tatmadaw too,\u201d he said. Myat Thu from the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network raised concerns that the bans will \u201ccreate a vacuum that, if not managed with care, could fuel disinformation\u201d. \u201cFacebook is removing pages that have long been recognized as the official presence for these groups and gained legitimacy as such,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to create a lot of confusion for journalists and political analysts here, who have relied on these pages for information.\u201d To many of these observers, Facebook\u2019s decision was especially baffling since it seemed to run counter to the recommendations of the Human Rights Impact Assessment it had commissioned itself. That report recommended that the company \u201calign Facebook\u2019s definition of a terrorist organization with international standards\u201d by \u201cexclud[ing] organizations considered to be legitimate combatants in conflict, such as officially recognized ethnic armed organizations (EAOs)\u201d. \u201cThis recommendation is particularly relevant in a context like Myanmar, where there is a history of toxic nationalism and state-mandated violent oppression of ethnic groups, as well as the presence of multiple legitimate secession movements,\u201d the report stated. By bringing its treatment of these combatants in line with international law, the report said, Facebook can reduce its risk of violating the freedom of expression of ethnic minorities. Facebook declined to comment on the record to numerous queries from the Guardian, but noted that there is no universally accepted definition of terrorism. State vs non-state actors Facebook\u2019s quandary in Myanmar also raises profound questions about the ways the platform chooses to regulate \u2013 and declines to regulate \u2013 violent actors using its platform. There is no real dispute that Myanmar\u2019s military has committed violent atrocities in Myanmar, but though Facebook has punished leaders of the military, it has not designated it a \u201cdangerous organization\u201d that cannot be praised or supported. \u201cThe company\u2019s statement says groups with a violent mission are banned,\u201d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a Southeast Asian human rights organization. \u201cDoes that mean all armies would be banned? Or just non-state armies? There are dozens of non-state armed groups in Myanmar. Is the company planning to ban all of them? The company didn\u2019t tell us exactly why these four groups were targeted while dozens of others were not.\u201d These questions have resonance far beyond Myanmar. Had Facebook existed during the Rwandan genocide, one human rights observer asked, would it have allowed the government-backed Hutu genocidaires to use its platform while banning the rebel Tutsi forces that fought back? Facebook declined to clarify its thinking on state and non-state \u201cdangerous organizations\u201d on the record, but a spokeswoman acknowledged that they focus on non-state actors. Facebook also did not respond to questions about whether the four banned groups had engaged in hate speech or used Facebook\u2019s platform to incite violence, stating only that the decision was made because of a recent increase in violence. Smith said that Facebook\u2019s decision to allow support for Myanmar\u2019s armed forces but not the banned ethnic armies seemed \u201carbitrary\u201d, and questioned why Facebook was not choosing to model its policy on international law. \u201cAt least with regard to international crimes, such as attacks on civilians in situations of armed conflict, there is useful law and jurisprudence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not use it? Why reinvent the wheel? \u2026 If not international human rights and humanitarian law, we would encourage the company to release more information about the framework they\u2019re relying on.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Neglect at a care home that had descended into \u201cchaos\u201d amid cost-cutting contributed to the death of Sophie Bennett, a mentally ill 19-year old, an inquest jury has ruled.</p> <p>The former county-level swimmer, described by her family as \u201cbright, loving and caring\u201d, killed herself at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, south-west London, in May 2016. Her death followed upheaval instigated by the operating charity, Richmond Psychosocial Foundation International (RPFI), which was advised by the internationally renowned mental health worker Elly Jansen.</p> <p>Cancelled therapy sessions, the removal of key staff who were then replaced by unqualified people and the introduction of a \u201cboot camp\u201d regime all contributed to Bennett\u2019s death, the jury at West London coroner\u2019s court found.</p> <p>In the months preceding her death, the charity had changed the home\u2019s resident profile from people with complex mental health needs to those with learning disabilities. The move allowed it to use lower-paid workers. New staff were not qualified in mental health and some agency workers had no experience.</p> <p>Bennett had complex needs involving bipolar affective disorder, social anxiety disorder and atypical autism, and the jury ruled that cost-cutting possibly contributed to her death. At the end of 2015, the charity commissioned an audit that was presented to Jansen, who was interested in the unit\u2019s ability to maintain itself financially, the inquest heard.</p> <p>The jury found that Jansen, the charity\u2019s founder, gave advice about the running of the facility without meeting or having any knowledge of the residents. It found the leadership and oversight of the charity\u2019s board was \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>Jansen was not on the board that ran the home but owned the building. John Taylor, the coroner, told the jury at West London coroner\u2019s court she was \u201cmore or less top of the pyramid of RPFI\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe entire structure and stability of Lancaster Lodge was gone,\u201d the coroner said. \u201cThere was a general deterioration, psychologically and emotionally \u2026 The support structures had broken down ... Lancaster Lodge became like a 1950s asylum: authoritarian, with management control \u2026 it became the complete opposite of a therapeutic community, with no safe space.\u201d</p> <p>He said there were \u201cerrors and omissions\u201d in the way the facility was run in the days leading up to Bennett\u2019s death, and steps taken to minimise access to items she could use to harm herself and the observation regime were \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found standards to be \u201cgood\u201d in 2014 and 2015. But when Wynne Price-Rees, an experienced inspector, was sent to Lancaster Lodge in 2016, he said: \u201cI had never seen anything else like it.\u201d</p> <p>A new \u201cclinical lead\u201d, Duncan Lawrence, transformed the regime into \u201ca dictatorship \u2013 with 19th-century governance\u201d, the inquest heard. Lawrence had a non-medical doctorate, which might have been bought from Knightsbridge University in Denmark, a \u201cdegree mill\u201d, the jury were told.</p> <p>The Care Quality Commission classed the home as inadequate and detailed a lack of person-centred care and insufficiently trained and qualified staff. One staff member, Joanne Chambers, told the jury that by February 2016 the home was \u201cclinically negligent\u201d and \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d.</p> <p>In late April it was proposed that Bennett be moved to another facility, which made her anxious that she had done something wrong. She self-harmed and told staff she had had suicidal thoughts. Advisers on a crisis phone line advised staff that she be taken directly to hospital but she was not.</p> <p> Bennett was placed on 10-minute watch and her room was searched for items she could use to hurt herself. Only a small blade was found. Some of the staff said they did not think the watch applied when she was in the bathroom, which is where she was found unconscious behind a locked door.</p> <p>In a statement Bennett\u2019s family \u2013 her mother, Nickie, her father, Ben and her three siblings \u2013 thanked the jury and said: \u201cWe await eagerly to see whether the CQC is to pursue a criminal prosecution, which we believe it should. We also want to see action by the Charity Commission.</p> <p>\u201cThe Charity Commission has been conspicuous by its absence from this inquest despite our urging it to attend and hear the evidence. It has known about the issues surrounding the governance of RPFI since well before Sophie\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the UK Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "Neglect at a care home that had descended into \u201cchaos\u201d amid cost-cutting contributed to the death of Sophie Bennett, a mentally ill 19-year old, an inquest jury has ruled. The former county-level swimmer, described by her family as \u201cbright, loving and caring\u201d, killed herself at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, south-west London, in May 2016. Her death followed upheaval instigated by the operating charity, Richmond Psychosocial Foundation International (RPFI), which was advised by the internationally renowned mental health worker Elly Jansen. Cancelled therapy sessions, the removal of key staff who were then replaced by unqualified people and the introduction of a \u201cboot camp\u201d regime all contributed to Bennett\u2019s death, the jury at West London coroner\u2019s court found. In the months preceding her death, the charity had changed the home\u2019s resident profile from people with complex mental health needs to those with learning disabilities. The move allowed it to use lower-paid workers. New staff were not qualified in mental health and some agency workers had no experience. Bennett had complex needs involving bipolar affective disorder, social anxiety disorder and atypical autism, and the jury ruled that cost-cutting possibly contributed to her death. At the end of 2015, the charity commissioned an audit that was presented to Jansen, who was interested in the unit\u2019s ability to maintain itself financially, the inquest heard. The jury found that Jansen, the charity\u2019s founder, gave advice about the running of the facility without meeting or having any knowledge of the residents. It found the leadership and oversight of the charity\u2019s board was \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d. Jansen was not on the board that ran the home but owned the building. John Taylor, the coroner, told the jury at West London coroner\u2019s court she was \u201cmore or less top of the pyramid of RPFI\u201d. \u201cThe entire structure and stability of Lancaster Lodge was gone,\u201d the coroner said. \u201cThere was a general deterioration, psychologically and emotionally \u2026 The support structures had broken down ... Lancaster Lodge became like a 1950s asylum: authoritarian, with management control \u2026 it became the complete opposite of a therapeutic community, with no safe space.\u201d He said there were \u201cerrors and omissions\u201d in the way the facility was run in the days leading up to Bennett\u2019s death, and steps taken to minimise access to items she could use to harm herself and the observation regime were \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found standards to be \u201cgood\u201d in 2014 and 2015. But when Wynne Price-Rees, an experienced inspector, was sent to Lancaster Lodge in 2016, he said: \u201cI had never seen anything else like it.\u201d A new \u201cclinical lead\u201d, Duncan Lawrence, transformed the regime into \u201ca dictatorship \u2013 with 19th-century governance\u201d, the inquest heard. Lawrence had a non-medical doctorate, which might have been bought from Knightsbridge University in Denmark, a \u201cdegree mill\u201d, the jury were told. The Care Quality Commission classed the home as inadequate and detailed a lack of person-centred care and insufficiently trained and qualified staff. One staff member, Joanne Chambers, told the jury that by February 2016 the home was \u201cclinically negligent\u201d and \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d. In late April it was proposed that Bennett be moved to another facility, which made her anxious that she had done something wrong. She self-harmed and told staff she had had suicidal thoughts. Advisers on a crisis phone line advised staff that she be taken directly to hospital but she was not. Bennett was placed on 10-minute watch and her room was searched for items she could use to hurt herself. Only a small blade was found. Some of the staff said they did not think the watch applied when she was in the bathroom, which is where she was found unconscious behind a locked door. In a statement Bennett\u2019s family \u2013 her mother, Nickie, her father, Ben and her three siblings \u2013 thanked the jury and said: \u201cWe await eagerly to see whether the CQC is to pursue a criminal prosecution, which we believe it should. We also want to see action by the Charity Commission. \u201cThe Charity Commission has been conspicuous by its absence from this inquest despite our urging it to attend and hear the evidence. It has known about the issues surrounding the governance of RPFI since well before Sophie\u2019s death.\u201d In the UK Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit negotiations are being pushed to the brink by Theresa May and the EU, with any last-minute offer by Brussels on the Irish backstop expected to be put to MPs just days before the UK is due to leave. In strained talks on Thursday, during which Donald Tusk suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan could help resolve the Brexit crisis, Theresa May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed to hold the next face-to-face talks by the end of February. That move cuts deep into the remaining time, piling pressure on the British parliament to then accept what emerges or face a no-deal scenario. It is understood that EU officials are looking at offering May a detailed plan of what a potential technological solution to the Irish border might look like, which could be included in the legally non-binding political declaration on the future trade deal. The blueprint would pinpoint the problem areas and commit to breaching the technical gaps where possible to offer an alternative to the customs union envisaged in the withdrawal agreement\u2019s Irish backstop. But officials believe it is increasingly likely that any renegotiated deal will only be put to the Commons at the end of March, necessitating even then an extension of the article 50 negotiating period to get legislation through parliament. On Thursday the German finance commissioner, G\u00fcnther Hermann Oettinger, suggested the chance of a no-deal Brexit was now as high as 60%. \u201cIf the British side asks for an extension of two or three months and there are reasons for that, I think there\u2019s a good chance that the member states would accept that unanimously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the eight or 12 weeks there needs to be the possibility of achieving progress and that there must be a withdrawal agreement at the end of that.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s failure during her meetings in Brussels with EU leaders on Thursday to go beyond her previous suggestions of a time limit and unilateral exit mechanism on the Irish backstop has confirmed fears that the deal\u2019s ratification will go to the wire. An EU official said it was remarkable that May had not offered \u201cany new concrete proposals\u201d during her 45-minute meeting with Tusk, the European council president, which was described as \u201cOK\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d.

However, it is understood No 10 warned Brussels that the furious reaction of some Labour MP to Corbyn\u2019s letter meant there was uncertainty over the extent of Commons support.

A joint statement from Downing Street and the European commission announced new talks on the speed with which the two sides would seek to complete post-Brexit talks on a future trade deal. May\u2019s critics have voiced fears that slow progress on those trade negotiations would leave Britain trapped in the Irish backstop, under which the UK would stay in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The joint statement said: \u201cPresident Juncker \u2026 expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK.\u201d EU leaders will hold a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh on 24 February.

In the footage, recorded in a home area of the ground, someone is heard shouting \u201cSalah, you fucking Muslim, fucking Muslim cunt\u201d. According to West Ham sources, the club believe they have identified the person responsible for the alleged abuse. \u201cAfter a thorough and immediate investigation following the abhorrent racist abuse aimed at Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah on Monday night, West Ham United can confirm that it has handed evidence to the Metropolitan Police,\u201d the club said. \u201cThe club is unequivocal in its stance \u2013 such abuse will not be tolerated. There is no place or excuse for this kind of behaviour.\u201d Number of incidents \u2018alarming\u2019, says Fare Network director Piara Powar, the executive director of anti-discrimination charity Fare Network, has said the number of recent incidents of reported racism is \u201calarming\u201d, and added that closing stadiums may be the logical next step in combating abuse. The incident during West Ham\u2019s home game with Liverpool, which led Hammers manager Manuel Pellegrini to demand a life ban for the culprits, follows allegations of discriminatory chanting by Chelsea and Millwall supporters in recent months. \u201cThe number and frequency of recent incidents in England is quite alarming,\u201d Powar said. \u201cFootball seems to have a rump of fans who have trouble accepting the diversity of our country. I also think it points to the divisions that have opened up in the UK since Brexit. \u201cI think the FA must get a grip on the problem,\u201d Powar added. \u201cThey do a lot of good work but they should use the powers they have to close stadiums and ban and fine clubs. The FA regulations allow for it but these measures are rarely used.\u201d PA",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our Larry Elliott on the Bank\u2019s forecasts: The Bank of England has warned the economy is on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis, as evidence suggests Brexit jitters are spreading from companies to consumers. In its latest quarterly health check, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2019 from 1.7% to 1.2%, blaming a slowing global economy as well as Brexit uncertainty for the sharp downward revision, and said there was a 25% chance of a recession this year. Threadneedle Street said its gloomier forecast assumed the UK\u2019s departure from the EU in seven weeks goes smoothly. If the prediction comes true, it would be the slowest growth since the economy contracted by 4.2% in 2009, during the financial crisis. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said: \u201cThe fog of Brexit is causing short-term volatility in the economic data and, more fundamentally, it\u2019s creating a series of tensions.\u201d More here: Goodnight! GW In a stark example of what Brexit fog looks like, UK exporters preparing to send goods to the other side of the world RIGHT NOW run the risk of bring locked out. Business leaders have told us that a ship departing a British port for, say, the Antipodies could arrive to find Britain has crashed out of the EU without a deal - leaving them unable to unload their cargo due to tariff confusion. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The Confederation of British Industry, the EEF manufacturers\u2019 lobby group and trade experts said exporters could be dispatching goods from UK ports imminently which would not arrive until after the 29 March deadline \u2013 raising the prospect of goods being stuck in ports or facing hefty additional costs in the event of a disorderly Brexit. The maximum shipping time to anywhere in the world is about 50 days \u2013 with the furthest being Australia and New Zealand \u2013 meaning cargoes sent from this weekend could face disruption when they arrive around the 29 March deadline. More here: The Bank of England\u2019s gloomy outlook has added to market anxiety over the health of the global economy. Most European stock markets are deep in the red this afternoon, as fear shoves greed out of the way. Weak factory data from Germany and Spain this morning, and growth downgrades from the EC, have raised fears that growth is faltering...and central banks may not be able to stop it. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The Bank of England \u2013 keen to hammer home the cost of the UK\u2019s Brexit uncertainty \u2013 added to the dour tone set off by the European Commission earlier in the session. Hours after the EC put the UK\u2019s 2019 growth at 1.3%, the Bank of England painted an even more depressing picture, cutting its own forecasts to just 1.2%. Mark Carney made clear, however, that the \u2018fog\u2019 of uncertainty currently cloaking the country\u2019s economy means growth, and inflation, could easily be much higher or lower than that estimate dependant on what happens after March 29th. There was also the warning that a no-deal Brexit would greatly increase the chance of a recession; nothing particularly new, then, but nevertheless a sharp reminder of what is at stake. Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, suspects the Bank of England could raise interest rates twice this year -- IF Britain secures a soft Brexit. \u201cWith inflationary challenges still present, the Bank of England has reoriented its focus toward growth challenges as concerns build over the threat of a global economic slowdown. In a similar fashion to China and the US, UK policymakers are tacking to a more accommodating stance, communicating additional patience on the delivery of future interest rate hikes. Of course, Brexit remains the elephant in the room and, should an orderly outcome transpire, we would expect the Bank to flip back to a marginally more hawkish bias \u2013 perhaps delivering as many as two interest rate hikes before year end.\u201d Not for the faint-hearted.... Several experts are concerned that the BoE has slashed its 2019 growth forecast to a measly 1.2%. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says it shows the risk of leaving the EU without a deal: \u201cThe Bank of England downgrading it\u2019s 2019 growth forecast shows that people are increasingly worried about this Government\u2019s stewardship of the economy. \u201cThe Government must be stronger in averting a no-deal Brexit, and act now to protect the economy.\u201d Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, fears the economy is already \u201cseizing up\u201d from uncertainty: The Bank\u2019s forecasts, when put together with recent business surveys, illustrate the harmful impact on the economy the longer that this goes on. Brexit uncertainty has kept interest rates on hold this month, and the near-term outlook for the UK economy is also weaker. However, in the event of a smooth Brexit, the Bank expect a lift to economic growth and business investment further ahead, as greater clarity unlocks pent-up demand.\u201d James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, has warned that such weak growth would hurt living standards across the UK. \u201cThe Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country. \u201cToday\u2019s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag. Everyone should be focused on the action that sits within the hands of UK policy makers to deliver stronger growth than the frankly awful forecasts published today by the Bank. The broad message from Mark Carney today is that growth has weakened since the last Inflation Report three months ago, Brexit fog is clouding the economy, and the risk of a no-deal Brexit has intensified. On growth, the BoE now expects UK GDP to only rise by 1.2% this year, down from 1.7%. That would be the weakest growth since 2009, when Britain was reeling from the financial crisis. Most of the damage will be done in the first half of 2019. If Britain secures a soft Brexit, growth could then pick up - perhaps faster than the Bank expects. Governor Carney warned: The fog of Brexit is causing short term volatility in the economic data, and more fundamentally, it is creating a series of tensions in the economy, tensions for business.\u201d On the upside, the economy still looks to be in OK shape: The fundamentals of the UK economy are sound. The financial sector is resilient. Corporate balance sheets are strong, and the labour market is tight.\u201d But the downside is that leaving the EU without a deal would hurt the economy - and Mark Carney believes it\u2019s more likely than before. He warned that a No-Deal would raise the chances of \u201cnegative quarters\u201d of growth. Two or more negative quarters would be a recession. He also warned that half of UK firms simply aren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit, saying: \u201cAlthough many companies are stepping up their contingency planning, the economy as a whole is still not yet prepared for a no-deal, no transition exit. In terms of our agent surveys, most recent surveys, of businesses and their preparedness, half of them say they are not ready. And the half that say they are ready... ready means \u2018we\u2019ve done all we can\u2019. Carney also criticised European Council chief Donald Tusk, over his claim that a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d awaits the leaders of the Brexit campaign. Carney said he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the comments (which have created quite a biblical storm in the UK), and quoted from the Gospel of Matthew: If one wants to be theological, \u201cDo not judge because you too will be judged.\u201d And asked whether he woke up every morning, regretting extending his tenure as BoE governor to help with Brexit, Carney ruefully revealed that the crisis has been interfering with his beauty sleep: \u201cI don\u2019t wake up in the morning any more....I wake up in the middle of the night. \u201cNo, the reason I extended was to remain here during a period that could be slightly more volatile or could involve a slightly more difficult transition ..., so obviously I don\u2019t regret it all.\u201d [Thanks to Thomson Reuters for the quotes] I think we can all sympathise with Mark Carney\u2019s disrupted sleep.... Q: Isn\u2019t there a danger that Brexit uncertainty will persist for longer than you expect, hurting the economy, especially as you think it will take four years to agree a UK-EU trade deal? Some uncertainty will linger around, yes, Mark Carney replies. But it would be \u201csubstantially less\u201d if the UK leaves with a withdrawal agreement. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Reaction to follow..... Q: Have you considered copying the Federal Reserve, and holding press conference more frequently? Carney says the Bank has already been making changes to communicate better with households. And as Brexit is such a big issue, the people responsible with handling Brexit should be the ones front and centre right now. Q: Are you worried about disruption at Barclays, where activity investor Ed Bramson is trying to shake up the bank and get a seat on the board. Carney says its important to maintain responsible banking and safe lending standards, and they won\u2019t be compromised for anyone. Q: When you arrived as governor, you intended to leave by last summer. We\u2019re all absolutely delighted that you stayed on longer, but do you ever wake up in the morning and wish you\u2019d stuck to plan A, asks my colleague Larry Elliott mischievously. Fighting off a fit of the giggles, Carney replies that he doesn\u2019t wake up in the morning any more, he wakes up in the middle of the night. But obviously he doesn\u2019t regret agreeing to extend his stint at the BoE, and it\u2019s a privilege to do the job, he replies sincerely (I think!). The rebalancing of the UK economy has paused, Carney warns. Consumption is providing the bulk of the growth again as business investment takes a Brexit hit. Q: Back to Brexit.. is no-deal more likely, and do you think the departure date could be extended? Yes, Mark Carney replies, the probability of a no-deal Brexit has gone up. There are seven weeks until the Brexit data, and there still are a lot of possibilities. He says some senior cabinet ministers have speculated about delaying Brexit beyond 29 March, and that some parliamentary experts have speculated that there isn\u2019t enough time to get all the legislation through. But Carney adds that Theresa May has been adamant that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. Q: Your new forecasts only project one interest rate hike over the forecast horizon. So, given the weak growth outlook, should we prepare for an interest rate cut? No, Mark Carney insists. The message is that people shouldn\u2019t expect a sharp move in interest rates. Q: You\u2019ve just delivered the worst growth forecasts in a decade - how is that manifesting itself, and how would a no-deal Brexit make it worse? Governor Carney reiterates that the Bank\u2019s central view is that in a form of soft Brexit, the economy will pick up, firms will hire and invest, wages will rise, inflation will rise too, and \u201cwe\u2019ll move forwards\u201d. That\u2019s the core expectation, and monetary policy is set accordingly. But at present, the economy has slowed - partly due to a weaker world, and a weaker Europe, but also due to Brexit uncertainty. Q: What\u2019s your message to the MPs who say we can leave the EU, painlessly, without a deal? Arms crossed firmly, governor Carney points out that half of the UK businesses say they\u2019re not ready for a no-deal Brexit (see here). And for others, being ready simply means they\u2019ve done all they can. Mark Carney is asked whether he sympathises with Donald Tusk\u2019s claim that there is a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for Brexit campaigners who didn\u2019t draw up a plan for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. No, the governor replies. \u201cI was surprised by those comments yesterday\u201d. And showing a theological bent, Carney adds: Do not judge because you too will be judged. (that\u2019s from Matthew 7:1-2) Q: What economic damage has Brexit caused? UK GDP is 1.5% below where we expected to be today in June 2016, Mark Carney replies. We do not know what the Brexit outcome will be, Mark Carney insists, adding that there are almost as many possible outcomes as on the morning after the EU referendum. Q: Did you expect the Brexit negotiations to turn out this way? Carney explains that the Bank saw a no-deal Brexit as a low-risk probability, but it has prepared for it in case it happened. That\u2019s why the core of the financial system is ready for whatever happens. Q: Your forecasts show a one in four chance of a recession before the summer - would a no-deal Brexit affect that? Mark Carney says households and businesses are \u201cincreasingly\u201d taking notice of Brexit uncertainty, and that is affecting the economy. That, and the weaker global growth, is why the Bank has cut its growth forecasts (from 1.7% to just 1.2% in 2019). When the economy is growing more slowly, the chances of a negative quarter or two goes up, the governor explains. So if there is a shock.... such as a no-deal, no-transition Brexit, that further increases the risk of quarters of negative growth, he adds. Onto the Q&amp;A, and a tricky poser about the impact of Brexit uncertainty on households. Mark Carney replies that household real incomes have been growing, with a \u201csteady pick-up\u201d in real wage growth. But Brexit is clearly a drag. This is a time of considerable uncertainty about one of the biggest issues facing the UK, the governor says, adding archly: It\u2019s important that parliament gets it right, and they\u2019re taking their time to do that. That is affecting businesses, and we\u2019re seeing it creep into household spending, he adds. But, if there is clarity on the Brexit deal soon, then the economy should pick up. With a final meteorological blast, Carney promises that \u201cwhatever the weather\u201d, the Bank will do its best to keep inflation close to our 2% target. If Brexit uncertainty dissipates faster than the Bank thinks, annual growth could be 0.5% percentage points higher, says Carney, with inflation 0.4% higher. But if the fog gets thicker, growth and inflation could go the other way. The Bank expects business investment and economic growth to soften in the near term, and then pick up as \u201cthe fog clears\u201d, Mark Carney continues. But the only thing that\u2019s certain is that the economy won\u2019t evolve exactly as the Bank expects, he adds. The timing of the Brexit deal, and its implementation time, could change - for example. Plus, the global economy can\u2019t be taken for granted either: Whatever form Brexit takes, the world will still turn and its outlook will change. Given the \u201chistoric resilience\u201d of the UK consumer, and rising wages, household spending is an \u201cupside risk\u201d to our forecasts, Carney continues. He adds that the fog of Brexit uncertainty is also hitting the financial markets. It would be remarkable if sterling and other asset prices currently reflect the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations, he continues (a hint that there will be wild swings, one way or the other). Governor Mark Carney has arrived for his press conference. He starts by reminding us of the (apocryphal) story of the UK newspaper headline: \u201cFog in the channel, continent cut off.\u201d Cutting off the continent is not the intention of Brexit, he adds, but the fog of Brexit uncertainty is causing some problems in the economy. Carney points out that business investment has fallen, and that some firms are stockpiling products in preparation for supply chain disruption. Consumers are also being hit, with demand for cars and houses down (and house prices now flat, as we reported this morning), and retail sales down. The Bank says it has surveyed 200 UK companies across the UK, and found that around half of them feel they\u2019re not ready for a \u2018no deal, no transition\u2019 Brexit. However, the other half think they are ready, and have done what they can. Of those, around a quarter were not making contingency plans \u2014 either because they did not think that they would be affected, or because they were waiting for more clarity about the outcome of a \u2018no deal, no transition\u2019 Brexit. The bulk of the remainder had started implementing plans that had been agreed or were being developed. You can read the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s meeting, here. The inflation report is online here. We should hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney in a few minutes. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been locked in the Bank of England this morning, digesting today\u2019s news. They\u2019ve let him out now, so here\u2019s his take: Minutes of the MPC\u2019s interest rate decision meeting said that over the past three months \u201ckey parts of the EU withdrawal process had remained unresolved and uncertainty had intensified. \u201cBusinesses had appeared increasingly to be responding to Brexit-related uncertainties, and there were some signs that those uncertainties might also be affecting households\u2019 spending and saving decisions.\u201d The minutes added that consumer confidence, particularly the view households took of the general state of the economy, had weakened significantly. Growth is now forecast to be 0.2% in each of the first two quarters of 2019, down from the 0.4% in each period pencilled in by the Bank in November. Activity is expected to pick up towards the end of the year, although the Bank stressed that the performance of the economy would depend on how Brexit unfolded. \u201cThe economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the EU and the UK; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.\u201d More here: There she goes again.... The pound has fallen further against the US dollar, on the back of the Bank of England\u2019s announcement. Sterling is now down over half a cent at $1.2877, a two-week low. Investors are concluding that UK interest rates will remain low for many months to come: The Bank has also flagged up that business investment has been hurt by Brexit uncertainty, even though it\u2019s historically cheap to borrow money to invest. The Bank of England has reiterated that it could cut interest rates, or raise them, after Brexit - depending on how it plays out. That\u2019s because the Bank could (in theory) cut borrowing costs to help the economy, or hike them to protect the pound and fight inflation. It all depends whether Brexit turns into a demand shock (hurting businesses), or a supply shock (in which consumers and firms are fighting over whatever scarce resources make it into the UK). Or, as the Bank puts it: The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The minutes of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting show that it is worried about Brexit, and the wider global economy. On the world economy, the Bank says that the US-China trade war is hurting: The world economy has continued to slow over recent months, with a broad-based softening across all regions. That deceleration reflects the past tightening in global financial conditions, as well as the initial impact of trade tensions on business sentiment. Global growth is expected to dip below trend in coming quarters, weighing on UK net trade, before rising to around potential rates It also fears that the UK economy has weakened in recent months: UK economic growth slowed in late 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019. This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home. These uncertainties could lead to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in UK data, which may therefore provide less of a signal about the medium-term outlook. Heightened uncertainty and elevated bank funding costs are assumed to subside over time, as greater clarity on future trading arrangements is assumed to emerge. The Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts, warning that Britain faced its weakest economic growth in 10 years in 2019. It now expects GDP to increase by just 1.2% - down from a previous forecast of 1.7%. That\u2019s even worse than the EC\u2019s forecasts (+1.3%) this morning. The bank\u2019s policymakers say: \u201cUK economic growth slowed in late 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019. \u201cThis slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home.\u201d For 2020, the UK growth outlook has been cut to 1.5% from 1.7%, before picking up to 1.9% in 2021. Newsflash: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 0.75%. It\u2019s a unanimous decision - all nine members of the monetary policy committee decided (with Brexit looming) not to move borrowing costs today. More to follow.... Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, can\u2019t see any reason for the Bank to surprise us with a rate hike today: With continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its final outcome, many industries and sectors have been in a period of stagnation, with property and housing being particularly affected. It is expected that interest rates will unchanged by the BoE.\u201d We\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s right in about eight minutes... Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest UK data which will have influenced the Bank of England\u2019s thinking this month (although Brexit overshadows everything, really). Over in Greece fears are mounting over the state of the country\u2019s \u201czombie\u201d banks amid warning that taxpayers may have to foot the bill of recapitalising lenders struggling with unprecedentedly high levels of bad debt. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: In what some have interpreted as preparation for the inevitable, the deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis has again warned that the time might be approaching for a fresh recapitalisation of banks. As a result of almost ten years of austerity, non-performing Greek loans account for almost 50 percent of total loans in the banking system \u2013 by far the highest in the EU. In recent days Dragasakis has increasingly spoken of the need for banks to come up with a plan to resolve the problem \u2013 in addition to foreclosures and auctions of repossessed assets that lenders are pursuing. He told parliament: \u201cIf we are not careful we may \u2026. force banks to necessitate new funds.\u201d Most of the bad debt has accrued as a result of depositors defaulting on mortgage payments during Greece\u2019s long-running debt crisis. The \u201czombie\u201d state of banks (so described by prime minister Alexis Tsipras) has been blamed for impeding growth in a country that desperately needs investment after exiting its third bailout programme last summer and is still regarded as the euro zone\u2019s weakest link. Budget airline easyJet has just updated its shareholders on its Brexit preparations. They include: putting in place new operating airlines in Austria and the UK; ring-fencing those operations so that there is no reliance on existing EU traffic rights by the UK airline; transferring over 1,000 pilots, re-issuing 3,300 cabin crew licences and re-registering 133 aircraft from the UK to Austria; putting in place the relevant safety certificates in Austria; and creating a second spare parts \u201chub\u201d in the EU to limit exposure to any logistical supply chain risks between the EU and the UK. EasyJet has also confirmed that it could force some non-EU shareholders to sell up to EU-based investors after Brexit. This would allow it to meet EU ownership rules, which say at least 50% of shares must be owned by EU nationals to qualify for an EU Air Operating Certificate. EasyJet has already raised its ownership by nationals (excluding UK) from the European Economic Area (EEA) to about 49%, and set up its new sister company in Austria, in preparation for Brexit. Just an hour to wait until the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision (although policymakers actually voted yesterday). Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says we shouldn\u2019t expect any fireworks from the BoE, given the Brexit uncertainty. He points out that the latest employment and inflation data has been better than expected, but purchasing manager surveys from companies have been weaker, suggesting the economy is stagnating. That\u2019s a good reason to leave interest rates on hold at 0.75%. Razaqzada writes: Domestically, Brexit is obviously the biggest risk facing the economy right now and we have seen the latest business surveys pointing to a slowdown in economic activity. Purchasing managers have reported falling activity in all three sectors of the economy \u2014 manufacturing, construction and services \u2014 in January. What\u2019s more inflation has started to ease back over the past few months and the headline consumer price index has fallen near the Bank\u2019s 2% target, at 2.1%, while core CPI has remained somewhat more stable around 1.9%. Crucially, though, with inflation easing a little and nominal wages including bonuses rising at a faster clip of 3.4% in the three months to November compared to a year earlier \u2014 the biggest increase since July 2008 \u2014 real wages have increased by a good 1.1%. On top of this, employment has remained robust and the unemployment rate has remained near historic lows around 4.0%. Quite a gloomy message from the EC today: The EC has also predicted that Britain will be the joint third-slowest growing (current) EU member this year - alongside France, Belgium and Sweden, but not as slow as Italy and Germany. Newsflash: The European Commission has just downgraded its growth forecasts, and Italy is in the firing line. It now expects the eurozone to grow by just 1.3% this year, down from a previous forecast of 1.9%. It has also trimmed its 2020 growth forecast to 1.6%, from 1.7%. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is blaming the US-China trade war, and weakness within Europe. Germany\u2019s 2019 growth forecast has been dramatically cut, from 1.8% to just 1.1%. And as for Italy? It\u2019s a shocker; GDP is now expected to only increase by 0.2% this year, not 1.2%. The Commission is blaming Italy\u2019s new populist coalition, which battled Brussels last year as it tried to raise spending and cut taxes. \u201cWhile the initial [Italian] slowdown was largely due to less dynamic world trade, the recent slackening of economic activity is more attributable to sluggish domestic demand, particularly investment, as uncertainty related to the government\u2019s policy stance and rising financing costs took its toll.\u201d As well as Brexit, and a cooling housing market, the Bank of England also needs to worry about the eurozone. With Italy in recession, and Germany worryingly close, a slowdown over the Channel is another headache for the UK\u2019s central bank. And just this morning, weak industrial production data could have sent governor Carney reaching for the Nurofen. Factories in Germany and Spain have both reported that production declined in December, as 2018 ended with a whimper. Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that housebuilding declined sharply in London and the Midlands last year as Brexit worries hit the housing market. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The number of new homes in London registered by housebuilders with the National House Building Council (NHBC) in 2018 fell 10% from the previous year to 16,069, the biggest annual drop since 2016. In the east Midlands and West Midlands, registrations were also down 10%, to 13,447 and 13,087 respectively following two strong years. Total new home registrations fell by 0.5% to 159,617 in 2018, indicating that housebuilding slowed a little. Gary Barker, CEO of Reapit (supplier of CRM and accounting software to estate agents) has confirmed that buyers and sellers are shunning the property market, especially in London. But he believes stronger demand outside the capital should support prices. \u201cWith Brexit negotiations still in deadlock, it is unsurprising that the property market continues to stagnate, with just 0.8% annual house price growth, and a monthly fall of -2.9%. Little progress was made in January, and Reapit\u2019s data shows that a lack of clarity has caused buyers and sellers to abstain from engaging the market. Exchanges are now down by 16% across Greater London, with 27% fewer new listings in December 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. \u201cHowever, there are other factors at work beyond Brexit: reasonable affordability, rising levels of employment and wage growth in the North and Midlands have attracted investors and first-time buyers alike, who are retreating from higher property prices in the Southern market. While growth in the South has slowed, we cannot ignore that growth remains elsewhere. \u201cUntil Brexit is clarified, limited housing stock and strong growth in the North and Midlands will buoy the market, preventing any outright falls.\u201d Britain\u2019s housing market has been sent into a spin by political uncertainty, and low supply of houses, says Lucy Pendleton, director of independent estate agents James Pendleton. She adds: \u201cThe long-term holding pattern in prices ahead of Brexit is abundantly clear and overall measures of consumer confidence have been scraping five-year lows. However, if the UK does enjoy a good EU exit, then a relief rally could be in store given the plentiful government support for buyers, cheap borrowing and rising wages coupled with low supply.\u201d Halifax\u2019s data also show that prices are actually lower than a year ago - another sign that the housing market has cooled. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, believes Brexit uncertainty is dragging the housing market back. Here\u2019s his take on the Halifax\u2019s house price data: \u2018Flat growth is probably the best we can hope for given the current tricky political situation we find ourselves in. Brexit has caused a slowdown in purchase activity as would-be buyers sit on their hands, waiting for the outcome before committing to something as major as buying a new home. Fewer transactions has meant less business for lenders, yet they remain keen to lend. They run big operations and need their staff to be busy, so have two options - change their risk profile or mortgage pricing. The latter is easier, which is why many lenders have reduced their mortgage rates, and is great news for borrowers who are ready to make a move. Newsflash: UK house prices slumped by 2.9% in January, according to Halifax Bank\u2019s monthly survey. That\u2019s a lot worse than the 0.5% decline which economists expected, and leaves the average price at \u00a3233,691. On an annual basis, prices were just 0.8% higher in the last quarter than a year ago. Again, that\u2019s weaker than expected, and down from 1.3% annual growth rate recorded in December. Some caution is needed - these monthly house price surveys are rather volatile. But over the last quarter, prices are down 0.6%. The big picture is that the housing market is clearly cooling, in the face of political uncertainty, despite real wages finally picking up. That could clearly bolster the Bank of England\u2019s reluctance to raise interest rates. Economist Rupert Seggins shows the full picture: Sterling has hit a two-week low this morning, as traders fret about Brexit ahead of the Bank of England meeting. The pound has shed 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar to $1.29, its lowest point since January 22nd. Theresa May is heading to Brussels today in an attempt to reshape the Brexit deal. The latest word, though, is that she doesn\u2019t actually have a firm proposal - dampening any hopes of a breakthrough. Neil Wilson of Markets.com suspects that EC president Donald Tusk\u2019s \u2018place in hell\u2019 attack has alarmed traders: \u201cSterling opened on the back foot, falling to a fresh two-week low, as Brexit risks heighten and the Bank of England looks set to stand pat on rates. The move lower in sterling seems more about Brexit than the BoE, although as described above it seems the Bank is not about to offer a hawkish boost to sterling bulls. It does rather look like Tusk\u2019s bizarre outburst betrayed deep frustration among the EU that Britain is heading for the exit, not least because they had probably held out some vague aspirations that the UK would seek a second referendum and ultimately stay. Bloomberg has predicted that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will probably vote unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged. But....you can\u2019t rule out one or two hawkish members jumping the fence and voting to hike. Chief economist Andrew Haldane or external member Michael Saunders are the most likely candidates. CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche says there are three reasons for the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged -- recent economic data has been patchy; inflation has fallen; and we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with Brexit. On the other hand, average weekly earnings are currently rising by 3.4%, the biggest jump in a decade. In normal times, that could justify a rate hike. If Brexit uncertainty wasn\u2019t casting such a dark cloud over the UK, the Bank of England could easily be raising interest rates today. So savers and borrowers should listen out, for any hints about how rates could move in the months ahead. Capital Economics says: With the outcome of Brexit as unclear as ever, it is likely that the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will keep rates unchanged at 0.75% on Thursday. However, the meeting\u2019s accompanying Inflation Report may provide some clues to how keen the MPC is to change rates once Brexit has been resolved. So long as a deal is eventually struck, we think interest rates will rise more quickly than is widely anticipated. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. While Brexiteers get a special place in Hell, economics journalists must settle for a special place at the Bank of England today, as the central bank sets interest rates and releases its latest economic forecasts. Yes, it\u2019s the final Super Thursday (as they\u2019re known in the City) before Brexit day. Investors, business leaders, consumers and politicians should all pay attention to what governor Mark Carney has to say about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, and the state of the UK and global economies. BoE policymakers are expected to leave UK interest rates alone, at 0.75%. With Brexit uncertainty at new heights, this isn\u2019t the moment to tighten monetary policy -- especially as inflation has dropped back to just 2.1%, close to the official target. The Bank\u2019s economists may also cut their growth and inflation forecasts, given weakness in the global economy since their last meeting in November. So it should be a fun-packed press conference at lunchtime, when Carney takes questions from the media. Will he take the opportunity to issue any fresh Brexit warnings? Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: With Brexit clouding vision the central bank has their hands tied as far as policy is concerned. We expect further warnings over a no deal Brexit and the one hike a year mantra until Brexit uncertainty has cleared. Also coming up today Halifax Bank is releasing their latest UK house price data - it may confirm that prices are levelling off. The European Commission will publish its latest economic forecasts this morning. They could slash growth forecasts for some euro area members, such as Germany and Italy, given recent weak data. That could spark a new row with Rome, just days after the Italian economy slumped into recession. The agenda 8.30am GMT: Halifax survey of UK house prices for January 10am GMT: EC publishes its latest economic forecasts Noon GMT: Bank of England interest rate decision &amp; quarterly Inflation Report 12.30pm GMT: BoE governor Mark Carney holds press conference",

But not everybody is a criminal, sometimes people get mixed up in little different things but that doesn\u2019t make you bad.\u201d He called up a video on his phone of the Labour MP David Lammy criticising the deportations in the Commons. \u201cHe [is trying to] tell them it\u2019s a racist thing they\u2019re doing,\u201d Lamar said. Coverage of the arrival had put local people on edge. The UK Home Office said that among the deportees, one had been convicted of murder, four of various sexual offences including rape, 14 of drugs offences, six of violent crimes including grievous bodily harm and three of firearms and weapon offences. They were said to include people who came to the UK as children and parents with British children. This was the first flight from the UK since the Windrush scandal, but deportation flights are an established issue here. \u201cThere\u2019s a flight that comes here every last Thursday of the month from the US,\u201d said Oswald Dawkins, who runs the National Organisation of Deported Migrants. \u201cThe stigma [around deportees] is less so now than it used to be years ago. For one, the government was one of the drivers for that. The majority do not have support. We can refer them to a shelter \u2013 this is someone who says they have no family, we\u2019d refer them to short-term emergency accommodation.\u201d Most of the men leaving Harman Barracks hid their faces with T-shirts and hats, but one seemed happy to be back and greeted friends before going to a bar next door. \u201cI\u2019ve had a drink, it\u2019s great to be here despite them kidnapping us out of England wrongfully,\u201d said the man, who declined to give his name. \u201cI feel glad to be here because it\u2019s 19 years I\u2019ve not been back in Jamaica. I feel so good, the only thing I miss is my kids, they\u2019re in England, and my wife and certain lifestyle, but Jamaica bless.\u201d Asked about negative local media coverage of their arrival, he said: \u201cDepends on the area where you live. In my area, people who get deported, it\u2019s not negative.\u201d",

Prof Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at the University at Albany in New York, who pioneered the mirror test in 1970, disputed whether the fish really recognised themselves. He said in their \u201czeal to undermine the integrity\u201d of the gold standard test the authors may have overlooked other explanations. The behaviour could be explained because the fish were evolutionarily programmed to be interested in skin markings, Gallup suggested. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that these findings may be an artefact of using marks that simulate ectoparasites,\u201d he said. Jordan said some of the criticisms were prompted by people\u2019s preconceptions about fish, rather than scientific objectivity, which he said was \u201ca bit sad and disappointing\u201d. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a fucking elephant and one of two elephants passes the test, everyone\u2019s like \u2018Yeah cool\u2019,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a fish they\u2019re like, \u2018Ooh you need a conspecific control and a control for empathy and a control for this and that \u2026 the fish are not doing this\u2019.\u201d The authors said the findings raised questions about fish welfare. \u201cWe must be very careful as scientists and humans not to let our loss of empathy towards animals that look different to us influence our opinion of what they experience,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cOtherwise, we conveniently forget or ignore that fish and other animals are sentient and, for instance, our entire practice of commercial fishing lets these animals die in stress and pain on the decks of boats.\u201d The findings are published in the journal PLOS Biology.",

      "bodyText": "Only one person had been granted emergency financial support by the Home Office\u2019s Windrush hardship fund by the end of last year, according to the latest summary of the government\u2019s progress in resolving the fallout from the scandal. The news was met with dismay by those campaigning for better treatment of those affected by the Home Office\u2019s handling of Windrush cases. The number of people who have died after being wrongly detained or removed from the UK has increased to 17, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, revealed in his monthly update on the work of the Windrush taskforce. Officials are still trying to trace a further 21 people they believe they wrongly removed from the UK. The Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, said she was disappointed that the hardship fund had issued only one grant. \u201cThis is very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the special hardship fund only to have helped one person by the end of last year is shocking. \u201cThere have been too many delays setting up the hardship scheme in the first place, and the compensation scheme still isn\u2019t in place. Given that we know the pressure many Windrush families have faced as a result of Home Office failures and mistakes, the government should be providing far more support, far more swiftly than this.\u201d The committee recommended last June that a hardship fund should be set up to help those people facing becoming destitute, severely in debt or homeless as a result of the government\u2019s decision to classify them as illegal immigrants, preventing them from working or receiving benefits. \u201cOnly in October did the home secretary concede that one may be needed, and only in December was the \u2018urgent and exceptional support\u2019 process up and running. By the end of the year only one application out of 16 for support had been approved, and five declined,\u201d Cooper said. Compensation has been promised to all those affected, but the scheme to award payments has not yet been launched. Vernon Vanriel, 63, who was flown back to London by the government in the autumn, after 13 years stuck in Jamaica trying to return to the UK, the country he had lived in for 43 years since the age of six, said he was still waiting for a decision on his request for a hardship payment. He has no winter clothes, and had asked for help buying a winter coat and shoes. He is currently living with his retired sister, receiving disability benefit which he shares with her to cover his living costs. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my sister I don\u2019t know what I would do. I\u2019ve got no warm clothes, I\u2019m ill. It is making life extremely difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed.\u201d Officials have taken calls from 6,603 people who believe they have been affected by Windrush-related immigration issues. More than 4,000 people have been issued with some form of documentation allowing them to remain in the UK, and 3,406 people have received citizenship. The lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie, who is helping a large number of people affected by Windrush issues, said she knew of several people who were in desperate need of financial support. \u201cBy definition, a hardship fund should operate swiftly and with compassion.

      "body": "<p>British exporters sending goods to far-flung destinations in the coming days risk being locked out of harbours around the world as a no-deal Brexit looms, business leaders have warned.</p> <p>Independent trade experts and the UK\u2019s biggest business groups said exporters could be dispatching goods from UK ports imminently that would not arrive until after the 29 March deadline. This raised the prospect of goods being stuck in ports or facing hefty additional costs in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p> <p>The warning came as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/07/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-cuts-growth-forecast\">Bank of England</a> warned the UK economy was on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis, as evidence suggested Brexit jitters were spreading.</p> <p>It also emerged on Thursday that civil servants drafted a radical series of economic policy options after the 2016 Brexit referendum, which included slashing regulation, cutting taxes and removing tariffs. The cross-Whitehall work, known as Project After, first reported in the Financial Times, was then shelved when the government decided to reject the idea of a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on rights and standards, government sources said.</p> <p>But as the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit grows, some ministers and officials have returned to the work in search of emergency levers to pull in the event of a downturn, the Guardian has been told.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/no-deal-brexit-medieval-siege-eu-britain-industries\">A no-deal Brexit won\u2019t result in a siege.

The maximum shipping time to anywhere in the world is about 50 days \u2013 with the furthest being Australia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealand</a> \u2013 meaning shipments sent over the next few days to far-flung ports face an uncertain reception.</p> <p>Ben Digby, the CBI\u2019s international trade director, said: \u201cThere are ships that are setting sail from the UK today that will have to weather a thick extra fog of uncertainty on the high seas, as they could arrive in port effectively locked out of the very market they have travelled across the world to get to.\u201d</p> <p>He warned that whisky going to South Korea could risk having to wait in its destination harbour until the situation became clear. As much as \u00a371m of bottles are shipped to Korea each year, with the potential for 20% tariffs to be slapped on bottles should they not arrive in time.</p> <p>The UK exports roughly \u00a35bn worth of goods a month, on average, to the 60 countries that have free trade agreements with the EU. The EU and the countries it has trade deals with cover about 32% of global GDP.</p> <p>As an island nation, about 95% of all goods by weight enter and leave the UK through ports across the country, with almost 500 million tonnes handled each year. EU traffic accounts for about 55% of all trade.</p> <p>Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at the EEF, said: \u201cThese problems don\u2019t just start on 29 March. It takes several weeks for container ships to travel from the UK to East Asia, Oceania, or South America. Very soon, sea-freight will be leaving the UK with no idea of the trade rules that will be in place when the goods arrive.\u201d</p> <p>The situation has parallels with the US-China trade dispute last year, when <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-05/down-to-the-wire-u-s-soybean-cargo-races-to-beat-china-tariff\">US ships raced across the world</a> to deliver soybeans before Beijing could impose tariffs on them.

      "bodyText": "British exporters sending goods to far-flung destinations in the coming days risk being locked out of harbours around the world as a no-deal Brexit looms, business leaders have warned. Independent trade experts and the UK\u2019s biggest business groups said exporters could be dispatching goods from UK ports imminently that would not arrive until after the 29 March deadline. This raised the prospect of goods being stuck in ports or facing hefty additional costs in the event of a disorderly Brexit. The warning came as the Bank of England warned the UK economy was on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis, as evidence suggested Brexit jitters were spreading. It also emerged on Thursday that civil servants drafted a radical series of economic policy options after the 2016 Brexit referendum, which included slashing regulation, cutting taxes and removing tariffs. The cross-Whitehall work, known as Project After, first reported in the Financial Times, was then shelved when the government decided to reject the idea of a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on rights and standards, government sources said. But as the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit grows, some ministers and officials have returned to the work in search of emergency levers to pull in the event of a downturn, the Guardian has been told. In the latest sign of the mounting disruption, several business groups \u2013 the CBI, the EEF manufacturers\u2019 group, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 warned separately that goods shipped from as early as this weekend might not arrive in time to beat the 29 March deadline, given the length of shipping times in world trade. The maximum shipping time to anywhere in the world is about 50 days \u2013 with the furthest being Australia and New Zealand \u2013 meaning shipments sent over the next few days to far-flung ports face an uncertain reception. Ben Digby, the CBI\u2019s international trade director, said: \u201cThere are ships that are setting sail from the UK today that will have to weather a thick extra fog of uncertainty on the high seas, as they could arrive in port effectively locked out of the very market they have travelled across the world to get to.\u201d He warned that whisky going to South Korea could risk having to wait in its destination harbour until the situation became clear. As much as \u00a371m of bottles are shipped to Korea each year, with the potential for 20% tariffs to be slapped on bottles should they not arrive in time. The UK exports roughly \u00a35bn worth of goods a month, on average, to the 60 countries that have free trade agreements with the EU. The EU and the countries it has trade deals with cover about 32% of global GDP. As an island nation, about 95% of all goods by weight enter and leave the UK through ports across the country, with almost 500 million tonnes handled each year. EU traffic accounts for about 55% of all trade. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at the EEF, said: \u201cThese problems don\u2019t just start on 29 March. It takes several weeks for container ships to travel from the UK to East Asia, Oceania, or South America. Very soon, sea-freight will be leaving the UK with no idea of the trade rules that will be in place when the goods arrive.\u201d The situation has parallels with the US-China trade dispute last year, when US ships raced across the world to deliver soybeans before Beijing could impose tariffs on them. Some boats were stuck in harbours after failing to beat the deadline. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said on Wednesday that the real deadline for averting no-deal Brexit was much closer than 29 March, due to the amount of time businesses need to ship goods. Speaking in front of the parliamentary business select committee, he said firms shipping goods to Japan needed six weeks\u2019 notice to make decisions. He added: \u201cPeople often say these things at the last minute. The last minute for important exporters is fast approaching over the next few days and weeks.\u201d Industry insiders said they hoped that countries would show leniency and continue to accept shipments of British goods after the deadline. They warned, however, that these might come with higher tariffs set under World Trade Organization rules, which would be higher than existing arrangements. Hannah Essex, a co-executive director of policy at the BCC, said it was unclear what would happen: \u201cTraders trying to fulfil orders now are still in the dark about what will happen to their goods when they arrive at destinations around the world in a matter of weeks.\u201d Lesley Batchelor, the director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade, said most countries would want to continue trading, but added: \u201cIf I was a shipper, I would not ship anything knowing this was going on without checking what was happening. \u201cIf it\u2019s a deal and we have transition, it\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s really just no-deal talk that\u2019s scaring everyone.\u201d Imports to Britain may also be affected. William Bain, the Brexit policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, warned that clothing and textiles from Turkey are set for tariffs rising from zero to an average of 12% in a no-deal scenario, while higher tariffs could also be imposed on berries and fruits from Mexico, bananas from Central America and potatoes from Egypt. \u201cUltimately it is the consumer who will face higher prices, or reduced availability, as a result,\u201d he said. The problems for seabound trade apply to several countries which the UK currently trades with under existing EU free trade deals \u2013 as part of Britain\u2019s membership of the bloc. These free trade agreements could be lost under a no-deal scenario. Trade officials are rushing to secure deals with these countries to roll over the existing agreements, although the government conceded to business leaders at a private meeting on Wednesday that most of them won\u2019t be ready in time. Lack of clarity over the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU has held up progress, one attendee at the meeting told the Guardian, including with major countries such as Canada, Turkey, Japan and South Korea. Changes to the UK-EU backstop deal \u2013 a key dividing line between London and Brussels \u2013 could further delay progress. \u201cPeople were saying we\u2019ve got customers expecting delivery in April and under what terms can we send goods to them? The problem is the uncertainty over the future UK-EU relationship, and time is just running out,\u201d they said. A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said it would not comment on the private meeting, but that the government was continuing to prepare for all eventualities. The spokesperson said: \u201cWe are making good progress on securing deals and have signed agreements with Chile, the Faroe Islands, and Eastern and Southern African Economic Partnership Agreement states. We have mutual recognition agreements with Australia and New Zealand, and expect others to follow soon.

      "body": "<p>Doggedness has sometimes served Theresa May well in the past two years. Yet, as this phase of the Brexit process reaches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/07/theresa-may-juncker-clash-brexit-robush-backstop\" title=\"\">another crunch point</a>, that same doggedness may now be her undoing. On Thursday the prime minister met a series of officials in Brussels. Her purpose was to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/07/why-is-may-going-back-to-the-eu-on-brexit-eight-key-questions\" title=\"\">fettle her Brexit deal</a> in ways that the European Union can accept and Conservative MPs can vote for. The EU\u2019s purpose was to stick to its November 2018 deal while remaining open to additional formulae that truly can get through the Commons. The talks with Jean-Claude Juncker were described as \u201crobust and constructive\u201d. This was predictable, since both sides need to show that they are sticking to their opening positions while at the same time looking for agreement. There will be more talks in the coming days. But the reality is that this approach is running out of road.</p> <p>The moral and political bankruptcy of this approach was apparent from Thursday\u2019s joint statement. It made clear \u2013 just as it has been clear from the EU side ever since November \u2013 that significant changes to the withdrawal agreement are simply not on the table. The EU27 will not reopen the agreement, Mr Juncker said flatly. Mrs May\u2019s hope, therefore, is to extract some form of commitment on exiting the Northern Ireland backstop, alongside the existing text, that will persuade enough of the 118 Tories who voted against her last month to change their minds. This looks likely, if it happens at all, to take the form of some kind of legally binding version of the letters that Donald Tusk and Mr Juncker published in January.</p> <p>For some rebel Tory MPs this may suffice as a way of implementing the so-called Brady amendment for which they overwhelmingly voted last week. For others in the rightwing European Research Group, however, it would simply sound the death knell of this phase, since they are dedicated to removing the backstop altogether. That isn\u2019t going to happen, because the EU27 will not shift on it. Mrs May admitted this reality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/05/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-speech-northern-ireland-eu-will-be-to-blame-if-theres-no-deal-says-transport-secretary-chris-grayling-politics-live?page=with:block-5c59c7a6e4b04a6f567d9626#block-5c59c7a6e4b04a6f567d9626\" title=\"\">in Belfast on Tuesday.</a> She repeated it in meetings with MEPs in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/07/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-brussels-talks-corbyn-faces-backlash-from-labour-pro-europeans-after-sending-brexit-plan-to-pm-politics-live?page=with:block-5c5c3acce4b042feedcb91d8#block-5c5c3acce4b042feedcb91d8\" title=\"\">Brussels</a> on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "Doggedness has sometimes served Theresa May well in the past two years. Yet, as this phase of the Brexit process reaches another crunch point, that same doggedness may now be her undoing. On Thursday the prime minister met a series of officials in Brussels. Her purpose was to try to fettle her Brexit deal in ways that the European Union can accept and Conservative MPs can vote for. The EU\u2019s purpose was to stick to its November 2018 deal while remaining open to additional formulae that truly can get through the Commons. The talks with Jean-Claude Juncker were described as \u201crobust and constructive\u201d. This was predictable, since both sides need to show that they are sticking to their opening positions while at the same time looking for agreement. There will be more talks in the coming days. But the reality is that this approach is running out of road. The moral and political bankruptcy of this approach was apparent from Thursday\u2019s joint statement. It made clear \u2013 just as it has been clear from the EU side ever since November \u2013 that significant changes to the withdrawal agreement are simply not on the table. The EU27 will not reopen the agreement, Mr Juncker said flatly. Mrs May\u2019s hope, therefore, is to extract some form of commitment on exiting the Northern Ireland backstop, alongside the existing text, that will persuade enough of the 118 Tories who voted against her last month to change their minds. This looks likely, if it happens at all, to take the form of some kind of legally binding version of the letters that Donald Tusk and Mr Juncker published in January. For some rebel Tory MPs this may suffice as a way of implementing the so-called Brady amendment for which they overwhelmingly voted last week. For others in the rightwing European Research Group, however, it would simply sound the death knell of this phase, since they are dedicated to removing the backstop altogether. That isn\u2019t going to happen, because the EU27 will not shift on it. Mrs May admitted this reality in Belfast on Tuesday. She repeated it in meetings with MEPs in Brussels on Thursday. The 27 are not looking for a compromise to the agreement. They are dealing with a country that is leaving their union. They mistrusted Mrs May\u2019s embrace of the Brady amendment right from the start. They still do. The bottom line is that her prospects of getting the \u201csubstantial and sustainable\u201d majority she needs if she is to get any deal through the Commons based on Tory and DUP votes alone are still vanishingly small. This makes the danger of a no-deal outcome much greater. This is where Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shift of policy on Brexit this week comes in. On Tuesday, the Labour leader wrote to the prime minister offering a softened version of his longstanding conditions \u2013 which he wants written into law before Brexit \u2013 for supporting Mrs May. His letter is a pro-soft-Brexit package. But its softness is more apparent than real. The real bit is that it spurns the 48% who voted remain in 2016. It also says nothing about either a second vote or a deliberative attempt to resolve Brexit differences. But the Corbyn letter does not offer anything to Mrs May either. Its conditions seem calculated to be unacceptable to her. There is no mention of freedom of movement in it. The possibility of a Norway-style EEA agreement is ignored. It simply invites the prime minister to split the Tory party in order to make a Brexit deal that might also split the Labour party. Mrs May is therefore unlikely to accept such an invitation. The effect of Mr Corbyn\u2019s letter may in fact be to strengthen Mrs May\u2019s attempt to chisel out a tweaked version of her original deal. Her aim is still to persuade her rebels that her tweaked deal is the least bad of all the options, ranging from no deal through to a soft Brexit and a second vote.

We took part in the march in London in October with our placard \u201cGrandmas against Brexit\u201d, inspired by the ladies I had encountered in Berlin and their Omas gegen Rechts placards. Wearing sashes bearing the same message, we were photographed innumerable times and even interviewed by a French radio station. We took part in a further march in York in November and received a similar warm welcome, except from an ardent female leaver who called us traitors . We were doing it for our grandchildren, for whose future outside the EU we fear. Alison Harris Harrogate, North Yorkshire \u2022 In September 2017, four of us joined the People\u2019s March for Europe with our banner Grannies4EU. Many grandmas asked to pose with the banner and numerous young people took approving photos. We were very disappointed that no British newspaper picked up our banner but, lo and behold, the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration did with a full article on our fervent desire to remain in Europe for the sake of future generations.

      "body": "<p>Instagram has announced that it will ban all graphic self-harm images as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of British teenager Molly Russell.</p> <p>The photo-sharing platform made the decision \u2013 which critics said was necessary but long overdue \u2013 in response to a tide of public anger over the suicide of the 14-year-old girl, whose Instagram account contained distressing material about depression and suicide.</p> <p>After days of growing pressure on Instagram culminated in a meeting with health secretary Matt Hancock, the social network\u2019s head Adam Mosseri admitted that the company had not done enough and said that explicit imagery of self-harm would no longer be allowed on the site.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable,\u201d Mosseri said. \u201cWe will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale.\u201d</p> <p>The move follows significant public anger over Molly\u2019s death. Her father Ian Russell said he believed Instagram was partly to blame. The family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her account after her death.</p> <p>Instagram announced a range of further measures, including the removal of non-graphic images of self-harm from the most visible parts of its app and website, which appeared designed to draw a line under what has become a reputational crisis for the brand and its parent company Facebook.</p> <p>But critics said the changes should have already been made and remained sceptical they would be enough to tackle a problem that some said has grown unchecked for 10 years.</p> <p>The NSPCC said Instagram had taken \u201can important step\u201d, but that social networks were still falling short and that legislation would be necessary.</p> <p>\u201cIt should never have taken the death of Molly Russell for Instagram to act,\u201d said chief executive Peter Wanless. \u201cOver the last decade, social networks have proven over and over that they won\u2019t do enough.\u201d</p> <p>Wanless said it was not enough to wait until \u201cthe next tragedy strikes\u201d, urging the government to act without delay and impose a duty of care on social networks, with tough punishments for those who fail to protect their young users.</p> <p>Others said Facebook had consistently fallen short on self-harm and suicide across its online empire. \u201cThe company has failed to prioritise preventing self-harm,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University.</p> <p>\u201cAt-risk individuals will not be safe until Facebook takes it role as a global corporation and communications platform more seriously. These changes should have been made years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Before the meeting, Mr Hancock said: \u201cSocial media companies need to do more, in particular, to remove material that encourages suicide and self-harm, so I\u2019m going to be asking other social media companies to act.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people to go on to social media and search for images about suicide to get directed to yet more of that sort of imagery. They need help to not post more about suicide.\u201d</p> <p>There have been longstanding concerns over how Instagram and other social networks handle content that could be harmful to the mental health of its audience, particularly young people, but the issue became urgent after Molly\u2019s father said in an interview Instagram \u201chelped kill my daughter\u201d.</p> <p>Mosseri accepted that the move was overdue. Asked in an interview with the Daily Telegraph why Instagram had taken so long to tackle the issue, he said: \u201cWe have not been as focused as we should have been on the effects of graphic imagery of anyone looking at content.</p> <p>\u201cThat is something that we are looking to correct and correct quickly. It\u2019s unfortunate it took the last few weeks for us to realise that. It\u2019s now our responsibility to address that issue as quickly as we can.\u201dSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme, the digital minister, Margot James, said the government would \u201chave to keep the situation very closely under review to make sure that these commitments are made real \u2013 and as swiftly as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Mosseri said some self-harm images would be allowed to remain on Instagram. \u201cI might have an image of a scar and say, \u2018I\u2019m 30 days clean,\u2019 and that\u2019s an important way to tell my story,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat kind of content can still live on the site but the next change is that it won\u2019t show up in any recommendation services so it will be harder to find.\u201d</p> <p>Instagram\u2019s decision comes as large social media companies such as Facebook, which owns Instagram, prepare to battle with the British government of the future of internet regulation in the UK.</p> <p>The government is considering imposing a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies, which could be accompanied by fines for non-compliance, prompting in a substantial behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by social media sites.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, is due to unveil the government\u2019s proposals at the end of this month, helping to spur Facebook into swift action.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

After days of growing pressure on Instagram culminated in a meeting with health secretary Matt Hancock, the social network\u2019s head Adam Mosseri admitted that the company had not done enough and said that explicit imagery of self-harm would no longer be allowed on the site. \u201cWe are not where we need to be on self-harm and suicide, and we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable,\u201d Mosseri said. \u201cWe will get better and we are committed to finding and removing this content at scale.\u201d The move follows significant public anger over Molly\u2019s death. Her father Ian Russell said he believed Instagram was partly to blame. The family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her account after her death. Instagram announced a range of further measures, including the removal of non-graphic images of self-harm from the most visible parts of its app and website, which appeared designed to draw a line under what has become a reputational crisis for the brand and its parent company Facebook. But critics said the changes should have already been made and remained sceptical they would be enough to tackle a problem that some said has grown unchecked for 10 years. The NSPCC said Instagram had taken \u201can important step\u201d, but that social networks were still falling short and that legislation would be necessary. \u201cIt should never have taken the death of Molly Russell for Instagram to act,\u201d said chief executive Peter Wanless. \u201cOver the last decade, social networks have proven over and over that they won\u2019t do enough.\u201d Wanless said it was not enough to wait until \u201cthe next tragedy strikes\u201d, urging the government to act without delay and impose a duty of care on social networks, with tough punishments for those who fail to protect their young users. Others said Facebook had consistently fallen short on self-harm and suicide across its online empire. \u201cThe company has failed to prioritise preventing self-harm,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University. \u201cAt-risk individuals will not be safe until Facebook takes it role as a global corporation and communications platform more seriously. These changes should have been made years ago.\u201d Before the meeting, Mr Hancock said: \u201cSocial media companies need to do more, in particular, to remove material that encourages suicide and self-harm, so I\u2019m going to be asking other social media companies to act. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to go on to social media and search for images about suicide to get directed to yet more of that sort of imagery. They need help to not post more about suicide.\u201d There have been longstanding concerns over how Instagram and other social networks handle content that could be harmful to the mental health of its audience, particularly young people, but the issue became urgent after Molly\u2019s father said in an interview Instagram \u201chelped kill my daughter\u201d. Mosseri accepted that the move was overdue. Asked in an interview with the Daily Telegraph why Instagram had taken so long to tackle the issue, he said: \u201cWe have not been as focused as we should have been on the effects of graphic imagery of anyone looking at content. \u201cThat is something that we are looking to correct and correct quickly. It\u2019s unfortunate it took the last few weeks for us to realise that. It\u2019s now our responsibility to address that issue as quickly as we can.\u201dSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme, the digital minister, Margot James, said the government would \u201chave to keep the situation very closely under review to make sure that these commitments are made real \u2013 and as swiftly as possible\u201d. Mosseri said some self-harm images would be allowed to remain on Instagram. \u201cI might have an image of a scar and say, \u2018I\u2019m 30 days clean,\u2019 and that\u2019s an important way to tell my story,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of content can still live on the site but the next change is that it won\u2019t show up in any recommendation services so it will be harder to find.\u201d Instagram\u2019s decision comes as large social media companies such as Facebook, which owns Instagram, prepare to battle with the British government of the future of internet regulation in the UK. The government is considering imposing a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies, which could be accompanied by fines for non-compliance, prompting in a substantial behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by social media sites. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, is due to unveil the government\u2019s proposals at the end of this month, helping to spur Facebook into swift action.

Our pre-season had started at Atlanta so I\u2019ve got some physical work done; it\u2019s about integrating with my new teammates and settling in as quickly as possible.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the sort of player who likes to get my teammates playing around me,\u201d he added before stressing an appreciation of the scale of the challenge ahead. \u201cNewcastle United has so much history around it and that\u2019s a form of pressure in itself,\u201d said the eighth Paraguayan to play in England\u2019s top tier. \u201cWe know what the fans demand of us but it\u2019s always been my dream to come to Europe and play in the Premier League. I feel I\u2019m representing my country but I also know it\u2019s going to be quite tough to adapt. \u201cThere are quite big differences between the MLS and the Premier League. The tempo here is different, it\u2019s higher, with more pressing. It\u2019s a more difficult league but, with the help of my teammates, it\u2019s something I feel I\u2019ll cope with \u2013 and my manager will help me. \u201cWhen I heard about the interest from Rafa Ben\u00edtez I had no hesitation about wanting to play for him. We all know what a great manager he is, what a great person he is. Coming here was a no-brainer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>No one in Prague a hundred years ago would have thought that Jan\u00e1\u010dek would be valued a century later as one of the greatest opera composers of the 20th century. Until the hugely successful Prague premiere of Jen\u016ffa in 1916, when the composer was 62, he was viewed by the chattering classes of the Czech capital as something of a wild and woolly \u201cbackwoodsman\u201d from the eastern region of the Czech lands, Moravia. Jan\u00e1\u010dek certainly did not fit comfortably into the traditions of Czech opera in the post-Smetana era.</p> <p>And yet in a modern age his stock is unquestionably high. His operas can shock, even wound, but they are often ravishingly beautiful, powerfully emotive and, above all, true. Today, with three productions of the same opera in the UK in the next few weeks, one can only conclude that something is up. Scottish Opera, Opera North and the Royal Opera House are all staging productions of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Katya Kabanov\u00e1 in February and March.</p> <p>Katya has a strong performing tradition in the UK. Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s sixth opera was first performed at Sadler\u2019s Wells in the spring of 1951. The conductor, recently returned from studying with V\u00e1clav Talich \u2013 one of the greatest Czech conductors of the 20th century \u2013 was a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/15/sir-charles-mackerras-obituary\">Charles Mackerras</a>.</p> <p>It also did well under the Czech conductor Rafael Kubel\u00edk in 1954, the 100th anniversary of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s birth, but failed to attract UK audiences later in the decade. However, a decisive moment came with the visit of the Prague National Theatre to the Edinburgh festival in 1964 when, according to the Observer, Jaroslav Krombholc conducted with \u201calmost unbearable lyric intensity\u201d. A new production at ENO in 1973, again under Mackerras, secured Katya\u2019s place in the repertoire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a503ce0720fce873f30bf323272a0426c9eee5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a503ce0720fce873f30bf323272a0426c9eee5b/0_337_5151_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A strong performing tradition ...

Stephanie Corley (Katya Kabanova) and Harold Meers (Boris) in Opera North\u2019s production of Katya Kabanova</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mackerras is unquestionably the central figure where interpretation of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s operas in this country are concerned. In numerous performances and a pioneering series of recordings, he not only secured pre-eminence as an interpreter of the composer, but grew an enthusiastic audience. In fact, in many ways, the Brits have seized the initiative from the Czechs. As a student in Prague in the late 1970s I well remember that the only Jan\u00e1\u010dek opera to garner full houses was Jen\u016ffa. Brilliant and passionate performances of From the House of the Dead and The Makropulos Case were barely half full, whereas in Britain the same operas frequently played to nearly 80% full houses.</p> <p>The Czechs have never been entirely comfortable with Jan\u00e1\u010dek. The favourites in Prague have always been Smetana\u2019s The Bartered Bride and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Rusalka. Smetana\u2019s comic masterpiece offered audiences at its premiere in 1866 a comforting view of rural life in which relatively simple problems have heart-warming solutions, and it proved an enduring recipe. Almost 40 years later, Jan\u00e1\u010dek confronted the harsh realities of life in the country with Jen\u016ffa in which drunkenness and abuse of women play a major part. The irresistible catharsis at the end of that opera offered something much more transcendental than a cheery final chorus in national dress. K\u00e1t\u2019a, however, went a great deal further in depth of characterisation and was the end of a painful personal, if ultimately triumphant, road for the composer.</p> <p>The passionate involvement Jan\u00e1\u010dek felt for the subject matter of all his compositions, whether opera or string quartet, was perhaps strongest in 1921\u2019s K\u00e1t\u2019a Kabanov\u00e1. The triumphant Prague premiere of Jen\u016ffa five years earlier had vindicated his reputation and after a decade of neglect by Prague\u2019s cultural elite, Jan\u00e1\u010dek was at last accepted and celebrated internationally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03b3dc354a1c8d475efece03c0993e734c7ac8f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b3dc354a1c8d475efece03c0993e734c7ac8f7/0_48_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Central female characters ...

Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1 became his muse during his astonishing final decade. While St\u00f6sslov\u00e1 enjoyed the attention of a now celebrated musical figure, it is unlikely that their relationship resulted in anything other a sublimated surge of creativity on Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s part, with her presence hovering over the central female characters of Katya, The Vixen and Makropulos.

By changing its title from The Thunderstorm to K\u00e1t\u2019a Kabanov\u00e1, Jan\u00e1\u010dek not only brought it into an ambit typical of Czech opera where a large proportion of works bear women\u2019s names, but signalled that his primary concern was with the personal tragedy of the central figure.</p> <p>He captures Katya\u2019s fragility, most harrowingly in the moment of reverie just before her fatal plunge into the Volga, and her potential for exultant joy, communicated most memorably in her description of her reactions in church where she imagines angels flying through the haze of incense to heaven. As important in securing our sympathy for her, however, is the chilling contrast between the petty concerns of the bourgeois town in which she finds herself and her own volatile, passionate nature. Her suicide can certainly be seen, as Ostrovsky intended, in part as a final protest against the stifling mores of the town\u2019s citizens and the domineering Kabanicha, but Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s music transmutes it into a much more personal drama.

      "bodyText": "No one in Prague a hundred years ago would have thought that Jan\u00e1\u010dek would be valued a century later as one of the greatest opera composers of the 20th century. Until the hugely successful Prague premiere of Jen\u016ffa in 1916, when the composer was 62, he was viewed by the chattering classes of the Czech capital as something of a wild and woolly \u201cbackwoodsman\u201d from the eastern region of the Czech lands, Moravia. Jan\u00e1\u010dek certainly did not fit comfortably into the traditions of Czech opera in the post-Smetana era. And yet in a modern age his stock is unquestionably high. His operas can shock, even wound, but they are often ravishingly beautiful, powerfully emotive and, above all, true. Today, with three productions of the same opera in the UK in the next few weeks, one can only conclude that something is up. Scottish Opera, Opera North and the Royal Opera House are all staging productions of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Katya Kabanov\u00e1 in February and March. Katya has a strong performing tradition in the UK. Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s sixth opera was first performed at Sadler\u2019s Wells in the spring of 1951. The conductor, recently returned from studying with V\u00e1clav Talich \u2013 one of the greatest Czech conductors of the 20th century \u2013 was a young Charles Mackerras. It also did well under the Czech conductor Rafael Kubel\u00edk in 1954, the 100th anniversary of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s birth, but failed to attract UK audiences later in the decade. However, a decisive moment came with the visit of the Prague National Theatre to the Edinburgh festival in 1964 when, according to the Observer, Jaroslav Krombholc conducted with \u201calmost unbearable lyric intensity\u201d. A new production at ENO in 1973, again under Mackerras, secured Katya\u2019s place in the repertoire. Mackerras is unquestionably the central figure where interpretation of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s operas in this country are concerned. In numerous performances and a pioneering series of recordings, he not only secured pre-eminence as an interpreter of the composer, but grew an enthusiastic audience. In fact, in many ways, the Brits have seized the initiative from the Czechs. As a student in Prague in the late 1970s I well remember that the only Jan\u00e1\u010dek opera to garner full houses was Jen\u016ffa. Brilliant and passionate performances of From the House of the Dead and The Makropulos Case were barely half full, whereas in Britain the same operas frequently played to nearly 80% full houses. The Czechs have never been entirely comfortable with Jan\u00e1\u010dek. The favourites in Prague have always been Smetana\u2019s The Bartered Bride and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s Rusalka. Smetana\u2019s comic masterpiece offered audiences at its premiere in 1866 a comforting view of rural life in which relatively simple problems have heart-warming solutions, and it proved an enduring recipe. Almost 40 years later, Jan\u00e1\u010dek confronted the harsh realities of life in the country with Jen\u016ffa in which drunkenness and abuse of women play a major part. The irresistible catharsis at the end of that opera offered something much more transcendental than a cheery final chorus in national dress. K\u00e1t\u2019a, however, went a great deal further in depth of characterisation and was the end of a painful personal, if ultimately triumphant, road for the composer. The passionate involvement Jan\u00e1\u010dek felt for the subject matter of all his compositions, whether opera or string quartet, was perhaps strongest in 1921\u2019s K\u00e1t\u2019a Kabanov\u00e1. The triumphant Prague premiere of Jen\u016ffa five years earlier had vindicated his reputation and after a decade of neglect by Prague\u2019s cultural elite, Jan\u00e1\u010dek was at last accepted and celebrated internationally. What is more, he was newly in love with a much younger woman. Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1 became his muse during his astonishing final decade. While St\u00f6sslov\u00e1 enjoyed the attention of a now celebrated musical figure, it is unlikely that their relationship resulted in anything other a sublimated surge of creativity on Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s part, with her presence hovering over the central female characters of Katya, The Vixen and Makropulos. There is no doubting thatKatya was a work of love; Jan\u00e1\u010dek himself claimed that the composition of the opera had flowed like \u201cthe beautiful river Volga\u201d.

Equally poignant is the way he depicts the stifling context in which she lives: the small town of Kalinovo on the Volga with all its hypocrisy, a mother-in-law from hell, the terrifying Kabanicha, who not only tries to dominate her, but everyone around her including her hopeless son, Tichon.

      "bodyText": "My friend John Kemmis, who has died aged 74, was a social worker who made a huge difference to countless young lives. Born in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, John was the youngest of three sons of Frederick Kemmis-Betty, who served as captain in the Royal Navy during the second world war and then returned to work as a stockbroker; his mother, Myrtle (nee Wingate Morris), was a volunteer social worker. John was brought up in Borough Green, Kent, and at the age of nine went to Ladycross school, Seaford, East Sussex, as a boarder, and then at 13 to Downside school, near Bath. His experiences as a young child in boarding school fuelled his determination that no child should ever suffer alone and unheard. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, and then qualified as a social worker at Hull University in 1968. John\u2019s career began in Greenwich, south-east London, in 1968; he became an area manager for social services in north Battersea, south-west London, in 1976. There John encouraged social workers to be innovative: 40 community-based projects were created and there was an explicit anti-poverty focus. Specialist teams made sure the needs and rights of children in care were given the same priority as supporting families to stay together. In 1995 John joined Voice for the Child in Care (now called Coram Voice), founded by Gwen James. Five years later, he was appointed its chief executive, and then spent over a decade leading campaigns to advance children\u2019s rights. At John\u2019s instigation, the charity drafted an amendment to the Children Act 1989 to give children in care a legal right to have an independent advocate to make sure their rights are upheld. He successfully lobbied peers and government to make the landmark change, which was enacted in the Adoption and Children Act 2002. John retired in 2011, but he continued lobbying for the rights of children until weeks before he died. One of his final public acts was a meeting with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, where he made the case for visiting advocates in every institutional setting.

A second novel from AJ Finn has been slated for a January 2020 release. Mallory has said that it will be set in San Francisco, \u201cthe only Hitchcockian American place that is not New York\u201d. The New Yorker said it would be a story of revenge involving a female thriller writer and an interviewer who learns of a dark past.</p> <p>Mallory worked in publishing before landing a major two-book deal on both sides of the Atlantic in 2016, with HarperCollins in the UK and US counterpart William Morrow, for whom he worked as executive editor at the time. According to the profile, the manuscript was submitted anonymously, with Mallory only revealing his name after bidding reached $750,000 (\u00a3578,000). The piece alleges that when it was revealed, \u201cmany\u201d publishers pulled out of the bidding, with a former Morrow employee telling the magazine: \u201cI\u2019d wondered why this person in publishing wants to be anonymous. Then: Oh, <em>that\u2019s</em> why!\u201d</p> <p>HarperCollins said it did not comment on the personal lives of its employees or its authors. \u201cProfessionally, Dan was a highly valued editor and the publication of The Woman in the Window \u2013 a Sunday Times bestseller \u2013 speaks for itself.\u201d</p> <p>When the New Yorker investigation was published, many working in the publishing industry reacted with anger, particularly at Mallory\u2019s rapid ascent from assistant to executive editor in roughly a decade, in an industry dominated by women but with few in senior roles. On Twitter, Ruoxi Chen, editor at Tor, said Mallory\u2019s story showed that publishers were \u201cstill hiring based on \u2018I like the cut of your jib, you can have a job\u2019 standards\u201d, while Wei Ming Kam at Oberon Books, said: \u201cSomething that publishing in both the UK and the US should be thinking about very hard today: how many other Daniel Mallorys are working in the industry RIGHT NOW.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dan Mallory\u2019s publisher HarperCollins has said that it intends publish a second novel by him, despite revelations that he had lied about having cancer. Mallory, who wrote the bestselling thriller The Woman in the Window under the pseudonym AJ Finn, admitted in a statement this week in response to an extensive New Yorker investigation that \u201con numerous occasions in the past, I have stated, implied, or allowed others to believe that I was afflicted with a physical malady instead of a psychological one: cancer, specifically\u201d. The profile alleged that he had a history of fabricating stories about illness and death and of lying about his professional qualifications. Mallory\u2019s statement said that he was \u201cafflicted with severe bipolar II disorder\u201d and \u201cin my distress, I did or said or believed things I would never ordinarily say, or do, or believe\u201d. But despite the opprobrium, a spokesperson for HarperCollins UK confirmed on Thursday that there was no change to its publishing plans. A second novel from AJ Finn has been slated for a January 2020 release. Mallory has said that it will be set in San Francisco, \u201cthe only Hitchcockian American place that is not New York\u201d. The New Yorker said it would be a story of revenge involving a female thriller writer and an interviewer who learns of a dark past. Mallory worked in publishing before landing a major two-book deal on both sides of the Atlantic in 2016, with HarperCollins in the UK and US counterpart William Morrow, for whom he worked as executive editor at the time. According to the profile, the manuscript was submitted anonymously, with Mallory only revealing his name after bidding reached $750,000 (\u00a3578,000). The piece alleges that when it was revealed, \u201cmany\u201d publishers pulled out of the bidding, with a former Morrow employee telling the magazine: \u201cI\u2019d wondered why this person in publishing wants to be anonymous. Then: Oh, that\u2019s why!\u201d HarperCollins said it did not comment on the personal lives of its employees or its authors. \u201cProfessionally, Dan was a highly valued editor and the publication of The Woman in the Window \u2013 a Sunday Times bestseller \u2013 speaks for itself.\u201d When the New Yorker investigation was published, many working in the publishing industry reacted with anger, particularly at Mallory\u2019s rapid ascent from assistant to executive editor in roughly a decade, in an industry dominated by women but with few in senior roles. On Twitter, Ruoxi Chen, editor at Tor, said Mallory\u2019s story showed that publishers were \u201cstill hiring based on \u2018I like the cut of your jib, you can have a job\u2019 standards\u201d, while Wei Ming Kam at Oberon Books, said: \u201cSomething that publishing in both the UK and the US should be thinking about very hard today: how many other Daniel Mallorys are working in the industry RIGHT NOW.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On 1 June 1970, Nelson Mandela wrote a letter to his young daughters Zeni and Zindzi from his prison cell on Robben Island. \u201cMy darlings,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is more than eight years since I last saw you \u2026\u201d The girls\u2019 mother Winnie had also been imprisoned the previous year, and their father had no idea, he wrote, who was looking after them in the school holidays, who fed them, bought them clothing or paid their school fees. He had written two letters to the pre-teenage girls the previous year, he told them, but had learned neither had reached them. And yet he would send another, he wrote, because \u201cthe mere fact of writing down my thoughts and expressing my feelings gives me a measure of pleasure and satisfaction. It\u2019s some means of passing on to you my warmest love and good wishes, and tends to calm down the shooting pains that hit me whenever I think of you.\u201d He signed it: \u201cTons of love, Daddy.\u201d This letter, or more accurately the modest notebook into which the prisoner himself made copies of all of his outgoing correspondence, forms part of a major new interactive exhibition about Mandela\u2019s life and legacy that opens on Friday in London, before embarking on a global tour. Mandela: The Official Exhibition traces the former South African president\u2019s extraordinary life from his early years in a small farming community in the remote Transkei region, to his education and political activism, his arduous imprisonment, long-awaited release and late-in-life roles as his nation\u2019s first post-apartheid president and global peacemaker. Among the 150 artefacts and personal items on display are the rough sisal mat on which Mandela slept during his incarceration on Robben Island, the master key to his cell, the trenchcoat he acquired on leaving prison and wore frequently after his release, and the white lion skin which was laid, with a flag of South Africa, on his coffin after he died in 2013. Chief Nkosi Zwelivelile (Mandla) Mandela, the former president\u2019s oldest grandson and the exhibition\u2019s co-curator, said he hoped the retelling of his grandfather\u2019s life would serve as \u201can inspiration to humanity\u201d. \u201cMy grandfather dedicated 67 years of his life to serving humanity. He was a champion for justice, peace and human rights. And this exhibition is exactly about that. It is a call to action to the global community to uphold [Mandela\u2019s clan name] Madiba\u2019s values and principles. It cannot be that we honour him in statues and awards and not fully follow in his footsteps in what he stood for.\u201d Chief Mandela is the son of Mandela\u2019s second son Makgatho by his first wife, Evelyn Ntoko Mase. Another letter on display was written by the imprisoned Nelson to Makgatho, consoling him on the death of Thembi, Mandela\u2019s oldest son, who was killed in a road accident in 1969. \u201cI have spent a lot of time these past few months thinking of you,\u201d Mandela wrote.

      "bodyText": "Paris has taken the extraordinary step of recalling its ambassador from Rome, in the worst crisis between the two neighbouring countries since the second world war. France blamed what it called baseless verbal attacks from Italy\u2019s political leaders, which it said were \u201cwithout precedent since world war two\u201d. Italy\u2019s two deputy prime ministers, the far-right Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio of the populist, anti-establishment Five Star Movement, have in recent months criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on a host of inflammatory issues, from immigration to the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government demonstrations. Di Maio this week met leaders of the gilets jaunes seeking to run in May\u2019s European parliament elections as he declared the \u201cwind of change has crossed the Alps\u201d and a \u201cnew Europe is being born of the yellow vests\u201d. France said the comments were an unacceptable \u201cprovocation\u201d. Announcing the immediate return to Paris of its ambassador for talks, the French foreign office said in a statement: \u201cFor several months, France has been the target of repeated, baseless attacks and outrageous statements. Having disagreements is one thing but manipulating the relationship for electoral aims is another. \u201cAll of these actions are creating a serious situation which is raising questions about the Italian government\u2019s intentions towards France.\u201d Salvini responded by saying the Italian government did not want to fall out with France and suggested a meeting with Macron to fix the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t want to row with anyone, I\u2019m prepared to go to Paris, even by foot, to discuss the many issues we have,\u201d he said. But, in a further dig at Macron, he said France must first address three issues: French police must stop pushing migrants back into Italy, end lengthy border checks blocking traffic and hand over around 15 Italian leftist militants who have taken refuge in France in recent decades. The long-running political spat between Italy and France has been viewed as the biggest bust-up between the countries since 1945. Both sides were initially seen to be using their differences for electoral reasons: Salvini to push his far-right agenda and Macron to style himself as a centrist counterweight against populism in May\u2019s European parliamentary elections. Relations soured after Italy\u2019s populist government came to power last June. Macron, who was under pressure at home for not accepting the Aquarius migrant ship that Salvini turned away from Italian ports, said populism was spreading across Europe \u201ca bit like leprosy\u201d. He did not name Italy but the leprosy comment was taken to be directly aimed at Rome. Salvini has called Macron a dire French president. \u201cI hope the French will be able to free themselves of a terrible president,\u201d he said in one Facebook video, urging French voters not to back Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche party in the European vote. Salvini is close to Macron\u2019s presidential rival, the French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is currently neck and neck with Macron\u2019s in polls before the European elections. Di Maio last month accused France of impoverishing Africa and bringing on the migration crisis. He said France was encouraging immigration to Europe \u201cbecause European countries, France above all, have never stopped colonising dozens of African countries\u201d. Furious, the French foreign office immediately summoned the Italian envoy in France for talks over what it called \u201chostile\u201d remarks. Already, relations were so strained that France and Italy failed to hold a traditional joint summit last year. Tensions had been mounting steadily over immigration and France\u2019s role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. The countries have even been at odds about celebrations for the Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci, with Italy raising doubts about loaning works for a major commemoration show at Paris\u2019s Louvre museum. During a visit to Egypt last month, Macron sought to shrug off the sparring, dismissing Salvini and Di Maio\u2019s comments as \u201cinsignificant\u201d. The French Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, told France Inter radio: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same political choices as Matteo Salvini\u2019s League or Luigi Di Maio\u2019s Five Star Movement, but everyone should prioritise the chief concern of dealing with their own country\u2019s affairs and ensuring good relations with neighbours.\u201d Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Pescara",

She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the withdrawal agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.</p> \n   <p>President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European parliament and the EU27.</p> \n   <p>The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here are the key lines.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May and Juncker played down prospect of any breakthrough on Brexit before the end of February.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Juncker told May during their \u201crobust\u201d talks that withdrawal agreement will not be re-opened.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But Juncker also said the EU would be willing to change the political declaration on the future relationship.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T12:09:47.924Z\">at 12.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5c1b78e4b042feedcb8fea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T11:51:11.268Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"978171e07f4b37661d59ccdbb813206b8e819be5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978171e07f4b37661d59ccdbb813206b8e819be5/0_133_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People\u2019s Vote campaigners in Brussels today, where they hold a banner saying \u2018No To A Blindfolded Brexit\u2019 to coincide with Theresa May\u2019s arrival for talks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People\u2019s Vote campaigners in Brussels today, where they hold a banner saying \u2018No To A Blindfolded Brexit\u2019 to coincide with Theresa May\u2019s arrival for talks.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5c1ae1e4b04a6f567daa4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T11:49:42.499Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Downing Street</strong> has given its initial response to the Jeremy Corbyn Brexit letter.

Importantly, MPs also reiterated their absolute commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal.</p> \n   <p>While Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop \u2013 so this is an issue that needs to be resolved, not just for our Conservative MPs and the DUP, but for MPs across the House.</p> \n   <p>To achieve this we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop; and considering legal changes to the current backstop that could provide the type of guarantees MPs from all sides have said they need.</p> \n   <p>The government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes.</p> \n   <p>The EU shares the UK\u2019s commitment to leave with a deal.

He calls for the Corbyn plan to be scrutinised - so that it can be rejected. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer. </p> \n   <p>What\u2019s needed now is for this and any other alternative Brexit proposal to be given the same level of scrutiny that led parliament to reject the government\u2019s deal last month. That will show that no number of tweaks to the political declaration pretending we can have our cake and eat it can change the reality that any Brexit deal means leaving the EU without clarity or certainty about where we will end up.</p> \n   <p>Our party conference agreed last year that if it couldn\u2019t get a general election it should explore other options including a new public vote. The party and parliament should examine this option so that if and when it is rejected, Labour can fulfil the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its voters and members by campaigning to give the public the final say. In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party - a People\u2019s Vote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although People\u2019s Vote is calling for the Labour plan to be subject to rigorous scrutiny, in fact a critical analysis has already been published - by the People\u2019s Vote campaign itself. Last month it published <a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/in/pages/17280/attachments/original/1548078482/shinealight_final3.pdf?1548078482\">a 16-page briefing paper (pdf)</a> highlighting problems with the \u201cNorway plus\u201d plan, with Labour\u2019s plan, and with a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <p>(Compared to the usual standard of political attack documents, this one is remarkably good. In recent months the People\u2019s Vote campaign has started devoting more of its time to highlighting the flaws with alternative Brexit plans, on the grounds that people will only back a second referendum when the alternatives have been shown to be unsatisfactory. The campaign is well funded, and the briefing material is produces is currently of a much higher quality than anything journalists get from either the Conservatives or Labour.)</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5bfaffe4b042feedcb8e6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T09:36:20.701Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour's five demands for Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is an extract from<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/jeremy-corbyn-lays-labours-five-brexit-demands-letter-theresa-may/\"> Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May, setting out Labour\u2019s five demands for Brexit.</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour has long argued that the government should change its negotiating red lines and seek significant changes to the political declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU.

This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tariff and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.

These new conditions are different, because they read like the outline of something that could eventually pass the Commons.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May clashed with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk during Brexit talks in Brussels but has secured agreement for a fresh round of formal negotiations to break the impasse. Labour has denied it would automatically move to back a second referendum if Theresa May rejected Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s offer of support for a revised Brexit deal, despite a shadow minister suggesting that would be the next step. British exporters sending goods to far-flung destinations in the coming days risk being locked out of harbours around the world as a no-deal Brexit looms, business leaders have warned. The Bank of England has warned the economy is on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis, as evidence suggests Brexit jitters are spreading from companies to consumers. As Larry Elliott report, in its latest quarterly health check, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2019 from 1.7% to 1.2%, blaming a slowing global economy as well as Brexit uncertainty for the sharp downward revision, and said there was a 25% chance of a recession this year. Threadneedle Street said its gloomier forecast assumed the UK\u2019s departure from the EU in seven weeks goes smoothly. If the prediction comes true, it would be the slowest growth since the economy contracted by 4.2% in 2009, during the financial crisis. The government has formally announced that UK nationals could face high roaming charges for using their mobile phones in the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after the news was quietly disclosed a day earlier. Owen Smith, the Labour MP who challenged Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, has said he is considering quitting the party, amid a growing backlash over the leadership\u2019s Brexit stance. Fatal stabbings in England and Wales have reached their highest level since records began more than 70 years ago, official figures show. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The European commission has posted this on Twitter, its growth forecasts for all EU countries. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Here are tweets from three journalists on the Corbyn Brexit letter. From the Financial Times\u2019 George Parker From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former Cabinet Office minister who is one of the Tories most determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit, has welcomed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit proposals. Theresa May clashed with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk during Brexit talks but has secured agreement for a fresh round of formal negotiations to break the impasse, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports in his story on the PM\u2019s day in Brussels. Some MEPS are warning against alarmism, predicting a negotiated Brexit will ultimately prevail because it is not in the interest of Brussels to have \u201ca full-blown Brexit crisis\u201d in the run-up to critical European elections in May. Speaking to the Guardian from Brussels, the Greek MEP Giorgos Kyrtsos insisted that it was still too early for concessions to be made by Brussels. \u201cTalking tough is the EU method. At this stage everyone wants to be seen to be talking tough before an initiative can be taken to reach a compromise,\u201d said the conservative who sits on the European People\u2019s Party working group that deals with Brexit. He went on: Today was about gaining political time. In the end there will be a negotiated Brexit, that at least is the main scenario being discussed [among MEPS] in Brussels. I don\u2019t think, in all honesty, there\u2019s a combative mood here. The EU knows it can\u2019t afford a hard Brexit economically or politically, and it doesn\u2019t want a full-blown crisis that could strengthen Eurosceptic and extreme rightwing anti-European parties in the run-up to [May\u2019s] elections. Senior politicians in the US have warned that a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the US would be in jeopardy if there there was a return to a hard border in Ireland Democratic congressman Richard Neal, who chairs the ways and means committee, the chief tax-writing committee of the United States House of Representatives which oversees trade deals, said he had already raised it with the US trade representative. He said: We want a bilateral trade agreement with the UK, but at the same time I think I would raise concerns that I raise now, and that would be obviously no return to a hard border. Republican congressman Peter King also expressed concern. He said: We as Irish Americans make it clear when we deal with the British that this is very, very important and if the British want to consider any kind of trade agreement with the United States, it\u2019s important that soft border is maintained. They were speaking during a trip by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney who is on a campaign to secure a seat on the UN security council. Coveney said he was not there to ask US lawmakers to take sides. He told RT\u00c9 News: We\u2019re not here in the US to lobby against the UK. We\u2019re not asking people to take sides - an Irish position or a UK position. Owen Smith, the Labour MP and pro-European who challenged Jeremy Corbyn unsuccessfully for the party leadership in 2016, has told Radio 5 Live that he is considering leaving the party because of its stance on Brexit. In an interview with Emma Barnett, when asked if he could in all conscience remain in the party, Smith replied: I think that\u2019s a very good question - and I think it\u2019s something that I and lots of other people are considering right now. But Smith also said that no decision about his future in the party was imminent. Explaining his thinking, he said: I haven\u2019t come to that decision [to leave the party]. But I do think [long pause] ... I stood to be a Labour MP with an understanding of what I was doing, what my values were, what the values of the Labour party were, what I wanted to do for the community I grew up in, which I am very, very proud to represent. And at the moment I may be asked by the Labour party to row in behind a policy decision that they know, and the government knows, is going to make the people I represent poorer, and I think more fundamentally, actually, is at odds with the internationalist, social democratic values that I believe in. Because Brexit is ultimately a nativist, nostalgic, rightwing, ideological programme, that was sold on lies, that was deceitfully won, and unfortunately is going, I think, to go through. And that must beg questions for those of us who are [coming] from my perspective. From AFP\u2019s Dave Clark Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s clip for broadcasters. (It wasn\u2019t really an interview. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg had three questions, but May did not engage with them, and the whole thing was over in two minutes.) May said that she had rebuked Donald Tusk, the European council president, for saying yesterday that those who promoted Brexit without a plan for how it would be delivered deserved a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d. (See 3.24pm.) She said that she and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, had agreed to resume Brexit talks at official level in an attempt to find a solution to the backstop issue. She said: Crucially, President Junker and I have agreed that talks will now start to find a way through this, to find a way to get this over the line, and to deliver on the concerns that parliament has, so that we get a majority in parliament. She said today\u2019s talks had been \u201crobust\u201d but \u201cconstructive\u201d. She said, in her meetings with EU leaders, she had said the UK needed legally-binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to meet parliament\u2019s concerns over the backstop. (Much of what she said on this just repeated the position set out by Number 10 in its overnight briefing note - see 10.12am.) She claimed that EU leaders were also keen to achieve a Brexit deal. She said: What I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal. My work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time, and I will be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that. She insisted that she was going to deliver Brexit. She said: And I\u2019m clear that I\u2019m going to deliver Brexit, I\u2019m going to deliver it on time, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do for the British public. I will be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that. This is what Theresa May said about Donald Tusk\u2019s anti-Brexit \u201chell\u201d comment yesterday. She said: I\u2019ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday, which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom. The point I made to him was that we should both be working to ensure that we can deliver a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future, and that\u2019s what he should be focusing on. As a reminder, this is what Tusk, the president of the European council, said yesterday. By the way, I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely. Theresa May is now speaking to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. She says she has had a good series of meetings. They have been robust, but constructive, she says. She says she explained that there must be changes to the backstop. They will have to be legally binding, she says. She says she and Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed that there will be further talks. Q: Donald Tusk talked about hell yesterday. Aren\u2019t you stuck in some kind of purgatory? May says she spoke to Tusk about what he said. She told him it was not helpful. Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, have been speaking to journalists after their meeting with Theresa May. Here are the key points. Verhofstadt said May told them that the UK accepted that there had to be a backstop of some kind in the withdrawal agreement. He said she \u201cassured us that there will be a backstop\u201d. This reflects what May said in her speech in Belfast on Tuesday - an admission that angered some Tory Brexiters who thought that, because the Brady amendment they passed said that the backstop should be \u201creplaced\u201d, it would be removed in its entirety. Verhofstadt said: It is important that Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop, that - what she said already in Belfast - there is no question to remove the backstop. Because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday agreement, safeguarding the internal market and safeguarding also the peace process. For us, an all-weather backstop insurance is absolutely key. Verhofstadt said that any problems with the backstop should be addressed in the political declaration. Tajani said a no-deal Brexit would be \u201can economic and human catastrophe\u201d. It would be \u201ca very dangerous solution\u201d, he said. Verhofstadt said it would be \u201ca disaster\u201d. He said: It is a disaster on both sides of the Channel and it is, in fact, irresponsible from some politicians in Britain to go for such a no deal and to prefer such a no deal. Verhofstadt said May should seek a cross-party solution to Brexit. Without that, she would not have a solid majority for a deal, he said. We cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons. Cross-party cooperation is the way forward, and I can say that we welcome also the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written today to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit. It is important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has recorded a clip for the BBC saying Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May setting out five demands for Brexit (see 9.36am) does not rule out a second referendum. Corbyn will be writing to Labour members today confirming this, he says. Starmer is keen to speak out because he has become the most prominent champion in the party of those pushing for a second referendum. What he is saying in this clip, and what he said in a tweet earlier, echoes what he said in his speech to the party conference, after delegates agreed a compromise motion saying: \u201cIf we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.\u201d But no one ever said the Corbyn letter does rule out a second referendum - because it doesn\u2019t. What is significant about it is that at no point, in a reasonably long letter, does Corbyn even mention a second referendum, even though it did feature in the Labour amendment on Brexit debated last week. When Labour\u2019s Brexit policy was agreed at party conference, some in the party assumed that it meant a failure to trigger a general election would automatically lead to the party backing a second referendum as its next move. Corbyn\u2019s letter confirms that that is not the case - because the priority now seems to be getting Theresa May to accept Labour\u2019s proposals. Corbyn does not rule out voting for a second referendum if May rejects his plan, but party sources have been saying explicitly today that that is not the leadership position. (See 11.17am.) Starmer is fighting a rearguard battle to keep the second referendum option in play. But today\u2019s developments make the prospect of Corbyn embracing this idea seem even more extremely improbable than it was, which is why pro-Europeans in the party have been complaining. (See 9.13am.) Theresa May is now meeting Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament. My colleague Daniel Boffey says their handshake looked more cordial than the May/Juncker one. The SNP has criticised Jeremy Corbyn for reaching out to Theresa May over Brexit. In a statement Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, said: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s confirmation that he will throw support behind Theresa May\u2019s disastrous Brexit deal is a severe blow to businesses, workers and people across the UK who are rightly concerned over the impact of Brexit. The attempt by the Labour leader to mask this as anything other than support for a Tory-driven, economy-wrecking Brexit deal is utterly disingenuous. It is worth pointing out that those Labour MPs who have been pushing for a Norway plus Brexit, or \u201cCommon Market 2.0\u201d as it is now being dubbed, have welcomed the Jeremy Corbyn letter. Even though Corbyn is not explicitly backing Norway plus, which would involve staying in the single market and the customs union, his plan - staying in the customs union and \u201cclose alignment with the single market\u201d - comes close. This is from Stephen Kinnock. And these are from Lucy Powell, co-author of the recent Common Market 2.0 paper (pdf). Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who also supports a version of Norway plus, has welcomed the Corbyn initiative too. Turning back to the Jeremy Corbyn letter, the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar has an interesting line. And here is some comment from journalists on the joint May/Juncker statement. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn And the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster has a whole Twitter thread on this. It starts here. Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have issued this joint statement after their talks. Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK\u2019s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system. The prime minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week\u2019s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the withdrawal agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament. President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European parliament and the EU27. The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions. Here are the key lines. May and Juncker played down prospect of any breakthrough on Brexit before the end of February. Juncker told May during their \u201crobust\u201d talks that withdrawal agreement will not be re-opened. But Juncker also said the EU would be willing to change the political declaration on the future relationship. Downing Street has given its initial response to the Jeremy Corbyn Brexit letter. (See 9.36am.) A spokesperson said: We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed. Pressed on the arrangements for next week, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, suggested that the debate on Thursday next week would either be on a revised Brexit plan, or else a general Brexit debate on an amendable motion. The government has said repeatedly that it wants a vote on a revised deal as soon as possible and that, if that does not happen by Thursday, there will be a debate anyway on Thursday on Brexit, on amendable motion. Leadsom seemed to be implying that, if Theresa May does get a revised deal next week, the debate and vote on that deal would be on the Thursday. At that point John Bercow, the speaker, intervened to say that, when he saw the draft business for next week last night, it did not include the promised Brexit debate. He said he was alarmed about that, and he said it was very important for the government to honour its promises to MPs about the Brexit vote. Earlier in the Commons Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, accused the government of implementing a \u201cTory triple-whammy tourist tax\u201d. He made the claim as he asked an urgent question about the HuffPost report saying, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, mobile phone roaming charges could return for people visiting Europe under government plans. Watson said: This is how holidaymakers have been hit by Brexit chaos. One, the value of the pound had plummeted increasing the cost of family holidays. Two, we are going to have to pay for visas to visit the EU. Three, we are going to be hit by a Brexit bill to use our mobile abroad. If [Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary] does not want to go down in history as the minister for the Tory triple-whammy tourist tax, I suggest he takes a different course. Jeremy Wright said that, although the regulations would allow mobile phone operators to impose roaming charges in the event of a no-deal Brexit, \u201cmany mobile operators, including those covering more than 85% of subscribers, have already said they have no current plans to change approach to roaming.\u201d But Watson said that this assurance was not good enough for consumers. He told MPs: [Wright] said that mobile phone operators have said that they have no plans to raise roaming charges. But he and I both know, and more importantly voters know, what that phrase really means. The reason the EU introduced free roaming in the first place is because the telecoms companies could not be trusted to give consumers a fair deal. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week. It does include a debate on Brexit on Thursday. She said the government was still committed to having a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on a revised deal as soon as possible. If this does not happen by Wednesday next week, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs, followed by the debate on Thursday, Leadsom said. Theresa May encountered an anti-Brexit campaigner when she arrived the the European commission HQ in Brussels, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. A senior Labour source says that Matthew Pennycook\u2019s claim that the party will move to backing a second referendum if Theresa May does not accept its Brexit proposals in full (see 10.52am) does not reflect the official leadership position. The Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second referendum, have criticised Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit offer to the government. Tom Brake, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said: Jeremy Corbyn has turned his back on the millions of Labour members and voters who demand a better future than Tory Brexit Britain. He has chosen to forget that Labour conference voted for the party to campaign for a people\u2019s vote after failing to secure a general election. After thirty years sitting on the backbenches arguing for more power for members and against the EU, Corbyn has finally chosen to go for the latter at the expense of the former. Matthew Pennycook, a shadow Brexit minister, says that if Theresa May does not accept Labour\u2019s Brexit conditions (see 9.36am) \u201cin full\u201d, the party must move to backing a second referendum. What Pennycook is saying is entirely consistent with the Labour Brexit policy agreed at party conference. But that document was a masterpiece of elasticity, designed to accommodate all opinion within the party ranging from People\u2019s Vote to Corbynite Lexitism. In truth, Pennycook\u2019s message is rather different from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. In his letter, Corbyn did not say anything about what Labour might do if May does not accept his proposals and he did not raise the issue of a second referendum at all. Also, whereas Pennycook is saying May must accept Labour\u2019s demands \u201cin full\u201d, the Corbyn letter said any negotiation with the EU would require \u201cflexibility and compromise\u201d. I\u2019ve asked Corbyn\u2019s office if they support what Pennycook is saying. I will post the response when I get it. On the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, said that the government would be happy to talk with Labour further about its Brexit plans. He said that he had not received any \u201cdirect overtures\u201d from the party about talks, but that he would be willing to discuss the issue with Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary. But he also claimed that the Labour proposals (see 9.36am) reflected \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. A key part of any discussion would be \u201cto understand exactly where the Labour frontbench is coming from\u201d, he said. He went on: I would be saying to Labour, \u2018What is it that you don\u2019t like about what is in the political declaration at the moment?\u2019, because what we have there is an idea of a customs arrangement with the European Union that still allows us to have an independent trade policy on top of that, but while getting access - tariff-free and quota-free - for our goods and agriculture to the European market. I would be asking what on earth they mean when they say they want to be in a customs union with the EU but also for Britain to have a say in EU trade policy with other countries. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s allowed under the European treaties. This seems to be wishful thinking. Here are three more Labour MPs expressing doubts about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit offer to Theresa May. From Darren Jones From Stephen Doughty From Ben Bradshaw Theresa May has arrived in Brussels. Last night Downing Street sent out a briefing note setting out the key messages that Theresa May will be delivering in Brussels today. For the record, here they are in full. The UK\u2019s objective is to find a way to guarantee we cannot, and will not, be trapped in the backstop. The prime minister is open to different ways to achieve this, but is clear it must be legally binding and therefore will require changes to the withdrawal agreement. Securing such changes will not be easy. The withdrawal agreement was the product of much hard work and was negotiated in good faith. However, parliament voted by a significant majority in the meaningful vote, sending an unequivocal message that change is required. Last week, parliament made clear that for the first time it could support the withdrawal agreement, subject to changes to the backstop. Importantly, MPs also reiterated their absolute commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal. While Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop \u2013 so this is an issue that needs to be resolved, not just for our Conservative MPs and the DUP, but for MPs across the House. To achieve this we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop; and considering legal changes to the current backstop that could provide the type of guarantees MPs from all sides have said they need. The government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes. The EU shares the UK\u2019s commitment to leave with a deal. We must show determination and do what it takes to now get the deal over the line. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has released a response to the Corbyn letter from the Labour MP Phil Wilson, one of its supporters. He calls for the Corbyn plan to be scrutinised - so that it can be rejected. He says: It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer. What\u2019s needed now is for this and any other alternative Brexit proposal to be given the same level of scrutiny that led parliament to reject the government\u2019s deal last month. That will show that no number of tweaks to the political declaration pretending we can have our cake and eat it can change the reality that any Brexit deal means leaving the EU without clarity or certainty about where we will end up. Our party conference agreed last year that if it couldn\u2019t get a general election it should explore other options including a new public vote. The party and parliament should examine this option so that if and when it is rejected, Labour can fulfil the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its voters and members by campaigning to give the public the final say. In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party - a People\u2019s Vote. Although People\u2019s Vote is calling for the Labour plan to be subject to rigorous scrutiny, in fact a critical analysis has already been published - by the People\u2019s Vote campaign itself. Last month it published a 16-page briefing paper (pdf) highlighting problems with the \u201cNorway plus\u201d plan, with Labour\u2019s plan, and with a no-deal Brexit. (Compared to the usual standard of political attack documents, this one is remarkably good. In recent months the People\u2019s Vote campaign has started devoting more of its time to highlighting the flaws with alternative Brexit plans, on the grounds that people will only back a second referendum when the alternatives have been shown to be unsatisfactory. The campaign is well funded, and the briefing material is produces is currently of a much higher quality than anything journalists get from either the Conservatives or Labour.) Here is an extract from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May, setting out Labour\u2019s five demands for Brexit. Labour has long argued that the government should change its negotiating red lines and seek significant changes to the political declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked. The changes we would need to see include: A permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union. This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tariff and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. As you are aware, a customs union is supported by most businesses and trade unions. Close alignment with the single market. This should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution. Dynamic alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with evolving standards across Europe as a minimum, allowing the UK to lead the way. Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship. We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules. Theresa May is in Brussels today for her first face-to-face talks with EU leaders since her Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports in a handy scene-setter, May does not have a firm alternative plan to propose, suggesting that her meetings might achieve little. But this morning there is an alternative plan B on the table. As the Guardian reports, Jeremy Corbyn has written to May setting out five changes to the Brexit plan that could lead to Labour MPs backing it in the Commons. Labour used to have six tests for Brexit, which seemed drafted in such a way that the PM\u2019s plan was always bound to fail. These new conditions are different, because they read like the outline of something that could eventually pass the Commons. Indeed, during PMQs yesterday, after listening to May\u2019s pro-European deputy David Lidington and the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Ken Clarke told the House that he got the impression that if the two of them were left in a room together \u201cthey would take about five minutes to agree a proposal that would take us smoothly through 29 March into proper negotiations.\u201d Here is the Corbyn letter. And a more readable version of the full text is here. Corbyn\u2019s letter is addressed to the PM. But it will be read closely in Brussels and, as Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard points out in his London Playbook briefing,it has the potential to change the dynamics around May\u2019s talks. Blanchard says: The PM\u2019s whole message to the EU, remember, is that there\u2019s no way to get the Brexit deal through parliament without reopening the withdrawal agreement and rewriting the backstop. As of today, that is no longer true. Juncker and co. can politely suggest she go back home and cut a deal with the opposition if she wants to get this thing done. One Labour source confirmed last night: \u201cThis is as much a letter for the EU as it is for Theresa May.\u201d But Labour pro-Europeans, who were hoping that after failing to trigger a general election through a confidence vote, the party would be campaigning and voting for a second referendum, not offering to facilitate Brexit, have reacted angrily to Corbyn\u2019s move. These are from Chuka Umunna, one of the leading Labour supporters of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. This is from Owen Smith, who challenged Corbyn unsuccessfully for the Labour leadership in 2016, partly fighting on the grounds that Labour should be open to a second referendum. This is from David Lammy. And this is from Chris Leslie, who was shadow chancellor for a short period after the 2015 election. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, take part in a debate on the future of the Conservative party at the Resolution Foundation. 10am (UK time): Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels. At 1pm she will meet Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliment\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman. And at 2pm she will meet Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement about next week\u2019s Commons business. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post after PMQs and another when I finish, at about 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In a statement released on behalf of the trainer he said:<br></p> <p>\u201cI have been aware of the recent news about Equine Influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request, our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light [on Wednesday] evening. The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about biosecurity and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. </p> <p>\u201cBankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated. We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. </p> <p>\u201cWhen new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c9181a2aa5976d2fccaea168a1dc0b6337f8b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c9181a2aa5976d2fccaea168a1dc0b6337f8b7/83_144_4687_2813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trainer Donald McCain\u2019s yard is at the centre of the equine flu outbreak which has shutdown racing in Britain on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trainer Donald McCain\u2019s yard is at the centre of the equine flu outbreak which has shutdown racing in Britain on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T14:59:59.257Z\">at 2.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c5c3bdee4b00ef6acc69464\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T14:22:55.187Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bookies' share prices take a hit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One business for whom the racing shutdown is definitely not good news is the bookmaking industry. Foreign racing is filling the screens this afternoon but betting shops and online bookies are taking a hit and that has been reflected in the share prices today. As of 2pm William Hill shares were down around 2.28%, GVC Holdings (which own Ladbrokes and Coral) had suffered a 2.71% hit and Paddy Power/Betfair were registering a 2.3% downturn.</p> <p>Philip Trampe of <a href=\"http://bettingexpert.com/\">Bettingexpert.com</a> commented: \u201cThe importance of British racing to the industry is reflected in the share price movements of the major betting concerns today, especially those with a large retail exposure. For example, William Hill, Paddy Power Betfair and GVC all suffered as their share price slipped because of fears of the equine flu.</p> <p>\u201cLosing out on four meetings on a quiet Thursday in February might not seem like a big deal, but in fact, it\u2019s estimated that today\u2019s cancellations could end up costing the industry \u00a320m. This goes to show how loyal a section of the British-facing industry\u2019s customer base is to racing in this country and it\u2019s not a given their betting spend transfers elsewhere on a like-for-like basis.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9105b0a8bca565b0fc06e75468ee9f85feebec21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9105b0a8bca565b0fc06e75468ee9f85feebec21/0_134_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ladbrokes have suffered a fall in shares today along with other bookmakers after the racing shutdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladbrokes have suffered a fall in shares today along with other bookmakers after the racing shutdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5c3a86e4b042feedcb91d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T14:07:35.826Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The veteran Newmarket trainer Mark Tompkins is not happy at the racing shutdown and <a href=\"http://www.marktompkins.co.uk/en/daily-news-a-runners\">has used his website to voice his frustration with the general level of cleanliness at racecourse stables</a>:</p> <p>\u2018We have so much racing nowadays and with racecourses wanting more and more fixtures they don\u2019t have time to clean the stables properly. I am also certain they do not use the right disinfectant either. Even yesterday at Ludlow horse feed was found in a stable from the previous meeting. A horse had already been put in the box before it was discovered. It obviously hadn\u2019t been mucked out, or disinfected, as all this costs money and manpower, which the racecourses say they cannot afford, or it is a cost cutting measure. We have had a lot of examples in recent months of this. </p> <p>We also have a sale nearly every day, horses are running all over the world and transporters bring them in from every point of the globe. All this is very exciting for certain people but it means the risk of an outbreak is enlarged and this is possibly what is happening in this case. There is also a rise of pre-training yards, who are not licenced and are under financial pressure, and that, once again, increases the risk of infection as they move from yard to yard. The BHA seem to be powerless in preventing an outbreak and I just hope that this now concentrates a few more minds, but it will cost a lot more money.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59851a21d1dbac978fefdeb1f3f85358cee28a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59851a21d1dbac978fefdeb1f3f85358cee28a9f/0_768_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newmarket trainer Mark Tompkins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newmarket trainer Mark Tompkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T15:38:40.064Z\">at 3.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c5c3874e4b042feedcb91c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T13:57:44.540Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The equine flu outbreak in Australia in 2007 was much more serious than this latest incident threatens to be. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/24/horseracing.sport\">Here\u2019s our racing correspondent Greg Wood</a> on the background to that story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faf4cad7fce4fab8fcba3d2503ba66ee6d25582b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faf4cad7fce4fab8fcba3d2503ba66ee6d25582b/0_103_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the stable staff leads her horse out of the Randwick race meeting after the card was abandoned in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the stable staff leads her horse out of the Randwick race meeting after the card was abandoned in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5c30b6e4b00ef6acc693db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T13:24:01.026Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The reason Wolverhampton has been called off on Saturday is reportedly that a horse from Donald McCain\u2019s yard ran earlier this week.

The British Horseracing Authority have announced that horse racing will not resume until next Wednesday at the earliest. A decision on a possible resumption on that date will be taken on Monday. You can read the full press release here. With the meetings at the weekend almost certain to be called off, speculation will soon start if Newbury\u2019s important card on Saturday is lost. Trainers would not want to lose races such as the Betfair Hurdle and the Denman Chase, or the Kingmaker Chase at Warwick for that matter. Betfair are also sponsoring at Ascot the following weekend, where the Betfair Ascot Chase is due to take place, and the option of running the big races scheduled for Newbury there will surely be one that will be looked at in the coming days. The Racing Post are now confirming earlier speculation here about the extent of the testing now taking place in yards throughout the country. The Post are reporting that \u2018The lockdown applies to British-based trainers who had runners at Ayr or Ludlow on Wednesday or Wolverhampton on Monday. They will have their entire string tested on Friday and no declarations will be accepted from the trainers until the all-clear is given.\u2019 Meanwhile, the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s chief regulatory officer has been speaking to the BBC: If all the horses that ran at Ludlow and Ayr on Wednesday are having to be tested and a stables such as that of prominent trainer Paul Nicholls is in lockdown then it is getting increasingly difficult to envisage racing resuming in the very near future. Lovely gesture from Huntingdon racecourse: More very useful information from racing journalist Terry Norman on the extent of the tests and work being done across British racing stables right now: Trainer Donald McCain has confirmed that three horses in his yard have tested positive for equine flu. In a statement released on behalf of the trainer he said: \u201cI have been aware of the recent news about Equine Influenza outbreaks in France and Ireland, and over the last couple of days, I have been concerned about the health status of a small number of horses in the yard. Their welfare is at the front of our minds, so at my request, our veterinary surgeon has examined them regularly and we have followed his advice on testing and treatment. It was by following this protocol that the positive results for equine flu came to light [on Wednesday] evening. The BHA were contacted immediately and we are liaising closely with them about biosecurity and management of all the horses at Bankhouse. \u201cBankhouse follows all the available advice on disease control and all our horses are fully inoculated. We are scrupulous about observing the health status of horses in our care and taking the necessary steps to treat any condition that may affect them. It follows we would never race any horses that we could have known were infected. Over the last two months, all potential runners have been scoped and their blood checked within 36 hours of their races to ensure that only healthy horses compete for the yard. \u201cWhen new horses arrive at our yard we, as much as possible, try to keep them separate but at this stage cannot know if the infection came from recent arrivals or from horses returning from racing. We have three confirmed cases and this morning have taken blood and swabs from all the others for testing.\u201d One business for whom the racing shutdown is definitely not good news is the bookmaking industry. Foreign racing is filling the screens this afternoon but betting shops and online bookies are taking a hit and that has been reflected in the share prices today. As of 2pm William Hill shares were down around 2.28%, GVC Holdings (which own Ladbrokes and Coral) had suffered a 2.71% hit and Paddy Power/Betfair were registering a 2.3% downturn. Philip Trampe of Bettingexpert.com commented: \u201cThe importance of British racing to the industry is reflected in the share price movements of the major betting concerns today, especially those with a large retail exposure. For example, William Hill, Paddy Power Betfair and GVC all suffered as their share price slipped because of fears of the equine flu. \u201cLosing out on four meetings on a quiet Thursday in February might not seem like a big deal, but in fact, it\u2019s estimated that today\u2019s cancellations could end up costing the industry \u00a320m. This goes to show how loyal a section of the British-facing industry\u2019s customer base is to racing in this country and it\u2019s not a given their betting spend transfers elsewhere on a like-for-like basis.\u201d The veteran Newmarket trainer Mark Tompkins is not happy at the racing shutdown and has used his website to voice his frustration with the general level of cleanliness at racecourse stables: \u2018We have so much racing nowadays and with racecourses wanting more and more fixtures they don\u2019t have time to clean the stables properly. I am also certain they do not use the right disinfectant either. Even yesterday at Ludlow horse feed was found in a stable from the previous meeting. A horse had already been put in the box before it was discovered. It obviously hadn\u2019t been mucked out, or disinfected, as all this costs money and manpower, which the racecourses say they cannot afford, or it is a cost cutting measure. We have had a lot of examples in recent months of this. We also have a sale nearly every day, horses are running all over the world and transporters bring them in from every point of the globe. All this is very exciting for certain people but it means the risk of an outbreak is enlarged and this is possibly what is happening in this case. There is also a rise of pre-training yards, who are not licenced and are under financial pressure, and that, once again, increases the risk of infection as they move from yard to yard. The BHA seem to be powerless in preventing an outbreak and I just hope that this now concentrates a few more minds, but it will cost a lot more money.\u2019 The equine flu outbreak in Australia in 2007 was much more serious than this latest incident threatens to be. Here\u2019s our racing correspondent Greg Wood on the background to that story. The reason Wolverhampton has been called off on Saturday is reportedly that a horse from Donald McCain\u2019s yard ran earlier this week. Racing journalist and handicapper Terry Norman has some interesting background on what is happening in stables around Britain now: You can sample the delights of \u2018virtual racing\u2019 here (the \u2018action\u2019 starts at 01:21): One of the betting products on offer in bookmakers these days is \u2018virtual racing\u2019, which many have been surprised to find out actually exists. There was an appropriate winner this lunchtime according to one well-known member of the racing Twitterati, with one wag suggesting \u2018Egg and Chips\u2019 had become the bookies\u2019 bread and butter (ouch): Interesting news from Timeform pundit Martin Dixon about the situation at Donald McCain\u2019s yard, the stable at the centre of the current outbreak affecting the horse racing industry: For those of you tuning into the World at One on Radio 4, Sky Sports Racing presenter Gina Bryce will be discussing the current situation and the issues raised by the equine flu outbreak at around 1.25pm: Following on from Professor Proudman\u2019s comments there was a useful intervention from ITV Racing pundit Kevin Blake this lunchtime on Sky Sports Racing, especially on why \u201csome of the fears and comparisons to the Australian outbreaks in 2007 are exaggerated\u201d. This is well worth a listen: Professor Christopher Proudman, head of the school of veterinary medicine at the University of Surrey, has provided some background on the current racing crisis: \u201cEquine influenza is a highly infectious respiratory disease that affects all horses causing symptoms similar to those experienced by people with influenza. Infected horses cannot train or race for several weeks and some horses may develop severe, secondary bacterial infections. \u201cThe UK horse population has been largely free from influenza for several decades due to a rigorous vaccination policy implemented by the regulators of equestrian sports, including horse racing, and a nationwide surveillance and testing programme supported financially by the racing industry [via the Horserace Betting Levy Board]. \u201cIt is a tribute to the effectiveness of disease surveillance that the current outbreak has been detected so early, to date only three cases have been detected in racehorses. The early, decisive action taken by the British Horseracing Authority, the regulatory body of UK horse racing, will minimise the risk of transmission of the virus between racehorses, thereby minimising the impact of this serious threat to horse welfare.\u201d The Cheltenham Festival, which was called off in 2001 after the foot and mouth outbreak, has been uppermost in the minds of racing followers after last night\u2019s shock news. But officials at the track appear confident the precautions taken by the British Horseracing Authroity should ensure the meeting goes ahead. A statement from Cheltenham Racecourse given to Sky Sports Racing read: \u201cWe are working with the BHA on this matter and hope that the early actions of the BHA will ensure that this outbreak of Equine Influenza can be contained. We look forward to racing resuming as soon as possible, and hope that this will be well in advance of the Festival in five weeks\u2019 time.\u201d It\u2019s not just racecourses that are affected by the equine flu outbreak. Horse movements are being restricted in a number of areas. Lambourn in Berkshire is the most important centre for jumps racing in the country: The bookies are not exactly scraping around for events to bet on with racing at Sha Tin, Thurles and Meydan keeping the \u2018racing\u2019 show on the road today but Paddy Power have got in on the act and are now betting on when racing will resume: The Animal Health Trust have issued useful guidelines with regard to the equine flu outbreak which can be read in full here. Live updates can be followed via @equiflunet Warwick are also due to race on Saturday with the reappearance of the exciting Kalashnikov in the Kingmaker Novice Chase and the OLBG Mares\u2019 Hurdle the highlights. That track is also on standby awaiting the expected announcement from the British Horseracing Authority later today: The next major race meeting is at Newbury on Saturday when the highlights include the big betting race of the month, the Betfair Hurdle, and the clash between King George winner Clan Des Obeaux and Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Native River in the Denman Chase. Trainers, who want to run their horses in important prep races for the Cheltenham Festival; punters, who will by then be desperate for a bet on domestic racing, and the sponsors will be hoping the card gets the go-ahead. BBC sports journalist Alistair Magowan is asking the question we\u2019re all asking, well at least the male half of the population anyway: They race at Thurles today and the Irish racing authorities have announced that racing will continue in Ireland. However, British trainers will not be able to enter horses in Irish races for the moment. Dr Lynn Hillyer of the the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board says: \u201cWe have taken the precaution of restricting entries here from Britain. It is a prudent step in the short term for us to restrict runners here from Britain.\u201d Although the British Horseracing Authority are not going to make an announcement until Thursday evening about the prospects for racing on Friday, Wolverhampton have already called off their scheduled Saturday all-weather fixture. One of the major concerns about the equine flu outbreak was the fact that there were runners from Ireland at Ayr yesterday, potentially putting the sport across the Irish Sea at risk. The Ayr runners were from the Gordon Elliott yard, and the trainer has just issued this statement via his Betfair blog: \u201cThe horses we ran at Ayr yesterday never came back to our yard and instead went to a non-racing isolation yard that is about twenty five minutes away from where we are based. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that the chances of this effecting [sic] our runners from yesterday is very remote but we can\u2019t take any chances whatsoever and those horses that went to Ayr will be quarantined as long as they have to be. \u201cHopefully everything will get back to normal in Britain as quickly as possible but from our point of view it\u2019s business as usual and we\u2019re sending seven horses to Thurles today.\u201d The BHA has just issued an update (which you can read in full here) on its efforts to deal with the outbreak of equine influenza which forced the cancellation of all racing in Britain today, emphasising that it is \u201cstill in the early stages of assessing the scale and severity of the outbreak\u201d. It confirms that \u201cfurther test results\u201d, presumably including those from the two horses which raced yesterday from the affected yard, should be known \u201cthis evening\u201d. Once the results are back, the BHA will convene a meeting with its vets \u201cto discuss the implications and a decision will then be made as to the impact on racing in the coming days\u201d. A decision on whether tomorrow\u2019s race meetings \u2013 at Bangor-on-Dee, Kempton Park, Southwell and Newcastle \u2013 will go ahead is also expected later this evening. The latest BHA update also points out that comparisons with the situation in Australia in 2007, when an outbreak of equine influenza affected racing for several months and caused hundreds of meetings to be abandoned, could be premature. \u201cThe situation here is not the same as the incident in Australia in 2007,\u201d it says. \u201cAustralian thoroughbreds are not vaccinated against influenza, while British thoroughbreds are, as the virus is endemic in the UK. Therefore an important barrier is in place to prevent the same situation occurring here. However, as we have seen in Europe, the virus has affected vaccinated horses in this case. The vaccine should however help reduce to a certain extent the effect and spread of the disease in thoroughbreds.\u201d Racing woke up to the news that all four scheduled race meetings in Britain on Thursday have been cancelled following confirmation of three cases of equine flu in vaccinated horses in a racing yard which sent runners to the meetings at Ayr and Ludlow on Thursday. The trainer concerned is believed to be Donald McCain, whose Bankhouse Stables in Cheshire is home to more than 100 horses and is the only racing stable to send runners to both of Wednesday\u2019s National Hunt meetings. Equine influenza is highly contagious, has an incubation period of between one and five days and its symptoms can persist for several weeks. In severe cases, a horse might be unable to exercise for two or three months and a severe outbreak would have the potential to close down Britain\u2019s racing industry for many weeks. The immediate question on the mind of every racing professional and fan is how long the shutdown is likely to continue, with the jumps season approaching its climax at the Festival meeting at Cheltenham next month and many valuable trials for those races scheduled over the next two weeks. The Festival is due to open on 12 March, in 33 days\u2019 time, and many trainers will be planning a run for their best horses over the next fortnight to put the finishes touches to regimes that have been geared towards the sport\u2019s showpiece event over the course of many months. Nearly 300 British-trained horses ran at last year\u2019s Festival and 82, almost one-third, made their final start between 20 and 33 days before the meeting. Newbury\u2019s card on Saturday, which includes the Betfair Hurdle, the Game Spirit Chase and the Denman Chase, a significant trial for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, is arguably the most significant card in Britain in the run-up to the Festival, while the Grade Two Kingmaker Chase at Warwick the same afternoon is a likely target for Kalashnikov, a leading contender for the Arkle Trophy in March. The final Grade One event in Britain before the Cheltenham Festival, meanwhile, is the Betfair Ascot Chase at Ascot on 16 February. Brant Dunshea, the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s chief regulatory officer, told Sky Sports Racing a few minutes ago that its priority is to establish whether the two horses to race at Ludlow and Ayr on Wednesday were incubating the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate in this country that our [racehorse] population is vaccinated against equine influenza,\u201d Dunshea said, \u201cbut we\u2019re still trying to understand what particular strain of equine influenza this is. The fact that it has appeared in a vaccinated population does cause us some concern, so we\u2019re working quickly to try and understand what\u2019s happened there. \u201cKey to our decision-making is understanding exactly the status of the horses that we know raced yesterday from the infected yard. We will have information in relation to samples taken from those two horses later this afternoon or early this evening.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Aleksander Ceferin has emphasised his firm opposition to a breakaway club \u201csuper league\u201d, and to Fifa\u2019s currently shelved proposals for a revamped Club World Cup, at the congress that confirmed his unopposed election as the Uefa president for another four years. At Uefa\u2019s annual congress in Rome, Ceferin committed to unspecified plans to \u201cdesign the club competitions of the future\u201d with the European Club Association, which is dominated by the biggest clubs, while also pledging to make European football more competitive. That appears to open the possibility, once the agreed football calendar ends in 2024, of a revamped Champions League with more matches in the group stage, the preferred option of the ECA president, Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus chairman. \u201cWhile we lead these two organisations,\u201d Ceferin said, referring to Uefa and the ECA, \u201cthere will be no \u2018Super League\u2019. It is a fact.\u201d Renewed concern about a breakaway competition from Uefa was sparked after the German magazine Der Spiegel published internal emails from some major clubs showing advanced exploration of the possibility. Agnelli told the Guardian last year he wanted the Champions League group stage to provide significantly more matches by playing in four groups of eight clubs rather than eight groups of four. Ceferin maintained he had been right to oppose the plans for a transformed four-yearly Club World Cup, with unnamed financial backers, promoted by the Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Projecting that Uefa will generate \u20ac5.72bn in 2019-20 principally from the Champions League, Europa League and European Championship, Ceferin called for constructive working with Fifa \u201crather than opposition\u201d, saying that respect means disagreeing with friends \u201cwhen we think in all humility that they are wrong\u201d. Infantino was also confirmed this week to be unopposed for re-election as Fifa president this summer. Greg Clarke, the Football Association chairman, won election as one of Uefa\u2019s nominated Fifa vice-presidents, which is guaranteed to a representative of the British home nations. That strengthens the English FA\u2019s position in international football relations, with David Gill already a Fifa council member, and will further encourage an FA bid to host the 2030 World Cup, which is under consideration. Ceferin said that Uefa would \u201cdo everything possible to bring the 2030 World Cup to our continent\u201d. Only five managers attended VAR briefing, says Ceferin Aleksander Ceferin has told Europe\u2019s top managers they have \u201cno excuses\u201d for complaining about video assistant referees any more \u2013 after only five of them came to a special briefing on the subject this week. \u201cWith VAR we prepared a meeting with all the coaches from Champions League [last 16] teams in Frankfurt on Monday and only five came,\u201d Ceferin said. He listed the five who made it \u2013 Massimiliano Allegri (Juventus), Bruno Genesio (Lyon), Thomas Tuchel (PSG), Eusebio Di Francesco (Roma) and S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (Porto) \u2013 before excusing J\u00fcrgen Klopp, as Liverpool were playing West Ham that night. The other clubs, which include Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, sent assistant coaches or other members of staff, including one that sent staff from their marketing department, Ceferin added. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not only a lack of respect for [Uefa\u2019s head of refereeing] Roberto Rosetti and his team, but the influence of managers is huge and if they complain about referees they should at least come see what the experts say about VAR.

But what has in the past been a frothy showbiz event, seen by many as a kitschy celebration of song and international community spirit, has taken on a political edge amid growing calls for an artistic and broadcaster boycott because it is being held in Israel. The host city of Tel Aviv has become the target of activists who object to Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine. The song contest is traditionally held in the country of origin of the previous year\u2019s winner. The first round of Eurovision in Australia will take place this weekend with a live telecast from the Gold Coast Convention Centre, broadcast by SBS. The lineup also includes former Killing Heidi vocalist Ella Hooper, drag queen Courtney Act, The Voice winner Alfie Arcuri and finalist Aydan Calafiore, Bachelor Girl\u2019s Tania Doko, singer-songwriter Leea Nanos and opera singer Mark Vincent. Australia first competed in Eurovision in 2015 and this will be the first year in which its representative will be decided by public vote rather than jury. However, the Palestinian-led international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement have called upon SBS to cancel its involvement, and have approached the Australian artists involved to discuss their concerns. The group began calls for boycott when Israeli pop star Netta Barzilai won the 2018 contest with her oddball entry, Toy. Since 2005, the BDS movement has called for musicians and other artists not to tour to Israel while it \u201cmaintains a regime of settler colonialism, apartheid and occupation over the Palestinian people\u201d as part of a broader program of non-violent intervention in the conflict. In September an open letter signed by artists including Candy Bowers, L-Fresh the Lion, Brian Eno and more, said: \u201cEurovision 2019 should be boycotted if it is hosted by Israel while it continues its grave, decades-old violations of Palestinian human rights.\u201d Activists also staged a protest outside SBS\u2019s headquarters in Sydney. In the wake of the protest, SBS threatened to sue the activists for use of the SBS logo in their publicity material. Pressure has also been growing on broadcasters internationally. Another petition in January called on BBC to press for Eurovision finals to be relocated. Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, has resisted calls to cancel its broadcast, but said it won\u2019t sanction any employees who refuse to cover it \u201con conscientious grounds\u201d. The UK, Italy and Montenegro are also running national finals this week. Guardian Australia understands there is internal unrest within the Australian broadcaster over its decision to participate in the song contest this year. Speaking to Guardian Australia under condition of anonymity, an SBS employee said there had \u201cdefinitely been some internal discussion\u201d over the ethics and politics of the Eurovision partnership, and over how to cover and promote the event in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex situation.

While emissions have been rising across the economy since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price after winning government in 2013, they have been falling in the electricity sector because of the closure of ageing coal plants and the rapid uptake of renewables. The lead researcher, ANU professor Andrew Blakers, says Australia is currently installing renewable power four or five times per capita faster than the European Union, Japan, China and the United States. That finding is based on preliminary data available for installations globally last year. Blakers says that trend is expected to continue, unless politics intervenes. \u201cThe electricity sector is on track to deliver Australia\u2019s entire Paris emissions reduction targets five years early, in 2025 \u2013 without the need for any creative accounting,\u201d he says. \u201cAustralia is on track to reach 50% renewable electricity in 2024 and 100% by 2032,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Australian renewable energy experience offers real hope for rapid global emissions reductions to preserve a living planet.\u201d The research notes that in the year to June 2018, total Australian emissions increased by 3.4 megatonnes substantially due to increased liquefied natural gas exports, but predicts that will moderate \u201cbecause of stabilisation of emissions from LNG, the government\u2019s Direct Action program and increased uptake of electric water heaters and electric vehicles\u201d. The research assumes emissions outside the electricity sector will increase annually by 2 megatonnes a year \u201cwhich is much smaller than decreases in the electricity sector from the uptake of wind and PV\u201d. \u201cThe overall decrease of 10-11 MT per year is fast enough to reach Australia\u2019s entire Paris target in 2025,\u201d it says. The ANU research suggests the net cost of achieving the Paris targets is zero, because renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The co-researcher Matthew Stocks says the price of electricity from large-scale solar PV and windfarms is currently about $50MWh \u201cand steadily falling\u201d. \u201cThis is below the cost of electricity from existing gas-fired power stations and is also below the cost of new-build gas and coal power stations,\u201d Stocks says. \u201cNearly all of the new power stations are either PV or wind.

Industry stakeholders have criticised the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities \u201cwith a net present value of billions of dollars\u201d because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies. A mix of coal power plants, pumped hydro and gas-fired power have been presented to the government as options for new electricity generation. The coal baron Trevor St Baker is proposing a $6bn plan for two new coal power plants. But the proposal has been criticised by the Victorian energy and environment minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, who has criticised the Morrison government for seeking to promote fossil fuels. The government says it is pursuing new generation projects to ensure sufficient dispatchable power is available to the grid to ensure power can be delivered reliably around the clock. But the new ANU research says stabilising the electricity grid when it is comprised of 50-100% renewable energy is straightforward using \u201coff-the-shelf techniques\u201d that are already widely used in Australia. The techniques referred to are storage, demand management, and strong interstate interconnection using high voltage transmission lines to smooth out the effect of local weather. The report says government subsidies for solar and wind are no longer required, but it would be valuable for governments to facilitate new private investment in storage and new transmission lines.",

      "bodyText": "Pat Dodson has joined Aboriginal organisations in the Kimberley in calling for action on reducing youth suicide, following the release of a long-awaited coronial report into the deaths of 13 children and young people. Senator Dodson said the report showed that \u201clittle or no progress\u201d had been made on reducing suicide rates in the Kimberley since a previous inquest was handed down in 2008, and that the latest report \u201cmust not join the 42 reports into Aboriginal well-being delivered over the last 15 years that simply sit and gather dust\u201d. \u201cThis report must lead a paradigm shift that leads to community-led solutions that address the clear sense of suffering, hopelessness and disillusionment that is being felt,\u201d he said. The 372-page report was delivered by the state coroner Ros Fogliani in Perth on Thursday and investigated the deaths of 13 people aged 10 to 24, who died in the Kimberley region from 2012 to 2016. Five of the children whose deaths were considered in the inquest were aged between 10 and 14, three were aged 16 or 17, and five were aged between 18 and 24. Fogliani said the \u201cprofoundly tragic\u201d deaths were \u201cshaped by the crushing effects of intergenerational trauma and poverty upon entire communities\u201d. \u201cThat community-wide trauma, generated multiple and prolonged exposures to individual traumatic events for these children and young persons,\u201d she said. The inquest was called in 2017, one year after the shocking suicide of a 10-year-old girl at Looma, and heard from 91 witnesses over 27 days of hearings in Perth, Fitzroy Crossing, Broome, Kununurra and Halls Creek. In four of the cases, Fogliani criticised the department of child protection for failing to undertake an assessment of the child\u2019s wellbeing, despite having cause to do so, and in one case she criticised the department of justice for failing to send a 12-year-old girl to mental health service, despite receiving a referral before her death that she may be vulnerable. The Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre (KALACC) said its findings were welcomed but not groundbreaking. \u201cIt affirms what we have been saying for 35 years \u2013 that culture needs to play a crucial role if any initiatives are to be successful,\u201d the KALACC chairwoman, Merle Carter, said. Many findings were similar recommendations made in another mass coronial report into suicides in the Kimberley in 2008. However, Folgiani\u2019s report includes a requirement in most recommendations that any new reforms, be they alcohol restrictions, mental health services, or cultural programs, be co-designed with community members. The 42 recommendations include: Introducing new laws to allow video statements to serve as evidence in chief in court in domestic violence cases, similar to laws governing evidence in sex abuse cases. Introducing the role of commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people , similar to the office that exists in Victoria. Investigating the creation of a banned drinkers register. Making the entire Kimberley region eligible for voluntary participation in the cashless welfare card scheme. Building a new mental health facility in the East Kimberley. Introducing mandatory screening for foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and ensuring FASD is covered by the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Expanding the adopt-a-cop and Elders reference group programs that currently operate in Halls Creek to build trust between community and police. Developing a statewide Aboriginal cultural policy and ensuring all programs and policies relating to Aboriginal people are built on principles of self-determination. Fogliani said all of the children and young people who formed part of the inquest had grown up in homes where there was a high level of alcohol abuse and seven had experienced significant periods of alcohol abuse prior to their death. Two had high blood alcohol levels when they died; others had no alcohol in their system upon death. She said a number of the children had also lost family members to suicide: two girls aged 10 and 13, both included in the inquest, were half-sisters; two boys in the inquest were cousin/brothers. The inquest heard evidence that the high level of grief, constant funerals and sorry business, could cause a \u201cclustering\u201d effect of suicide among young people with limited coping skills. The WA health minister, Roger Cook, said the government would consider all 42 recommendations \u201cin the coming weeks and months\u201d, but said the report highlighted the role alcohol played in each of the deaths. \u201cI think alcohol is devastating these communities and we need to take a stronger stand ... we need to see what is the best way to respond,\u201d Cook told reporters.

      "bodyText": "The NSW Liberals accepted pre-election donations from a figure who worked under billionaire donor Huang Xiangmo at a Chinese Communist Party-linked group. Huang, a major political donor, has been effectively blocked from re-entering Australia after authorities reportedly cancelled his residency and blocked his bid for citizenship. The Chinese billionaire was the long-term chairman of a peak Chinese Community Party-linked lobby group, the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, and was heavily scrutinised for his dealings with Labor senator Sam Dastyari. Guardian Australia can reveal that the NSW Liberals have accepted money in the lead-up to the state election from a figure who worked beneath Huang at the reunification council. The party accepted two $1,000 donations from Charlton Lok, who was previously a vice chairman of the council at the same time Huang was the organisation\u2019s honorary chairman. The first donation was accepted on 15 November, the same day the federal Coalition\u2019s ban on foreign donations \u2013 part of its wider crackdown on foreign interference in Australian democracy \u2013 passed the Senate. The second was received four days later. Both donations to the NSW Liberals were made during fundraising events held by the NSW Liberals. NSW state ministers Victor Dominello and Dominic Perrottet spoke at the respective fundraisers. The federal foreign donations ban was not in force at the time of Lok\u2019s donations. Even if it were, it would not have applied to donations to state branches of the major parties. The council\u2019s secretariat said in a statement that Lok, an Australian citizen, was free to \u201cmake donations to any political party that he may wish and his intention is private\u201d. \u201cMr Lok is an Australian Citizen for many decades. He belongs to many community organisations, and is a well-respected leader of the Chinese Community in Sydney and Australia,\u201d the council said in a statement. The council said he should not have to be questioned by the press. \u201cFinally, any Australian is free to associate to any legal entity in Australia without being questioned by anyone else, including the press.\u201d Lok did nothing wrong by making the donations, but they raise questions about the NSW Liberals, given the the timing and Lok\u2019s long involvement with the reunification council. Lok was an honorary advisor in the council\u2019s seventh and third terms, a vice chairman in its sixth, fifth, and fourth terms. He was also a member in its second term. Lok is not listed as holding a role on the council\u2019s executive committee in its current eighth term, which began in August, before the donations were made. Experts say the council is part of a global foreign influence network overseen by the Communist Party\u2019s United Front Work Department. Academics researching foreign interference have told both the Australian parliament and US congress that the global network of reunification councils share close links to the Chinese Communist Party. The Australian arm answers to the Beijing-based Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which experts say is directly subordinate to the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s central committee. The council received significant scrutiny over dealings between Huang and former Labor senator Sam Dastyari, which eventually forced Dastyari out of public office. Dastyari warned the Communist party-linked Huang in 2016 that he was probably under surveillance by government agencies. Huang has previously denied the organisation is an affiliate of the United Front Work Department, telling the ABC it was an \u201cautonomous, non-government organisation\u201d that \u201csupports economic and cultural exchange programs and charitable causes\u201d. China foreign influence expert, Clive Hamilton, questioned the acceptance of the donations by the NSW Liberals. Hamilton\u2019s own research has suggested the individual donor shares connections with various other bodies that \u201ccome under the guidance or directions of the United Front Work Department\u201d. \u201cAfter the Sam Dastyari affair, you\u2019d think the NSW Liberals would be vigilant about accepting money from people linked to the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf nothing else, the optics of taking money from people linked to the Chinese Communist Party are terrible.\u201d \u201cLuckily for the Liberals, the Labor Party is in no position to score points off their actions.\u201d A spokesman for the NSW Liberal party said it \u201cfully complied\u201d with its obligations under \u201cCommonwealth and state electoral funding laws, and declares donations in line with those obligations under the relevant legislation.\u201d The party has fully complied with disclosure obligations around the donations. A spokesman for the special minister of state, Alex Hawke, said the foreign donation laws did not apply to donations made for state electoral purposes. He said the donations ban was designed to support the integrity of Australia\u2019s democracy and sovereignty. \u201cForeign governments, foreign billionaires and foreign companies have no legitimate role in funding any activities that influence Australian politics, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve banned foreign donations,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is an arrangement contrived to avoid these new laws, then the act has anti-avoidance measures prohibiting such donations. The Morrison government is confident that the AEC will ensure compliance with these important laws, as the Australian public rightfully expect.\u201d",

A strong, coherent Labour alternative to this shabby, Tory Brexit is absent \u2013 it has been since this parliament began. Totally demoralising.\u201d The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, was quick to stress on Thursday that a referendum was still a possibility, saying that the letter, \u201cdoes not rule out the option of a second referendum \u2013 a public vote\u201d. One member of his team, Matthew Pennycook, even suggested the implication of the letter was that if the prime minister does not meet Labour\u2019s stringent conditions, \u201cwe must move to support a public vote\u201d. Labour sources denied it was the party\u2019s official position but said the option of a public vote was still on the table, as agreed at the party\u2019s conference. Starmer promised that Corbyn would be writing to Labour members to reassure them a public vote was still on the table. A Labour source declined to confirm that such a message would be sent, adding: \u201cJeremy writes to members all the time.\u201d Smith\u2019s name is not one of those routinely mentioned among a group of MPs widely thought to be close to quitting Labour and forming a rival grouping. Some Labour insiders say resignations from some of these MPs could come within days. Labour MPs who support a second referendum reacted with dismay to Corbyn\u2019s letter. Pat McFadden said his leader was giving MPs in leave constituencies permission to back May\u2019s deal. \u201cHe wants it to happen, and even if he doesn\u2019t vote for it himself, he\u2019s sending a signal to Labour MPs that they can do so,\u201d he tweeted. During the bitter leadership tussle of 2016, one of the key policy dividing-lines was Smith\u2019s promise of a referendum on the final Brexit deal.",

The bureau is proposing to delay the August rollout of the rule until November 2020, with a 30-day comment period opened to the public. Kathy Kraninger, director of the bureau, said it will \u201cevaluate the comments, weigh the evidence and then make its decision\u201d.",

Increasingly, women pilots are also servicing debt from the costs of higher education and flight training, along with saving for the costs of buying a first house. \u201cFor some it means delaying having children, taking shorter maternity leave or giving up on having a family altogether.\u201d One pilot, speaking anonymously, said she and her partner were excited by an unplanned pregnancy \u2013 until they realised they would not be able to keep their rented home: \u201cFortunately, the scan proved it was a false alarm. Nevertheless, many tears were shed, and I still don\u2019t know what the best thing to do would be: lose our home and deal with a 90% pay cut or terminate the pregnancy.\u201d The union is calling on airlines to move to 26 weeks\u2019 full parental pay. Strutton said: \u201cIf airlines are serious about taking on more women pilots they should say yes.\u201d BA, whose owner IAG is expected to announce annual profits of \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn this month, is not alone in aviation in paying the legal minimum parental allowance to its employees. But it falls short compared with its major UK-based competitor airlines, as well as wider norms for blue-chip firms. Surveys suggest that the majority of UK employers offer enhanced pay, while almost three in four organisations with more than 1,000 staff pay more than the minimum. EasyJet, the UK\u2019s biggest airline, has six weeks at 90% and then 12 weeks at 50%, and offers parents flexible working arrangements. Virgin Atlantic pays the statutory minimum but from July will offer 100% pay for 12 weeks. A BA spokesman said it offered \u201cindustry-standard maternity pay\u201d, adding: \u201cWe recognise that there is always more to be done to inspire girls and women to take up careers in traditionally male-dominated roles.\u201d Ryanair, the Irish airline which flies more than any other in Europe, also pays the statutory minimum.",

Rather we operate as a teacher said to me, like the Tour de France: a few people pull away from everyone else and the rest are all bunched up behind. Class assimilation is always the rightwing solution to inequality. It is deeply superficial. Poshness isn\u2019t a lesson to be learned by lowly state school pupils so that they may pass as good enough because they are imbued with the confidence that \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy\u201d. The whole point of the public school system is that money does buy it. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling party believes western powers are behind a \u201crevolution\u201d to bring about regime change in the country, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Briefing papers prepared by Zanu-PF officials blame opposition parties and \u201crogue NGOs\u201d for \u201can orgy of violence\u201d following a protest against fuel price rises last month, accusing them of following a plan \u201cby hostile elements to subvert the state by rendering the country ungovernable\u201d. The document is thought to have been produced by Zanu-PF officials for circulation among foreign diplomats at the African Union summit, currently underway in Addis Abbaba. It will concern observers already worried by the increasingly hard line taken by the Zimbabwean authorities. The protests last month led to sporadic incidents of rioting and looting, which prompted a brutal crackdown by the police and the army. The violence came 14 months after the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe came to an end following a military takeover, and was the worst in Zimbabwe for at least a decade. Police documents seen by the Guardian last week detailed the army\u2019s role in a series of killings, rapes and beatings. In a report published earlier this week, a coalition of local NGOs described a \u201cde facto state of emergency\u201d and a \u201creign of terror\u201d by the security forces, which they accused of being responsible for 1,800 human rights violations. They said these included at least 17 extrajudicial killings, 16 rapes, 26 abductions and more than 600 assaults. \u201cThe violations are systematic, unleashed mainly by male perpetrators whom the victims identified as wearing either military or police attire, armed with AK rifles and or baton sticks, travelling in army and police vehicles. The targets of attack were initially male population in high density suburbs but later become indiscriminate to include women and young girls\u201d, the report, by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, said. More than 1,000 people have been detained in the crackdown, including labour leaders, activists and officials from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the main opposition party. Many face lengthy sentences. Seven have been charged with subversion, which could lead to up to 20 years in prison. Zanu-PF has denied all responsibility for the disorder. The 24-page briefing document, seen by the Guardian, is titled: \u201cBrief on the political and security situation in Zimbabwe in the aftermath of the 14th to 16th January violent protests.\u201d It is dated 30 January and stamped \u201cGovernment of Zimbabwe\u201d. \u201cAnti-government protests are an instrument of choice for subversive elements, particularly the MDC, rogue NGOs, hostile [civil society organisations] and Hostile Intelligence Services (sic), keen to effect either regime change in Zimbabwe or force the consummation of a [coalition government of national unity],\u201d the document says. The Zanu-PF document describes the security forces\u2019 response as \u201cproportional to the threat posed\u201d, though it adds: \u201cUnfortunately some misguided elements within the system and the security forces committed excesses and the law is now taking its course.\u201d The briefing says reports of abuses are aimed at prompting western intervention in Zimbabwe. Analysts are divided as to whether the more moderate position of the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe and won a contested election last year, is genuine or designed to deflect foreign criticism. The recent violence now means it is very unlikely that Mnangagwa, who has said the government \u201cregrets\u201d the loss of life but has defended the crackdown, will achieve his stated aim of ending Zimbabwe\u2019s pariah status and unlocking the massive financial aid necessary to avert total economic collapse. On Tuesday the UK said it would not back a bid by Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth because of recent human rights abuses and was \u201cfurther\u201d from backing any economic assistance package. This suggests that basic commodities such as food, fuel and medicine will remain both scarce and increasingly expensive. On Wednesday, Mnangagwa invited leaders of the more than 20 political parties that participated in last year\u2019s disputed polls to a \u201cpost-election dialogue\u201d at his State House office. The talks were snubbed by the MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa, who said he wants any dialogue to be independently mediated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional organisation, and guaranteed by the African Union and the UN. A Zanu-PF spokesman did not respond to requests to comment on the views contained in the leaked briefing.",

USA!! USA!!! Three years ago, following a disagreement with a pothole, an unscheduled trip over the handlebars of my bike and a face-to-face encounter with the road, I came round in hospital. There I noticed the wristband the good hospital folk attached to me, which had me down as Congo, Trauma with a date of birth of 01/01/1900 and a ripe old age at the time of 116\u201d \u2013 John Stainton.</p> <p>\u201cMay I point out that The Fiver picture desk was not so much on fire yesterday as in deep and murky water. That was no bongo, that was most obviously a djembe. An image of a Monty Python member with two djembes would work for the player representing FC Vallorbe-Ballaigues in the Swiss fifth division(!)\u201d \u2013 Steve Allen.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing on from the news of a Bournemouth fan being banned for throwing a pie during their match at Chelsea (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs), I noted the report in Big Paper stated, apparently with a straight face: \u2018It is not known what type of pie was thrown.\u2019 Pondering why this detail would be in any way important, I came to the conclusion that certain combinations of meat and pastry must be more dangerous than others. Being hit by a curry pie could, for example, presumably put a person into a korma\u201d \u2013 Alan Cormack.</p> <p>\u201cTerrible to hear that supporter has been banned for pie throwing.

Of course when he wasn\u2019t figuring out that E = mc\u00b2, Einstein came up with the occasional bon mot. \u201cUnthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth,\u201d he once said and it is a line young Alfredo may have quoted in his own defence, when asked to explain to his increasingly frustrated manager $tevie Mbe why he had just got his fourth red card (one of which was rescinded) of the season for an off-the-ball stramash with Scott McKenna on Wednesday night and is now facing yet another two-game spell on the naughty step. \u201cI think for Alfredo to go to the next level or to improve he will have to channel his aggression,\u201d he parped, as the mellifluous strains of Phil Collins opus No Jacket Required were piped into the visitors\u2019 dressing room. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to analyse the incident so I can\u2019t tell you if Scott deserved a red or whether Alfredo did. They\u2019ve had a fantastic battle up until that point.\u201d It was a battle Morelos was dominating, having scored two goals as O\u2019Rangers ran out 4-2 winners to go five points ahead of Aberdeen and top of the table \u2026 if you\u2019re one of those particularly one-eyed O\u2019Rangers fans who folds over the bit above your team that shows the Queen\u2019s Celtic are six points clear. After being awarded four spot-kicks in one match last weekend, the most penalties they\u2019ve been given since the taxman rocked up to Ibrox in 2010, O\u2019Rangers could be forgiven for thinking they might have used up all their luck for February, but they\u2019ve now announced they are seeking to have Morelos\u2019s latest dismissal overturned. \u201cA table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?\u201d asked Einstein. For $tevie Mbe, the answer is a baby-faced striker with 23 goals to his name already this season who isn\u2019t suspended for his team\u2019s next two games.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cSteve Hibbert\u2019s missive about Bongo Christ (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) brought to mind a name I was given when taken to hospital in the USA! USA!! USA!!! Three years ago, following a disagreement with a pothole, an unscheduled trip over the handlebars of my bike and a face-to-face encounter with the road, I came round in hospital. There I noticed the wristband the good hospital folk attached to me, which had me down as Congo, Trauma with a date of birth of 01/01/1900 and a ripe old age at the time of 116\u201d \u2013 John Stainton. \u201cMay I point out that The Fiver picture desk was not so much on fire yesterday as in deep and murky water. That was no bongo, that was most obviously a djembe. An image of a Monty Python member with two djembes would work for the player representing FC Vallorbe-Ballaigues in the Swiss fifth division(!)\u201d \u2013 Steve Allen. \u201cFollowing on from the news of a Bournemouth fan being banned for throwing a pie during their match at Chelsea (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs), I noted the report in Big Paper stated, apparently with a straight face: \u2018It is not known what type of pie was thrown.\u2019 Pondering why this detail would be in any way important, I came to the conclusion that certain combinations of meat and pastry must be more dangerous than others. Being hit by a curry pie could, for example, presumably put a person into a korma\u201d \u2013 Alan Cormack. \u201cTerrible to hear that supporter has been banned for pie throwing. I hope a powerful flan group gets behind his case\u201d \u2013 Daniel Doody. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

FA chairman Greg Clarke has also been elected as Fifa vice-president. \u201cIf I compare what I get paid for two days a week at the FA, pro rata, compared to what I used to earn, I\u2019ll still be earning a lot less,\u201d he whooped. Fresh off beating Everton, Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus thinks he knows what it\u2019ll take for the Premier League leaders to deny Liverpool the title. \u201cWe need to win every single game,\u201d he tooted.

The victim was standing with his sibling near a display of toy footballs when a man in a white T-shirt, identified in court as Cech, walked past the victim with his arm extended and an object in his hand. As Cech exited the frame, the victim could be seen looking quickly back towards him before running to his mother nearby. The boy suffered a 10cm burn to his left forearm, and a 3cm burn on his forehead, which needed specialist hospital treatment. The crown has also claimed that Hussini, Pulko and Badiova were involved in an \u201caborted\u201d attempt near a school eight days before the shop attack. Jurors have also been told about messages from the victim\u2019s father to Paktia after the attack, including one which read \u201cNailed It!\u201d The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>From 13 runners meeting in Bushy Park, south-west London, in 2004, to five million members worldwide in 2018, parkrun has become a global phenomenon. There are now more than 1,700 of the free, weekly running events in 23 countries, with numbers continuing to rise. Beyond joining local races, there\u2019s an increasing number of \u201cparkrun tourists\u201d, who plan trips in order to tick off unusual and spectacular routes from Singapore to South Africa.</p> <p>There are even unofficial clubs with their own lingo to denote their achievements: the Alphabeteers, who tick off parkruns for each letter of the alphabet; the Cowell club (100 or more different events); Fielding club (250 different UK events), Freyne club (250 different global events); Yorkshire Pud-done (all the runs in Yorkshire and the Humber); East-Did-Lands and West-Did-Lands (all the parkruns in the east or west Midlands); and Going for Bailey (attempting to run your first 100 runs at 100 different events).</p> <p>Now tour operators are getting in on the action. <a href=\"https://www.exodus.co.uk/parkrun\">Exodus</a> has incorporated parkruns in to several of its adventure holidays, including Sicily\u2019s Aeolian Islands and Etna (eight days from \u00a31,199); Port Elizabeth via the Garden route to Cape Town (12 days from \u00a31,399), and Treviso and the Prosecco hills in Italy (4 days from \u00a3459).</p> <p>All parkrun events, which are managed by volunteers, stay true to the original aim of being free and inclusive. \u201cUnlike traditional running events that may require pre-registration, entry fees and cut-off times, at parkrun it is free to participate and speed is not important,\u201d says Chrissie Wellington, head of health and wellbeing at Parkrun. \u201cThe popularity continues to grow by empowering local communities to implement a permanent mixed-gender, multi-generational health intervention that appeals to a broad cross-section of society. Particularly those for whom physical activity and volunteering is not the norm.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Here are 10 of the best routes in the UK and around the world</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.parkrun.org.uk/molevalley/\">Mole Valley, Surrey</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0aa53aa42d4624dd2d5a58d5a6f38fb1768c348a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aa53aa42d4624dd2d5a58d5a6f38fb1768c348a/0_48_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mole Valley parkrun\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This parkrun takes place around the rolling vineyards of Denbies Wine Estate, in a county that is fast becoming one of UK\u2019s biggest wine producers.

      "bodyText": "From 13 runners meeting in Bushy Park, south-west London, in 2004, to five million members worldwide in 2018, parkrun has become a global phenomenon. There are now more than 1,700 of the free, weekly running events in 23 countries, with numbers continuing to rise. Beyond joining local races, there\u2019s an increasing number of \u201cparkrun tourists\u201d, who plan trips in order to tick off unusual and spectacular routes from Singapore to South Africa. There are even unofficial clubs with their own lingo to denote their achievements: the Alphabeteers, who tick off parkruns for each letter of the alphabet; the Cowell club (100 or more different events); Fielding club (250 different UK events), Freyne club (250 different global events); Yorkshire Pud-done (all the runs in Yorkshire and the Humber); East-Did-Lands and West-Did-Lands (all the parkruns in the east or west Midlands); and Going for Bailey (attempting to run your first 100 runs at 100 different events). Now tour operators are getting in on the action. Exodus has incorporated parkruns in to several of its adventure holidays, including Sicily\u2019s Aeolian Islands and Etna (eight days from \u00a31,199); Port Elizabeth via the Garden route to Cape Town (12 days from \u00a31,399), and Treviso and the Prosecco hills in Italy (4 days from \u00a3459). All parkrun events, which are managed by volunteers, stay true to the original aim of being free and inclusive. \u201cUnlike traditional running events that may require pre-registration, entry fees and cut-off times, at parkrun it is free to participate and speed is not important,\u201d says Chrissie Wellington, head of health and wellbeing at Parkrun. \u201cThe popularity continues to grow by empowering local communities to implement a permanent mixed-gender, multi-generational health intervention that appeals to a broad cross-section of society. Particularly those for whom physical activity and volunteering is not the norm.\u201d Here are 10 of the best routes in the UK and around the world Mole Valley, Surrey This parkrun takes place around the rolling vineyards of Denbies Wine Estate, in a county that is fast becoming one of UK\u2019s biggest wine producers. The first half is mainly uphill, the second back down with views across the vineyards to Box Hill. Afterwards runners can head to the estate\u2019s Conservatory Restaurant (where parkrunners get 10% off). Whinlatter Forest, Lake District Nicknamed \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, this route rewards runners with spectacular views after a 210-metre ascent. Whinlatter is one of England\u2019s only true mountain forests, with a route though Douglas fir trees. With a red squirrel reserve and osprey nesting in the valley, it\u2019s also a great area for spotting wildlife. Colby, Pembrokeshire Coast national park The park\u2019s landscape is breathtaking and varied, with rugged cliffs and sandy beaches giving way to hills and woodland, and a coastal path stretching 186 miles. In a valley at the eastern end, Colby Woodland Garden, near Amroth hosts a parkrun, with three laps along trail paths through the meadow and forests. Portrush, Northern Ireland When it started in September 2012, this was the first beach parkrun in the world running entirely on sand. The out-and-back route starts in the town and heads out along the along the wide sandy beach of Whiterocks. Views on the outward run include Dunluce Castle ruins, the Giant\u2019s Causeway headland and the Skerries, a small group of uninhabited islands around a mile from the coast. The group usually congregate at the watersports centre for tea and cake post-run. Woodhouse Moor, Leeds The first parkrun to launch outside London, this route laps the beautiful urban park close to the university campus three times. It\u2019s popular with visitors and locals as one of the oldest parkruns but also for its volunteers, including George Webster, 18, who\u2019s become something of a local celebrity in the parkrun world. George, who has Downs syndrome, started as a token collector and has now completed 56 parkruns. He is also a \u201cparkrun star\u201d, acting as an advocate for their life-changing impact and encouraging others to get involved. Kangaroo Island, Australia Australia\u2019s third-largest island is home to an abundance of wildlife, including wallabies, koalas, seals and the eponymous marsupials which vastly outnumber the human population of 4,700. The island, in the state of South Australia, is a 45-minute ferry ride from the mainland port of Cape Jarvis. The coastal parkrun, which launched in 2017, starts and finishes at the tidal pool in Kingscote, the island\u2019s biggest town. Swakopmund, Namibia With the waves of the Atlantic on one side and golden Namib Desert sand on the other, this is a flat course popular with locals and visitors. The town is one of the largest in Namibia, with a well-kept promenade, wide roads and German colonial architecture, and was one of the first places in the region outside South Africa to host a parkrun. Crissy Field, California The parkrun team here say they\u2019ve seen an increase in tourists from the UK, Australia and beyond, thanks to the views the route offers. On the first mile, runners see San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge, depending on the fog. On the return leg, there are views to Alcatraz, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the San Francisco skyline, including the futurist-looking Transamerica Pyramid, the second-tallest building in the city at 259 metres. East coast, Singapore The first country in south-east Asian to host a parkrun, Singapore now has three. East Coast Park was the first, with a beach park route along a manmade sandy shore. Runners here can enjoy a post-event picnic under the palm trees or a dip in warm Singaporean Strait waters. The route starts at 7.30am rather than the usual 9am, to avoid the humidity, and weaves along the coast between Buddhist monks and dog-walkers. Cieszyn, Poland Taking in two countries in one run, this route starts and finishes in the Polish town of Cieszyn but crosses into the Czech Republic along the way. The city was divided between the countries in 1920, following a short border war, with Cieszyn the larger neighbour of its Czech sister city, \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn. The city parkrun here straddles the River Olza, which forms part of the boundary between the two countries. Another two-for-one run is the Severn Bridge parkrun from Wales into England and back, which launched last year. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February to state that Singapore has three parkruns instead of two.",

      "bodyText": "A cross-party group of MPs is calling for a ban on the export of plastic waste over concerns the UK is passing the buck to the world\u2019s poorest people to clean up its rubbish. MPs have tabled an early day motion to highlight growing concerns first raised by the National Audit Office that millions of tonnes of plastic waste sent abroad for recycling may be being dumped in landfill. The EDM is sponsored by the Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, Green party MP Caroline Lucas, Labour MPs Geraint Davies and Mike Hill, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Ben Lake, and Kelvin Hopkins, an independent MP. The plastic recycling system in the UK has been in the spotlight since China banned imports of plastic and other waste from the west over concerns about the quality of the material. It was followed by Malaysia \u2013 which imported 105,000 tonnes of plastic for processing last year \u2013 imposing restrictions, and then Thailand and Vietnam, leaving the plastic recycling export market in crisis. Two-thirds of UK plastic waste is exported for recycling in an industry worth \u00a350m last year, rather than being processed and used in the UK. The Guardian revealed recently that the export market was under investigation over suspected abuses. The MPs said many of the countries in the global south receiving the UK\u2019s rubbish had high levels of plastic waste mismanagement and they were extremely concerned that the sight of piles of plastic rubbish generated in the UK was increasingly common across the global south. \u201cThis house \u2026 strongly condemns the practice of leaving some of the world\u2019s poorest people to deal with the UK\u2019s plastic waste \u2026 The government should not pass the buck to the global south on plastic, instead dealing with our own waste on UK soil,\u201d the motion read. The MPs said they were backing a campaign by A Plastic Planet for a complete ban on plastic waste exports to the developing world. Businesses in the UK have long complained that they are disadvantaged when it comes to processing plastic waste in the UK. They have called for more investment into processing plants in the UK and an end to the incentives to export plastic to be recycled. But Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association, warned that banning exports could backfire. He said it would mean more plastic ending up in landfill in the UK. \u201cMost of our plastic exports take place in a compliant manner,\u201d said Ellin. \u201cIf we were to ban the legitimate trade in recycled plastics, then it will decimate our industry, prices will crash and material will end up in landfill \u2026 We should definitely look to invest in our own plastic reprocessing infrastructure in the UK, but exports should have their place too as part of a global economy.\u201d",

Samuels misses out because of a knee injury \u2013 there are also rumours of a personality clash with the head coach, Richard Pybus \u2013 but while it means his long-running rivalry with Stokes will be missing from the five-match series that begins in Barbados on 20 February, West Indies may well be better for it. The 38-year-old\u2019s strike rate of 63 and average of 22 over the past two years had caused significant drag in the middle overs. In his place comes Nicholas Pooran, an uncapped power-hitter who, with the similarly dangerous Shimron Hetmyer, may put England\u2019s bowling attack under more pressure throughout the innings. The 14-man squad is for the first two ODIs, with West Indies giving their fast bowler Shannon Gabriel a rest after the Test series. Pace instead will come from Oshane Thomas, another hulking right-armer who can top 90mph. There is no room for Carlos Brathwaite \u2013 star of the 2016 World T20 final when his four final-over sixes off Stokes powered West Indies to the title \u2013 while Andre Russell, currently in the Bangladesh Premier League, has declared himself unable to get through 50-over matches due to a knee injury.",

It is of little surprise that the Brexit priority for most British businesses \u2013 after securing a deep relationship with the UK\u2019s most important trading partner, the EU \u2013 is not future free trade agreements with the US, New Zealand and others, but replacing those that already exist.</p> <p>Yet clarity from the government has been hard to come by. The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7beae1d2-2a39-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\" title=\"\">reported</a> that frustrations boiled over in a meeting this week in which government trade officials told a group of business executives that even if the UK leaves the EU with a deal, they cannot guarantee that existing EU trade agreements will continue to apply to the UK during the subsequent two-year transition period.</p> <p>This should not have come as a surprise to anyone. Replacing all of the existing agreements by 29 March was never going to be possible, and the withdrawal agreement only requires the EU to ask its FTA partners to continue to extend the benefits of the deal to the UK for the duration of the transition \u2013 it can\u2019t guarantee the FTA partners will say yes.</p> <p>Replacing the trade agreements that the UK enjoys through its EU membership was always going to be tricky. All need to be renegotiated, if only a little, and some \u2013 for example the EU\u2019s customs union with Turkey \u2013 are entirely dependent on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The UK appears to have done a good job on the replications it has concluded. One of the big fears about the replaced agreements is that British exports would no longer qualify for the tariff-free treatment because not enough of the value-added is created within the UK \u2013 the \u201crules of origin\u201d question. However, the recently published text of the future <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamuelMarcLowe/status/1093193112531451904\" title=\"\">UK-Chile replacement deal</a> reveals that British negotiators managed to convince the Chileans to continue allowing British exports to account for EU inputs as being British for the purpose of meeting local content requirements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b48532152e5488e8a71e88dc744ad69258b6a815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b48532152e5488e8a71e88dc744ad69258b6a815/0_575_5634_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK ambassador to Chile, Jamie Bowden, and Roberto Ampuero, Chilean minister of foreign affairs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018British negotiators managed to attain a favourable replacement deal with Chile.\u2019 The UK\u2019s ambassador to Chile, Jamie Bowden, and Roberto Ampuero, Chile\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, in Santiago in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Agencia Makro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether they will be able to convince bigger trading partners, such as South Korea, to do the same remains to be seen, but it is a notable achievement nonetheless.</p> <p>The real problem has been the UK\u2019s lack of transparency, and lack of honesty about the difficulties inherent to the process from the beginning. In October 2017, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/liam-fox-promises-to-sign-40-free-trade-deals-the-second-after-brexit-2017-10?r=UK\" title=\"\">Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said,</a> \u201cI hear people saying, \u2018Oh, we won\u2019t have any [free trade agreements] before we leave\u2019. Well, believe me we\u2019ll have up to 40 ready for one second after midnight in March 2019.\u201d While he has since gone back on this, and indeed official government policy has changed, such statements linger, and run the risk of lulling companies into a false sense of security.</p> <p>When the government has been honest with business groups and stakeholders, the information has often been delivered late in the day and contained to small groups, with participants sworn to secrecy or made to sign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/15/uk-defends-asking-firms-in-border-consultations-to-sign-secrecy-deals\" title=\"\">non-disclosure agreements</a>.</p> <p>Not being open about the difficulties of replacing existing trade agreements has consequences. As anyone who talks to small businesses in the UK will tell you, even those with experience of exporting remain entirely unprepared and largely unaware that existing free trade agreements might no longer apply.</p> <p>If the UK is going to make a success of any post-Brexit trade policy this secrecy will need to end. These discussions cannot happen behind closed doors, and the trade-offs and consequences of government decisions should be made public as early as possible. If not, anger will continue to grow, people and businesses will be caught by surprise, and even the successes will be tainted by resentment.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Lowe is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform</p>",

And these agreements matter to British business: up to 15% of UK exports are to countries the EU already has a trade agreement with. It is of little surprise that the Brexit priority for most British businesses \u2013 after securing a deep relationship with the UK\u2019s most important trading partner, the EU \u2013 is not future free trade agreements with the US, New Zealand and others, but replacing those that already exist. Yet clarity from the government has been hard to come by. The Financial Times reported that frustrations boiled over in a meeting this week in which government trade officials told a group of business executives that even if the UK leaves the EU with a deal, they cannot guarantee that existing EU trade agreements will continue to apply to the UK during the subsequent two-year transition period. This should not have come as a surprise to anyone. Replacing all of the existing agreements by 29 March was never going to be possible, and the withdrawal agreement only requires the EU to ask its FTA partners to continue to extend the benefits of the deal to the UK for the duration of the transition \u2013 it can\u2019t guarantee the FTA partners will say yes. Replacing the trade agreements that the UK enjoys through its EU membership was always going to be tricky. All need to be renegotiated, if only a little, and some \u2013 for example the EU\u2019s customs union with Turkey \u2013 are entirely dependent on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The UK appears to have done a good job on the replications it has concluded. One of the big fears about the replaced agreements is that British exports would no longer qualify for the tariff-free treatment because not enough of the value-added is created within the UK \u2013 the \u201crules of origin\u201d question. However, the recently published text of the future UK-Chile replacement deal reveals that British negotiators managed to convince the Chileans to continue allowing British exports to account for EU inputs as being British for the purpose of meeting local content requirements. Whether they will be able to convince bigger trading partners, such as South Korea, to do the same remains to be seen, but it is a notable achievement nonetheless. The real problem has been the UK\u2019s lack of transparency, and lack of honesty about the difficulties inherent to the process from the beginning. In October 2017, Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said, \u201cI hear people saying, \u2018Oh, we won\u2019t have any [free trade agreements] before we leave\u2019. Well, believe me we\u2019ll have up to 40 ready for one second after midnight in March 2019.\u201d While he has since gone back on this, and indeed official government policy has changed, such statements linger, and run the risk of lulling companies into a false sense of security. When the government has been honest with business groups and stakeholders, the information has often been delivered late in the day and contained to small groups, with participants sworn to secrecy or made to sign non-disclosure agreements. Not being open about the difficulties of replacing existing trade agreements has consequences. As anyone who talks to small businesses in the UK will tell you, even those with experience of exporting remain entirely unprepared and largely unaware that existing free trade agreements might no longer apply. If the UK is going to make a success of any post-Brexit trade policy this secrecy will need to end. These discussions cannot happen behind closed doors, and the trade-offs and consequences of government decisions should be made public as early as possible. If not, anger will continue to grow, people and businesses will be caught by surprise, and even the successes will be tainted by resentment. \u2022 Sam Lowe is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform",

      "body": "<p>An England flag flutters over sharp, spear-like fence tops, in front of a roof as bleak as a bunker, in George Shaw\u2019s painting Someone Else\u2019s House. Painted in 2018 as we stumbled towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-in-hell-for-those-who-backed-brexit-without-plan\">the Brexit crisis that is now upon us</a>, its title seems plain enough. This is a remainer\u2019s alienated view of Brexit England as a strange, bigoted neighbour skulking behind a nationalist fence. Yet there\u2019s a twist \u2013 or two. The red cross on the flag is the cross of St George, and it\u2019s been painted by a man called George. There is a white cross inside the red one \u2013 what does that mean? This may be a more private and quirky symbol than we know; perhaps it is even religious. Since Shaw, who was raised Catholic, makes similarly subtle religious allusions in many of his paintings, that does not seem a far-fetched interpretation.</p> <p>In other words, Shaw is not outside the scene. He\u2019s not looking down on people who choose to put up a flag, shuddering at the millions who voted leave. On the contrary, he\u2019s the artist of the left behind, in more ways than one. He paints left-behind people and left-behind cats and dogs. Or rather left-behind pubs, lockups and care homes, for there are no people in most of Shaw\u2019s scenes.

But while Constable grew up in the Suffolk countryside that his paintings immortalise, Shaw grew up in the 1970s and 80s on Tile Hill estate on the outskirts of Coventry. This is the place he obsessively paints. He depicts the house where he lived as a child, a tree he could see out of his window, and woods close to the houses.

      "bodyText": "When Democrats won all three statewide constitutional offices in 2013 for the first time in over two decades, it seemed to herald a new era in Virginia politics. This change also brought significant policy wins, such as former governor Terry McAuliffe restoring the voting rights of over 200,000 convicted felons who had served out their sentences and attorney general Mark Herring\u2019s refusal to defend Virginia\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage in the courts. This generally positive direction seemed confirmed when the Virginia Democrats held all three of those offices and made significant inroads in the state legislature in the 2017 elections. But over the span of five days, all of that has been undone in the most spectacular way imaginable. In that time, both the governor, Ralph Northam, and Herring have found themselves embroiled in a scandal over their use of blackface during their respective medical school and undergrad days in the 1980s. The lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, only the second black person to hold statewide office, has been accused of sexual assault by Dr Vanessa Tyson, a college professor and fellow attendee of the 2004 Democratic national convention in Boston, where the assault is alleged to have taken place. (Fairfax has denied the accusations, and has retained the services of the same law firm that represented now supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in his Senate confirmation proceedings.) Democrats have sat uncomfortably with accountability for sexual predators in their ranks in the recent past. To this end, look no further than the outright hostility Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has faced from major Democratic donors for seeking to hold her now former colleague Al Franken accountable when photos and stories of him groping women gained public attention. And lest you think that the calls for Northam and Herring to account for their racist pasts and resign have been universal amongst Virginia Democrats, take a look at comments from Dick Saslaw, the minority leader in the Virginia senate: His whole life has been about exactly the opposite, and that\u2019s what you need to examine, not something that occurred 30 years ago.

Trust me. I was 18 years old and I was a handful, okay?\u201d And while blackface is an affront to the dignity of black Virginians like me, the records of Northam and Herring with regards to a compressor station feeding the now delayed Atlantic coast pipeline being sited in the historic black community of Union Hill reflect the same kind of callousness towards black people as smearing shoe polish on your face and dancing the moonwalk, only with much more tangible negative harms to the communities like the one I grew up in. There will be people who argue that Democrats should not train their fire on their own, and that the party should unite against the common enemy they have in the Republican party and Donald Trump.

      "body": "<p>Tiffany Haddish: comedian, actor and, by some measure, the US\u2019s most enjoyable celebrity, has a helluva story to tell. One that involves a stepfather confessing he tried to kill her; a mother with schizophrenia; an abusive ex-husband whom she married twice, and, well, that\u2019s barely skimming the surface. But ever since her breakout role in the 2017 hit comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/19/girls-trip-review-raucous-comedy-delivers-fresh-and-filthy-good-time\" title=\"\">Girls Trip</a>, she has had different kinds of stories to tell. And, oh boy, is she good at telling them.</p> <p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t tell this, but \u2026 When I arrived in London, I was staying at Salma Hayek\u2019s house \u2013 she\u2019s my friend now,\u201d she says, with a grin that is half self-mocking for the name-drop and half endearingly excited. \u201cAnd I get there and her house is like a PALACE. And she says: \u2018OK, pick a room.\u2019 And I\u2019m, like: \u2018First off, the fact that you tell me to pick a room is, like, AMAZING.\u2019 Then she shows me her closet and it is the most amazing thing in the world, Gucci, whatever, EVERYTHING. And I\u2019m, like: \u2018I\u2019ll sleep in here!\u2019 Then she shows me her daughter\u2019s old bedroom with pink walls, circle bed, unicorn stuff all around. And I\u2019m, like: \u2018I\u2019m sleeping in here! I always wanted to be a princess, and this is a princess room!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By now, Haddish, 39, is so excited she is banging the sofa she is sitting on with her fists, a seven-year-old overcome in a toy store: \u201cI mean, AMAZING!\u201d</p> <p>Haddish and I are meeting in a hotel in London, ostensibly to discuss her work in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part-review-chris-pratt\" title=\"\">The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</a>. When the first Lego film came out in 2014, she was a little-known comedian who had spent the past decade hacking her way through small TV appearances (typical IMDb entry: \u201cOne episode of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stripper number three.\u201d) Now, just four years later, she is one of the main characters in the mega-earning franchise, appearing alongside Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell and, as is Haddish\u2019s way, nearly stealing the film from all of them.</p> <p>She is extremely funny as the shape-shifting blocks called Queen Watevra Wa\u2019Nabi (as in, \u201cwhatever I wanna be\u201d), and the movie is a joy \u2013 but it\u2019s clear pretty quickly that Haddish doesn\u2019t have much interest in discussing it. (Me: \u201cWhat did you think when you saw what your character looked like?\u201d Her: \u201cNever thought I\u2019d play someone with blue eyes, but hey.\u201d)</p> <p>Haddish got her first break in 2015 on Tyler Perry\u2019s soapy drama, If Loving You Is Easy, followed by a regular gig on the NBC sitcom, The Carmichael Show. When she finally shot to fame at 37 in Girls Trip, the riotous and raunchy film about four female friends, critics rightly compared her clearly star-making performance to that of Zach Galifianakis in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-the-hangover\" title=\"\">The Hangover</a> and Melissa McCarthy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/bridesmaids-review\" title=\"\">Bridesmaids</a>. While the three other women were perfectly good, Haddish had so much vibrant charisma, she made the others look pale in comparison.</p> <p>Since then, she has won an Emmy for hosting Saturday Night Live; is the star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/the-last-og-review-jordan-peele-gentrification-sitcom-coasts-on-charm\" title=\"\">The Last OG</a>, a US comedy created by Jordan Peele and co-starring Tracy Morgan; and this year alone has four movies coming out. But alongside her comedy, Haddish has become almost as well known for her appearances on the US talkshow circuit, where she describes her adventures among the A-listers with a candour you never hear from celebrities.</p> <p>Last summer on Jimmy Kimmel, she described the time she went up to Leonardo DiCaprio at a Beverly Hills party and told him: \u201cSo, I want to hit that \u2013 but I only want to do it to you as your character out of What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape.\u201d (DiCaprio played a mentally disabled teenager in the 1994 film.) DiCaprio \u2013 understandably \u2013 thought this was a joke and launched into the usual actor spiel about how he had prepared for the role, and what a great experience the film was. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah,\u2019\u201d Haddish says making a bored face. \u201c\u2018But when am I gonna hit that?\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqkvgktjag\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nlqkvgktjag?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Has she hit that?</p> <p>\u201cNo \u2013 he never called me! He don\u2019t want me!\u201d she says collapsing on the sofa with an exaggerated sob. She is groomed like a Hollywood starlet for the day \u2013 hair straight, gown formal \u2013 but throws herself around like a slapstick comedian. \u201cI better leave him alone before he says I #MeToo-ed him through the press, and I don\u2019t harass him because I know he\u2019s got a girlfriend. But when that relationship goes, I\u2019m popping back up, like: \u2018Hi, Leonardo!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I tell her that it\u2019s so much fun to hear what it\u2019s like on the inside of celebrity from someone who clearly still feels like they\u2019re on the outside.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely, totally, feel like I\u2019m on the outside. I mean, where I came from is definitely on the outside, and that\u2019s what made me who I am,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It would hard to be more on the outside than where Haddish started. She was born and raised in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in South Central Los Angeles, and her Eritrean father left when she was three. When she was eight, her mother was in a car accident so serious it gave her brain damage and probably triggered her schizophrenia. Haddish suddenly had to look after her four half-siblings as well as her mother, who, when she got out of hospital, would regularly beat her and tell her that she hated her because she reminded her of Haddish\u2019s father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"991f8e4055887590486cbc93fa2636da278aefba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f8e4055887590486cbc93fa2636da278aefba/0_154_4615_2769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queen Latifah, Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith and Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen Latifah, Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith and Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Haddish was 12, her mother got into a vicious fight with a neighbour and accidentally whacked his baby with a plank of wood. The baby was fine, but once social services cottoned on to just how chaotic Haddish\u2019s home life was, they intervened. Haddish was placed in a group home, where she was viciously bullied, then in a foster home where the grandfather would suck on her nipples, telling her it would make her breasts grow faster.</p> <p>At what point did she realise she was being molested?</p> <p>\u201cNot until years later! Yeah,\u201d she says with a shrug that seems more like an expression of closure and self-protection than lack of interest.</p> <p>Eventually, Haddish\u2019s grandmother got custody of the kids, and Haddish went to school, where she managed to hide the fact that she was illiterate until she was 14. A few years later, Haddish\u2019s stepfather told her that he had cut the brakes in Haddish\u2019s mother\u2019s car when she\u2019d had her car accident, in the hope of killing her and all the children.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a millionaire and y\u2019all supposed to be gone,\u201d he said, according to her extraordinary memoir, <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Last-Black-Unicorn/Tiffany-Haddish/9781501181832\" title=\"\">The Last Black Unicorn</a>.</p> <p>Is she in touch with her stepfather now?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I just saw him this weekend in Vegas. He came to my show,\u201d she says.</p> <p>How does it feel to see a man who confessed to trying to kill her?</p> <p>\u201cWell, at least he confessed,\u201d she says. But when she sees the expression on my face, she continues: \u201cAnd, you know, I can\u2019t PROVE he did it. Maybe he was just saying it.\u201d</p> <p>Um, why?</p> <p>\u201cMaybe to make me work harder or to appreciate life or \u2026 or \u2026 I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t hate him. You know, he fought in the Vietnam war, he was a sniper \u2013 he\u2019s got his own little demons. God makes you pay for your sins, and if I hadn\u2019t gone through that, where would I be now?\u201d</p> <p>When Haddish was 15 and back with her grandmother, she became so disruptive in school that her social worker gave her an ultimatum: psychiatric therapy or comedy camp. Haddish chose comedy camp, and, she says simply: \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d One of the most heartbreaking parts of reading Haddish\u2019s memoir, I tell her, is thinking of how many other kids \u2013 in LA, the US, anywhere \u2013 had similarly chaotic beginnings, and knowing she is the exception to getting beyond them. \u201cTotally. I mean, I still live in South Central because it\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable. But I know I\u2019m blessed,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s nice being able to buy things now, but I\u00a0still count every penny</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After finishing high school and getting kicked out by her grandmother, she gave up her tentative dreams of comedy and took various jobs, ranging from working in an airport to being, briefly, a pimp. Eventually, she decided to return to comedy. But she was regularly sexually harassed by comedy club owners \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018So you want this, you\u2019re gonna have to do that,\u201d \u2013 and Haddish always refused. She was so broke that, for a while, she lived in her car. When her comedy colleague Kevin Hart heard, he gave her $300 for a hotel room for a week. Haddish, characteristically and correctly, shot back: \u201cWhat? I cannot get no hotel room nowhere for 300 bucks.\u201d</p> <p>The two are still good friends, and regularly work together. Haddish is loyal to him when asked about the recent furore around Hart\u2019s homophobic tweets, which led to him stepping down from hosting this year\u2019s Oscars.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, he apologised for what he did years ago,\u201d she begins, which is a s<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/kevin-hart-homophobic-tweets-apologies-ellen-degeneres.html\" title=\"\">omewhat debatable claim</a>. But her second point is undoubtedly true: \u201cSo he was like: \u2018Oh you guys don\u2019t want it? OK bye.\u2019 And he went to Australia and did a show for 35,000 people, and I think he made more money doing a comedy show than doing the Oscars.\u201d</p> <p>Haddish is always conscious of money. When we meet, she is wearing a beautiful long green Gucci dress (sweetly, she has left the side zip down) and shoes, which she admires lovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice being able to buy things now, but I still count every penny,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The first thing she did when she started earning was get her mother proper medical care. Haddish\u2019s grandmother and youngest brother live with her while Haddish is redoing her grandmother\u2019s house.</p> <p>So does she support her whole family? \u201cWe support each other,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cMaybe I contribute a little more financially because I\u2019m gone a lot now, and that makes me feel bad. But I\u2019m looking forward to having my house back to myself so I can walk around naked. Ha ha!\u201d</p> <p>Haddish is single, and has had, she admits, poor judgment when it comes to men. To make a very long story short, she met her now ex-husband on a cruise, he tracked her down five years later in 2011, and wooed her by finding her father, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since she was three. Pretty much from the beginning, she says, he found him controlling. And yet, despite not even being attracted to him, she married him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking: this is God\u2019s work, and even if he\u2019s not that physically attractive, I can live with that. What\u2019s important is his soul, and to me, it seemed his soul cared about me a lot,\u201d she writes in her memoir.</p> <p>She has also made allegations of physical violence in her autobiography, which he has denied; he has also filed a $1m libel suit against her publisher. She finally divorced him \u2013 and then, two years later, remarried him. She divorced him for a second time in 2013 and is the one subject on which she will not be drawn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/28/the-lego-movie-2-the-second-part-review-chris-pratt\">The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part review \u2013 even more awesome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGirl, I don\u2019t deal with that man. I wish him well, and stay out of my life, please,\u201d is all she\u2019ll say when asked about him.</p> <p>She jokes about how she is looking for her fantasy man (\u201cHe gotta know how to cook, dance, be psychic \u2026\u201d) But Haddish has generally looked for men who need saving, and, given her family history, it\u2019s not that surprising. Probably the most poignant part of her memoir comes when, as an adult, Haddish tries to involve her biological father in her life. But he abandons her again, and she is devastated.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad didn\u2019t care. Stepdad didn\u2019t care.

      "bodyText": "Tiffany Haddish: comedian, actor and, by some measure, the US\u2019s most enjoyable celebrity, has a helluva story to tell. One that involves a stepfather confessing he tried to kill her; a mother with schizophrenia; an abusive ex-husband whom she married twice, and, well, that\u2019s barely skimming the surface. But ever since her breakout role in the 2017 hit comedy Girls Trip, she has had different kinds of stories to tell. And, oh boy, is she good at telling them. \u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t tell this, but \u2026 When I arrived in London, I was staying at Salma Hayek\u2019s house \u2013 she\u2019s my friend now,\u201d she says, with a grin that is half self-mocking for the name-drop and half endearingly excited. \u201cAnd I get there and her house is like a PALACE. And she says: \u2018OK, pick a room.\u2019 And I\u2019m, like: \u2018First off, the fact that you tell me to pick a room is, like, AMAZING.\u2019 Then she shows me her closet and it is the most amazing thing in the world, Gucci, whatever, EVERYTHING. And I\u2019m, like: \u2018I\u2019ll sleep in here!\u2019 Then she shows me her daughter\u2019s old bedroom with pink walls, circle bed, unicorn stuff all around. And I\u2019m, like: \u2018I\u2019m sleeping in here! I always wanted to be a princess, and this is a princess room!\u2019\u201d By now, Haddish, 39, is so excited she is banging the sofa she is sitting on with her fists, a seven-year-old overcome in a toy store: \u201cI mean, AMAZING!\u201d Haddish and I are meeting in a hotel in London, ostensibly to discuss her work in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. When the first Lego film came out in 2014, she was a little-known comedian who had spent the past decade hacking her way through small TV appearances (typical IMDb entry: \u201cOne episode of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stripper number three.\u201d) Now, just four years later, she is one of the main characters in the mega-earning franchise, appearing alongside Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell and, as is Haddish\u2019s way, nearly stealing the film from all of them. She is extremely funny as the shape-shifting blocks called Queen Watevra Wa\u2019Nabi (as in, \u201cwhatever I wanna be\u201d), and the movie is a joy \u2013 but it\u2019s clear pretty quickly that Haddish doesn\u2019t have much interest in discussing it. (Me: \u201cWhat did you think when you saw what your character looked like?\u201d Her: \u201cNever thought I\u2019d play someone with blue eyes, but hey.\u201d) Haddish got her first break in 2015 on Tyler Perry\u2019s soapy drama, If Loving You Is Easy, followed by a regular gig on the NBC sitcom, The Carmichael Show. When she finally shot to fame at 37 in Girls Trip, the riotous and raunchy film about four female friends, critics rightly compared her clearly star-making performance to that of Zach Galifianakis in The Hangover and Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids. While the three other women were perfectly good, Haddish had so much vibrant charisma, she made the others look pale in comparison. Since then, she has won an Emmy for hosting Saturday Night Live; is the star of The Last OG, a US comedy created by Jordan Peele and co-starring Tracy Morgan; and this year alone has four movies coming out. But alongside her comedy, Haddish has become almost as well known for her appearances on the US talkshow circuit, where she describes her adventures among the A-listers with a candour you never hear from celebrities. Last summer on Jimmy Kimmel, she described the time she went up to Leonardo DiCaprio at a Beverly Hills party and told him: \u201cSo, I want to hit that \u2013 but I only want to do it to you as your character out of What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape.\u201d (DiCaprio played a mentally disabled teenager in the 1994 film.) DiCaprio \u2013 understandably \u2013 thought this was a joke and launched into the usual actor spiel about how he had prepared for the role, and what a great experience the film was. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah,\u2019\u201d Haddish says making a bored face. \u201c\u2018But when am I gonna hit that?\u2019\u201d Has she hit that? \u201cNo \u2013 he never called me! He don\u2019t want me!\u201d she says collapsing on the sofa with an exaggerated sob. She is groomed like a Hollywood starlet for the day \u2013 hair straight, gown formal \u2013 but throws herself around like a slapstick comedian. \u201cI better leave him alone before he says I #MeToo-ed him through the press, and I don\u2019t harass him because I know he\u2019s got a girlfriend. But when that relationship goes, I\u2019m popping back up, like: \u2018Hi, Leonardo!\u2019\u201d I tell her that it\u2019s so much fun to hear what it\u2019s like on the inside of celebrity from someone who clearly still feels like they\u2019re on the outside. \u201cI definitely, totally, feel like I\u2019m on the outside. I mean, where I came from is definitely on the outside, and that\u2019s what made me who I am,\u201d she says. It would hard to be more on the outside than where Haddish started. She was born and raised in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in South Central Los Angeles, and her Eritrean father left when she was three. When she was eight, her mother was in a car accident so serious it gave her brain damage and probably triggered her schizophrenia. Haddish suddenly had to look after her four half-siblings as well as her mother, who, when she got out of hospital, would regularly beat her and tell her that she hated her because she reminded her of Haddish\u2019s father. When Haddish was 12, her mother got into a vicious fight with a neighbour and accidentally whacked his baby with a plank of wood. The baby was fine, but once social services cottoned on to just how chaotic Haddish\u2019s home life was, they intervened. Haddish was placed in a group home, where she was viciously bullied, then in a foster home where the grandfather would suck on her nipples, telling her it would make her breasts grow faster. At what point did she realise she was being molested? \u201cNot until years later! Yeah,\u201d she says with a shrug that seems more like an expression of closure and self-protection than lack of interest. Eventually, Haddish\u2019s grandmother got custody of the kids, and Haddish went to school, where she managed to hide the fact that she was illiterate until she was 14. A few years later, Haddish\u2019s stepfather told her that he had cut the brakes in Haddish\u2019s mother\u2019s car when she\u2019d had her car accident, in the hope of killing her and all the children. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be a millionaire and y\u2019all supposed to be gone,\u201d he said, according to her extraordinary memoir, The Last Black Unicorn. Is she in touch with her stepfather now? \u201cYeah, yeah, I just saw him this weekend in Vegas. He came to my show,\u201d she says. How does it feel to see a man who confessed to trying to kill her? \u201cWell, at least he confessed,\u201d she says. But when she sees the expression on my face, she continues: \u201cAnd, you know, I can\u2019t PROVE he did it. Maybe he was just saying it.\u201d Um, why? \u201cMaybe to make me work harder or to appreciate life or \u2026 or \u2026 I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t hate him. You know, he fought in the Vietnam war, he was a sniper \u2013 he\u2019s got his own little demons. God makes you pay for your sins, and if I hadn\u2019t gone through that, where would I be now?\u201d When Haddish was 15 and back with her grandmother, she became so disruptive in school that her social worker gave her an ultimatum: psychiatric therapy or comedy camp. Haddish chose comedy camp, and, she says simply: \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d One of the most heartbreaking parts of reading Haddish\u2019s memoir, I tell her, is thinking of how many other kids \u2013 in LA, the US, anywhere \u2013 had similarly chaotic beginnings, and knowing she is the exception to getting beyond them. \u201cTotally. I mean, I still live in South Central because it\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable. But I know I\u2019m blessed,\u201d she says. After finishing high school and getting kicked out by her grandmother, she gave up her tentative dreams of comedy and took various jobs, ranging from working in an airport to being, briefly, a pimp. Eventually, she decided to return to comedy. But she was regularly sexually harassed by comedy club owners \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018So you want this, you\u2019re gonna have to do that,\u201d \u2013 and Haddish always refused. She was so broke that, for a while, she lived in her car. When her comedy colleague Kevin Hart heard, he gave her $300 for a hotel room for a week. Haddish, characteristically and correctly, shot back: \u201cWhat? I cannot get no hotel room nowhere for 300 bucks.\u201d The two are still good friends, and regularly work together. Haddish is loyal to him when asked about the recent furore around Hart\u2019s homophobic tweets, which led to him stepping down from hosting this year\u2019s Oscars. \u201cFirst of all, he apologised for what he did years ago,\u201d she begins, which is a somewhat debatable claim. But her second point is undoubtedly true: \u201cSo he was like: \u2018Oh you guys don\u2019t want it? OK bye.\u2019 And he went to Australia and did a show for 35,000 people, and I think he made more money doing a comedy show than doing the Oscars.\u201d Haddish is always conscious of money. When we meet, she is wearing a beautiful long green Gucci dress (sweetly, she has left the side zip down) and shoes, which she admires lovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice being able to buy things now, but I still count every penny,\u201d she says. The first thing she did when she started earning was get her mother proper medical care. Haddish\u2019s grandmother and youngest brother live with her while Haddish is redoing her grandmother\u2019s house. So does she support her whole family? \u201cWe support each other,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cMaybe I contribute a little more financially because I\u2019m gone a lot now, and that makes me feel bad. But I\u2019m looking forward to having my house back to myself so I can walk around naked. Ha ha!\u201d Haddish is single, and has had, she admits, poor judgment when it comes to men. To make a very long story short, she met her now ex-husband on a cruise, he tracked her down five years later in 2011, and wooed her by finding her father, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since she was three. Pretty much from the beginning, she says, he found him controlling. And yet, despite not even being attracted to him, she married him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: this is God\u2019s work, and even if he\u2019s not that physically attractive, I can live with that. What\u2019s important is his soul, and to me, it seemed his soul cared about me a lot,\u201d she writes in her memoir. She has also made allegations of physical violence in her autobiography, which he has denied; he has also filed a $1m libel suit against her publisher. She finally divorced him \u2013 and then, two years later, remarried him. She divorced him for a second time in 2013 and is the one subject on which she will not be drawn. \u201cGirl, I don\u2019t deal with that man. I wish him well, and stay out of my life, please,\u201d is all she\u2019ll say when asked about him. She jokes about how she is looking for her fantasy man (\u201cHe gotta know how to cook, dance, be psychic \u2026\u201d) But Haddish has generally looked for men who need saving, and, given her family history, it\u2019s not that surprising. Probably the most poignant part of her memoir comes when, as an adult, Haddish tries to involve her biological father in her life. But he abandons her again, and she is devastated. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t care. Stepdad didn\u2019t care. [So] I think I interpret possessiveness from men as love,\u201d she writes. Today, she says she doesn\u2019t really want kids, and initially I assume it\u2019s because of her career ambitions and, yes, she says, it is a bit of that. (\u201cIf Meryl Streep can be invited to the Oscars 22 times, why can\u2019t I?\u201d) But she is also scared of repeating her mother\u2019s patterns: \u201cMy mama would say to me: \u2018You look like your ugly daddy.\u2019 I would hate to hear that come out of my mouth, but who\u2019s to say it wouldn\u2019t? I never want to put that on someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if some man inspires me to bust this thing open that\u2019s cool, too!\u201d My favourite Haddish moment is not from her comedy and movies, but when she appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show last year, where, to her astonishment, Oprah Winfrey surprised her on stage. Haddish went in full meltdown, alternately sobbing that she loved her and furiously asking why Winfrey never replied to her letters. \u201cI lost the letter,\u201d Winfrey replied, in a tone that suggests she gets asked that a lot. \u201cBut I wrote you six!\u201d wept Haddish on national TV. I tell Haddish I\u2019d never seen a celebrity seem so human on a talkshow, or interview one so open about herself either. \u201cFor me, being fake is too exhausting,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the way I grew up, in different homes, different schools, taught me I\u2019m most comfortable being myself wherever I am. Also, I think being fake shows on people \u2013 they get tired, or bitter. Being yourself is easiest. I may be cheating but you know what? It feels good!\u201d The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part opens on 8 February.",

And yet all this time a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/17/sardanapalo-lost-liszt-opera-premiered\">sizeable chunk of genuine, mature Liszt opera</a> has been hiding, as the musicologist <a href=\"https://www.davidtrippett.com/\">David Trippett</a> notes, in plain sight. Early in 1850, Liszt began to set a libretto based on Byron\u2019s Sardanapalus. Two years later, he abandoned it; but the first act is there in his notebook, complete enough for Trippett to have reconstructed it with only a little conjecture as to what Liszt might have had in mind. This CD is the result, comprising the first act of Sardanapalo alongside the composer\u2019s symphonic poem Mazeppa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/146OA0NfJCEBIYFji7GFXS\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/146OA0NfJCEBIYFji7GFXS\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Liszt\u2019s mind, as ever, seems to resemble a vast repository of all the music of the 19th<sup> </sup>century. The opening music, which sets the scene with favourite concubine Mirra in Assyrian King Sardanapalo\u2019s harem, moves from something like Mendelssohnian fairy music to a worldly little waltz that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/16/la-traviata-giuseppe-verdi-opera-victorian-love-and-sex\">La Traviata</a>, which Verdi would write three years later. It\u2019s rooted in Italian tradition; and yet some of Liszt\u2019s glittering textures seem to look half a century ahead to Richard Strauss. Then, around every corner, there is Wagner; Liszt had recently conducted an early performance of Lohengrin, and there\u2019s a Wagnerian slant to the harmony as well as a corresponding grandeur of scope.</p> <p>Could Liszt have become a great operatic composer, too? The music of Sardanapalo is a sometimes heavy-handed melange, but that\u2019s not a charge to which Wagner\u2019s early works are immune. A libretto in which nothing happens in the whole first act is no help. Liszt soon let go of his operatic ambitions and focused on symphonic poems such as Mazeppa, a dynamic performance of which, by the Staatskapelle Weimar, opens this disc. <a href=\"http://kirillkarabits.com/\">Kirill Karabits</a> conducts this and Sardanapalo with pace and purpose, and his singers are strong if not subtle: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/30/facing-the-music-joyce-el-khoury\">Joyce El-Khoury</a> makes an impassioned if sometimes squally Mirra, tenor Airam Hern\u00e1ndez is ardent as the king, and Oleksandr Pushniak sings the traditional-spoilsport-bass role of Beleso with all due gravitas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEqRAdUEO2E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EEqRAdUEO2E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Also out this week</h2> <p>The <strong>City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</strong>\u2019s disc of Schubert\u2019s Symphonies Nos 3, 5 and 8.

This CD is the result, comprising the first act of Sardanapalo alongside the composer\u2019s symphonic poem Mazeppa. Liszt\u2019s mind, as ever, seems to resemble a vast repository of all the music of the 19th century. The opening music, which sets the scene with favourite concubine Mirra in Assyrian King Sardanapalo\u2019s harem, moves from something like Mendelssohnian fairy music to a worldly little waltz that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in La Traviata, which Verdi would write three years later. It\u2019s rooted in Italian tradition; and yet some of Liszt\u2019s glittering textures seem to look half a century ahead to Richard Strauss. Then, around every corner, there is Wagner; Liszt had recently conducted an early performance of Lohengrin, and there\u2019s a Wagnerian slant to the harmony as well as a corresponding grandeur of scope. Could Liszt have become a great operatic composer, too? The music of Sardanapalo is a sometimes heavy-handed melange, but that\u2019s not a charge to which Wagner\u2019s early works are immune. A libretto in which nothing happens in the whole first act is no help. Liszt soon let go of his operatic ambitions and focused on symphonic poems such as Mazeppa, a dynamic performance of which, by the Staatskapelle Weimar, opens this disc. Kirill Karabits conducts this and Sardanapalo with pace and purpose, and his singers are strong if not subtle: Joyce El-Khoury makes an impassioned if sometimes squally Mirra, tenor Airam Hern\u00e1ndez is ardent as the king, and Oleksandr Pushniak sings the traditional-spoilsport-bass role of Beleso with all due gravitas. Also out this week The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra\u2019s disc of Schubert\u2019s Symphonies Nos 3, 5 and 8. It\u2019s labelled Volume 1, and if conductor Edward Gardner can keep conjuring playing as lithe and light-footed as this, then Volumes 2 and 3 will be well worth looking out for.",

Let me call you back. Wait \u2013 before you go \u2013 are those airquotes round \u2018black bastard\u2019 yours or his?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, if it helps, he\u2019s ashamed of it now.\u201d</p> <p>We immediately convened a war room in the agency, and our first thought was that this was the worst shit Liam had been in, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/16/starwars\" title=\"\">Phantom Menace</a>.</p> <p>But, you know what, that was the end of the negativity. From that point on, I reminded my brainstormers that there are no bad ideas \u2013 even stalking black neighbourhoods with a cosh, hoping to kill an innocent man, is not, in itself, a \u201cbad idea\u201d. I did the airquotes. The smart move is to realise we are just looking at this thing the wrong way.</p> <p>Ancient oriental martial philosophy has long been core to our approach and it remains so to this day. And it wasn\u2019t long before someone brought up that incredibly powerful Sun Tzu quote: \u201cMany battles are won by people totally not actually noticing they are being fought.\u201d Like, maybe no one will see the interview? Or maybe it will appear on a day that Harrison Ford or Steven Spielberg also recall youthful lynching fantasies. We agreed the courageous thing to do here was to simply decline to comment. I don\u2019t think we need to feed this story. It does not behove \u2013 behoove? \u2013 us to stoop to the level of feeding stories.</p> <h2><strong>Monday</strong><br></h2> <p>OK, so, it turns out people did see the interview.</p> <p>Took a 6am call from a delighted rival, who cackled that I must be losing my mind over this. And I was like: \u201cWhat? I\u2019m extremely relaxed. I\u2019m at home on my running machine, powerwalking. Wait \u2013 I think I just saw a shadow in my yard. Oh, that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s just my gardener.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, the reason I\u2019m so relaxed, apart from the powerwalking, is that we no longer live in those dark, unsophisticated days where it was OK to react to some ludicrous celebrity utterance with the verdict: \u201cGod, what a complete asshole. I mean, really, what an out-and-out fucker.\u201d These days, there is really NO utterance too outlandishly vile or fist-gnawingly batshit that people will not regard it as having \u201cstarted an important conversation\u201d.</p> <p>And that, in an incredibly real and ideally even lucrative way \u2013 let\u2019s not rule lucrative out \u2013 is what Liam has done. Cinema\u2019s Liam Neeson has S<em>tarted An Important Conversation</em>. it was the first thing I said to Good Morning America\u2019s booker when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/05/liam-neeson-says-he-is-not-a-racist-in-wake-of-rape-comments\" title=\"\">wanted to get Liam on to apologise</a>. I said: \u201cActually, Liam has started a really important conversation.\u201d</p> <p>And she goes: \u201cWhat conversation? Like, a man walks into a bar and says: \u2018Which one of you guys wants to get coshed to death for being black?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And I said: \u201cDon\u2019t get uppity with me. You\u2019re stuck on the non-conversation. You\u2019re looking at this from the wrong angle. The meta-conversation, that all the really rational people are having, is about revenge, masculinity, sexual politics and the dark places that exist within us all. It\u2019s really nothing to do with standing outside bars hoping a suitable black murder victim would emerge with the time-worn inquiry: \u2018Want some?\u2019 So confident am I,\u201d I told her, \u201cthat Liam has started a conversation, that I am going to let him go on your show and talk some more. And he\u2019s booked with Ryan Seacrest after that.\u201d</p> <h2>Tuesday<br></h2> <p>I watched both of Liam\u2019s TV appearances and he did a great job. Perfect. The most moving bit was when he talked about the hurt he had felt, but how he had been helped by a priest blah blah blah, \u201cand, believe it or not, powerwalking\u201d.</p> <p>I can and do believe it. Need to put a call into StairMaster. In terms of sponsorship potential, Liam might just have started an incredibly important conversation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the movie. We still had the Cold Pursuit premiere in Manhattan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/05/liam-neeson-red-carpet-event-cancelled-following-remarks\" title=\"\">but we didn\u2019t do a red carpet</a>. Pulling that section of the evening was a delicately balanced call. You know, I\u2019m fine with the whole \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d line of questioning, but if the follow-up is something like, \u201cCould you just demonstrate the size of the cosh you took to black areas to potentially kill someone?\u201d, then I think that is a situation we\u2019d want to keep the talent out of.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06533e57866b29b530aa46e55f3430779357622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06533e57866b29b530aa46e55f3430779357622/0_92_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Neeson on Good Morning America\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Liam did a great job on Good Morning America.

I\u2019m extremely happy. For the first day or so of this crisis, I\u2019d see something on the metaphorical horizon, and I\u2019d think: Is that a Zulu? Is it bad? Is it good? Ooh, it\u2019s a think piece \u2013 but I can\u2019t make out what it says yet. And yet, as they hove \u2013 hoove? \u2013 into focus, most of these things just said: It\u2019s good and important to talk about our sustained attempted lynching sprees. I mean, who among us?</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m thrilled to see the waves this conversation is making around the world. There was a guy on British TV, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/john-barnes-liam-neeson-deserves-a-medal-for-race-admission-11628709\" title=\"\">a John Barnes</a>, who judged that people would now be afraid to tell the truth about how they feel \u201cbecause of what\u2019s happened to Liam Neeson\u201d.</p> <p>I guess I\u2019d say to him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. People absolutely can still talk at the highest level about their intention to commit racially motivated homicide, because, really, nothing has happened to Liam Neeson. He has movies in pre-production, production and post-production.\u201d</p> <p>On second thoughts, I would make it clear that WHITE people can still talk about this stuff. I don\u2019t want to be liable for anything that might happen to \u2026 the others \u2026 if they pull this shit.</p> <p>Which reminds me, the way this whole thing is now skewing, I am anticipating significant engagement from grateful representatives of The Black Community, which I see as a homogenised entity. What I would say to it \u2013 the black community, I mean \u2013 is that flowers or muffin baskets are more fuss than Liam would be comfortable with. In many ways, he\u2019s a very traditional man, would you believe.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I understand that you want to express gratitude for a) not being killed by him back then; b) the healing power of powerwalking; and c) the fact that Liam has Started A Really Important Conversation about people wanting to violently murder you simply for being black. But the best way you can do this is by simply thanking him for his service. I will consider opening an appreciation book in each of your neighbourhoods/areas/whatever for you to pay your respects.\u201d</p> <h2>Thursday<br></h2> <p>Wow \u2013 I almost miss the storm now it has basically passed! Still, the lull has given me a chance to meet with the producers of Taken 4, who have harnessed The Started Conversation in an incredible way. I know we\u2019re highly comfortable with Liam taking vengeance on poorly caricatured Albanians or whatever, because that\u2019s what most of the earlier movies in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/07/taken\" title=\"\">the franchise</a> were about. But, this time, they want him to kick it up a gear. This time, he faces up to a new, much more ruthless and uncompromising enemy. These guys appear to operate completely above the law, they specialise in getting away with it, their power is unimaginable, and their criminal masterstroke is brainwashing people to think they are victims in situations they totally perpetrated. Yes, they are The White Guys of a Certain Age \u2013 and I\u2019m delighted that Taken 4 may now be considered officially in development.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sunday So I got a call from a British newspaper reaching out for comment. \u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cOn what?\u201d She says: \u201cYour client Liam Neeson took the opportunity of a 17-minute promotional interview for his new movie Cold Pursuit to reveal that when a friend of his was raped in the past, he asked what colour her attacker was, then went out to black-populated areas in his city with a cosh, for maybe a week, hoping that some \u2018black bastard\u2019 would come out and have a go at him for something so he could kill him.\u201d And I said: \u201cOK. Let me call you back. Wait \u2013 before you go \u2013 are those airquotes round \u2018black bastard\u2019 yours or his?\u201d \u201cHis,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, if it helps, he\u2019s ashamed of it now.\u201d We immediately convened a war room in the agency, and our first thought was that this was the worst shit Liam had been in, including Phantom Menace. But, you know what, that was the end of the negativity. From that point on, I reminded my brainstormers that there are no bad ideas \u2013 even stalking black neighbourhoods with a cosh, hoping to kill an innocent man, is not, in itself, a \u201cbad idea\u201d. I did the airquotes. The smart move is to realise we are just looking at this thing the wrong way. Ancient oriental martial philosophy has long been core to our approach and it remains so to this day. And it wasn\u2019t long before someone brought up that incredibly powerful Sun Tzu quote: \u201cMany battles are won by people totally not actually noticing they are being fought.\u201d Like, maybe no one will see the interview? Or maybe it will appear on a day that Harrison Ford or Steven Spielberg also recall youthful lynching fantasies. We agreed the courageous thing to do here was to simply decline to comment. I don\u2019t think we need to feed this story. It does not behove \u2013 behoove? \u2013 us to stoop to the level of feeding stories. Monday OK, so, it turns out people did see the interview. Took a 6am call from a delighted rival, who cackled that I must be losing my mind over this. And I was like: \u201cWhat? I\u2019m extremely relaxed. I\u2019m at home on my running machine, powerwalking. Wait \u2013 I think I just saw a shadow in my yard. Oh, that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s just my gardener.\u201d Of course, the reason I\u2019m so relaxed, apart from the powerwalking, is that we no longer live in those dark, unsophisticated days where it was OK to react to some ludicrous celebrity utterance with the verdict: \u201cGod, what a complete asshole. I mean, really, what an out-and-out fucker.\u201d These days, there is really NO utterance too outlandishly vile or fist-gnawingly batshit that people will not regard it as having \u201cstarted an important conversation\u201d. And that, in an incredibly real and ideally even lucrative way \u2013 let\u2019s not rule lucrative out \u2013 is what Liam has done. Cinema\u2019s Liam Neeson has Started An Important Conversation. it was the first thing I said to Good Morning America\u2019s booker when she wanted to get Liam on to apologise.

Home, I\u2019m Darling is at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre, London, until 13 April, and then touring the UK. ed1909 asks: Are you a fan of Matt Berry\u2019s music? Willy Wonka asks: Maltesers or Minstrels? Ah. Forgot about the advert. Ham sandwich or Beef paste cob? porterrichard asks: If you were to switch yourself off and on again, which personal fault/trait would you like to lose/reset? Murraythemint asks: Can you use a com pu ter, yet? zed5dead asks: I showed some Italian friends your attempts at speaking their language in The IT Crowd (and also some old Dolmio adverts). They didn\u2019t really get it, but that made it more funny to me. Can you speak any Italian? tallisisdead asks: You are wonderful in Home, I\u2019m Darling \u2013 as is all the cast, but you especially \u2013 and it\u2019s a hilarious, thought-provoking play. What has it been like working closely with a writer and a director from the start of the process? Has anything from this process informed your writing? ecnicholson asks: The first episode of Defending the Guilty was excellent. I\u2019m a criminal barrister and thought it was spot-on. What\u2019s happened to it? Will there be any more episodes? AlexNeedham asks: Is Home, I\u2019m Darling a giant metaphor for Brexit? Hellios1978 asks: I heard a rumour that all your vintage dresses on The IT Crowd and The Kennedys were your own. Is this true? theeccentriccam asks: Was the Maltesers advert you starred in pivotal in advancing your on-screen career? How did you feel when they started rebroadcasting it after your IT Crowd success? Isolde2 asks: Is there any great classical role you are desperate to play? Or any you felt unsuited for and wished you hadn\u2019t? aemenzies17 asks: I have truly enjoyed your work, especially Doc Martin. I have heard that while filming the show, the cast stayed in Cornwall for months at a time? I am thinking about relocating to Cornwall and wondering if you have any observations, opinions, ideas, or advice about the area? The locals? ThisNameisMine asks: What\u2019s it like living with Ray \u201cBloody\u201d Purchase? And have you ever thought about a joint project? Anielarke1 asks: Would you like to appear on stage with any of the revered dames: Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren? If so, which play, or something original? Archivist SN asks: Matt Berry, Chris O\u2019Dowd, Richard Ayoade: snog, marry, avoid? daveycampbell20 asks: Who was the biggest joker on The IT Crowd set? Observatoire asks: I enjoy Doc Martin, but do you think Cornish people feel insulted by their depiction as a bunch of simpletons? kbkc asks: Thank you for entertaining so many of us so very well. Have you ever learned a personal lesson from one of the characters you\u2019ve played? Do you think there are enough opportunities for would-be actors who come from poor backgrounds? Do you have a particularly strong view on the behaviour of theatre audiences? Moshkin asks: What is your preferred crisp flavour? norfolkchowdhury asks: What has been your favourite theatre role, and why? matildafrump asks: Are there any props from the Home, I\u2019m Darling set that you want to take home at the end of the run? (I\u2019d love quite a few of them.) \u201cI\u2019m going to put you in IT,\u201d Chris Morris tells Katherine Parkinson in the first episode of The IT Crowd. Cue an unforgettable scene of squirmy comedy, as she elaborates on the supposedly vast experience of computing outlined on her CV, which actually amounts to \u201csending emails, receiving emails, deleting emails \u2026\u201d Katherine went from playing Jen Barber on the Channel 4 comedy to further TV roles in The Honourable Woman, The Kennedys, Humans, In the Club and Hang Ups.

Why do things seem to be changing right now?</p> \n<p><strong>Winnie:</strong> Why did we go viral? I think we said things that people have wanted to hear, especially on a big stage where powerful politicians and companies are represented. And they are rarely said. People go there and speak in coded words and praise themselves and spin out the stats that suit them, but for once we spoke plainly about the challenges that people face.</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood.</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> I don\u2019t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn\u2019t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It\u2019s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goFzOBk9-sY\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/goFzOBk9-sY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch Rutger Bregman and Winnie Byanyima in conversation at Davos.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Anand: </strong>The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power; it\u2019s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it\u2019s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it\u2019s ever been. Never mind the fact that we\u2019re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires \u2013 as long as they are doing good things, we don\u2019t ask what else they do; as long as they are giving back, we don\u2019t ask how they made their money. It\u2019s like a mafia deal: no questions asked.</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3983cf20-a02f-42ae-befb-be383ae8e091\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum.

How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years?</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it\u2019s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: \u201cWait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Humanism is not only for people on the left. It is for people who don\u2019t want to be gaslit by the pretensions of the private-jet set</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anand Giridharadas</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest.</p> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language \u2013 words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats\u2019 bidding. One is \u201cwin-win\u201d. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win \u2013 in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others.</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It\u2019s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems.</p> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> A couple more examples. Take \u201cthought leader\u201d. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don\u2019t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don\u2019t expect. Another instance is \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as \u201csocial impact\u201d and \u201csocial venture capital\u201d and \u201cimpact investing\u201d. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cdignity\u201d. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes.</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term \u201cclimate justice\u201d. You can talk about \u201cclimate change\u201d, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer \u201cclimate action\u201d, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don\u2019t place the responsibility where it lies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b33d181e929d2fbbfec7d932d667021632267d07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33d181e929d2fbbfec7d932d667021632267d07/0_543_3592_2154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Win-winners \u2026 the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Win-winners \u2026 the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michel Euler/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals; almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes \u2013 or at least doesn\u2019t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn\u2019t working. And that\u2019s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. </p> \n<p>When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity; homophobia; racism; the establishment. But you also need to know what you are <em>for</em>. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn\u2019t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed.</p> \n<p>Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I\u2019ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the \u201cend of history\u201d was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy \u2013 win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that\u2019s not traumatised by the cold war. I\u2019ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, \u201cOh that sounds like Venezuela\u201d \u2013 Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You have a huge class of people who haven\u2019t done any real work themselves \u2013 they were just born into certain families</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Rutger Bregman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> I\u2019ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I\u2019ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I\u2019ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this \u201cThere is no alternative\u201d talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it\u2019s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy.</p> \n<p>I think we need to really claim this mantle of humanism because it\u2019s not only for people on the left. It is for everyone who does not want to be gaslit by the pretensions of the private-jet set. I really sense, even with people on the right, that there is anger about monopolies, political corruption and crony capitalism. There is anger about companies that talk a big game about belonging to communities, but actually make their decisions based on factors that have nothing to do with those communities. What we have yet to see is political leadership that is able to speak to those not only belonging to the left but also to that 10 or 20% of the folks on the right who are also against plutocracy, even if they may like markets. Such people may like business and may like the idea of making \u00a3100,000 with their own barber shop one day, but they don\u2019t like Amazon being the only retailer in the US, they don\u2019t like Facebook controlling democracy and abetting ethnic violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1748f38a353843925a2d11edaa0ec3cb5071541e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1748f38a353843925a2d11edaa0ec3cb5071541e/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a Amazon warehouse, in Milton Keynes, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a Amazon warehouse, in Milton Keynes, England.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Vincent/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> One thing I\u2019ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn\u2019t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to.</p> \n<p>One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology \u2013 it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. </p> \n<p>In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn\u2019t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It\u2019s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The super-rich use their money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Winnie Byanyima</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don\u2019t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people \u2013 they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires\u2019 tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: \u201cx-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses\u201d. We use that kind of language \u2013 it\u2019s emotive, it has an impact on people.</p> \n<p><strong>A</strong><strong>:</strong> In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language.</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> Here\u2019s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That\u2019s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven\u2019t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I\u2019ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It\u2019s \u201cventure capitalism for the people\u201d, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can\u2019t get around it.</p> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta\u2011Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: \u201cPart of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.\u201d And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157387580ff83ad05cae9e0a4130c74d8d1fe449\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157387580ff83ad05cae9e0a4130c74d8d1fe449/83_342_1675_1004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic representative for the Bronx and Queens in New York, found herself \u2018in the middle of of a narrative around access and power\u2019.

Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly.</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> I\u2019m 30 years old. I\u2019ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals \u2013 those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. </p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> I hope that\u2019s true.</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, \u201cOh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride \u2013 all the trains are good.\u201d But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable.</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm?</p> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> My view from the US, and I bet it\u2019s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can\u2019t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can\u2019t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can\u2019t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft.</p> \n<p>The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that\u2019s not a theft at all, it\u2019s a wave of rising equality; it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to divert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others \u2013 they are the ones who stole the dream from you.</p> \n<p>And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ask people what kind of country they would like to live and almost everyone says: 'Somewhere like Sweden'</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Rutger Bregman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen?</p> \n<p><strong>R:</strong> If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: \u201cSomewhere like Sweden.\u201d Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it\u2019s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: \u201cWe should not allow them to define us.\u201d The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together \u2013 black, white, men, women, that doesn\u2019t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don\u2019t allow them to divide us.</p> \n<p><strong>W:</strong> We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it\u2019s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I\u2019m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. </p> \n<p><strong>A:</strong> I do feel tremendously hopeful, which is strange because my country has the most dangerous leader it has ever had, and things are very fractured around the world. I was recently in Britain in the House of Commons when they took that chaotic vote [on Brexit] a couple weeks ago, so it may seem strange to be hopeful. But there are cycles in history, and I believe we are at the natural end of a 40-year cycle, defined by the religion of money, defined by the veneration of entrepreneurs and markets. And instead of just saying, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong\u201d, I think it\u2019s more empathetic to ourselves as a society to say that the last 40 years has been an experiment, an era defined by entrepreneurs as heroes, markets as gods \u2013 just as a century ago there was the industrial revolution and the first gilded age, a time of great fortunes. I think we are living in the death pangs of an era that has done tremendous good, but has also done tremendous harm, that has lifted a lot of people out of poverty, but also put the planet in mortal jeopardy. And I feel hope that another era has to follow this era because that is how history works. As well as the death pangs, there are birth pangs right now. I believe that after the age of markets will come the age of reform and the age of solidarity.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

R: I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood. W: I don\u2019t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn\u2019t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It\u2019s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again. Anand: The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power; it\u2019s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it\u2019s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it\u2019s ever been. Never mind the fact that we\u2019re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires \u2013 as long as they are doing good things, we don\u2019t ask what else they do; as long as they are giving back, we don\u2019t ask how they made their money. It\u2019s like a mafia deal: no questions asked. R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years? W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it\u2019s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: \u201cWait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.\u201d R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest. A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language \u2013 words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats\u2019 bidding. One is \u201cwin-win\u201d. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win \u2013 in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others. W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It\u2019s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems. A: A couple more examples. Take \u201cthought leader\u201d. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don\u2019t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don\u2019t expect. Another instance is \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as \u201csocial impact\u201d and \u201csocial venture capital\u201d and \u201cimpact investing\u201d. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cdignity\u201d. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes. W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term \u201cclimate justice\u201d. You can talk about \u201cclimate change\u201d, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer \u201cclimate action\u201d, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don\u2019t place the responsibility where it lies. R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals; almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes \u2013 or at least doesn\u2019t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn\u2019t working. And that\u2019s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity; homophobia; racism; the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn\u2019t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed. Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I\u2019ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the \u201cend of history\u201d was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy \u2013 win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that\u2019s not traumatised by the cold war. I\u2019ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, \u201cOh that sounds like Venezuela\u201d \u2013 Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: \u201cWhatever.\u201d A: I\u2019ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I\u2019ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I\u2019ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this \u201cThere is no alternative\u201d talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it\u2019s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy. I think we need to really claim this mantle of humanism because it\u2019s not only for people on the left. It is for everyone who does not want to be gaslit by the pretensions of the private-jet set. I really sense, even with people on the right, that there is anger about monopolies, political corruption and crony capitalism. There is anger about companies that talk a big game about belonging to communities, but actually make their decisions based on factors that have nothing to do with those communities. What we have yet to see is political leadership that is able to speak to those not only belonging to the left but also to that 10 or 20% of the folks on the right who are also against plutocracy, even if they may like markets. Such people may like business and may like the idea of making \u00a3100,000 with their own barber shop one day, but they don\u2019t like Amazon being the only retailer in the US, they don\u2019t like Facebook controlling democracy and abetting ethnic violence. R: One thing I\u2019ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn\u2019t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to. One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology \u2013 it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn\u2019t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It\u2019s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around. W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don\u2019t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people \u2013 they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires\u2019 tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: \u201cx-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses\u201d. We use that kind of language \u2013 it\u2019s emotive, it has an impact on people. A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language. R: Here\u2019s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That\u2019s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven\u2019t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I\u2019ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It\u2019s \u201cventure capitalism for the people\u201d, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can\u2019t get around it. A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta\u2011Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: \u201cPart of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.\u201d And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories. W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly. R: I\u2019m 30 years old. I\u2019ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals \u2013 those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that\u2019s true. R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, \u201cOh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride \u2013 all the trains are good.\u201d But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable. W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm? A: My view from the US, and I bet it\u2019s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can\u2019t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can\u2019t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can\u2019t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft. The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that\u2019s not a theft at all, it\u2019s a wave of rising equality; it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to divert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others \u2013 they are the ones who stole the dream from you. And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen? R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: \u201cSomewhere like Sweden.\u201d Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it\u2019s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: \u201cWe should not allow them to define us.\u201d The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together \u2013 black, white, men, women, that doesn\u2019t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don\u2019t allow them to divide us. W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it\u2019s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I\u2019m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. A: I do feel tremendously hopeful, which is strange because my country has the most dangerous leader it has ever had, and things are very fractured around the world. I was recently in Britain in the House of Commons when they took that chaotic vote [on Brexit] a couple weeks ago, so it may seem strange to be hopeful. But there are cycles in history, and I believe we are at the natural end of a 40-year cycle, defined by the religion of money, defined by the veneration of entrepreneurs and markets. And instead of just saying, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong\u201d, I think it\u2019s more empathetic to ourselves as a society to say that the last 40 years has been an experiment, an era defined by entrepreneurs as heroes, markets as gods \u2013 just as a century ago there was the industrial revolution and the first gilded age, a time of great fortunes. I think we are living in the death pangs of an era that has done tremendous good, but has also done tremendous harm, that has lifted a lot of people out of poverty, but also put the planet in mortal jeopardy. And I feel hope that another era has to follow this era because that is how history works. As well as the death pangs, there are birth pangs right now. I believe that after the age of markets will come the age of reform and the age of solidarity. \u2022 Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

In October, Singer posted a message on social media in anticipation of the article, which had then been due to be published in Esquire magazine, accusing journalists of \u201ca reckless disregard for the truth, making assumptions that are fictional and irresponsible.\u201d In 2017, Singer denied accusations by Cesar Sanchez-Guzman, who had alleged that, as a 17-year-old in 2003, he was sexually assaulted by Singer on a yacht. Singer was fired from Bohemian Rhapsody before filming ended, and was replaced by Dexter Fletcher; however Singer remains the sole credited director owing to union regulations. Singer has consistently denied wrongdoing, and was recently reported to have been hired to direct a remake of the 1980s action flick Red Sonja. He did not attend the Golden Globe awards, where Bohemian Rhapsody won best film (drama) and best actor (drama) for Malek, but posted a now-deleted thank you note on social media. The Bafta film awards take place on Sunday 10 February.",

It is an exceptional event that will see young ladies showcase their beautiful curves and intellect,\u201d said Mungoma.</p> <p>Women aged 18 to 35 are eligible to participate in the contest, according to organisers.</p> <p>But in an angry response to the scheme, Simon Lokodo, the state minister for ethics and integrity, said the contest \u201cdefinitely could not happen\u201d.</p> <p>Lokodo said: \u201cIt\u2019s shameful. I strongly condemn it. It demeans women and completely destroys their integrity. You can\u2019t bring people from abroad to come and see the physiognomy of your people [women].</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not different from the striptease<em> </em>that they put in bars and lodges.

In a separate row, a Kenyan TV personality has said she will take legal action over the use of her photograph to promote the contest. Grace Msalame said she was not aware of the campaign, and was appalled that women\u2019s bodies were being used in that way. As social media users mocked the campaign for using a Kenyan to promote Uganda, Msalame issued a strongly worded statement, saying she took \u201cgreat offence\u201d to her image being used to \u201cpropagate, disseminate and encourage the objectification of women.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e37020189147e650e677b872a7f76cdae13745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e37020189147e650e677b872a7f76cdae13745/0_0_966_679/500.jpg\" alt=\"The homepage of the Miss Curvy Uganda 2019 website\" width=\"500\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The homepage of the Miss Curvy Uganda 2019 website.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miss Curvy Uganda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rita Aciro, executive director of the Uganda Women\u2019s Network, said the minister should resign over \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201cdegrading\u201d women.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame to women and girls of Ugandans.

      "bodyText": "A plan to promote Uganda\u2019s tourist industry with a \u201cMiss Curvy\u201d beauty contest has caused a government row in the east African nation. The proposal to add \u201ccurvy and sexy women\u201d to official literature listing Uganda\u2019s attractions, devised by the country\u2019s tourism minister, has drawn an angry rebuke from the minister of ethics and integrity and condemnation from women\u2019s right activists. Godfrey Kiwanda officially launched the \u201cMiss Curvy Uganda\u201d beauty pageant on Tuesday, with the finalists to be selected in June, as part of his \u201cTulambule\u201d (\u201clet\u2019s tour\u201d) promotion to attract foreign visitors. \u201cWe have naturally endowed, nice-looking women that are amazing to look at. Why don\u2019t we use these people as a strategy to promote our tourism industry,\u201d said Kiwanda at a launch event in the capital, Kampala, while gesturing at a lineup of unhappy looking contestants on a stage. Ann Mungoma, the contest\u2019s chief organiser, said the initiative was designed to promote an appreciation of beauty in diversity. \u201cMiss Curvy is an event that will bring out the endowment of the real African woman. It is an exceptional event that will see young ladies showcase their beautiful curves and intellect,\u201d said Mungoma. Women aged 18 to 35 are eligible to participate in the contest, according to organisers. But in an angry response to the scheme, Simon Lokodo, the state minister for ethics and integrity, said the contest \u201cdefinitely could not happen\u201d. Lokodo said: \u201cIt\u2019s shameful. I strongly condemn it. It demeans women and completely destroys their integrity. You can\u2019t bring people from abroad to come and see the physiognomy of your people [women]. \u201cIt\u2019s not different from the striptease that they put in bars and lodges. It completely reduces a woman to toys of entertainment. \u201cI am already receiving a lot of support from women themselves, including [female] members of parliament. Everybody is against the competition.\u201d Kiwanda has been using women, including socialites Zari Hassan and Anita Kyarimpa Fabiola, as the face of the \u201clet\u2019s tour and explore\u201d innovation, a measure introduced to resuscitate enthusiasm in the tourism sector. In a separate row, a Kenyan TV personality has said she will take legal action over the use of her photograph to promote the contest. Grace Msalame said she was not aware of the campaign, and was appalled that women\u2019s bodies were being used in that way. As social media users mocked the campaign for using a Kenyan to promote Uganda, Msalame issued a strongly worded statement, saying she took \u201cgreat offence\u201d to her image being used to \u201cpropagate, disseminate and encourage the objectification of women.\u201d Rita Aciro, executive director of the Uganda Women\u2019s Network, said the minister should resign over \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201cdegrading\u201d women. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to women and girls of Ugandans. It\u2019s an exposure of scant knowledge of his job and what it takes. Common sense tells you tourism is not promoted using women\u2019s bodies. Women are not sex objects,\u201d said Aciro. \u201cUgandan women have offered better for this country. He should apologise to Ugandans and should resign his position. The government should disassociate itself for the minister.\u201d Perry Aritua, executive director of the Women\u2019s Democracy Network in Uganda, said: \u201cThis is just despicable. Women still [continue to] face derogatory treatment. It\u2019s against the fight against sexual and gender based violence in this country. \u201cArticle 33 of our constitution is very clear that women will be accorded equal dignity with men. So when you objectify women as a form of tourism, you have reduced their dignity Activist Primrose Nyonyozi Murungi has launched a petition on charge.org calling for the pageant to be scrapped, with overwhelming numbers signing up in support. \u201cIn a country where women are grabbed by men while walking on the streets, they have legalised it by making them tourist attractions. It is not fair. They are objectifying us and reducing women to nothing,\u201d said Murungi. Uganda earns approximately $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) a year from the tourism sector, with the country\u2019s wildlife-rich national parks a major draw, according to government statistics.",

In real life, Han Han famously flipped his middle finger at officials on the racetrack. But he must be mellowing \u2013 because with this comeback story he keeps his eye firmly on the mainstream, steering steady-as-you-go down the middle of the road.</p> <p>Comedy actor Shen Teng plays Zhang Chi, an arrogant five-times champ slapped with a five-year ban after a spot of after-hours racing in a multi-storey car park. The film opens with Zhang Chi nearing the end of his ban, flat broke, deserted by fans and sponsors, cooking fried rice on a street food stall. He\u2019s a few pounds heavier but just as cocky. The way he gets his career back in gear unfolds in a more or less predictable manner \u2013 making amends with teammates, getting his old car race-worthy and humiliating himself on reality TV in a desperate attempt to raise finances.</p> <p>A nice touch here is his rival, hotshot new champion Lin Zhengdong (Huang Jingyu), the son of a billionaire property developer, whose family has machine tooled his success, buying in the best team and most expensive cars. Not a stereotypical villain \u2013 Lin actually wants to help Zhang Chi get back on the track to put a stop to gossip that his own winning streak is all money, no skill. </p> <p>It might not be the social commentary that Han Han built his reputation on, but perhaps he\u2019s making the point that, with blandly slick professionalism like Lin\u2019s, something is being lost in the pursuit of Chinese prosperity \u2013 the view of the city from Zhang Chi\u2019s flat is about to be spoiled by construction of a giant skyscraper.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIdHNx6cF8M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DIdHNx6cF8M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "This likable, unchallenging Chinese sports movie, about a has-been rally driver out to prove he\u2019s still got what it takes after a lengthy ban, is the third film directed by Han Han, the superstar blogger/novelist/rally driver/film-maker once hailed as the voice of a generation of Chinese millennials. In real life, Han Han famously flipped his middle finger at officials on the racetrack. But he must be mellowing \u2013 because with this comeback story he keeps his eye firmly on the mainstream, steering steady-as-you-go down the middle of the road. Comedy actor Shen Teng plays Zhang Chi, an arrogant five-times champ slapped with a five-year ban after a spot of after-hours racing in a multi-storey car park. The film opens with Zhang Chi nearing the end of his ban, flat broke, deserted by fans and sponsors, cooking fried rice on a street food stall. He\u2019s a few pounds heavier but just as cocky. The way he gets his career back in gear unfolds in a more or less predictable manner \u2013 making amends with teammates, getting his old car race-worthy and humiliating himself on reality TV in a desperate attempt to raise finances. A nice touch here is his rival, hotshot new champion Lin Zhengdong (Huang Jingyu), the son of a billionaire property developer, whose family has machine tooled his success, buying in the best team and most expensive cars. Not a stereotypical villain \u2013 Lin actually wants to help Zhang Chi get back on the track to put a stop to gossip that his own winning streak is all money, no skill. It might not be the social commentary that Han Han built his reputation on, but perhaps he\u2019s making the point that, with blandly slick professionalism like Lin\u2019s, something is being lost in the pursuit of Chinese prosperity \u2013 the view of the city from Zhang Chi\u2019s flat is about to be spoiled by construction of a giant skyscraper.",

EDF Energy said more than 150 jobs were likely to be cut due to the closure of the Cottam plant in north Nottinghamshire on 30 September. The power station was no longer economically viable, the company said. Cottam has been hit by the costs of working to European environmental standards and the failure to secure a contract for payments supply backup power after September. The UK government has pledged to end coal power generation in the UK by 2025 to meet its climate change commitments. Just seven years ago, coal was a cornerstone of the energy system, providing more than 40% of electricity, but a series of closures in the face of poor economics have led to it tumbling to 5% last year. The most recent plant to shut was Eggborough in Yorkshire last year. Gas and renewables have taken up the slack, as new windfarms have been connected to the grid. Cottam started operating in 1969 and is capable of powering around 3.7m homes, though in recent years it will have been operating well below its maximum capacity. EDF Energy, which bought the 2GW plant in 2000, said Cottam had performed well beyond its original 30-year lifespan due to investment and upgrades. But it said the closure was not a surprise. \u201cThere has been an aspiration to move away from coal for a long time now and we have prepared thoroughly for the closure,\u201d said Andy Powell, Cottam\u2019s plant manager.

But the social network was criticised by activist groups such as Noyb (\u201cNone of your business\u201d) for not allowing users to decline consent without also forcing them to delete their account. \u201cIn the end, users only had the choice to delete the account or hit the agree button \u2013 that\u2019s not a free choice, it more reminds of a North Korean election process,\u201d said Noyb\u2019s chair, Max Schrems, in May 2018.",

But what he deeply thinks and feels hardly matters at this point. What matters is what he says and does now, if he wants Labour to win. Some have hailed his letter as a cunning manoeuvre: just as May arrives in Brussels today, he has pre-empted her with a Norway-style alternative that could, just possibly, squeak through the Commons. EU negotiators could embarrass her by urging her to take it up. He could find backing among those MPs of the Lisa Nandy/Caroline Flint/John Mann wing of the party already threatening to back a Brexit deal. The TSSA poll finds that Labour would lose 11 leaver seats by opposing Brexit, instead of 45 if it supports it. Those MPs in leave-voting seats claim they can bring 60 Labour MPs to back a softened Brexit. Others say no more than 25 MPs \u2013 the number voting with the government or abstaining last time \u2013 would cross the floor on the next vote. If Labour votes were to swing Brexit, history will look back on these as appeasers and trimmers who helped cause a national disaster \u2013 and a disaster for Labour too. Timing is all: the moment for Labour to call for delay and a final-say referendum will come if May fails on a vote a second time. Wait until all that\u2019s left is no-deal or a referendum. Meanwhile, Corbyn\u2019s letter sends out a badly misjudged message and unless this tone is corrected sharply, expect a backlash from Labour members and voters. Brexit is a Tory beast that Labour needs to skewer. The TSSA poll shows that any flirtation with Brexit will cripple Labour and alienate the young who Corbyn drew in. That\u2019s confirmed by a new ComRes poll for Lead Not Leave, finding 72% of voters aged between 18 and 34 back staying in a reformed EU, compared with just 38% of people aged 55 and over. The young are even more strongly against a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, the TSSA polling concludes: \u201cIf there is an election in 2019, Labour will get a lower share of the vote in every seat in the country if it has a pro-Brexit policy than if it has an anti-Brexit position.\u201d \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is releasing a broad outline of a vision for the Green New Deal, a plan to battle economic and racial injustice while also fighting climate change. The new congresswoman\u2019s blueprint, co-introduced by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, aims to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US\u2019s reliance on oil, gas and coal. It does not set a date for ending the use of fossil fuels. Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal \u201cto achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions\u201d. That includes getting all power from \u201cclean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources\u201d. The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education \u2013 a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution. Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet from congressional aides that did not include a list of supporters. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be \u201cmassive\u201d. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said a select committee on climate change, which she has announced the members of, will not be tasked with writing a specific bill and called the Green New Deal a \u201csuggestion\u201d. \u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with Politico. \u201cThe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it right?\u201d Discussions on what shape the plan would take also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations, as well as the youth-run Sunrise Movement. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea, but to lay out specific legislative goals. Some environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, said they were encouraged by the movement on climate change but that the resolution does not do enough to confront fossil fuels. The Sierra Club, however, welcomed the document. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal. But the resolution itself focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change. It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. One of its goals is \u201cto promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth\u201d.

He was struggling to bolster support for his faltering domestic agenda and anticipated foreign one; the Four Freedoms were eventually mythologized and sentimentalized in paintings by none other than Norman Rockwell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/06/children-skipping-school-ruining-planet-strike-climate-change\">The children skipping school aren't ruining the planet \u2013 you are | Sre\u0107ko Horvat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re not trying to reclaim American patriotism or generate support for a coming world war.

But their vision of freedom as your right as an individual to do whatever you want \u2013 so long as you can pay for it \u2013 is a recipe for disaster in the 21st century, when it\u2019s clearer than ever that all our fates are bound up together. Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist\u2019s freedom to invest or the consumer\u2019s freedom to buy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist\u2019s freedom to invest or the consumer\u2019s freedom to buy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here, we modestly upstage FDR with five freedoms that can orient us to an uncertain future.</p> <p><strong>Freedom from fear</strong>: FDR called for freedom from fear of military conflict. We\u2019re still working on his call for disarmament \u2013 we could start with the US army, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of oil and a purveyor of fear worldwide. We must transform our built environment to grant us freedom from fear of the physical changes that already locked-in global warming will bring: fire and hurricanes, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and storm surges \u2013 and freedom from the fear that those dangers will grow exponentially worse. It also means abolishing the social disasters a volatile planet could exacerbate. We need freedom from food scarcity and water shortages, freedom from racist, colonial, and sexual violence, and freedom from militarized borders. Freedom from fear means guaranteed jobs and homes so that we can survive every storm, every relocation, and every reorganization of industry.</p> <p><strong>Freedom from toil</strong>: We can\u2019t escape work altogether, and there\u2019s a lot of work we need to do, immediately and in the long term. But work doesn\u2019t need to rule our lives. The great nineteenth-century English socialist William Morris made a distinction between useful work and useless toil: we need the former but should free ourselves from the latter. We can escape the crushing toll of working long hours for low wages to make something that someone else owns. At present, there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s worse than useless; it\u2019s toil that\u2019s harmful to the people doing it and to the world in which we live. But even useful work should be distributed more widely so that we can all do less of it \u2013 and spend more time enjoying its fruits.</p> <p><strong>Freedom to move</strong>: We live on a beautiful planet that belongs to everyone; we should all be free to move around it. Freedom to move is particularly crucial for those whose homes are being rendered unlivable by rising temperatures and seas. But we should also be free to travel to enjoy our vibrant world\u2019s wonders. Not as quickly as we do now; we can\u2019t all fly everywhere at the drop of a hat, and some of us need to fly less often. But it\u2019s the reckless waste of the affluent that must end, not the ordinary person\u2019s occasional pleasure in discovering a new corner of the world. Free public transit is necessary to get around without relying on emissions-spewing cars and airplanes. The freedom to move also means the freedom to pack up and live in another city, region, or country. To cope with inevitable climate displacements, we need solidarity without fences or walls.</p> <p><strong>Freedom from domination: </strong>Liberals say the market gives us freedom to choose. But under capitalism, the market is master, determining what we can do and who we can be. Every year or two, we can mark a ballot paper. Every hour of every day the compulsion of the market stamps its will on every aspect of our lives. The left has long sought to end the arbitrary power of the few over the many. We must continue to pursue freedom not only from toil, but from the despotism of the boss, from a viciously enforced racial order, and from the intimate violence of patriarchy. Now, the outrageous power of the few threatens billions with ruin. Domination also names our helplessness in the face of global capitalism. We need to know it\u2019s possible to change our own fate, to be able to imagine the end of capitalism more easily than the end of the world. But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends \u2013 those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on <em>this</em> planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity.</p> <p><strong>Freedom to live</strong>: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and \u2013 most important \u2013 redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom <em>to </em>want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone\u2019s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life spans the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure.</p> <p>Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm.</p> <ul> <li><p>This piece originally appeared in <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/\">Jacobin</a></p></li> </ul>",

But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends \u2013 those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on this planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity. Freedom to live: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and \u2013 most important \u2013 redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom to want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone\u2019s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life spans the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure. Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm. This piece originally appeared in Jacobin",

Following on the heels of an onstage appearance with Jared Leto\u2019s Thirty Seconds to Mars and the announcement that he would like to collaborate with, of all people, pallid teen-poppers the Vamps, a lot of pre-release attention has been attracted not by the album\u2019s guest stars \u2013 a great, calm-but-menacing turn from Giggs on Nothing But Net and rising Brooklyn rapper Jay Critch amid the soft-focus, Auto-Tune-heavy Necklace among them \u2013 or indeed the inevitable co-sign from Drake, but the fact that among its multifarious styles lurks a track that Tracey has described as \u201cmy take on country music\u201d.

The family joke about how the Scots arrived by caravan and by chance: a fireman, a nurse and their children stranded in a vehicle they could not afford to fix, selling it and starting a new life where they had been left: John, Tracey, Ryan, eight, and Emma, seven.</p> <p>And then Jack arrived \u2013 a tale that, told with a grin and a little help from Ryan, unfolds like some 20th-century Spanish nativity scene, as if it was all meant to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/barcelona-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-match-report\">Barcelona\u2019s Malcom scores against Real Madrid to leave semi-final in the balance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey used to come on holiday and thought it was a good place to bring up the next set of kids,\u201d Jack explains. \u201cThey had me on the way to Spain and, about six months later, I was born in the centre of M\u00e1laga, right next to the cathedral. My mum still talks about it. They didn\u2019t know where the hospitals were, didn\u2019t speak Spanish and had no way of communicating; they were expecting a baby, looking for a hospital, asking everyone, but had no idea what anyone said. And it would\u2019ve been a bank holiday, too: I was born on D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda.\u201d</p> <p>So they searched, increasingly fraught. It was 28 February 1996, a leap year. \u201cThey ended up in a private hospital; my dad probably regrets that,\u201d he says. Nearly 23 years on, Harper plays football at La Rosaleda, barely a mile from there. He is, says Marca, a \u201crevelation\u201d, scorer of the goal his coach wants shown at the academy; the striker who is leading M\u00e1laga, third in the second tier, in their attempted return to La Liga; a former Real Madrid forward and not-very-foreign foreigner who is a local hero, an idol, according to the newspaper whose offices are a goalkick from the ground in the city where he was born.</p> <p>The family no longer have a caravan \u2013 \u201cthat would be the dream,\u201d Harper says \u2013 and they moved to nearby Fuengirola, living on M\u00e1laga street. \u201cThere\u2019s an Iceland [store] in M\u00e1laga. Now and again, when I deserve one, I do like an Irn-Bru,\u201d he smiles, but his diet was mostly Mediterranean, his environment too, and he became as Spanish as British. You can hear it in his accent; Scottish in one language, <em>malague\u00f1o</em> in the other. \u201cIt was school then football \u2013 in Spanish \u2013 then a switch in my head when I got home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Ryan, who played for nine Spanish clubs before sustaining a knee injury, and younger brother Mac, forced out by back problems, Harper could play, which took him to Madrid at 13 and a meeting with Cristiano Ronaldo. A lesson, too. \u201cI took a picture. I was tiny; it\u2019s funny looking at that. I\u2019m a fan \u2013 he\u2019s the hardest worker, he was always there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen his car move. If it was easy everyone would do it. He\u2019s obsessed.\u201d</p> <p>Harper does extra shooting and sessions in a hyperbaric chamber \u2013 \u201clike a spaceship\u201d \u2013 and at Madrid he progressed, seeing the first team more often. \u201cAt 17-18, I trained with them a bit. Maybe the manager wants extra men; you play the ones who didn\u2019t get on at the weekend, or you play the centre-back, simulating the striker they\u2019ll be up against. We were workers. You go, play, come back, we weren\u2019t told much. But every year I\u2019d get closer.\u201d</p> <p>Every year people would be more aware, too. \u201cI had Twitter and people messaged me every now and again, going, \u2018Are you actually Scottish?\u2019 I got my first call-up at 15. We went to Largs.\u201d</p> <p>There he was different. \u201cThe only Scottish people I really speak to are my family, I don\u2019t have friends there, so I didn\u2019t have the patter. Even playing, they\u2019d say words I wasn\u2019t sure about. I felt like they\u2019d observe me a bit more, keep their distance, thinking, \u2018He doesn\u2019t even speak English\u2019, or, \u2018His attitude won\u2019t be good because he\u2019s from a big club\u2019.

      "bodyText": "The Harpers had been on the road for 21 days when the engine failed 1,786 miles from where the journey began and still more than 100 from their destination, so they just set up home there. The family joke about how the Scots arrived by caravan and by chance: a fireman, a nurse and their children stranded in a vehicle they could not afford to fix, selling it and starting a new life where they had been left: John, Tracey, Ryan, eight, and Emma, seven. And then Jack arrived \u2013 a tale that, told with a grin and a little help from Ryan, unfolds like some 20th-century Spanish nativity scene, as if it was all meant to be. \u201cThey used to come on holiday and thought it was a good place to bring up the next set of kids,\u201d Jack explains. \u201cThey had me on the way to Spain and, about six months later, I was born in the centre of M\u00e1laga, right next to the cathedral. My mum still talks about it. They didn\u2019t know where the hospitals were, didn\u2019t speak Spanish and had no way of communicating; they were expecting a baby, looking for a hospital, asking everyone, but had no idea what anyone said. And it would\u2019ve been a bank holiday, too: I was born on D\u00eda de Andaluc\u00eda.\u201d So they searched, increasingly fraught. It was 28 February 1996, a leap year. \u201cThey ended up in a private hospital; my dad probably regrets that,\u201d he says. Nearly 23 years on, Harper plays football at La Rosaleda, barely a mile from there. He is, says Marca, a \u201crevelation\u201d, scorer of the goal his coach wants shown at the academy; the striker who is leading M\u00e1laga, third in the second tier, in their attempted return to La Liga; a former Real Madrid forward and not-very-foreign foreigner who is a local hero, an idol, according to the newspaper whose offices are a goalkick from the ground in the city where he was born. The family no longer have a caravan \u2013 \u201cthat would be the dream,\u201d Harper says \u2013 and they moved to nearby Fuengirola, living on M\u00e1laga street. \u201cThere\u2019s an Iceland [store] in M\u00e1laga. Now and again, when I deserve one, I do like an Irn-Bru,\u201d he smiles, but his diet was mostly Mediterranean, his environment too, and he became as Spanish as British. You can hear it in his accent; Scottish in one language, malague\u00f1o in the other. \u201cIt was school then football \u2013 in Spanish \u2013 then a switch in my head when I got home.\u201d Like Ryan, who played for nine Spanish clubs before sustaining a knee injury, and younger brother Mac, forced out by back problems, Harper could play, which took him to Madrid at 13 and a meeting with Cristiano Ronaldo. A lesson, too. \u201cI took a picture. I was tiny; it\u2019s funny looking at that. I\u2019m a fan \u2013 he\u2019s the hardest worker, he was always there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen his car move. If it was easy everyone would do it. He\u2019s obsessed.\u201d Harper does extra shooting and sessions in a hyperbaric chamber \u2013 \u201clike a spaceship\u201d \u2013 and at Madrid he progressed, seeing the first team more often. \u201cAt 17-18, I trained with them a bit. Maybe the manager wants extra men; you play the ones who didn\u2019t get on at the weekend, or you play the centre-back, simulating the striker they\u2019ll be up against. We were workers. You go, play, come back, we weren\u2019t told much. But every year I\u2019d get closer.\u201d Every year people would be more aware, too. \u201cI had Twitter and people messaged me every now and again, going, \u2018Are you actually Scottish?\u2019 I got my first call-up at 15. We went to Largs.\u201d There he was different. \u201cThe only Scottish people I really speak to are my family, I don\u2019t have friends there, so I didn\u2019t have the patter. Even playing, they\u2019d say words I wasn\u2019t sure about. I felt like they\u2019d observe me a bit more, keep their distance, thinking, \u2018He doesn\u2019t even speak English\u2019, or, \u2018His attitude won\u2019t be good because he\u2019s from a big club\u2019. I just wanted to blend in, play for my country. The style was different, too.\u201d Perhaps that crystallised at under\u201119 level when the then coach, Ricky Sbragia, left Harper out, seeking a more physical, taller team \u2013 even though he was already over 6ft. Sbragia said that while Harper was \u201cexceptionally gifted\u201d, he was a \u201cluxury\u201d who could \u201cfloat\u201d for Madrid whereas Scotland needed discipline, insisting: \u201cWe can\u2019t carry him.\u201d He has since admitted being at fault, conceding: \u201cMy choice of words was not exactly brilliant.\u201d Harper would rather say nothing \u2013 but it stung. \u201cI was hurt not to be in.

After the Academy announced a series of high-profile presenters for its \u201chostless\u201d ceremony, a further twist in the saga emerged when actor Dwayne Johnson tweeted that he had been approached to MC the event before Hart, but \u201ccouldn\u2019t make it work\u201d due to filming commitments on a sequel to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.",

      "body": "<p>On those days when the weather seems intrinsically aligned with the state of the world at large \u2013 and with no end in sight \u2013 there is only one thing to do: make soup. Soup can be made from almost anything, with only a hob, a pan and a blender, and as little or as much effort as you want to expend. And, crucially, with appropriate seasoning, soup is instantly and comprehensively comforting.</p> <p>Google pretty much any fresh ingredient and you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a soup recipe for it, which means making it comes with the added virtue of being good for the planet. According to the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">waste and sustainability charity Wrap</a>, British households <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Food-Surplus-and-Waste-UK-Key-Facts-23-11-18.pdf\" title=\"\">waste 5m tonnes</a> of perfectly good food every year \u2013 enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall 100 times over. The leading culprits in these proms of shame are all things to make soup with (in fact, the list of what we most discard reads like its own soup recipe: potato, onion, carrot, milk, bread, cheese, ham). Here are some ideas to get you blending.</p> <p>A few things to bear in mind. First, soup is an eminently flexible dish. Every main vegetable can be substituted with one or several others; any thin broth can be bolstered with cooked grains, bread or noodles. Second, the key to flavoursome food is time: with soup that means cooking down the flavour base your recipe starts with \u2013 whatever combo of onion, carrot, celery, garlic, anchovy, peppers etc \u2013 slowly. Third, a variety of textures will elevate your bowl of soup from baby food to satisfying dinner: be generous and playful with your garnishes. Everything I\u2019ve suggested topping the soups with is interchangeable and accumulable. The hungrier you are, the more loaded your bowl can be. Finally, there is no soup that won\u2019t benefit from a final squeeze of lemon and some flaky salt.</p> <h2>Bread</h2> <p>For a nation of toasters (surely the first thing to do with a loaf that is going stale), Britain bins a baffling 20m slices every day. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Not only does bread make croutons with which to top any soup (fry them in olive oil with sliced garlic till crunchy), it makes soup, too. A cheat\u2019s version of Natalia Conroy\u2019s very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/02/six-of-the-best-one-pot-meals\" title=\"\">slow-braised borlotti bean, parsley and bread soup</a> is easily achieved with a can of beans (butter or cannellini will work just as well). Drain and fry with some combo of onions, garlic, celery, carrot and parsley, all finely chopped. Add canned tomatoes and a bunch of greens (kale, cavolo nero, spinach), both chopped, and cook until softened. Then blend half and add back into the pan, place wedges of stale white bread on top, and drench with lots of olive oil and hot water. Cook for 10 minutes, leave for another 10, then break up the bread and fold in to the rest. Serve garnished with more herbs and olive oil.</p> <h2>Milk</h2> <p>An umami-rich cream of mushroom soup is a great way to use some of the 3.1m glasses\u2019 worth of milk we would otherwise pour down the drain each morning. Slowly fry 500g of mushrooms in butter with some finely sliced shallots or onions, then add to a pan of white sauce. When nicely browned, blend then return to the pan and dilute with more milk and some vegetable or chicken stock. Season to taste and top with crispy shallots and chives, a dash of double cream and a grind of black pepper.</p> <h2>Lettuce</h2> <p>Salad leaves don\u2019t fare any better in our fridges, but make excellent broths. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/anna-jones-recipe-cooking-lettuce\" title=\"\">Take Anna Jones\u2019s lead:</a> to a base of gently fried onion, celery and garlic, add some garden peas (fresh or frozen), vegetable stock and two finely sliced heads of romaine (or the equivalent weight in other leaves; watercress and rocket bring excellent spice) and simmer until wilted. Remove from the heat and add torn fresh herbs, then blend and season, garnishing with sprouting seeds and that squeeze of lemon.</p> <h2>Potato</h2> <p>Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect leek and potato soup recipe is all the proof you need that our collective daily binning of 4m whole potatoes makes no sense whatsoever. But alliums aren\u2019t the tuber\u2019s only friend: slow cook a batch, cubed, with pancetta, onion, garlic and thyme in chicken stock and \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/potato-soup-recipe-261540\" title=\"\">it\u2019s the Kitchn\u2019s secret ingredient</a> \u2013 a can of Carnation milk (cream will work, too). Season with salt and black pepper, thicken with flour if needed and top with chopped spring onion and crumbled cheese crackers.</p> <h2>Tomatoes</h2> <p>Why are 1.2m whole tomatoes trashed each day in Britain, when most of our innately flavourless tomatoes could probably do with over-ripening? Instead of binning them, roast until well charred in a tray with chopped onion, garlic and red pepper (half a lemon is a nice addition), doused in olive oil and seasoned and spiked with dried herbs and chilli flakes. Blitz the lot until creamy, then dilute in a pan with stock and simmer until the flavours are nicely blended. J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt does an even-quicker, 15-minute job with the same ingredients, using tinned tomatoes instead of fresh, which is so good that <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/78495-j-kenji-lopez-alt-s-15-minute-creamy-vegan-tomato-soup\" title=\"\">Food52 made it one of their Genius recipes</a>. Top a bowl of either with crumbled feta and croutons.</p> <h2>Bananas</h2> <p>Similarly, why do we throw away almost the same quantity of bananas, when they too only get better with age? Tom Kitchin does a beautifully <a href=\"https://www.thestaffcanteen.com/chefs-recipes/Auntie-Charlotte%E2%80%99s-Thai-Cod---Banana-Soup-by-Tom-Kitchin\" title=\"\">savoury Thai number</a> where he fries finely chopped spring onion (onion will work, too) and garlic in oil then adds two large, sliced bananas, chilli, fish sauce, sugar and salt then 200ml each of coconut milk and vegetable stock. Blitzed and garnished with fresh coriander, sliced chilli and lime, it\u2019s ideal served with a piece of well-seasoned, roasted cod.</p> <h2>Apples</h2> <p>A sorely undervalued soup ingredient. To wit, the apple and celeriac potful <a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/apple-celeriac-soup/\" title=\"\">Anna Jones did for Jamie magazine</a> a while back. To a base of onion and celery, add chopped celeriac and apple with fresh thyme and, once softened, simmer in stock until tender. Blitz half, then return to the pan and stir in some creme fraiche. Serve garnished with crispy sage leaves and crushed hazelnuts.</p> <h2>Ham (and bacon, and pork, in general)</h2> <p>Wrap claims that we bin 2.2m slices of ham every day. Which is a shame, because aside from being an excellent garnish for any omnivore\u2019s otherwise meatless soups, ham is great in Asian broths. It might not be what is traditionally called for in making tonjiru\u2013 pork-flavoured miso soup \u2013 but it works just as well. Fry onion and the ham (or other finely sliced pork) with minced ginger in sesame oil, then add sliced carrot, daikon, sweet potato, normal potato and any other root veg you fancy, mix well, then add in mushrooms and other soft veg (green beans, sugar snap peas) and mix again. Pour in dashi fish stock and simmer until all is tender (skimming off scum as required). Once cooked, remove from the heat and stir in a dollop of miso paste. Tofu makes a good addition at this point. Top with chopped spring onion and sesame seeds to serve.</p> <h2>Carrots</h2> <p>Much like onions (see below), carrots are a staple soup ingredient, yet the UK throws away 2.7m a day. Rachel Roddy has an excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/fennel-bulbs-recipe-four-dishes-meals-rachel-roddy\" title=\"\">no-recipe soup method</a>: you gently fry, in olive oil and butter, a sofrito of carrot, onion and celery plus the vegetable you want your soup named after (fennel, say, parsnip or leek), then deglaze with some booze (she leans toward vermouth), throw in a hard, non-waxed cheese rind if you have one (we throw away so much cheese in this country; here\u2019s a good reason not to) and a herb of your choice (bay leaves, say, or oregano), cover with water or stock then cook and blend. Her final words are worth remembering: \u201cLike most soups, it is infinitely better the next day.\u201d</p> <h2>Onions</h2> <p>These are the first thing you fry in literally every recipe on this list, but still, we bin more onions than we do bananas. And as anyone who has been to a French wedding will tell you, they make the best midnight snack of a soup, all on their own. Gill Meller of River Cottage HQ <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtV3DG7FRSw/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1hmqfotmi6ssb\" title=\"\">recently posted to Instagram</a> a tantalising pic of what has to be the simplest onion soup recipe out there. \u201cFour medium onions,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpeeled, halved and thinly sliced. Sweat gently in butter and salt and pepper for 40-50 minutes, lid on. Add chicken stock and simmer for 30 minutes.\u201d Season to taste, and serve with toast and grated cheese.</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019.

You were so proud and I promised to return some time later to hear about the day in full.</p> <p>But I also cruelly cut you off mid-sentence because five other patients on my ward needed blood samples taking. My other 31 patients also needed critical and urgent tasks that I had to perform in order to keep them safe and help them heal. Right before you rapidly deteriorated and died, the last thing you experienced was a harried, overworked doctor interrupting your joyful reminiscence.</p> <p>And I am sorry to my other patients because this situation \u2013 where I am forced, for their safety, to be cold \u2013 is a daily occurrence. People will make a joke about the food, or the view from the window, and I won\u2019t have time to laugh and share the fun; the best I can manage is a fleeting smile as I rush past. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2018/apr/23/burnt-out-doctor-why-matters\">I am a burnt-out doctor. This is why it matters | Eileen Parkes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remember the wife of a patient who desperately wanted her husband\u2019s incurable disease to be reversed. I wanted to be present while she told me how the two of them had met when they were both 18, how they\u2019d had three children together, and how they\u2019d planned for an activity-packed retirement that, sadly, would now never happen. But the awful truth is I was only half-listening. I was thinking about my immediate problems: scans I needed to order, results of investigations I needed to act on. I am forced to choose between keeping patients and their loved ones safe and showing compassion. I am very sorry for this.</p> <p>I have to prioritise key tasks to treat people. Even just doing this for patients is near impossible for the depleted staff team on the ward. We keep people safe but we are so overstretched that any extras, such as conversation, are luxuries that, should I indulge, would leave them unsafe and their condition worsening. Even working over my contracted hours, without a break in the day \u2013 not even to relieve my bladder \u2013 I cannot get everything done.</p> <p>Has this job taken my humanity? I\u2019m not unkind; I am deeply sorry for the effects of this system failure. I can\u2019t allow myself to feel guilty. The regular overtime I put in, the family occasions I am forced to miss, the social engagements that I have to cancel last minute - all help keep that guilt at bay.</p> <p>I am proud of the work I do but my ability to connect with people as they lie there with only hours left is continually pervaded by an overstretched, underfunded NHS workforce.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sorry that you died before I got chance to hear your story. While I was fumbling around, trying to get blood from your dehydrated veins, you were trying to tell me about a special day you\u2019d experienced 30 years ago. You were so proud and I promised to return some time later to hear about the day in full. But I also cruelly cut you off mid-sentence because five other patients on my ward needed blood samples taking. My other 31 patients also needed critical and urgent tasks that I had to perform in order to keep them safe and help them heal. Right before you rapidly deteriorated and died, the last thing you experienced was a harried, overworked doctor interrupting your joyful reminiscence. And I am sorry to my other patients because this situation \u2013 where I am forced, for their safety, to be cold \u2013 is a daily occurrence. People will make a joke about the food, or the view from the window, and I won\u2019t have time to laugh and share the fun; the best I can manage is a fleeting smile as I rush past. I remember the wife of a patient who desperately wanted her husband\u2019s incurable disease to be reversed. I wanted to be present while she told me how the two of them had met when they were both 18, how they\u2019d had three children together, and how they\u2019d planned for an activity-packed retirement that, sadly, would now never happen. But the awful truth is I was only half-listening. I was thinking about my immediate problems: scans I needed to order, results of investigations I needed to act on. I am forced to choose between keeping patients and their loved ones safe and showing compassion. I am very sorry for this. I have to prioritise key tasks to treat people. Even just doing this for patients is near impossible for the depleted staff team on the ward. We keep people safe but we are so overstretched that any extras, such as conversation, are luxuries that, should I indulge, would leave them unsafe and their condition worsening. Even working over my contracted hours, without a break in the day \u2013 not even to relieve my bladder \u2013 I cannot get everything done. Has this job taken my humanity? I\u2019m not unkind; I am deeply sorry for the effects of this system failure. I can\u2019t allow myself to feel guilty. The regular overtime I put in, the family occasions I am forced to miss, the social engagements that I have to cancel last minute - all help keep that guilt at bay. I am proud of the work I do but my ability to connect with people as they lie there with only hours left is continually pervaded by an overstretched, underfunded NHS workforce. Desperately sick people and my humanity can\u2019t both survive. For someone who became a doctor to care, that is gut-wrenchingly difficult to accept.

Geoffrey Whaley, 80, from Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire, had arranged plans to end his life at the Dignitas facility on Thursday after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2016. In the final weeks of his life, he and his wife Ann, 76, were investigated by Thames Valley police following an anonymous phone call made to social services alerting them of the couple\u2019s intentions to travel to Dignitas. The Labour peer Lord Falconer, who met the Whaleys last week, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that police had interviewed Mr Whaley once and Mrs Whaley twice under caution. On Thursday Geoffrey Whaley released an open letter to MPs telling of the anguish he and has family faced after police were tipped off about his plans. In his letter, Geoffrey writes: \u201cI want to impress upon you the anguish me and my family have experienced, not because of this awful illness , but because of the law against assisted dying in this country.\u201d \u201cWhen I eventually got the \u2018green light\u2019 from Dignitas, a weight lifted.\u201d \u201cAs I was saying my final goodbyes and preparing myself for the end, the final, biggest bomb dropped and I could no longer keep it together. \u201cThe thought that I might not make it to Switzerland, or that, if I did, Ann might be facing 14 years in jail for helping me, was almost too much to bear.\u201d Mrs Whaley booked flights to Switzerland because her husband could no longer use his hands. In the UK, helping someone to kill themselves is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Last night, the couple and their two adopted children, Alix and Dominic, shared their final meal together at a hotel in Zurich. Falconer said: \u201cThe idea that this was anything other than his choice was absurd and I thought the law was a total pig. I think pressure will grow and the law will change and if parliament won\u2019t do it, the courts will do it.\u201d The honorary secretary of the Association for Palliative Medicine, Amy Proffitt, said that a law change could compromise doctors.

      "body": "<p>Eddie Jones has been around long enough to appreciate that destiny lies at the end of a road blighted with potholes and misleading signposts. After his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/ireland-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">greatest triumph</a> on Saturday he was gracious in victory, 11 months after he had been booed by some home supporters at Twickenham after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Ireland had secured the Grand Slam</a> there.</p> <p>\u201cThey are a top team,\u201d he said of Ireland, the world\u2019s form country in 2018 who had been systematically taken apart by England. And they are. Just as England found last year after two years of barely uninterrupted success under Jones, nothing feeds the appetite of an ambitious team like a setback.</p> <p>England showed in the opening minute in Dublin they had a hunger bordering on the ravenous. They were billed as the underdogs but they were like New Zealand in their attitude, taking on Ireland at their source of strength, the breakdown and the gain line, overwhelming the champions whose game plan burned in the heat of the onslaught.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/05/nick-isiekwe-replaces-injured-maro-itoje-in-england-squad-france-six-nations-rugby-union\">Eddie Jones's England options a cause for joy but they bring problems too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones had picked a team not just to contain Ireland but to take them on and make them chase the game, one of their few weaknesses in recent years. He was advised to pick Mike Brown at full-back to counter Conor Murray\u2019s box-kicking but his plan was to attack, not just defend. Elliot Daly was central to it, as he showed with the pass for England\u2019s first try and in scoring the second from his own kick ahead, proof of the power of positive thinking.</p> <p>While Jones was positive, picking a team to get England on the front foot, Joe Schmidt was more defensive. He moved Robbie Henshaw from centre to full-back, omitting Rob Kearney, who had excelled in the autumn, and picking Bundee Aki at 12.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones has been around long enough to appreciate that destiny lies at the end of a road blighted with potholes and misleading signposts. After his greatest triumph on Saturday he was gracious in victory, 11 months after he had been booed by some home supporters at Twickenham after Ireland had secured the Grand Slam there. \u201cThey are a top team,\u201d he said of Ireland, the world\u2019s form country in 2018 who had been systematically taken apart by England. And they are. Just as England found last year after two years of barely uninterrupted success under Jones, nothing feeds the appetite of an ambitious team like a setback. England showed in the opening minute in Dublin they had a hunger bordering on the ravenous. They were billed as the underdogs but they were like New Zealand in their attitude, taking on Ireland at their source of strength, the breakdown and the gain line, overwhelming the champions whose game plan burned in the heat of the onslaught. Jones had picked a team not just to contain Ireland but to take them on and make them chase the game, one of their few weaknesses in recent years. He was advised to pick Mike Brown at full-back to counter Conor Murray\u2019s box-kicking but his plan was to attack, not just defend. Elliot Daly was central to it, as he showed with the pass for England\u2019s first try and in scoring the second from his own kick ahead, proof of the power of positive thinking. While Jones was positive, picking a team to get England on the front foot, Joe Schmidt was more defensive. He moved Robbie Henshaw from centre to full-back, omitting Rob Kearney, who had excelled in the autumn, and picking Bundee Aki at 12. Jones had again harked on about Jonathan Sexton in the buildup and was Aki seen as a minder for the fly-half with England armed with the ball-carrying threat of Ben Te\u2019o or Manu Tuilagi in the midfield and Billy Vunipola at No 8? The selection reflected where the teams were coming from: Ireland had won 18 of their previous 19 Tests, while England had recovered from five straight defeats to win four out of five while still finding themselves, a narrow defeat to New Zealand followed by a disjointed performance against Japan that required the intervention of Owen Farrell. As a pointer to the World Cup, it showed England will be contenders and that Ireland under Schmidt have not been deflected by adversity. Their previous defeat in the Six Nations had been in 2017 when Wales played in the manner of England last Saturday, controlling the gain line and meeting them head on; Ireland\u2019s link at half-back ruptured and they lost by 13 points. A week later they denied England a grand slam in Dublin, the start of a 12-match winning run. Warren Gatland was also bold in his Wales selection in Paris where, despite snow giving way to rain, he played Gareth Anscombe at fly-half rather than Dan Biggar. The conditions suited the latter more with his kicking game and ability in the air, but at a time when referees are not looking for an excuse to whistle, he appreciates the need to bring the outside backs into play and not wait for opponents to kick the ball to them. It did not work last Friday with Wales trailing 16-0 at the interval after making a number of handling errors and some suspect calls in defence, prompting the call for Biggar just after the comeback had commenced.

      "bodyText": "A black former employee of Kid Rock\u2019s Made in Detroit restaurant is suing over alleged racial discrimination after she says she was fired the first time she wore her hair in an afro. A federal lawsuit filed in Detroit last week by Carinne Silverman-Maddox alleged she was \u201cabruptly suspended and dismissed for allegedly over-pouring a single drink\u201d in October. However, she claims her white co-workers also over-poured drinks in the \u201cexact same manner\u201d and broke other rules, but only she was fired. The suit also notes that on the day that she was sent home, Silverman-Maddox wore her hair in an afro \u201cinstead of straightening it or putting it up like her Caucasian coworkers\u201d, and she \u201cimmediately noticed strange looks from the management\u201d. The suit states that Made in Detroit management suspended Silverman-Maddox \u2013 who had a spotless employee file \u2013 on 13 October, but she remained off the schedule until she was officially fired in December when she took legal action. \u201c[Silverman-Maddox] was astonished by the discipline as she was pouring drinks in the manner she was specifically trained to do, and every bartender frequently free poured drinks,\u201d civil rights attorney Jack Schulz wrote in the complaint. Schulz told the Guardian it was clear Silverman-Maddox was treated differently than her white co-workers. \u201cAt a surface level \u2013 even if you accept that she over-poured a drink \u2013 the crime is how she was treated and how white people were treated for doing the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crime, to me, is unequal treatment.\u201d Kid Rock, based out of suburban Detroit, became a star in the late 90s with music that fuses rap, southern rock and country.

      "bodyText": "The government has rejected pleas by fracking companies to review strict rules around earthquakes caused by their operations, in a major blow that could spell the end for Britain\u2019s nascent shale industry. Cuadrilla complained on Wednesday that it had only been able to frack a tiny section of its well near Blackpool last autumn because of the limits, and warned it would not be able to undertake commercial fracking if the regulations are not reviewed. Earlier this week, petrochemicals company Ineos urged a relaxation of the \u201cunworkable\u201d regulations, which mean companies have to halt work if they trigger tremors above 0.5 magnitude. But on Thursday the government made it clear that it was not budging on the limits, part of a regulatory regime that the UK has said is more robust than in the US, where fracking took off and has transformed the energy landscape. A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe government believes shale gas could be an important new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits including the creation of well paid, quality jobs. \u201cThat\u2019s why the government has given the industry significant support to develop while ensuring that our world-leading regulations remain in place to ensure fracking happens safely and responsibly. \u201cWe set these regulations in consultation with industry and we have no plans to review them.\u201d Daniel Carey-Dawes of the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: \u201cThe government has today met its obligation to protect our environment and the public, by refusing to entertain the desperate calls by industry for a relaxation of regulations on seismic activity as a result of fracking.\u201d The government response came as its own polling laid bare the extent of public opposition to fracking. The number of people opposing fracking has risen again, to 35%, with those in favour down to 13%. Another 47% neither support nor oppose, while the rest said they do not know.

What began as a political hoax is now affecting real investment decisions in the economy, as Nissan\u2019s recent decision has shown. The hysteria needs to stop and the sobering reality of the scale of the stakes for the UK\u2019s future prosperity must be better understood. It is a damning indictment and a severe dereliction of duty that such a calamity as a no-deal Brexit is a possibility, no matter how unlikely. It\u2019s time to rule out no deal, once and for all. \u2022 Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, and founder and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice",

      "body": "<p>Outside the world\u2019s largest gun show the flag flies at half-mast, but it\u2019s unclear for which catastrophe. The most recent mass shooting, at the Borderline Bar and Grill in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/california-borderline-mass-shooting-thousand-oaks\">Thousand Oaks, California</a>, was on a Wednesday and Wanenmacher\u2019s Tulsa Arms Show is three days later, but the shock of mass shootings and the periods of mourning which follow ebb more quickly now than even a few years ago.</p> <p>The nightmare has woven itself into the everyday informational stream: the stock market rises and falls, one team beats another team, restaurants open and close, Apple announces a new phone, a man enters a public place with artillery and massacres a bunch of strangers. It\u2019s news but not shocking news. There is a mass shooting \u2013 more than four people not including the shooter \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence\">nine out of 10</a> days in America.</p> <p>Inside Wanenmacher\u2019s Tulsa Arms Show, the sheer scale amazes. The event fills the Expo Center on the Tulsa fairgrounds, all 11 acres of it, with more than 4,200 tables. It takes five and a half minutes, at a brisk pace, to cross from one end to the other, eight hours simply to wander through the stalls. You could argue that the annual Shot Show in Las Vegas is bigger, but that is strictly for industry professionals, law enforcement and dealers. Wanenmacher\u2019s is where the ordinary American gun culture is on its most expansive display.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"j\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/16/2_US_GUARDIAN_Pro_Gun_franziska.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The guns are as varied and as beautiful as human experience itself, in every shape, color, price point and for every purpose. There are rifles and pistols and semi-automatics, by brand, by type, by cost. There are worn old .22s you might give a kid to shoot squirrels. There are long-barreled old Colts out of westerns, and neat little Glocks that possess the slick smoothness of MacBook Airs. There are new concepts in barreling, targets, silencers, laser sights, armor, customized hearing protection, triggers that are not in violation of the ban on automatic weapons. And those are just the dealers\u2019 wares: individual sellers wander the stalls with little flags on sticks, detailing what they offer for sale or trade: a left-handed Sig Sauer or a Ruger EC9s, say.</p> <p>At the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, near Los Angeles, ex-marine Ian David Long used a .45 Glock 21 with an extended magazine when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/california-borderline-mass-shooting-thousand-oaks\">murdered</a> 12 people. In the history of mass shootings in the US, the Thousand Oaks massacre is not just one among the now hundreds a year. At least 30 people at the bar that night had survived, a year earlier, the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas, in which a man with no criminal record or mental health issues or apparent motive, armed with 10 AR-10s and four AR-15s modified with bump stocks among other weapons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2017/oct/02/vegas-shooting-route-91-music-festival-attack-in-pictures\">killed</a> 58 and left 851 injured.</p> <p>A mass shooting is no longer a once-in-a-lifetime event in the US.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The morning after Thousand Oaks, Lonnie Phillips woke his wife Sandy with the news. They were in Long Beach, working with grassroots organizations supporting survivors of gun violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t have far to go for the next one,\u201d he told her. By noon they had arrived at the scene.</p> <p>Since their daughter Jessica Ghawi, a young sports journalist, was murdered in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/20/colorado-theater-shooting-deadly-attack\">2012 Aurora, Colorado, shooting</a>, Sandy and Lonnie have lived out of a 26ft-long tagalong trailer, a Rockwood Ultralight that\u2019s somewhat worn. \u201cQuite honestly, we need a new one,\u201d Sandy admits. They\u2019ve put the machine to good use. Thousand Oaks is their 11th shooting, if you include their daughter\u2019s at Aurora, which Sandy calls \u201cour shooting\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe kind of got it down to a loop,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the west loop several times.\u201d They\u2019re working on an east loop. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do. We keep moving.\u201d How did Sandy and Lonnie decide to do this with their lives? \u201cThat was easy. That was so easy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"right\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/23/11_US_GUARDIAN_No_Gun_franziska.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In July 2012, Jessica was killed, and in December of that same year, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-classroom-massacre\">Sandy Hook</a>, where 20 children and six adults died. \u201cWe walked into the community center and some of the families were walking in,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cAnd I turned to my husband and said: \u2018Oh my God that\u2019s what we looked like five months ago.\u2019 And I wanted to run up to every one and put my arms around them and say, \u2018You feel like you\u2019re not going to live through this but you will. Honest, you will.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the past six years, Sandy has spoken with more than 1,000 victims of gun violence. Mass shootings have become so common in the United States that they now have regulars. \u201cWe do see the same Red Cross people, and sometimes the same Billy Graham people.\u201d Sandy says Greg Vanis, an Illinois man, sets up \u201ccrosses for losses\u201d at the memorials for the victims. They\u2019ve come to know him, too.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/18/santa-fe-texas-high-school-shooting-saddened\">Santa Fe, Texas, school shooting</a> in May, they ran into several reporters who had been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida-school-shooting\">Parkland, Florida</a>, prompting a reunion of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you but I\u2019m so sick of seeing you this way,\u201d Sandy told them.</p> <p>There are two gun cultures in America now, not just one. The first is a celebration of weapons and of the freedom weapons promise, a culture of resistance to government, of revolutionary individualism, a culture as old as the country itself, and the other, much newer, a perpetual caravan of mourning for senseless death. These cultures coexist but do not coincide. The political divisions in Washington, as vicious and irreconcilable as they may be, are not accidents of process. They are only signs of the far more profound divisions that lie beneath.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The beauty of the guns for sale at Wanenmacher\u2019s is undeniable. The Barrett .50 caliber with night vision and thermal scope is iconic, pure power in physical form. \u201cHe\u2019s light there. Pick him up,\u201d the dealer purrs. She\u2019s right. He is surprisingly light. The Winchesters from the 1880s are more distinctly American in their design than the Capitol building, and more refined, more elegant. The presentation boxes from the 19th century are simply fabulous works of craftsmanship and art, like Wes Anderson made a violent lunchbox set.</p> <p>Everywhere at Wanenmacher, there are the conversations one hears among collectors, gun people telling gun stories to other gun people. \u201cI told him if you come to the gym with me, I\u2019ll go to the gun show with you,\u201d says a long-suffering wife to the equally long-suffering friend she meets only at events like these. A wry smile passes between them. \u201cWe all know the gun guy who never fired a gun because getting to the range is a pain in the ass,\u201d says a customer to a dealer from whom he has just made an extravagant purchase, as a kind of justification, to demonstrate that he\u2019s not the kind of gun owner he\u2019s describing. A sign in a display case makes a cute in-joke: \u201cFor an additional $4.95 I will provide a receipt that matches what you told your wife you paid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"right\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/23/33_US_GUARDIAN_No_Gun_franziska.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Suddenly, it strikes me who the gun people remind me of. They remind me of readers, book people, my people. Half of these guys, it seems to me, are out here buying guns they\u2019re never going to use, buying them just to have them, just like book people buy books to be around books. They possess the same crazy passion, the same sense of community, the same belief in the sacrosanct nature of the product. And just like book people, the crowd at Wanenmacher\u2019s believes the product is good in itself.</p> <p>How would you feel if the government came for your books? How would you feel if the government wanted to restrict dangerous books?</p> <p>One of Sandy and Lonnie\u2019s main tasks when they talk to survivors is to prepare them for the self-righteous fury of gun rights advocates. \u201cThey need to know they\u2019re going to be used and abused,\u201d Sandy says. Survivors need media training at the most devastating moments of their lives. \u201cWe tell them about the people who say this never happened. Your daughter is an actress,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible and it happens every single time in a mass shooting. And they believe it. They truly believe. That\u2019s the insane part.\u201d</p> <p>The same day of every mass shooting in America, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jan/28/going-viral-the-victims-of-online-conspiracy-theories\">conspiracy theorists</a> actively promote the idea that it is a \u201cfalse flag\u201d. It\u2019s one of the reasons the Phillipses keep traveling, talking to victim after victim. After Jessica died, \u201cwe started to experience some pretty ugly things, and we wondered \u2018is this normal?\u2019 and then, yeah, it is normal\u201d, Sandy says. It is now normal to have your children murdered, and then be told they never existed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Only in America is the gun a totem, a sacred political object beyond the realm of argument. The gun laws of every other country provide a balance between public safety and the rights of people to own weapons. In some places, like Canada, gun ownership is relatively easy. Over a quarter of Canadian households <a href=\"https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/wd98_4-dt98_4/p2.html\">own some sort of firearm</a>. In other places, like Japan, while gun ownership is possible, it\u2019s barely so. There are only 210,928 citizens licenced to carry firearms in Japan out of a population of 127 million.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"right\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/16/22_US_GUARDIAN_No_Gun_franziska.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In all these other countries, some people think the rules are too strict, others think that the rules are too lenient, but the general idea that guns should be regulated is not disputed. Every other machine is regulated, so why not guns? Gun politics is esoteric everywhere else. Only in America is the fascination so total that it defines politics. The symbolism of the gun is vastly more powerful that any discussion of policy.</p> <p>There is politics at the gun show, without a doubt. If you sign up for a National Rifle Association (NRA) membership at one of their many booths at the entrance, you don\u2019t have to pay the $10 admission fee. A sign at one booth does read, like a kind of accidental poem:</p> <blockquote> <p>No sales to</p> <p>Obama</p> <p>or Clinton supporters.</p> <p>Get lost.</p> <p>You are too dumb and irresponsible</p> <p>to own a gun.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But, I bet if you showed him the cash, he would sell. The room is full of fantasies of defiance, political fantasies of historical memory. There are fantasies of the old west, embodied in those long-barrel colts, fantasies of the civil war by way of gorgeous cartridge cases or terrifying battlefield amputation equipment. There are fantasies of the Vietnam war, too, in a strong market for original unit patches.

By this point, the matter has been chewed to death with no satisfying conclusion. Not since the medieval scholastics debated how many angels can dance on the head of a pin have so many brilliant minds been engaged in answering such an irrelevant and impossible question: what did a collection of 18th-century geniuses mean by \u201ca well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\u201d?</p> <p>The debate over the meaning of those 26 words has raged over dinner tables and in bars and in the op-ed pages of newspapers and in courts for a hundred years. Legal scholars have teased out every feathery trace of original intention. The real problem though is that the meaning of the words couldn\u2019t be any clearer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"k\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src='https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/01/23/3_US_GUARDIAN_Pro_Gun_franziska.jpg'style='width: 100%'/&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d If you read those words outside the political context of the moment, without knowing the history of the debate, their sense is plain. But no one, not even extreme pro-gun advocates, are willing to take them at face value. There are slightly less than 300 federal gun laws in the US today, and thousands of regulations. They all infringe the rights of the people to keep and bear arms in some way. If you take the sentence from the constitution for what it means, why can\u2019t any American own an Apache helicopter? Or a nuclear bomb?</p> <p>A constitution exists to bind a country together. At this point in history, 240 years after its composition, much of the US constitution is sheer nonsense. Democrats and Republicans alike worship the document as a sacred text, indulging a delirious sentimentality which was the precise opposite of what the framers envisioned as the necessary basis for responsible government. During the 2016 election, gold star father Khizr Khan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/elections/khizr-humayun-khan-speech.html\">waved a pocket constitution</a> at a Clinton rally like a talisman to deflect Trump\u2019s insults; the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/annotated-constitution\">reprinted the whole thing</a>, with commentary, like Talmud. The reverence is insane. The document says right on the first page that every African American is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise\">three-fifth of a person</a>.</p> <p>Guns just point out an obvious reality. The entire practice of constitutional law in the US is an absurdity. It gives absolute significance to meanings that have long since vanished into history. Jefferson himself believed it was the \u201csolemn opportunity\u201d of every generation to update the constitution \u201cevery 19 or 20 years\u201d. Before Trump, and anything he may or may not have done, there was already a constitutional crisis. There is no way to govern effectively when your foundational document is nonsensical and you worship it anyway. Look at what happens when you base your gun policy on the writings of a bunch of guys who had never seen an integrated cartridge, never mind an automatic weapon. You get mass murder nine days out of 10.</p> <p>The number of guns in the US is somewhere north of 393m. Americans buy 12bn rounds a year, and a solid estimate of how much ammunition is in private hands is more or less impossible. The number of live rounds is literally inestimable. There is little point comparing gun violence in the US to gun violence in other countries. There are 57 times as many school shootings in the US as there are in the rest of the industrialized world combined. The reason for the difference is simple. When other countries faced mass shootings, their systems of government had the ability to take measures in response. The US doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>The rash of mass murders points to a broader crisis: American politics is reaching a post-policy phase. It is a battleground over identities rather than over strategies for public management. These identities are in conflict, and growing more conflicted, while there is no functioning mechanism for reconciliation. America is splitting at the heart.</p> <p>On Sunday, the gun show winds down, and the Phillipses are preparing to leave Thousand Oaks. \u201cI usually fall apart when we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Sandy admits. \u201cI know that this is just the start of their pain and it goes on forever. The void is always there.\u201d The booths empty one by one, with just enough enthusiasm remaining for a couple of last-minute deals, a few tired goodbyes.</p> <p>The partings are only temporary, at Wanenmacher\u2019s anyway. The next show is only six months away. The flag outside will almost certainly be hanging at half-mast.</p> <p><em>Photography from Reuters, REX/Shutterstock, AP, Getty Images</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2019/01/us-guns-enhancer/v3/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2019/01/us-guns-enhancer/v3/boot.js\" data-alt=\"ENHANCER DON'T DELETE\"> </figure>",

The most recent mass shooting, at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, was on a Wednesday and Wanenmacher\u2019s Tulsa Arms Show is three days later, but the shock of mass shootings and the periods of mourning which follow ebb more quickly now than even a few years ago. The nightmare has woven itself into the everyday informational stream: the stock market rises and falls, one team beats another team, restaurants open and close, Apple announces a new phone, a man enters a public place with artillery and massacres a bunch of strangers. It\u2019s news but not shocking news. There is a mass shooting \u2013 more than four people not including the shooter \u2013 nine out of 10 days in America. Inside Wanenmacher\u2019s Tulsa Arms Show, the sheer scale amazes. The event fills the Expo Center on the Tulsa fairgrounds, all 11 acres of it, with more than 4,200 tables. It takes five and a half minutes, at a brisk pace, to cross from one end to the other, eight hours simply to wander through the stalls. You could argue that the annual Shot Show in Las Vegas is bigger, but that is strictly for industry professionals, law enforcement and dealers. Wanenmacher\u2019s is where the ordinary American gun culture is on its most expansive display. The guns are as varied and as beautiful as human experience itself, in every shape, color, price point and for every purpose. There are rifles and pistols and semi-automatics, by brand, by type, by cost. There are worn old .22s you might give a kid to shoot squirrels. There are long-barreled old Colts out of westerns, and neat little Glocks that possess the slick smoothness of MacBook Airs. There are new concepts in barreling, targets, silencers, laser sights, armor, customized hearing protection, triggers that are not in violation of the ban on automatic weapons. And those are just the dealers\u2019 wares: individual sellers wander the stalls with little flags on sticks, detailing what they offer for sale or trade: a left-handed Sig Sauer or a Ruger EC9s, say. At the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, near Los Angeles, ex-marine Ian David Long used a .45 Glock 21 with an extended magazine when he murdered 12 people. In the history of mass shootings in the US, the Thousand Oaks massacre is not just one among the now hundreds a year. At least 30 people at the bar that night had survived, a year earlier, the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas, in which a man with no criminal record or mental health issues or apparent motive, armed with 10 AR-10s and four AR-15s modified with bump stocks among other weapons, killed 58 and left 851 injured. A mass shooting is no longer a once-in-a-lifetime event in the US. * * * The morning after Thousand Oaks, Lonnie Phillips woke his wife Sandy with the news. They were in Long Beach, working with grassroots organizations supporting survivors of gun violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t have far to go for the next one,\u201d he told her. By noon they had arrived at the scene. Since their daughter Jessica Ghawi, a young sports journalist, was murdered in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, shooting, Sandy and Lonnie have lived out of a 26ft-long tagalong trailer, a Rockwood Ultralight that\u2019s somewhat worn. \u201cQuite honestly, we need a new one,\u201d Sandy admits. They\u2019ve put the machine to good use. Thousand Oaks is their 11th shooting, if you include their daughter\u2019s at Aurora, which Sandy calls \u201cour shooting\u201d. \u201cWe kind of got it down to a loop,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the west loop several times.\u201d They\u2019re working on an east loop. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do. We keep moving.\u201d How did Sandy and Lonnie decide to do this with their lives? \u201cThat was easy. That was so easy.\u201d In July 2012, Jessica was killed, and in December of that same year, there was Sandy Hook, where 20 children and six adults died. \u201cWe walked into the community center and some of the families were walking in,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cAnd I turned to my husband and said: \u2018Oh my God that\u2019s what we looked like five months ago.\u2019 And I wanted to run up to every one and put my arms around them and say, \u2018You feel like you\u2019re not going to live through this but you will. Honest, you will.\u2019\u201d In the past six years, Sandy has spoken with more than 1,000 victims of gun violence. Mass shootings have become so common in the United States that they now have regulars. \u201cWe do see the same Red Cross people, and sometimes the same Billy Graham people.\u201d Sandy says Greg Vanis, an Illinois man, sets up \u201ccrosses for losses\u201d at the memorials for the victims. They\u2019ve come to know him, too. At the Santa Fe, Texas, school shooting in May, they ran into several reporters who had been at Parkland, Florida, prompting a reunion of sorts. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you but I\u2019m so sick of seeing you this way,\u201d Sandy told them. There are two gun cultures in America now, not just one. The first is a celebration of weapons and of the freedom weapons promise, a culture of resistance to government, of revolutionary individualism, a culture as old as the country itself, and the other, much newer, a perpetual caravan of mourning for senseless death. These cultures coexist but do not coincide. The political divisions in Washington, as vicious and irreconcilable as they may be, are not accidents of process. They are only signs of the far more profound divisions that lie beneath. * * * The beauty of the guns for sale at Wanenmacher\u2019s is undeniable. The Barrett .50 caliber with night vision and thermal scope is iconic, pure power in physical form. \u201cHe\u2019s light there. Pick him up,\u201d the dealer purrs. She\u2019s right. He is surprisingly light. The Winchesters from the 1880s are more distinctly American in their design than the Capitol building, and more refined, more elegant. The presentation boxes from the 19th century are simply fabulous works of craftsmanship and art, like Wes Anderson made a violent lunchbox set. Everywhere at Wanenmacher, there are the conversations one hears among collectors, gun people telling gun stories to other gun people. \u201cI told him if you come to the gym with me, I\u2019ll go to the gun show with you,\u201d says a long-suffering wife to the equally long-suffering friend she meets only at events like these. A wry smile passes between them. \u201cWe all know the gun guy who never fired a gun because getting to the range is a pain in the ass,\u201d says a customer to a dealer from whom he has just made an extravagant purchase, as a kind of justification, to demonstrate that he\u2019s not the kind of gun owner he\u2019s describing. A sign in a display case makes a cute in-joke: \u201cFor an additional $4.95 I will provide a receipt that matches what you told your wife you paid.\u201d Suddenly, it strikes me who the gun people remind me of. They remind me of readers, book people, my people. Half of these guys, it seems to me, are out here buying guns they\u2019re never going to use, buying them just to have them, just like book people buy books to be around books. They possess the same crazy passion, the same sense of community, the same belief in the sacrosanct nature of the product. And just like book people, the crowd at Wanenmacher\u2019s believes the product is good in itself. How would you feel if the government came for your books? How would you feel if the government wanted to restrict dangerous books? One of Sandy and Lonnie\u2019s main tasks when they talk to survivors is to prepare them for the self-righteous fury of gun rights advocates. \u201cThey need to know they\u2019re going to be used and abused,\u201d Sandy says. Survivors need media training at the most devastating moments of their lives. \u201cWe tell them about the people who say this never happened. Your daughter is an actress,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible and it happens every single time in a mass shooting. And they believe it. They truly believe. That\u2019s the insane part.\u201d The same day of every mass shooting in America, conspiracy theorists actively promote the idea that it is a \u201cfalse flag\u201d. It\u2019s one of the reasons the Phillipses keep traveling, talking to victim after victim. After Jessica died, \u201cwe started to experience some pretty ugly things, and we wondered \u2018is this normal?\u2019 and then, yeah, it is normal\u201d, Sandy says. It is now normal to have your children murdered, and then be told they never existed. * * * Only in America is the gun a totem, a sacred political object beyond the realm of argument. The gun laws of every other country provide a balance between public safety and the rights of people to own weapons. In some places, like Canada, gun ownership is relatively easy. Over a quarter of Canadian households own some sort of firearm. In other places, like Japan, while gun ownership is possible, it\u2019s barely so. There are only 210,928 citizens licenced to carry firearms in Japan out of a population of 127 million. In all these other countries, some people think the rules are too strict, others think that the rules are too lenient, but the general idea that guns should be regulated is not disputed. Every other machine is regulated, so why not guns? Gun politics is esoteric everywhere else. Only in America is the fascination so total that it defines politics. The symbolism of the gun is vastly more powerful that any discussion of policy. There is politics at the gun show, without a doubt. If you sign up for a National Rifle Association (NRA) membership at one of their many booths at the entrance, you don\u2019t have to pay the $10 admission fee. A sign at one booth does read, like a kind of accidental poem: No sales to Obama or Clinton supporters. Get lost. You are too dumb and irresponsible to own a gun. But, I bet if you showed him the cash, he would sell. The room is full of fantasies of defiance, political fantasies of historical memory. There are fantasies of the old west, embodied in those long-barrel colts, fantasies of the civil war by way of gorgeous cartridge cases or terrifying battlefield amputation equipment. There are fantasies of the Vietnam war, too, in a strong market for original unit patches. There\u2019s an awful lot of Nazi paraphernalia, too, far more than the usual pins and cigarette cases you might find in musty army surplus places. Also on display was a slave shackle and a bill of sale for a 13-year-old girl named Delilah, aged 13. She cost $75. \u201cYou need any Negroes?\u201d the dealer, a warm gentleman with facial hair modelled on old paintings of Robert E Lee, asks. \u201cI\u2019m afraid those ones are all dead so you\u2019re going to lose on that deal.\u201d A regular customer drifts by and commands his attention. \u201cYou staying out of trouble?\u201d \u201cWell, I got married.\u201d \u201cLets just leave that there. It\u2019s coming.\u201d Mostly politics at the gun show is assumed, the way dealers or hunters or the NRA activists refer to everyone, without thinking about it, as \u201cresponsible gun owners like us\u201d. A grandfather and a granddaughter laugh together as they polish medals. A new father comforts his crying baby in his arms while an AR-10 rides in the stroller. To them, guns represent something larger than mere machinery. They\u2019re an entire aesthetic combining the love of the wilderness, the camaraderie of military service, the fear of crime, the distrust of government, the sheen of naked power with the history of the original settlers, the ideal of self-reliance and the authenticity of rural life into a vision of what it means to be a free person, an individual. The love of guns has so much influence because it is so primordial, so far below the surface of rational decision-making. * * * Sandy Phillips does not despair, traveling from massacre to massacre. Washington makes her despair. \u201cWhen we go to lobby, or when we talk to elected officials, then I get discouraged,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s take someone like Ted Cruz from Texas, who will lie to you to your face, who will tell you things that you know are not true.\u201d Sandy and Lonnie had a private meeting with him once. \u201cI think he just expected to pat us on the head and send us on our way,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe found out we had done our research, and he didn\u2019t like that very much. That\u2019s the kind of guy he is.\u201d The Phillipses tried other methods. They tried to sue the gun dealer who sold their daughter\u2019s killer 4,000 rounds of ammunition, but the case was dismissed due to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The couple had to pay $264,000 to the other side\u2019s lawyers and filed for bankruptcy in January 2017. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like to oppose guns in the US. If Sandy were in charge, what would the gun laws look like? She would put semi-automatics, such as the AR-15 or the various semi-auto pistols, under the same classification as machine guns, which you can still own but only for a price and under certain conditions. She wants to ban any accessories that allow semi-automatic to function as automatics, such as bump stocks. Then \u201cthe easy stuff\u201d, expanded background checks, which 90% of Americans, and 69% of NRA members, support, yet which remain politically impossible. So, to sum up, if Sandy Phillips, implacable advocate of gun control, had her way with American policy, the US would still have the most permissive gun laws on earth by a large margin. All reasonable compromise is, needless to say, impossible. It\u2019s America in the 21st century. The drive to intellectual purity is total and dominates. If guns are good in themselves, then more guns are the answer to public safety not less. (Besides, swimming pools and cellphones result in tragedies but nobody wants to ban them.) If guns are good in themselves, we should want them in our churches and our legislatures. If guns are good, when the government decides to ban them, you should buy more. (Nothing leads to sales spikes for weapons more than even a hint of an assault rifle ban.) You need guns for self-defence because the police will fail you, that\u2019s why everyone needs a gun.

The legal system can be hostile, even if you did nothing wrong.\u201d Americans are purchasing access to emergency legal advice in case they happen to shoot somebody. They are paying $10.95 to imagine a story playing out in their lives, a continuously looped fantasy that they might need to kill someone in self-defence and the government not only wouldn\u2019t keep them safe but also wouldn\u2019t understand. No politics can hope to compete with an inner monologue like that, a movie playing on repeat in the collective mind. By now, Sandy and Lonnie have more of less broken down how to deal with a mass shooting. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this long enough to know how it works,\u201d Sandy says.

Then they head to the \u201creunification center\u201d, a term with evil irony since it is the place where people go to find out there will be never be any reunification with the people they love. They tell the authorities that they\u2019re there to support whoever needs their support. \u201cWe keep the politics out of it,\u201d Sandy says. * * * Somewhere between Wanenmacher\u2019s gun show and the rituals of mourning for mass shootings sits the question of the second amendment. By this point, the matter has been chewed to death with no satisfying conclusion. Not since the medieval scholastics debated how many angels can dance on the head of a pin have so many brilliant minds been engaged in answering such an irrelevant and impossible question: what did a collection of 18th-century geniuses mean by \u201ca well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\u201d? The debate over the meaning of those 26 words has raged over dinner tables and in bars and in the op-ed pages of newspapers and in courts for a hundred years. Legal scholars have teased out every feathery trace of original intention. The real problem though is that the meaning of the words couldn\u2019t be any clearer. \u201cThe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d If you read those words outside the political context of the moment, without knowing the history of the debate, their sense is plain. But no one, not even extreme pro-gun advocates, are willing to take them at face value. There are slightly less than 300 federal gun laws in the US today, and thousands of regulations. They all infringe the rights of the people to keep and bear arms in some way. If you take the sentence from the constitution for what it means, why can\u2019t any American own an Apache helicopter? Or a nuclear bomb? A constitution exists to bind a country together. At this point in history, 240 years after its composition, much of the US constitution is sheer nonsense. Democrats and Republicans alike worship the document as a sacred text, indulging a delirious sentimentality which was the precise opposite of what the framers envisioned as the necessary basis for responsible government. During the 2016 election, gold star father Khizr Khan waved a pocket constitution at a Clinton rally like a talisman to deflect Trump\u2019s insults; the New York Times reprinted the whole thing, with commentary, like Talmud. The reverence is insane. The document says right on the first page that every African American is three-fifth of a person. Guns just point out an obvious reality. The entire practice of constitutional law in the US is an absurdity. It gives absolute significance to meanings that have long since vanished into history. Jefferson himself believed it was the \u201csolemn opportunity\u201d of every generation to update the constitution \u201cevery 19 or 20 years\u201d. Before Trump, and anything he may or may not have done, there was already a constitutional crisis. There is no way to govern effectively when your foundational document is nonsensical and you worship it anyway. Look at what happens when you base your gun policy on the writings of a bunch of guys who had never seen an integrated cartridge, never mind an automatic weapon. You get mass murder nine days out of 10. The number of guns in the US is somewhere north of 393m. Americans buy 12bn rounds a year, and a solid estimate of how much ammunition is in private hands is more or less impossible. The number of live rounds is literally inestimable. There is little point comparing gun violence in the US to gun violence in other countries. There are 57 times as many school shootings in the US as there are in the rest of the industrialized world combined. The reason for the difference is simple. When other countries faced mass shootings, their systems of government had the ability to take measures in response. The US doesn\u2019t. The rash of mass murders points to a broader crisis: American politics is reaching a post-policy phase. It is a battleground over identities rather than over strategies for public management. These identities are in conflict, and growing more conflicted, while there is no functioning mechanism for reconciliation. America is splitting at the heart. On Sunday, the gun show winds down, and the Phillipses are preparing to leave Thousand Oaks. \u201cI usually fall apart when we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Sandy admits. \u201cI know that this is just the start of their pain and it goes on forever. The void is always there.\u201d The booths empty one by one, with just enough enthusiasm remaining for a couple of last-minute deals, a few tired goodbyes. The partings are only temporary, at Wanenmacher\u2019s anyway. The next show is only six months away. The flag outside will almost certainly be hanging at half-mast.

      "bodyText": "Bollywood, India\u2019s gargantuan film industry, is known for its big-budget, colour-saturated musical numbers that are scattered through every movie. Dotted within each tale of star-crossed lovers, historical rivalries or family dramas is a surreal sequence where dozens of dancing extras enter the frame, characters burst spontaneously into song and locations shuttle from the Egyptian pyramids to the Swiss Alps, London streets or even space. Yet, in recent years, this escapist function of Bollywood has been failing to capture its audience. The most expensive Bollywood film in 2018, the 19th-century action-drama Thugs of Hindostan, was made on a budget of 300 crore rupees (\u00a332m) but took in only half that at the box office, with owners of some Indian cinemas demanding refunds. Film-makers are increasingly turning away from spectacle and towards realist narratives, creating a burgeoning independent Indian cinema, with films such as Chaitanya Tamhane\u2019s 2014 film Court focusing on India\u2019s judicial system, Neeraj Ghaywan\u2019s Masaan (2015), tackling the caste divide, and 2018\u2019s Love Sonia telling the story of sex trafficking in India. \u201cThere\u2019s already an appetite for more gritty, realist film-making in India,\u201d says director Zoya Akhtar, \u201cbut there\u2019s never enough critique of Indian society happening here.\u201d Akhtar\u2019s latest film, Gully Boy, aims to further the realist narrative of Indian cinema by disrupting its fascination with musical numbers and subverting the system from within \u2013 the production stars two of Bollywood\u2019s biggest actors: Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt. Gully Boy is a fictionalised account of the burgeoning hip-hop scene in Mumbai. Gully, or \u201cgutter\u201d, rap is a musical sub-genre made by the younger people who live in the sprawling slums of the city; its aesthetic is DIY and its lyrics tackle everything from police brutality to the caste system and even the brutal gang rape of a Delhi woman in 2012. A stark contrast from both the commercialised rap of the US and the party-starting optimism of most Bollywood chart hits, Akhtar\u2019s film comprises rap songs and battles composed entirely of gully rap. It is Bollywood\u2019s first hip-hop film. Akhtar, one of Bollywood\u2019s few female directors, first came across the gully community while editing her last film, Dil Dhadakne Do in 2015. \u201cMy editor was watching a video on his phone by this kid called Naezy; it was his track Aafat,\u201d she says, \u201cand I loved how raw and how authentic it felt.\u201d The video shows Naved Shaikh, AKA Naezy in Khatarnak, Mumbai, an area notorious for gang violence, as he raps about brushes with the police and his frustrations at an unequal society. Akhtar became a fan. \u201cI then spent a year talking to Naezy and his collaborator Divine,\u201d Akhtar says. \u201cI went through the streets with them, meeting their families and girlfriends, and I realised I had to do something with this story.\u201d The result is Akhtar\u2019s fourth feature film, and in the three years it has taken her to make the movie, the gully rap scene has exploded across India. \u201cThe music\u2019s on the cusp of really becoming big,\u201d she says. \u201cIndian film music is the biggest genre but this could be a real challenge to its dominance.\u201d Rapper Vivian Fernandes, AKA Divine, has also seen a shift in the perceptions of gully rap since he and Shaikh started making music. \u201cPeople who live here had never heard their lives represented in a song and they are connecting with gully,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the people, for the people and it\u2019s going to be the biggest genre of our country. I\u2019m already seeing kids in villages rapping in dialects of Gujarati, Marathi and Tamil. It\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d see \u2013 when I started, there was no one even rapping in Hindi.\u201d Growing up in Khatarnak, Fernandes was introduced to hip-hop through a pirated CD made by a friend, and was hooked. \u201cI realised that Bombay didn\u2019t have a sound when it came to independent music \u2013 it was all Bollywood \u2013 so I started using our local slang and rapping over free beats to make our Bombay music.\u201d Fernandes lived around the corner from Shaikh and they developed the gully sound together, culminating in their crossover hit Mere Gully Mein (In My Hood) in 2015. The track has since amassed almost 15 million views on YouTube. Both Fernandes and Shaikh have acted as musical supervisors on the film, contributing to a soundtrack that also features British-Indian producer Rishi Rich and new gully rappers from around India. \u201cThe process of making this film was very different from anything else I\u2019ve done,\u201d Akhtar says of filming in the Mumbai slums. \u201cIt was an incredible experience.

With one of the fastest-growing middle-class populations in the world, this is a controversial message in a culture that still prioritises vocational stability over creativity. Yet, for Akhtar, star power will overshadow any controversy. \u201cWe\u2019re using extremely popular actors to tell a narrative that wouldn\u2019t normally be for a mainstream audience, and that\u2019s what will sell it.\u201d With the film already scheduled for a European premiere at the Berlin international film festival, Gully Boy may well shift perceptions of Bollywood globally.

The BBC has warned of potential channel closures and enormous cuts to services if it is forced to take on the full \u00a3745m cost of paying the licence fee for over-75s when the government stops funding it.

The deal could also help pave the way for a breakthrough in talks to launch a streaming service joint venture with ITV, a \u201cbest of British\u201d rival to Netflix and Amazon. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of ITV, is to give detail on its plans for a service when the broadcaster\u2019s annual results are revealed on 27 February and is understood to be keen to be able to announce a breakthrough in the protracted talks with the BBC. The talks have been hindered in part by the uncertainty around the complicated video-on-demand rights deals the BBC has in place with UKTV and others, including Netflix. Last year Virgin Media took UKTV\u2019s channels off air, accusing the BBC of being a \u201clinear dinosaur in an on-demand world\u201d for holding back and splitting digital rights.

      "bodyText": "The under-fire Liberal minister Scott Buchholz gave a female air force officer what he described to colleagues as \u201ca hug\u201d \u2013 a move which led to an official complaint against him. Buchholz has issued an apology to the officer following the incident in Darwin last August during a taxpayer-funded exchange with the Australian defence force to observe the military exercise Pitch Black in 2018. The Defence department has declined to reveal details of the complaint, which was first reported by the ABC. But the Guardian understands Buchholz has told colleagues the nature of the incident was a \u201chug\u201d. \u201cHe may have misread the situation and the friendly nature of the group,\u201d a defence source said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller woman and a big burly bloke throws his arms around you that can be confronting.\u201d Another source said Buchholz is a \u201cknown hugger\u201d but acknowledged that could throw some people off guard if they didn\u2019t know him well. Defence said the complaint was referred to the office of the minister for defence personnel. \u201cDefence subsequently received an apology from the parliamentarian and is satisfied with the response,\u201d a spokesman said. In a statement, Buchholz, who was promoted from the backbench to the ministry by Scott Morrison just weeks after the incident, admitted to poor behaviour. \u201cI behaved like an idiot on a parliamentary exchange last year and I recognise how inappropriate my actions were. I apologised for my conduct and the offence I caused, and I reiterate my deep respect for the ADF and its members,\u201d he said. The Guardian sought further comment from Buchholz\u2019s office about the hug allegation. His spokesman said Buchholz had nothing further to add and was focused on constituency business on Thursday. Buchholz was part of a federal parliamentarian group who attended the biennial training exercise in northern Australia involving the Royal Australian Air Force and up to 4,000 personnel from Australia\u2019s military allies. The MPs have copped criticism for skipping some events to go to the Darwin Cup races. Labor MP Luke Gosling arranged a leave pass with Defence officials for himself to attend the event because it was in his local federal electorate. It\u2019s understood other MPs in the group tagged along.

      "body": "<p>In the afterword to his four-story collection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jan/15/stephenking-fiction\" title=\"\">Different Seasons</a></em>, Stephen King describes the heart-sinking moment when you realise that what you\u2019ve written is a novella. He compares the form to \u201can anarchy-ridden literary banana republic\u201d where no one in their right mind would want to end up. Fiction between 20,000 and 40,000 words long does seem to be the least appetising prospect of all for publishers. That\u2019s a pity, of course. Give me great bantamweight work any day \u2013 think of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, <em>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em> \u2013 with its extraordinary power-to-size ratio, rather than the grandiose bloat of an interminable saga.</p> <p>James Lasdun\u2019s new book is actually two novellas, <em>Feathered Glory</em> and <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em>, and the headline act is clearly the second tale. Both explore uncomfortable corners of the male psyche with eerie clarity, but <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em> goes darker and further, with a timely and irresistibly unpleasant story that is sure to provoke passionate discussion.</p> <p>The plot centres on Marco Rosedale, a middle-aged, British-born New Yorker, with a media career of some distinction, who learns that he has been accused of sexual assault by an ex-girlfriend, Julia Gault, a former television journalist. The story unfolds during the 2016 US presidential campaign, just as the growing rumble of sexual assault allegations against a number of powerful men is beginning to coalesce into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a> movement. It is narrated by Marco\u2019s friend, another Englishman living in New York, a writer who is never named but bears a strong resemblance to Lasdun himself \u2013 at least, to the Lasdun the reader encounters in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/16/give-me-everything-stalked-lasdun-review\" title=\"\">Give Me Everything You Have</a></em> (2013), his searing non-fiction account of being stalked by an ex-student he calls Nasreen.</p> <p>That too is a book about men and women behaving badly, the reliability of memory, shame, trauma and sexual politics. In it, Lasdun reflects on Nasreen\u2019s rage and the agonised question of his responsibility for it. But whereas Nasreen\u2019s assault on Lasdun\u2019s peace of mind seems wholly unjustified, <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em> takes us into much more unsettling territory. The major subject here is the enormity of rape and the enormity of being wrongly accused of rape.</p> <p>The narrator, by instinct and affiliation, is on the side of his friend. He has been somewhat dazzled by Marco ever since they attended the same London school. They share a background and even the same wayward teeth \u2013 \u201clittle crooked monuments to 1970s English dentistry\u201d. Both men are struggling to keep pace with changing social mores. At the very moment the narrator is congratulating himself for remembering the name of one of the minor characters, she is transitioned from Erin to Eric and is thenceforth referred to by the male pronoun.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an age of binary solutions, there is something wonderful about Lasdun\u2019s scrupulous recording of doubts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the narrator has links to Julia as well, who he knew in his boyhood and found intriguing enough to shape a novel around. Enmeshed in the unfolding story as Marco\u2019s confidant, he is torn between his allegiance to his friend and his desire for the truth. Marco claims the alleged rape \u2013 said to have taken place thirty years earlier during a journalistic assignment to Ulster \u2013 was a consensual encounter and dismisses the accuser\u2019s motives as mercenary. But when Julia refuses to back down, Marco mobilises his status and contacts to silence her. This stirs a sense of injustice in the narrator, who is constantly oscillating between the terrible fear that his friend might be guilty and the worry that he is being insufficiently supportive. \u201cHad I internalized the campus outlook, I wondered, with its endless tedious refinements of anxiety over power and privilege?\u201d This anxious back and forth is the rhythm of the book: each time we feel that we can definitively decide where to put our sympathies, the story jostles and unbalances us with new insights.</p> <p>In an age of loud invective and binary solutions, there is something wonderful about Lasdun\u2019s scrupulous recording of doubts and uncertainty. I like his unapologetic literariness and the unexpected way his books draw strength from artefacts of high culture. In <em>Give Me Everything You Have</em>, the Middle English poem \u201cGawain and the Green Knight\u201d became a tool for thinking about the obligations of male decency. In a similar way, the Mallarm\u00e9 poem from which Lasdun borrows the title of the novella is used to evokes contradictory facets of male sexuality.</p> <p>He tells us, almost at the outset, that he feels some final truth should be achievable. Reality \u201cwas something that existed outside the human mind, and independently of it ... not a prize awarded to whoever fought hardest and dirtiest\u201d. It\u2019s some achievement that by the end of the story, you feel he has stayed true to this, but also true to the novelistic task of representing the characters in all their complexity.</p> <p>The first tale is lighter and slighter. <em>Feathered Glory</em> is about Richard, the head teacher of a private elementary school in upstate New York, whose notion of himself as happily married is disturbed by the contagious recklessness of an old friend. Memories of a former lover are stirred up and Richard begins entertaining the possibility of an infidelity \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s putting it a bit strongly. Richard\u2019s so tentative about acknowledging the pull of his libido that his projected deception of his wife includes a sizable dose of self-deception. \u201cIt was necessary, for the sake of his conscience, to stave off any suspicion of premeditation.\u201d Like <em>Afternoon of a Faun</em>, <em>Feathered Glory</em> feels fresh, is free of contrivance and takes unexpected turns. In its deep, patient inspection of the protagonist\u2019s state of mind it resembles a psychoanalytic case history.</p> <p>There are clear commonalities between the two stories \u2013 a quartet of central characters destabilised by a figure from the past, an avian motif, a strait-laced man enthralled by the behaviour of a more impulsive friend. \u201cI was just trying to make a complicated story simple!\u201d complains Richard, in <em>Feathered Glory</em>, when he is caught in the act of a lie.

      "bodyText": "In the afterword to his four-story collection Different Seasons, Stephen King describes the heart-sinking moment when you realise that what you\u2019ve written is a novella. He compares the form to \u201can anarchy-ridden literary banana republic\u201d where no one in their right mind would want to end up. Fiction between 20,000 and 40,000 words long does seem to be the least appetising prospect of all for publishers. That\u2019s a pity, of course. Give me great bantamweight work any day \u2013 think of Heart of Darkness, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Animal Farm \u2013 with its extraordinary power-to-size ratio, rather than the grandiose bloat of an interminable saga. James Lasdun\u2019s new book is actually two novellas, Feathered Glory and Afternoon of a Faun, and the headline act is clearly the second tale. Both explore uncomfortable corners of the male psyche with eerie clarity, but Afternoon of a Faun goes darker and further, with a timely and irresistibly unpleasant story that is sure to provoke passionate discussion. The plot centres on Marco Rosedale, a middle-aged, British-born New Yorker, with a media career of some distinction, who learns that he has been accused of sexual assault by an ex-girlfriend, Julia Gault, a former television journalist. The story unfolds during the 2016 US presidential campaign, just as the growing rumble of sexual assault allegations against a number of powerful men is beginning to coalesce into the #MeToo movement. It is narrated by Marco\u2019s friend, another Englishman living in New York, a writer who is never named but bears a strong resemblance to Lasdun himself \u2013 at least, to the Lasdun the reader encounters in Give Me Everything You Have (2013), his searing non-fiction account of being stalked by an ex-student he calls Nasreen. That too is a book about men and women behaving badly, the reliability of memory, shame, trauma and sexual politics. In it, Lasdun reflects on Nasreen\u2019s rage and the agonised question of his responsibility for it. But whereas Nasreen\u2019s assault on Lasdun\u2019s peace of mind seems wholly unjustified, Afternoon of a Faun takes us into much more unsettling territory. The major subject here is the enormity of rape and the enormity of being wrongly accused of rape. The narrator, by instinct and affiliation, is on the side of his friend. He has been somewhat dazzled by Marco ever since they attended the same London school. They share a background and even the same wayward teeth \u2013 \u201clittle crooked monuments to 1970s English dentistry\u201d. Both men are struggling to keep pace with changing social mores. At the very moment the narrator is congratulating himself for remembering the name of one of the minor characters, she is transitioned from Erin to Eric and is thenceforth referred to by the male pronoun. But the narrator has links to Julia as well, who he knew in his boyhood and found intriguing enough to shape a novel around. Enmeshed in the unfolding story as Marco\u2019s confidant, he is torn between his allegiance to his friend and his desire for the truth. Marco claims the alleged rape \u2013 said to have taken place thirty years earlier during a journalistic assignment to Ulster \u2013 was a consensual encounter and dismisses the accuser\u2019s motives as mercenary. But when Julia refuses to back down, Marco mobilises his status and contacts to silence her. This stirs a sense of injustice in the narrator, who is constantly oscillating between the terrible fear that his friend might be guilty and the worry that he is being insufficiently supportive. \u201cHad I internalized the campus outlook, I wondered, with its endless tedious refinements of anxiety over power and privilege?\u201d This anxious back and forth is the rhythm of the book: each time we feel that we can definitively decide where to put our sympathies, the story jostles and unbalances us with new insights. In an age of loud invective and binary solutions, there is something wonderful about Lasdun\u2019s scrupulous recording of doubts and uncertainty. I like his unapologetic literariness and the unexpected way his books draw strength from artefacts of high culture. In Give Me Everything You Have, the Middle English poem \u201cGawain and the Green Knight\u201d became a tool for thinking about the obligations of male decency. In a similar way, the Mallarm\u00e9 poem from which Lasdun borrows the title of the novella is used to evokes contradictory facets of male sexuality. He tells us, almost at the outset, that he feels some final truth should be achievable. Reality \u201cwas something that existed outside the human mind, and independently of it ... not a prize awarded to whoever fought hardest and dirtiest\u201d. It\u2019s some achievement that by the end of the story, you feel he has stayed true to this, but also true to the novelistic task of representing the characters in all their complexity. The first tale is lighter and slighter. Feathered Glory is about Richard, the head teacher of a private elementary school in upstate New York, whose notion of himself as happily married is disturbed by the contagious recklessness of an old friend. Memories of a former lover are stirred up and Richard begins entertaining the possibility of an infidelity \u2013 in fact, that\u2019s putting it a bit strongly. Richard\u2019s so tentative about acknowledging the pull of his libido that his projected deception of his wife includes a sizable dose of self-deception. \u201cIt was necessary, for the sake of his conscience, to stave off any suspicion of premeditation.\u201d Like Afternoon of a Faun, Feathered Glory feels fresh, is free of contrivance and takes unexpected turns. In its deep, patient inspection of the protagonist\u2019s state of mind it resembles a psychoanalytic case history. There are clear commonalities between the two stories \u2013 a quartet of central characters destabilised by a figure from the past, an avian motif, a strait-laced man enthralled by the behaviour of a more impulsive friend. \u201cI was just trying to make a complicated story simple!\u201d complains Richard, in Feathered Glory, when he is caught in the act of a lie. In fact, this specious act of self-justification could serve as the ironic epigraph to both tales. Feathered Glory offers quieter pleasures; it\u2019s Afternoon of a Faun that lingers after you have closed the book with a vividness that testifies to the compact virtues of the novella. \u2022 Marcel Theroux\u2019s The Secret Books is published by Faber.

She is an accomplished despatch box performer and in the past, when standing it an PMQs, she has often played it for laughs. Today she started with with a very good joke, but after that stuck very firmly to policy, largely eschewing party political sloganising. Her tone was appropriate given the seriousness of the crisis facing the country and, although her questions did not elicit any new information, the response they got did illustrate the weaknesses in the the government\u2019s stance. She also seemed to commit Labour to wanting a temporary extension of article 50 more firmly than any other frontbencher has, as far as I\u2019m aware. She was probably right when she said that Lidington understands the minutiae of Brexit better than any of his colleagues (he was Europe minister for years, and also served a long stint as shadow Northern Ireland secretary). Lidington made some reasonable points about the flaws in Labour\u2019s own Brexit policy, but at no point did he really go for the jugular. It meant that he never got off the defensive, but, on the plus side, his demeanour, too, matched the occasion.

Thornberry has said she would be happy with a Norway option. But that would involve free movement. Does Thornberry support Norway, or the Labour manifesto, which ruled out free movement.</p> \n  <p>Thornberry says Lidington probably understands these issues better than anyone else in government. But even he cannot give answers. She will give him one more chance; is there a better plan than this, or will he let parliament take charge?</p> \n  <p>Lidington says May will report back to parliament. The two-year deadline stems from EU legislation. And from article 50. Thornberry voted for article 50, he says. He says perhaps this was a vote where Thornberry was present but not involved.

      "bodyText": "Brexiters have hit back at Donald Tusk after he said that those who promoted Brexit without having a plan to make it work deserved \u201ca special place in hell\u201d. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Tusk should apologise for his \u201cspiteful\u201d comment (see 1.20pm) and Sammy Wilson, the DUP Brexit spokesman, said Tusk was a \u201cdevilish Euro maniac\u201d. (See 12.44pm.) Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said that he will be be meeting Theresa May for Brexit talks over dinner in Dublin on Friday night. At a press conference in Brussels, he also said the Commons only voted for the Brady amendment, which backed the Brexit deal on condition that backstop is replaced with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, because there was no agreement on what that phrase actually meant. (See 4.25pm.) Nearly 5 million British and EU citizens could be stuck in limbo after a no-deal Brexit, a senior EU official has warned, who said it could take several years \u201cto pick up the pieces\u201d of the UK crashing out of the bloc. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has said a no-deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Wales. He made his comments during a keynote speech at the Welsh NHS Confederation Annual Conference and Exhibition where he said: I do genuinely feel that in 2019 the skies have darkened. I endorse absolutely everything that has been said about Brexit, about the way it hangs over the work that we do. The way in which it is getting in the way of our ability to focus the type of future we would like to create in our public services here in Wales. And the absolute imperative that a deal is struck so that we do not face the catastrophic impact that there would be here in Wales on leaving the European Union without a deal at all. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Here is some more reaction from MPs to the Donald Tusk comment. From Nick Boles, the remain-voting Conservative From Tobias Ellwood, another remain-voting Tory From Kate Hoey, the Brexiter Labour MP And this is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader Responding to the Juncker/Varadkar press conference, Downing Street insisted the EU would have to give ground in order for a deal to be agreed. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: Leo Varadkar said that they want the UK to leave with a deal, Donald Tusk said earlier today their priority is avoiding no deal. The fact is that the deal that was on the table has been rejected by 230 votes. So if, as they state, they wish for us to leave with a deal there are going to have to be changes made in order to address concerns which MPs have on the backstop. Here are the main points from the press conference given by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister. Varadkar said he would be meeting Theresa May for talks over dinner in Dublin on Friday night. Juncker and Varadkar both stressed their commitment to the backstop. They did so in the joint statement they issued. And, in the Q&amp;A, Juncker said: We cannot accept the idea, which is circulating around, that the withdrawal agreement could be re-opened. The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement. We cannot re-open the discussion on the backstop ... [Theresa May] knows that the commission is not prepared to re-open the issue. This is the current position of the 27, and thus of the commission. This is the position of the commission, and thus of the 27. Juncker said the UK would not be allowed a mechanism allowing it to withdraw from the backstop unilaterally. He said: So-called alternative arrangements can never replace the backstop. We need the bacsktop. We need the withdrawal agreement. And, when it comes to future relations, we can have a look into alternative arrangements. But they can never replace the backstop. There is no way to have unilateral jumping out of the backstop because the backstop is needed as a guarantee. A safety net is not a safety net if it can be destroyed by the unilateral action of one of the parties. But a unilateral withdrawal mechanism is only one of the two legal options that May is exploring as means of ensuring the UK does not get trapped in the backstop. The other is a time limit. Juncker did not explicitly rule out adding a time limit to the backstop, and some journalists think that might be significant. Varadkar said that the Commons only voted for the Brady amendment, which backed the Brexit deal on condition that backstop is replaced with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, because there was no agreement on what that phrase actually meant. He said: I do have a concern about this idea around alternative arrangements. We need to bear in mind that this majority that did exist in the House of Commons for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d probably only existed because \u201calternative arrangements\u201d can mean whatever you want whatever you want them to mean. I don\u2019t believe that would have passed if people actually had to get into the detail of what alternatives might mean or might not mean. Juncker showed Varadkar a thank you card he had been sent by a family in Ireland. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has declared Donald Tusk\u2019s anti-Brexiter comment \u201cout of order\u201d. (Maybe it\u2019s just me, but isn\u2019t there something a bit dispiriting about the home secretary spouting demotic like a pub landlord? Even on Twitter, he could have put it a bit more eloquently.) Here is the quote from Jean-Claude Juncker on Donald Tusk\u2019s \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d comment. The Commons has adjourned for the day. Today\u2019s business was especially light. Apart from the usual (questions, adjournment debate etc), all MPs had to do was pass two social security motions. This might seem odd, given the Brexit crisis. But the government cannot bring any of its main Brexit legislation to the Commons until it knows whether or not there will be a deal and, if there is a deal, what it will entail. Varadkar said he will meet Theresa May for talks in Dublin on Friday night. Q: What did you make of Angela Merkel\u2019s comments this week about the possibility of a deal if people are \u201ccreative\u201d? Varadkar says he cannot interpret Merkel\u2019s comments. But all politicians are creative. We have been creative all along. Perhaps it is for those who created this problem to be creative now. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, are taking questions. Q: Was today the start of the difficult conversation about what might have to happen in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit? Juncker says the EU stands ready to help Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, although he does not like the term \u201chelp\u201d. But is working assumption is that there will be a deal, Juncker says. He says the EU is willing to look at alternative arrangements to the backstop. But they cannot replace the backstop. The backstop won\u2019t be a backstop if the UK can withdraw unilaterally. Varadkar says the border will be the border for the EU as a whole. But Ireland is making no plans for a hard border. Q: Do you agree with what Donald Tusk said? Juncker says he believes in heaven. He has never seen hell, apart from when he is doing his job here. Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, have just issued this statement after their meeting in Brussels. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has said there is a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for politicians who promoted Brexit \u201cwithout even a sketch of a plan\u201d, while he reiterated the EU\u2019s refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal treaty. His comment has attracted huge attention on social media - perhaps because it reflects a view strongly felt by some remainers that has not been articulated in such forthright terms by mainstream political leaders in the UK. In his statement (full text here, and full summary at 12.02pm) Tusk also said that there was \u201cno political force and no effective leadership for remain\u201d in the UK - an implicit assertion that the campaign for a second referendum is now a lost cause. His diatribe has infuriated Brexiters - as he knew it would. (See 12.40pm.) But the row may also have distracted attention from some of the more conciliatory language in this statement. Although he said that the EU was \u201cnot making any new offer\u201d to the UK and that the the withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot open for re-negotiation\u201d, he also said that he still believed that a \u201ccommon solution\u201d was possible and that, if the UK were to provide \u201ca believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland\u201d, a deal would be possible. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said the withdrawal agreement remains \u201cthe best deal possible\u201d. Speaking alongside Tusk after their talks in Brussels, he also said that if the UK\u2019s intentions for the future relationship \u201cwere to evolve\u201d, the EU would be \u201cprepared to adapt the content and level of ambition in the political declaration while respecting its established principles\u201d. Theresa May could win the backing of dozens of Labour MPs for a Brexit deal if she softened her red lines, it has been claimed. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy told Radio 5 Live that up to 60 MPs on the opposition benches could be prepared to back a revised deal. She said that she wanted the UK to remain in a customs union and that Labour MPs would want \u201cbinding assurances\u201d on the future trade relationship. She went on: If [May] were able to come back, and stop this eternal circular conversation within the Tory party, and start reaching out to the rest of parliament and the rest of the country and give us those assurances, I think you\u2019d get somewhere between 40 and 60 Labour members of parliament who would be prepared to step forward and say, we\u2019ve got to come together around this, otherwise we leave with no deal. Nandy said that Labour should also be willing to drop one of its own red lines, its commitment to ending free movement. She said: The [Labour party\u2019s] six key tests commit us to the exact same benefits as being in the single market, to being in a permanent UK-wide customs union with the European Union, and ending free movement. Now it is very clear, in discussions with the European Union, that you cannot do all of those things. So we are going to have to choose. My own view is that access to the single market and remaining in a permanent customs union is the only thing that will protect the huge number of food manufacturing jobs in my constituency, and the service industry as well, which employs many many people in my town and across the country. So ending free movement is where we are going to have to budge. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said article 50 should be extended. Speaking at PMQs, where she was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, she said: Does the minister not agree that the sensible, cautious thing to do at this late stage is to seek a temporary extension of article 50 so that we have time to see whether negotiations succeed or if they do not to pursue a different plan? Thornberry\u2019s colleague, the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, has previously described an extension of article 50 as probably inevitable, but this seems to be the first time Labour has actively proposed this idea. Thornberry broke with the European big power consensus by saying it was wrong to recognise Juan Guaido as the interim president of Venezuela, saying she did not wish to strike a pose to help Venezuela, but do something realistic and practical to secure fresh elections. Donald Trump will return to the UK in December for a Nato summit, it has been announced. Police will be given strengthened powers to crackdown on illegal traveller sites under new government plans, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has announced in a written ministerial statement. In the Commons the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone described Donald Tusk\u2019s anti-Brexiter comment as a \u201ccompletely outrageous insult\u201d, adding: I don\u2019t recall any president insulting members of this House, members of the government and the British people in such a way. (Reminder: during the EU referendum Bone campaigned alongside Nigel Farage, the then Ukip leader, under the banner of Grassroots Out, the organisation they both founded. Farage\u2019s offensiveness towards EU politicians is legendary. He famously described Herman Van Rompuy, Tusk\u2019s predecessor as president of the European council, as having \u201call the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk\u201d.) Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, issued this statement after her talks with Theresa May at Stormont today. She said: The party has an on-going engagement with the government regarding our exit from the European Union. This was another useful opportunity to press for a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom. We want a deal which respects the Union and the referendum result. Our message was very simple. The draft withdrawal agreement is flawed because the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The backstop is the main problem. It must be dealt with in the terms set out in the Brady amendment which secured a majority in the House of Commons. During that debate, the prime minister made commitments that there would be legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. That is what is needed. This is from the Have I Got News For You Twitter account. Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Fein president, has also backed Donald Tusk\u2019s anti-Brexiter comment. And she dismissed claims that what he said might further antagonise the Brexiters. She said: You are not going to convince me that anything Donald Tusk says could further harden the position of the Boris Johnsons\u2019 or the Rees-Moggs\u2019 of this world They are people who have acted with absolute contempt for this country, utter disregard for the experiences of Irish people north and south, with utter disregard for the peace process that has been collectively built over decades. Their position is the most hardline of hardline, it is their language that is intemperate and it is their position that is untenable. The SNP have applauded Donald Tusk for his comment about Brexiters. This is from its foreign affairs and Europe spokesperson, Stephen Gethins. He said: The charlatans and chancers who led the Leave campaign did not even have the decency to set out their plans before the vote, which has led directly to the uncertainty and damage that we face today. The council president has hit the nail on the head with his remarks. Before any election or referendum, it is a basic part of democracy that those seeking office or a change set out their proposals in a manifesto or white paper and can then be held to account based on what was said before a vote. Yet those who campaigned for leave, including senior UK government ministers, failed even in this basic democratic requirement. Their action stands in stark contrast to the Scottish government that rightly opened up its plans to full scrutiny by producing a 650-page white paper and other position papers ahead of Scotland\u2019s independence referendum. Providing a blueprint for future plans as well as means of accountability is responsible politics. Instead, with Brexit, we are faced with a situation where even the UK government itself is warning of food and medicine shortages and the loss hundreds of thousands of jobs and a massive economic hit. We are facing the worst crisis in peace-time because of senior government figures failing to hold themselves to account for their actions or have a plan for what comes next other than holding the Tory party together. All the while the Labour party acts as a willing accomplice in inflicting this economic devastation. The rest of Europe can clearly see that it is all of us in the UK who are paying the price for their continued failure. On the World at One Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, says it would be ironic if the \u201cintransigence\u201d of the EU lead to there being a no-deal Brexit, something the EU claims it wants to avoid. It would be the ultimate irony if the EU\u2019s intransigence around the deal that we have should lead to the one thing that they claim to be seeking to avoid, and that is a no-deal which would lead, potentially, to having to have a hard border. That is what they are seeking to avoid so why won\u2019t they discuss this rationally with us? (She is sounding very like Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, who said much the same thing yesterday.) There was a tone of resigned exasperation from Downing Street about Donald Tusk\u2019s remarks, at the briefing for lobby journalists after PMQs. Asked about his comments, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: It\u2019s a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that sort of language to be helpful - and I appreciate that was difficult this morning, because he didn\u2019t take any questions. We had a robust and lively referendum campaign in this country in what was the largest democratic exercise in our history. People voted to leave the European Union, and what everybody should be focused upon now is delivering the verdict of the British people, so we can leave the EU in an orderly way, and with a deal that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is being interviewed on the World at One now. She says Donald Tusk should apologise for his comment. She says it was \u201cpretty disgraceful\u201d, \u201ccompletely unaccepable\u201d and \u201cspiteful\u201d. I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful. I\u2019m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u2019t done it. This is a negotiation between friends, allies, neighbours. It\u2019s supposed to be collegiate and collaborative, and it totally demeans him to stoop to such a spiteful tweet. Here is my colleague Jennifer Rankin\u2019s story on Tusk\u2019s outburst. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, was one of the leading Vote Leave campaigners and may have been one of those Donald Tusk was referring to when he said that the people who backed Brexit without having a plan to deliver it deserved \u201ca special place in hell\u201d. (See 12.02pm.) She told the BBC that Tusk was a man with \u201cno manners\u201d. Here is the Conservative MP Anna Soubry on the Tusk outburst. Here is some comment from journalist on Donald Tusk\u2019s outburst. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge From AFP\u2019s Damon Wake From the Times\u2019 Bruno Waterfield This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock asks Lidington why the Tories have \u201ctrousered\u201d \u00a31m in donations from people with links to Russia, despite the government saying the Putin regime should not be treated as normal. Lidington says there are people of Russian origin who live in the UK, who are British citizens and who are entitled to donate to political parties. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has responded to Donald Tusk\u2019s anti-Brexit outburst. (See 12.02pm and 12.37pm.) Back to PMQs, and Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says MPs voted for the Brady amendment, which said the backstop should be \u201creplaced\u201d. Which bit of \u201creplaced\u201d was not clear? Lidington says Theresa May set out yesterday how the work on finding an alternative to the backstop would proceed. Back to Donald Tusk, and this is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter, asks what progress is being made on the so-called Malthouse compromise. Lidington says there is no intention to hold it up. He says the Matlhouse compromise group have been meeting with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. Those talks continue, he says. Turning back to Donald Tusk, here is the full text of the statement he made when he spoke to journalists earlier. (See 12.02pm.) Jim McMahon, the Labour MP, says the government has committed to setting up a fund to pay for children\u2019s funeral. But it has not actually been set up yet. Thousans of families have had to pay for funerals since the announcement without help. Lidington says the government will stop parents having to pay for these funerals. But it is looking into how best this can be delivered. He says he will put McMahon\u2019s point to the ministers in charge. Jack Brereton, a Conservative, commends the police and the fire service for their response to the fire in Stafford this week. Lidington says all MPs will feel enormous sympathy for the horror the family have suffered. PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn\u2019t a particularly memorable PMQs, but it was more focused and less shouty than the usual May/Corbyn encounter, and Emily Thornberry, who had the upper hand, will notch it up as a success. She is an accomplished despatch box performer and in the past, when standing it an PMQs, she has often played it for laughs. Today she started with with a very good joke, but after that stuck very firmly to policy, largely eschewing party political sloganising. Her tone was appropriate given the seriousness of the crisis facing the country and, although her questions did not elicit any new information, the response they got did illustrate the weaknesses in the the government\u2019s stance. She also seemed to commit Labour to wanting a temporary extension of article 50 more firmly than any other frontbencher has, as far as I\u2019m aware. She was probably right when she said that Lidington understands the minutiae of Brexit better than any of his colleagues (he was Europe minister for years, and also served a long stint as shadow Northern Ireland secretary). Lidington made some reasonable points about the flaws in Labour\u2019s own Brexit policy, but at no point did he really go for the jugular. It meant that he never got off the defensive, but, on the plus side, his demeanour, too, matched the occasion. At least he was taking it all seriously. Thornberry says she would be happy to hold a seminar on the problems with May\u2019s plan at another time. She says a customs union is the only viable solution. So why is the government so dead-set against it. Lidington says the Labour plan for a customs union would not fully address the border problems in Ireland. Thornberry has said she would be happy with a Norway option. But that would involve free movement. Does Thornberry support Norway, or the Labour manifesto, which ruled out free movement. Thornberry says Lidington probably understands these issues better than anyone else in government. But even he cannot give answers. She will give him one more chance; is there a better plan than this, or will he let parliament take charge? Lidington says May will report back to parliament. The two-year deadline stems from EU legislation. And from article 50. Thornberry voted for article 50, he says. He says perhaps this was a vote where Thornberry was present but not involved. If Thornberry wants to avoid no deal, she should vote for a deal, he says. Thornberry says the sensible, cautious thing to do would be to seek a temporary extension of article 50. Labour backs temporary extension of article 50. In the past some Labour figures have said this will be inevitable, but the party has been hesitant about being seen to call for this. Lidington asks Thornberry to explain Labour policy. Thornberry says there is no way that the UK can avoid a border in Ireland after Brexit without a full customs union, or a backstop, or a technological solution. Which plan is the government pushing? Lidington says Labour wants a customs union, so businesses can export without tariffs or checks. But that is what the PM\u2019s plan proposes. So what part of her deal does Labour object to? Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary who is standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, starts by saying it is good to be up against the person dubbed the effective deputy PM again. This must the the only time the words effective and prime minister appear in the same sentence. She asks when the vote on the deal will take place. Lidington says Theresa May said the meaningful vote would come back as soon as possible. If that does not happen by next Wednesday, there will be a debate and vote next Thursday. Thornberry says May said she would get a significant and legally-binding change to the withdrawal agreement. What will happen if towards 29 March that has not been achieved. Lidington says May is going to Brussels tomorrow. He says, if MPs want to avoid no deal, they must vote for a deal. Andrew Bridgen, the Tory Brexiter, starts by saying he was pleased to watch the video of Jeremy Corbyn condemning the EU when he was a backbencher. Will the government rule out a second referendum. Lidington says a second referendum would suggest the government got it wrong. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister who is standing in for Theresa May at PMQs, starts by welcoming the news that the Nato summit is coming to the UK in December. Here are the main points from Donald Tusk\u2019s statement to journalists. Tusk, the president of the European council, said there was \u201ca special place in hell\u201d for those who promoted Brexit in the UK without having a plan for making it happen. By the way, I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely. He said the EU was preparing for the \u201cpossible fiasco\u201d of no deal. He said people all over Europe wanted the UK to change its mind. He said: People all over the continent, and in Ireland, hoped that the UK would change its mind about Brexit. Tusk said he too hoped the UK would decide to stay in the EU. He said Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn were both \u201cpro-Brexit\u201d and that there was no leadership for remain in the UK. But the facts are unmistakeable. At the moment the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the leader of the opposition, rules out this question. Today there is no political force, and no effective leadership, for remain. I say this without satisfaction, but you can\u2019t argue with the facts. He said the EU would not be \u201cmaking any new offer\u201d to the UK. He said the withdrawal agreement was \u201cnot open for renegotiation\u201d. He said he hoped May would come to Brussels with a \u201crealistic\u201d plan tomorrow. I hope that tomorrow we will hear from prime minister May a realistic suggestion on how to end the impasse in which the process of the orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU has found itself following the latest votes in the House of Commons. He said the Irish border issued remained the EU\u2019s top priority. The EU is first and foremost a peace project,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. This is why we insist on the backstop. Just in case anyone did not get the message, Donald Tusk, the European council president, has been tweeted. Tusk says he hopes Theresa May will come to Brussels with a \u201crealistic suggestion\u201d tomorrow. He says the withdrawal agreement is not open to renegotiation. He says the EU has been preparing for the \u201cpossible fiasco\u201d that might happen if the UK leaves without a deal. And he ends by saying those who promoted Brexit without a plan for leaving deserve \u201ca special place in hell\u201d. By the way, I have been wondering what the special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to [deliver it] safely. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is speaking in Brussels now. He says he would like the UK to remain in the EU. But Theresa May is committed to leave, he says. And he says there is no effective leadership for remain. He says the EU is preparing for a no-deal Brexit. Critics of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal have published proposals for a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which they claim will deliver the \u201cmost advanced and liberalising\u201d conditions ever seen. As the Press Association reports, the document - part of a sequence of reports released under the slogan A Better Deal - proposes zero tariffs and no restrictions in quantity for trade in goods and agricultural and food products and \u201cmaximum liberalisation\u201d for services. It proposes \u201cstate of the art\u201d highly facilitated customs clearance arrangements between the EU and UK. On the movement of labour, it calls for easier access to temporary business visas, while on the movement of capital it proposes free flows between the EU and UK. The two sides would be barred from erecting technical barriers to trade or using standards as a means of making trade more difficult. And the two sides would have to commit not to use subsidies or state aid to distort markets. Written by international trade policy experts Shanker Singham and Robert MacLean, the document states that its proposals would preserve the UK\u2019s ability to strike trade deals around the world and make changes to its own domestic relations, the Press Association reports. Speaking ahead of the report\u2019s launch in Westminster this morning, Esther McVey, the Brexiter former work and pensions secretary, said: Brexit was about taking back control over our trade policy. Ninety per cent of global economic growth will come from outside the EU in the years ahead and the EU now accounts for less than half of the UK\u2019s overall trade. So we must develop a trading relationship with the EU that makes doing business with our closest trading partners possible, without hindering our ability to develop new trading relationships with non-EU countries. This proposal paves the way to a better future and a more global Britain. The prime minister must introduce direct rule government for Northern Ireland if no Brexit deal can be agreed, the Ulster Unionist party has said. UUP leader Robin Swann made the call as he arrived to meet Theresa May at Stormont. He said: We are not far from March 29, we as a party don\u2019t see a no deal as a positive situation or something that suits Northern Ireland or the UK. We have asked her to look for an extension of article 50. If she is not prepared to do that, and we are at a situation where the executive and the Assembly isn\u2019t up and running again, she has to put something in place. She has to put direct rule in place come March 30 because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction. As the Press Associatoin reports, after his meeting, Swann claimed May appeared reluctant to talk about efforts to restore power sharing. He said: The conversation we were having with the prime minister was initially about Brexit, we had to drag her to a place were we actually started to talk about how we get these institutions back up and running. The Labour MP Chris Leslie asks Fox if he can say the government is ruling out removing all tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A HuffPost story yesterday said this was being considered. Fox says the government has not decided what it\u2019s policy would be in these circumstances. He says he personally has never advocated full liberalisation. But it would not just be a decision for him, he says. It would be a collective decision. Fox says he personally would not favour cutting tariffs on all imports to zero in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Leslie suggests the people working in an industry like ceramics, which would suffer hugely if tariff reduction allowed in cheap ceramic imports, will be worried that Fox has not ruled out universal tariff reduction. Fox says this would be a collective decision. But he says the government is very aware of the harm a decision like that could cause. At the international trade committee Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asked Fox if he thought May was \u201cwedded\u201d to the backstop. The reports from yesterday\u2019s speech implied she is, he said. But Evans said a lot of Brexiters \u201cwould just like to bin it\u201d. Fox said it was important to differentiate between the concept and the mechanism. May was committed to the concept of ensuring that there will be no hard border in Ireland, Fox said. But she was not committed to a \u201cparticular mechanism\u201d for achieving that. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons international trade committee. As the Telegraph\u2019s Jack Maidment reports, Fox started by saying a Brexit deal was closer than ever. MPs proposing the so-called Malthouse compromise, which would offer the EU a choice of options to get round Conservative objections to the Irish backstop, have insisted Theresa May still takes their idea seriously, despite seeming to rule it out in a speech in Belfast on Tuesday. The idea, named after named after housing minister Kit Malthouse, groups together Tories from both Brexit wings of the party. It proposes to offer the EU two option. Plan A proposes an extended transition period which would remove the backstop in place of as-yet undetermined technological checks; if this fails, plan B would also extend the transition arrangement to allow for a managed no deal. A series of supportive MPs have been meeting Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay this week as a so-called alternative arrangements working group. In her speech, May stressed that the UK could not leave the UK without a backstop, the insurance policy intended to avoid a hard Irish border if no permanent solution can be found. But one MP from the group said they felt this had been overblown: The thing about the PM is that, as ever, she\u2019ll stick to the same line until something else is firmly on the table. What the working group is doing now is looking at the workability of what has been proposed. I strongly suspect she hasn\u2019t had formal advice on that, so the words don\u2019t preclude alternative arrangements. It\u2019s a question of what those alternative arrangements are. Another MP from the group said they felt it was possible May could still present their idea to Brussels: We\u2019ve had very good engagement from the government. We\u2019ve had a series of working parties. I think the idea is that by the end of today there\u2019s a sense of this being, hopefully, a realistic option that the prime minister can then consider as she looks for options to take to Europe. There is, however, not complete unity on the way forward. One MP from the group said they would be fine with the Malthouse plan being taken to Brussels as part of a \u201cmenu\u201d of options, such as a change to the backstop, for example to time-limit it. But another argued that the entire backstop was \u201cstructurally wrong\u201d, adding: So to accept it with a time limit, or some exit mechanism, whatever it might end up looking like, is still a very difficult thing to do. In the committee Rachel Reeves repeatedly asked Greg Clark what the government would do to avoid a no deal, if Theresa May failed to come up with a plan that would pass parliament. Clark repeatedly insisted that the way to avoid this was for parliament to pass a deal. Reeves then asked Clark if he would remain in government if May decided to implement a no-deal Brexit. Clark replied: As long as [getting a deal] remains the policy of the government, I will be a vigorous proponent of that. But I think it\u2019s obvious to everyone that, if it were ever to be the policy of the government, as a matter of policy, to leave the European Union [without a deal], I think there would be many people on all sides of the House that would regard that as unacceptable. Greg Clark effectively confirms he would resign from the cabinet if it every adopted no-deal Brexit as policy. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon has won \u00a330,000 in libel damages in a high court action against the Sun over claims a heavy metal band he performed with used Nazi imagery, the Press Association reports. In the committee Rachel Reeves, the committee chair, asks Clark if he agrees that the Commons should rule out a no-deal Brexit. Clark says the only way to do that would be by passing a deal, or revoking article 50. And revoking article 50, which would mean abandoning Brexit, would he unacceptable. Q: What about extending article 50? That only postpones the problem, he says. Greg Clark, the business secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons business committee. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, Clark said the effective deadline for a Brexit deal was within \u201cthe next couple of weeks\u201d because exporters need to know what is happening before they despatch goods on a six-week sea journey to the far east. Some journalists are interpreting Clark\u2019s comment as meaning the real deadline is Thursday 14 February, when MPs are due to next vote on Brexit, or the day after. In an interview with the Times (paywall) at the weekend, Clark explained in detail why the effective deadline for a deal is in the middle of February. He said: An engineering employer said to me yesterday, \u2018Actually D-Day is much closer for us \u2014 it\u2019s the middle to the end of February if you are shipping to the Far East.\u2019 The reason for that is if you are sending a consignment of goods to Japan or South Korea, it\u2019s going to take six weeks for it to arrive. Both countries have free-trade agreements with the EU, which will fall if we have no deal. So you don\u2019t know whether the goods that you\u2019ve had to embark on the ocean, when they arrive there will be admitted and if so what tariffs are going to be paid. People say \u2018Things are always decided at the 59th minute of the 11th hour\u2019. But it\u2019s important to understand where \u2018the wire\u2019 is. The wire is not the 29th of March. Theresa May\u2019s first meeting in Belfast is with the Ulster Unionists, the BBC reports. Donald Trump will return to the UK in December for a Nato summit, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: The US president, who has repeatedly criticised the military alliance, will meet with heads of state in London, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg announced on Wednesday. It will be Mr Trump\u2019s second visit to Britain since his election, having jetted in amid swathes of protest last July. Stoltenberg said: \u201cI am pleased to announce that allies have agreed that the next meeting of Nato heads of state and government will take place in London in December 2019. \u201cThe meeting in London will be an opportunity for allied heads of state and government to address the security challenges we face now and in the future, and to ensure that Nato continues to adapt in order to keep its population of almost one billion people safe.\u201d An aide to Emily Thornberry tells me that, when she said at the Institute for Government event this morning \u201cI\u2019m very surprised, in some ways, that 70% of the country is now not in favour of remaining in the European Union\u201d, what she meant was that she was surprised that we have not got to the point where 70% favour remain - not that 70% don\u2019t favour remain, and she is surprised by that. I have updated the post at 10.04am to reflect that. Emily Thornberry\u2019s speech at the Institute for Government has now ended. During the Q&amp;A she was asked about Brexit. Here are the top lines. Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said politicians have a duty to \u201cdo as we\u2019re told\u201d on Brexit. She explained: My view has been since the Brexit vote is that it\u2019s our duty to do as we\u2019re told. We are public servants. I may not think it\u2019s a great idea to leave the European Union; I definitely don\u2019t think it is, and I\u2019m completely honest about that. But it is my duty to do everything I can from opposition to try to deliver a Brexit that is the most practical and pragmatic. She said the anger that made people vote leave remains. Too many people who voted for Brexit hear - it may not be what is said, or what\u2019s meant sometimes - but what they hear is that they only voted for Brexit because they\u2019re racist, because they are stupid, because they were manipulated by the Russians. I haven\u2019t met anybody who voted to leave the European Union who are any of those things, and certainly don\u2019t think of themselves as any of those things. And they are getting dug in in their opinions. And the anger that caused them to vote to leave the European Union remains, because I think the underlying causes of people being left behind, being ignored, not being London, not being the south east, continue. And we should be a little bit more humble when listening to what the public have to say to us ... Because at a time when just end up shouting at one another, we won\u2019t be able to pull the country back together again. She said she did not think Labour could back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. The final deal should involve staying in the customs union, she said. UPDATE: Originally I also included this Thornberry quote in the summary. I\u2019m very surprised, in some ways, that 70% of the country is now not in favour of remaining in the European Union, because if we look at the evidence before our eyes there are so many truthful things that could have been written on the side of the bus ... She seemed to be saying that on some measures, 70% of people now do not favour staying in the EU (which is not correct). But an aide says the point she was making was that she was surprised that we have not got to the point where 70% favour remain - not that 70% don\u2019t favour remain, and she is surprised by that. For the record, here is the latest polling on Brexit, from What UK Thinks, which keeps a comprehensive database on Brexit polling. Theresa May has arrived at Stormont for the talks with the Northern Ireland parties. This morning the Guardian splashes on Theresa May\u2019s Belfast speech, and how it threatens to re-open the rift in the Conservative party over Brexit and the backstop. Here is our story. And here is the front page. This morning there is some evidence that the backlash against the speech continues. Nadine Dorries, a prominent Tory Brexiter, posted this on Twitter this morning. May\u2019s speech, and her answers during the Q&amp;A, were intended to reassure those in Northern Ireland who are worried about the return of a hard border. But, according to the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack, May has managed to discomfort the Brexiters without getting any credit from those on the other side of the argument, Sinn Fein. We will be hearing more on this later, because May is meeting all the parties in Northern Ireland today, and they are likely to brief on the talks after they are over. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.35am: Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, gives a speech on Labour\u2019s foreign policy. As Patrick Wintour reports, she will say a Labour government would not indulge human rights abuses by Britain\u2019s allies or by governments that \u201ccall themselves \u2018socialist\u2019 but \u2026 betray every socialist ideal\u201d. There is a live feed here. Morning: Theresa May meets leaders of the Northern Ireland political parties in Northern Ireland. 10am: Greg Clark, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Commons business committee. 10am: David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, and Greg Hands, the former international trade secretary, launch a paper proposing a UK/EU free trade agreement. 10am: Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, meets Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels. Press statements are due at around 3pm. 10.30am: Judgement is given in Richard Burgon\u2019s libel action against the Sun. 11am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee. 12pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, faces Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, at PMQs. They are standing in, because Theresa May is in Northern Ireland. 2.30pm: Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, and Suella Braverman, the former Brexit minister, give evidence to the European scrutiny committee about the handling of the Brexit process. And at some point today Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, is giving a speech saying Labour would establish a new standalone internet regulator with the power to fine tech companies that fail in their duty of care to children. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post after PMQs and another when I finish, at about 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council\u2019s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved \u2013 something the council says users appreciate. </p> <p>But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone.</p> <p>Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council\u2019s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding <a href=\"https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/blog/2018/12/07/local-digital-fund-success\">to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots</a>. </p> <p>When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple \u2013 a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration\u2019s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. </p> <p>Labellarte led the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jul/04/robot-amelia-future-local-government-enfield-council\">Amelia chatbot service</a> at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. </p> <p>Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. </p> <p>This includes making it clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/18/how-can-you-tell-who-is-human-online-chatbots\">when bots are in use</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,\u201d she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair.

Automated systems can make organisations more efficient \u2013 but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response.

The software does provide automatic answers for a handful of the most common queries, but a member of staff still monitors this work and responses are marked as being from an automated system. \u201c It is important to be transparent,\u201d says Maryvonne Hassall, the council\u2019s digital strategy manager. Aylesbury Vale is looking at extending the software to deal with voice enquiries by phone as well as through voice-activated speakers. It already has an Alexa skill, equivalent to an app, that can deal with queries such as information about bin days. Last spring, the London borough of Waltham Forest introduced its Walt environmental reporting chatbot, accessible through Messenger and direct messages to a Twitter account @WFTellWalt. It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council\u2019s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved \u2013 something the council says users appreciate. But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone. Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council\u2019s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots. When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple \u2013 a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration\u2019s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. Labellarte led the introduction of the Amelia chatbot service at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. This includes making it clear when bots are in use: \u201cIt\u2019s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,\u201d she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair. Many chatbot systems rely on machine learning and there is growing concern about built-in bias. Automated systems can make organisations more efficient \u2013 but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo. In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response. But she adds that real people should continue to deal with complex queries and anything that requires compassion, such as the result of medical tests. \u201cYou need people to engage with people.\u201d",

How can I back them up in case the laptop dies? <strong>Jenifer</strong></p> <p>As you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? <strong>EC</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>First things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/free-backup-software-tools-2617964\">more than 30</a> free third-party alternatives for Windows including <a href=\"http://www.ascomp.de/products/show/product/backupmaker\">BackUp Maker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.backup-utility.com/download.html\">AOMEI Backupper Standard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/tb-free.html\">EaseUS Todo Backup Free</a>.</p> <p>Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web\u2019s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart\u2019s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn\u2019t updated when you add a new bookmark.</p> <h2><strong>Manually saving bookmarks</strong></h2> <p>In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select \u201cExport Bookmarks \u2026\u201d to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good \u2013 you select Bookmarks then \u201cExport Bookmarks \u2026\u201d \u2013 but most browsers now make it more complicated.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer\">Firefox</a>, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for \u201cImport and Backup\u201d. In <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en-GB\">Google Chrome</a>, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome://bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select \u201cExport bookmarks\u201d.</p> <p>In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the \u201cImport from another browser\u201d button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine.</p> <p>Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file \u2013 drag and drop usually works \u2013 into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.</p> <p>You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML\">MHTML</a> or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome://flags or vivaldi://flags or opera://flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/single-file/\">Firefox</a> and <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle\">Chrome</a>. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)</p> <h2><strong>Syncing bookmarks and bookmark managers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0643b1c3dc7e289d1711c60a294d3869effd225\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0643b1c3dc7e289d1711c60a294d3869effd225/357_362_3285_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"vivaldi web browser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivaldi is one of many browsers that offers a syncing feature designed to keep your bookmarks up to date across different computers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vivaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/165139\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-sync-my-computer\">Firefox</a>, <a href=\"https://help.vivaldi.com/article/sync/\">Vivaldi</a> and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026735/microsoft-edge-sync-favorites-and-reading-list\">Edge</a> also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.</p> <p>Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.</p> <p>Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager\u2019s website.</p> <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/bookmarks/\">one of the simplest bookmark managers</a>, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT203519\">iCloud Bookmarks</a> is rather better, and works in several different browsers \u2013 Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge \u2013 on many different devices.</p> <p>I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you\u2019ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include <a href=\"https://start.me/start/gb/start-page\">start.me</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bookmarkninja.com/\">Bookmark Ninja</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropmark.com/\">Dropmark</a>, <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/\">Raindrop.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bookmax.net/\">Bookmax</a>, <a href=\"https://atavi.com/\">Atavi</a> and, for Chrome only, <a href=\"https://booky.io/\">Booky</a>. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category \u2013 Delicious and Xmarks \u2013 have closed down.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the excellent <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/faq/\">Pinboard</a>, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/dec/16/goodbye-delicious-hello-pinboard-bookmarking-guardian\">bought the remains of Delicious</a>. Guardian Technology used Pinboard for a few years for <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">linkbucket blog posts</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://getpocket.com/\">Pocket</a> \u2013 which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome \u2013 would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. <a href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a> does much the same thing.</p> <p>Most researchers who need <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a> will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.</p> <p>Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.</p> <h2><strong>Social bookmarking</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44d78041db9a2c387dafe8d8ae4400fa2a566cfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44d78041db9a2c387dafe8d8ae4400fa2a566cfb/206_0_2702_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pinterest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pinterest is one of many sites that might be a good replacement for Google+ as a social bookmarking service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in <a href=\"http://vanderwal.net/folksonomy.html\">folksonomy</a> or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.</p> <p>Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.</p> <p>I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with <a href=\"https://www.bookmax.net/accounts\">Bookmax</a> (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/\">Pinterest</a> might be the best alternative.</p> <p>The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of \u201csecret boards\u201d. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.</p> <h2><strong>Goodbye Google+</strong></h2> <p>Either way, you should <a href=\"https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1045788\">download your data from Google+</a> before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn\u2019t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don\u2019t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.</p> <p>You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link. In my case, it was only a 9MB download, 17MB when unzipped.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:ask.jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></strong></p>",

Jenifer As you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? EC First things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are more than 30 free third-party alternatives for Windows including BackUp Maker, AOMEI Backupper Standard and EaseUS Todo Backup Free. Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web\u2019s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart\u2019s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn\u2019t updated when you add a new bookmark. Manually saving bookmarks In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select \u201cExport Bookmarks \u2026\u201d to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good \u2013 you select Bookmarks then \u201cExport Bookmarks \u2026\u201d \u2013 but most browsers now make it more complicated. In Firefox, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for \u201cImport and Backup\u201d. In Google Chrome, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome://bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select \u201cExport bookmarks\u201d. In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the \u201cImport from another browser\u201d button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine. Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file \u2013 drag and drop usually works \u2013 into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices. You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome://flags or vivaldi://flags or opera://flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.) Syncing bookmarks and bookmark managers Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in. Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders. Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager\u2019s website. Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple\u2019s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers \u2013 Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge \u2013 on many different devices. I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you\u2019ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category \u2013 Delicious and Xmarks \u2013 have closed down. There\u2019s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, who bought the remains of Delicious. Guardian Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts. Pocket \u2013 which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome \u2013 would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing. Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts. Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things. Social bookmarking Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it. Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers. I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative. The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of \u201csecret boards\u201d. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc. Goodbye Google+ Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn\u2019t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don\u2019t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful. You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link. In my case, it was only a 9MB download, 17MB when unzipped.

      "bodyText": "We know that politics makes strange bedfellows, but few alliances are more surprising than the one linking the ultra-rich to ultra-nationalists. What could the wealthiest people in the world have in common with those upending politics in the name of the \u201cforgotten man\u201d? As I have found in over a decade of research on global elites and tax havens, a shared political project unites them: both seek to weaken or dismantle international alliances that constrain them. For ultra-nationalists, this project means \u201ctaking back control\u201d of their governments from foreigners. For the ultra-rich, it means eliminating the controls that international organizations and alliances have imposed on them individually and as a class: a world without the EU, or without the Global Magnitsky Act, is one in which the people who appeared in the Panama Papers can get even richer and expand their influence over an increasing share of the world\u2019s governments and resources. Thus what the media has treated as two separate news stories are actually manifestations of one big story, linking the shocks of the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, the Brexit vote, and the 2016 US election. It is a consummate irony that ultra-nationalism has been repackaged for voters as an effort to regain local control, protect national boundaries and reassert the dominance of local ethnic groups. What has been sold to working-class and middle-class voters as \u201ca war for the little guy\u201d is in practical terms the wishlist of the ultra-wealthy worldwide. When Steve Bannon, who served Trump as chief White House strategist and is now fomenting populist revolution across Europe, called for \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, he specifically targeted the systems of taxation, financial oversight, and public accountability that constrain the ultra-wealthy. The American hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, whose $60m offshore \u201cwar chest\u201d bankrolled both Brexit and the Trump campaign, only began donating to political causes after the US Internal Revenue Service fined his firm $6.8bn for tax evasion. Arron Banks, the UK businessman with substantial offshore holdings, may have had a similar motivation: he became the largest financial backer of Brexit\u2019s Leave.EU campaign following the imposition of costly international regulatory requirements on his insurance companies. Even richer is the irony that ultra-nationalist campaigns have been funded by wealth hoarded offshore, courtesy of the same global elites demonized by Bannon and other self-proclaimed nationalists. Populist ultra-nationalism is a project bought and paid for by global elites and their tax haven wealth. The links first started to become apparent in the Panama Papers leak of May 2016, which showed that several of the most prominent supporters of Brexit held substantial assets offshore, in accounts that later came under investigation as conduits for illegal foreign influence \u2013 including contributions from Russia. That wealth helped finance the Leave campaign, which touted the importance of local control and taking back control from \u201cforeign elites\u201d. Through the Paradise Papers we also learned that Donald Trump, who campaigned against the \u201ccorrupt globalism\u201d of Hillary Clinton and proudly proclaims himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d, had surrounded himself with cabinet members whose vast fortunes are stashed in tax havens around the world. Some of these tax haven schemes link them to foreign adversaries of the United States. This link between offshore finance and ultra-nationalism is not exclusive to the Anglo-Saxon countries.

With Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s career already hanging by a thread over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, the day\u2019s developments threatened to take down Virginia\u2019s top three elected officials, all of them Democrats.

Herring, 57, went public after rumors of a blackface photo of him had circulated at the capitol for a day or more. But in his statement, he said nothing about the existence of a photo. Herring made a name for himself nationally by playing a central role in getting Virginia\u2019s ban on gay marriage lifted, and he had been planning to run for governor in 2021. The chairman of the Virginia legislative black caucus, Lamont Bagby, said its members needed time to process the news about the attorney general: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to digest.\u201d In his statement, Herring said he and two friends had dressed up to look like rappers they listened to, including Kurtis Blow, admitting: \u201cIt sounds ridiculous even now writing it. \u201cThat conduct clearly shows that, as a young man, I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behavior could inflict on others,\u201d he said. But he also said: \u201cThis conduct is in no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.\u201d Northam has come under pressure from nearly the entire state and national Democratic establishment to resign after the discovery of a photo on his profile page in the Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook of someone in blackface standing next to a person in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe. Northam admitted at first that he was in the photo without saying which costume he was wearing. A day later, he denied he was in the picture. But he acknowledged he once used shoe polish to blacken his face and look like Michael Jackson at a dance contest in Texas in 1984, when he was in the army. Last Friday, Herring condemned the yearbook photo as \u201cindefensible\u201d and said that it was \u201cno longer possible\u201d for Northam to lead the state.

Then in 1967 Israel occupied and later annexed east Jerusalem, in a move that has never been recognised by the international community. In the decades since, a <a href=\"https://law.acri.org.il/en/category/east-jerusalem/\">deep disparity</a> has grown between the poverty-stricken Palestinian east side and largely Jewish Israeli west Jerusalem: for example, annually <a href=\"https://law.acri.org.il/en/category/east-jerusalem/planning-and-building-rights/\">only 13% of the city\u2019s building permits</a> issued by the Israeli government are granted to Palestinians in east Jerusalem.</p> <p>The situation for Palestinians within Jerusalem is complicated. Within Israel and the Palestinian Territories, there are roughly four types of status Palestinians can hold. Israeli-Arabs \u2013 also called Palestinian citizens of Israel \u2013 make up about 20% of Israel\u2019s nine million citizens and are those who remained inside Israel following the 1948 war. They have a different status from Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem: the latter can move freely inside Jerusalem and Israel, but remain stateless and must continue to live in Jerusalem to maintain their residency. Then there are the 2.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, who are under the control of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority, and in 1.9 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who are ruled by militant group Hamas. West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians cannot travel inside Israel without an Israeli permit and hold Palestinian identity cards.</p> <p>Of these four Palestinian statuses, two \u2013 Palestinian citizens of Israel and east Jerusalem residents \u2013 feel the impact of Jerusalem\u2019s housing dynamics.<br></p> <p>Given this labyrinthine question of status, as well as the history and ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the two populations are often fearful of mingling. Palestinian suicide bombers in the mid-2000s brought everyday life in west Jerusalem to a halt, and since 2015 there have been waves of Palestinian stabbings. Many Israelis describe Jerusalem as the kind of city where the three main communities \u2013 Jewish Israelis, Palestinians, and ultra-religious Jews \u2013 prefer to live separately. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9266a0cbb47134f2a69d5e529cca78888e2b2352\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9266a0cbb47134f2a69d5e529cca78888e2b2352/0_53_4224_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the city\u2019s population divided.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the city\u2019s population divided.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Israeli public was elated when US president Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/death-division-and-denial-as-us-embassy-opens-in-jerusalem\">moved the American Embassy</a> from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year, effectively endorsing Israel\u2019s position that Jerusalem is its undivided capital.

Uduny and four others co-founded the group a decade ago to get away from the problems of unemployment and poverty in the slum. This small plot was once wasteland, a spot for young people to hide and take drugs, Uduny says.</p> <p>They began by keeping chickens, and in 2014 acquired three dairy goats through a grant from a government initiative to help eradicate food poverty in slums.

      "bodyText": "In a space of less than an eighth of an acre in Huruma, a small informal settlement in north-east Nairobi, is a tiny farm housing 19 goats and 286 birds \u2013 chickens, doves and guineafowl. Pens and cages have been cobbled together with discarded wood and corrugated iron. Goats hop from a pen curious to see their new visitors, passing day-old chicks who squeak from inside a cage. There\u2019s a goat skin drying out in the sun as a bunch of flies swarm above it. Moments of calm can only be found inside the group\u2019s office, where a small goat sits quietly under a chair. Her name is Olivia, and she is blind. This farm, as small and chaotic as it is, is a lifeline for Kevin Uduny and the rest of the Huruma Town Youth Group (HTYG) who manage it. Uduny and four others co-founded the group a decade ago to get away from the problems of unemployment and poverty in the slum. This small plot was once wasteland, a spot for young people to hide and take drugs, Uduny says. They began by keeping chickens, and in 2014 acquired three dairy goats through a grant from a government initiative to help eradicate food poverty in slums. The project (though not the size of the farm) has grown from there. Now, eight members of the youth group work here, along with young kids from the area who volunteer. Urban farming has become a vital resource for Kenyans living in areas with high levels of food insecurity. Almost half of Nairobi\u2019s citizens are malnourished, and an estimated 73% of Nairobi\u2019s slum population live below the poverty line. \u201cAs a young person I regret being born in Kenya.

      "body": "<p>As the so-called Techlash gains pace and polemics on the downsides of the internet flood the book market, one omission seems to recur time and again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/20/facebook-google-antitrust-laws-gilded-age\" title=\"\">Facebook, Google, Amazon</a> and the rest are too often written about as if their arrival in our lives started a new phase of history, rather than as corporations that have prospered thanks to an economic and cultural environment established in the days when platforms were things used by trains. To truly understand the revolutions in politics, culture and human behaviour these giants have accelerated, you need to start not some time in the last 15 or so years, but in the 1980s.</p> <p>Early in that decade, the first arrival of digital technology in everyday life was marked by the brief microcomputer boom, which was followed by the marketing of more powerful personal computers. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/10/margaret-thatcher-ronald-reagan-love-affair-churchill-roosevelt\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan</a> were embedding the idea that government should keep its interference in industry and the economy to a minimum. In the US, a new way of thinking replaced the bipartisan belief that monopolies should always be resisted: concentrations of economic power were not a problem as long as they led to lower prices for consumers. And at the same time as old-school class politics was overshadowed, the lingering influence of the 60s counterculture gave the wealthy a new means of smoothing over their power and privilege: talking in vague terms about healing the world, and enthusiastically participating in acts of spectacular philanthropy.</p> <p>If there was one period when all this cohered, it was between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/24/g8.debtrelief\" title=\"\">1984 to 1985: the time of Band Aid and Live Aid</a>, the launch of both Bill Gates\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/from-windows-1-to-windows-10-29-years-of-windows-evolution\" title=\"\">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system and the Apple Macintosh, and the advent of Reagan\u2019s second term as president. And in 1984 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, who would grow up in a country and culture defined by these events and forces, was born; he invented Facebook while he was at Harvard, and made his fortune via an intrusive, seemingly uncontrollable kind of capitalism, sold with the promise of \u201cbringing the world closer together\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2026ba2f8f26907d65ef9cc5b8c5bb1255bddc6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2026ba2f8f26907d65ef9cc5b8c5bb1255bddc6a/0_127_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roger McNamee is a little longer in the tooth. Aged 62, he is old enough to know that the US beat the depression and won the second world war when \u201cwe subordinated the individual to the collective good, and it worked really well\u201d. He knows that the anti-state, libertarian mores that define what we now know as Big Tech were born in the 1980s, and that by the early 21st century, \u201chardly anyone in Silicon Valley knew there had once been a different way of doing things\u201d. Laissez-faire ideas, he says, joined with a bombastic arrogance in the minds of the \u201cbros\u201d who flocked to northern California to make their fortune from the mid 1990s onwards. What they did was founded on cutting-edge technology \u2013 but in terms of its underlying economic ideas, their business represented recently established nostrums being taken to their logical conclusion.</p> <p>This may suggest the perspective of an outsider, but McNamee does not quite fit that description. As a high-profile investor in tech businesses, he was co-founder of Elevation Partners, a private equity firm established with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/aug/16/u2-bono-facebook-stake\" title=\"\">U2 frontman Paul \u201cBono\u201d Hewson</a>, the very embodiment of the 80s\u2019 uneasy mixture of profit and philanthropy. In 2010, the firm acquired 1% of Facebook for $90m, but McNamee had already put money into the company, become a source of occasional advice for its founder, and been key in the appointment as chief operating officer of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/22/facebook-sheryl-sandbrook-faces-axe\" title=\"\"> Sheryl Sandberg</a>, the former Bill Clinton administration insider who brought business acumen and political connections to Zuckerberg\u2019s inner circle. But now McNamee has come to the conclusion that what he helped bring about is a blend of hubris and dysfunction: <em>Zucked</em> is partly the story of his early enthusiasm giving way to mounting alarm at Facebook\u2019s failure to match its power with responsibility, and what he has tried to do about it.</p> <p>It is an unevenly told tale. McNamee wants readers to think of him as a player in the events he describes, but the text regularly has a sense of things viewed from too great a distance. That said, he knows enough about Facebook and its contexts to get to the heart of what its presence in our lives means for the world, and is bracingly blunt about the company\u2019s threat to the basic tenets of democracy, and his own awakening to its dangers. In early passages about the initial occasions when he met Zuckerberg, he writes of a man then aged 22 appearing \u201cconsistently mature and responsible\u201d, and \u201cremarkably grown-up for his age\u201d. He goes on: \u201cI liked Zuck. I liked his team. I liked Facebook.\u201d But by the time of the 2016 presidential election, everything had changed. In a memo to Zuckerberg and Sandberg, McNamee was blunt: \u201cI am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed.\u201d And he had a keen sense of what had gone wrong, summarised here in the kind of aphoristic phrase for which he clearly has a talent: \u201cFacebook has managed to connect 2.2 billion people and drive them apart at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The account of how this played out is now familiar, and ends with the election and subsequent revelation that 126 million Facebook users were exposed to messages authored in Russia. McNamee deals with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-scandal-the-biggest-revelations-so-far\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, and how it highlighted Facebook\u2019s blithe attitude to its users\u2019 personal data (though he really should have mentioned the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose curiosity and resilience ensured that the story broke, and Facebook was called to account).

And as all these things endlessly increased, the company simply sped on. \u201cIn the world of growth hacking, users are a metric, not people,\u201d McNamee writes.

      "bodyText": "As the so-called Techlash gains pace and polemics on the downsides of the internet flood the book market, one omission seems to recur time and again. Facebook, Google, Amazon and the rest are too often written about as if their arrival in our lives started a new phase of history, rather than as corporations that have prospered thanks to an economic and cultural environment established in the days when platforms were things used by trains. To truly understand the revolutions in politics, culture and human behaviour these giants have accelerated, you need to start not some time in the last 15 or so years, but in the 1980s. Early in that decade, the first arrival of digital technology in everyday life was marked by the brief microcomputer boom, which was followed by the marketing of more powerful personal computers. Meanwhile, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were embedding the idea that government should keep its interference in industry and the economy to a minimum. In the US, a new way of thinking replaced the bipartisan belief that monopolies should always be resisted: concentrations of economic power were not a problem as long as they led to lower prices for consumers. And at the same time as old-school class politics was overshadowed, the lingering influence of the 60s counterculture gave the wealthy a new means of smoothing over their power and privilege: talking in vague terms about healing the world, and enthusiastically participating in acts of spectacular philanthropy. If there was one period when all this cohered, it was between 1984 to 1985: the time of Band Aid and Live Aid, the launch of both Bill Gates\u2019s Microsoft Windows operating system and the Apple Macintosh, and the advent of Reagan\u2019s second term as president. And in 1984 Mark Zuckerberg, who would grow up in a country and culture defined by these events and forces, was born; he invented Facebook while he was at Harvard, and made his fortune via an intrusive, seemingly uncontrollable kind of capitalism, sold with the promise of \u201cbringing the world closer together\u201d. Roger McNamee is a little longer in the tooth. Aged 62, he is old enough to know that the US beat the depression and won the second world war when \u201cwe subordinated the individual to the collective good, and it worked really well\u201d. He knows that the anti-state, libertarian mores that define what we now know as Big Tech were born in the 1980s, and that by the early 21st century, \u201chardly anyone in Silicon Valley knew there had once been a different way of doing things\u201d. Laissez-faire ideas, he says, joined with a bombastic arrogance in the minds of the \u201cbros\u201d who flocked to northern California to make their fortune from the mid 1990s onwards. What they did was founded on cutting-edge technology \u2013 but in terms of its underlying economic ideas, their business represented recently established nostrums being taken to their logical conclusion. This may suggest the perspective of an outsider, but McNamee does not quite fit that description. As a high-profile investor in tech businesses, he was co-founder of Elevation Partners, a private equity firm established with U2 frontman Paul \u201cBono\u201d Hewson, the very embodiment of the 80s\u2019 uneasy mixture of profit and philanthropy. In 2010, the firm acquired 1% of Facebook for $90m, but McNamee had already put money into the company, become a source of occasional advice for its founder, and been key in the appointment as chief operating officer of Sheryl Sandberg, the former Bill Clinton administration insider who brought business acumen and political connections to Zuckerberg\u2019s inner circle. But now McNamee has come to the conclusion that what he helped bring about is a blend of hubris and dysfunction: Zucked is partly the story of his early enthusiasm giving way to mounting alarm at Facebook\u2019s failure to match its power with responsibility, and what he has tried to do about it. It is an unevenly told tale. McNamee wants readers to think of him as a player in the events he describes, but the text regularly has a sense of things viewed from too great a distance. That said, he knows enough about Facebook and its contexts to get to the heart of what its presence in our lives means for the world, and is bracingly blunt about the company\u2019s threat to the basic tenets of democracy, and his own awakening to its dangers. In early passages about the initial occasions when he met Zuckerberg, he writes of a man then aged 22 appearing \u201cconsistently mature and responsible\u201d, and \u201cremarkably grown-up for his age\u201d. He goes on: \u201cI liked Zuck. I liked his team. I liked Facebook.\u201d But by the time of the 2016 presidential election, everything had changed. In a memo to Zuckerberg and Sandberg, McNamee was blunt: \u201cI am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed.\u201d And he had a keen sense of what had gone wrong, summarised here in the kind of aphoristic phrase for which he clearly has a talent: \u201cFacebook has managed to connect 2.2 billion people and drive them apart at the same time.\u201d The account of how this played out is now familiar, and ends with the election and subsequent revelation that 126 million Facebook users were exposed to messages authored in Russia. McNamee deals with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and how it highlighted Facebook\u2019s blithe attitude to its users\u2019 personal data (though he really should have mentioned the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose curiosity and resilience ensured that the story broke, and Facebook was called to account). But some of his best material is about the elements of Facebook\u2019s organisation and culture that created the mess, and the work he has done trying to alert powerful people to the need for action. Once Zuckerberg realised his creation was eating the world, he and his colleagues did what \u201cbros\u201d do, and embraced a mindset known as \u201cgrowth hacking\u201d, whereby what mattered was \u201cincreasing user count, time on site, and revenue\u201d: unrestrained capitalism, in other words. And as all these things endlessly increased, the company simply sped on. \u201cIn the world of growth hacking, users are a metric, not people,\u201d McNamee writes. As Facebook expanded, he says, \u201cit is highly unlikely that civic responsibility ever came up.\u201d If Facebook looks like a borderline autocracy (Zuckerberg controls around 60% of the company\u2019s voting shares, because his stock has a \u201cclass B\u201d status that gives him unchallengeable power), that is partly because it is different from comparable companies in one crucial sense: the simplicity of its business model. \u201cThe core platform consists of a product and a monetisation scheme,\u201d McNamee points out, which \u201cenables Facebook to centralise its decision making.

The government told the energy regulator, Ofgem, to set the cap because ministers argued people on SVTs were being ripped off by big energy firms capitalising on consumer loyalty. The limit is not an absolute one but the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge. There is a separate cap for 4m homes on prepayment meters.</p>\n    <p><b>Does that mean energy bills will never go up?</b></p>\n    <p>No. It is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/23/energy-prices-tory-cap-miliband-freeze\">a freeze</a>, it is a movable cap. The energy cap has fallen twice since it was put in place because the wholesale price of electricity and gas, the biggest variable influencing prices, have fallen. But if energy market prices climb higher, the cap would move higher, too. Homes may also face higher bills if they use more energy because the cap applies to the price of each unit of energy - not the whole bill.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Is there any way to avoid the increase?</b></p>\n    <p>Yes. Homes can save hundreds of pounds a year by spending a few minutes on one of the many comparison sites, or sign up to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/02/energy-bills-will-these-sites-save-you-a-flipping-fortune\">auto-switching service</a>, and move to a cheaper tariff, either with your existing supplier or a rival one. Fixed tariffs, which are not covered by the cap, are almost always much cheaper than SVTs, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/22/third-dual-fuel-tariffs-break-government-price-cap\">there are exceptions</a>, so watch out. Several smaller suppliers also offer good customer service and variable tariffs that are well below the cap.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Could bills fall again?</b></p>\n    <p>Maybe. Energy market experts believe gas and electricity wholesale prices will remain low through 2020 because energy demand is lower than normal because of the Covid-19 crisis. But wholesale costs are not the only factor in setting the level of the cap. Ofgem, the regulator, includes the cost of using energy networks and paying for government policies, too. These costs are expected to keep rising.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Together, the increases in the two caps will add a collective \u00a31.71bn to consumer bills, according to the auto-switching site Look After My Bills.</p> \n<p>Ofgem insisted consumers were paying a fair price for their energy despite the increases. The regulator said it had to raise the caps because wholesale costs facing energy firms had increased by 17% and other costs had climbed, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can assure these customers that they remain protected from being overcharged for their energy and that these increases are only due to actual rises in energy costs, rather than excess charges from supplier profiteering,\u201d the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Dermot Nolan, said.</p> \n<p>The regulator said its analysis suggested without the cap people would be \u201cpaying significantly more even after the increase\u201d of the cap in April.</p> \n<p>The government said the higher caps reflected sharp increases in electricity and gas costs.</p> \n<p>Claire Perry, the energy minister, said: \u201cWe were clear when we introduced the cap that prices can go up but also down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, a consumer group that backs the cap, said: \u201cAs unwelcome as this news is, it\u2019s likely that prices would be higher still without the cap and there are steps people can take to ease the strain on their bills.\u201d</p> \n<p>Industry body Energy UK said suppliers of all sizes were facing \u201cdrastically rising costs\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, there are signs of some relief on the horizon for consumers later this year.</p> \n<p>Nolan told The Guardian wholesale costs had begun to fall recently, a trend which could see the regulator announce a lower cap in August, to take effect from October.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they [wholesale costs] do indeed continue to fall\u2026 there is a reasonable chance of a price decrease in October,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Energy analysts Cornwall Insight said that, based on wholesale prices it had seen in January, households could expect a \u00a350 decrease in the cap in October.</p> \n<p>One of the big six companies, npower, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/31/npower-to-cut-900-jobs-predicts-financial-losses-2019-big-six-energy\">blamed 900 job cuts on the cap and competition</a>.

      "bodyText": "Around 15m households will see their energy bills increase by more than \u00a3100 a year from April after the regulator Ofgem said it was lifting two price caps because of rising wholesale costs. Big energy suppliers are expected to increase their prices by \u00a3117 for 11m customers on default tariffs to a new ceiling of \u00a31,254 a year for a home with typical use, leaving many consumers paying more for their electricity and gas than before the flagship policy took effect on 1 January. Consumer groups said the rise was \u201ceye-watering\u201d and would be a shock for people who thought the cap would stop their bills from rising. The significant increase, which wipes out the average saving of \u00a376 from the cap, will be embarrassing for ministers, who promised that people would save money under the flagship policy. The 10% rise is on a par with the worst by the big six energy suppliers over the past two years, many of which the government claimed were unjustified. Comparison sites, which are opposed to the cap, branded the increase \u201cbrutal\u201d, \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d and the \u201cworst possible start for the energy cap\u201d. Ofgem also announced a rise of \u00a3106 a year to \u00a31,242 for a further 4m households on prepayment meters, who are typically more vulnerable customers. Together, the increases in the two caps will add a collective \u00a31.71bn to consumer bills, according to the auto-switching site Look After My Bills. Ofgem insisted consumers were paying a fair price for their energy despite the increases. The regulator said it had to raise the caps because wholesale costs facing energy firms had increased by 17% and other costs had climbed, too. \u201cWe can assure these customers that they remain protected from being overcharged for their energy and that these increases are only due to actual rises in energy costs, rather than excess charges from supplier profiteering,\u201d the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Dermot Nolan, said. The regulator said its analysis suggested without the cap people would be \u201cpaying significantly more even after the increase\u201d of the cap in April. The government said the higher caps reflected sharp increases in electricity and gas costs. Claire Perry, the energy minister, said: \u201cWe were clear when we introduced the cap that prices can go up but also down.\u201d Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, a consumer group that backs the cap, said: \u201cAs unwelcome as this news is, it\u2019s likely that prices would be higher still without the cap and there are steps people can take to ease the strain on their bills.\u201d Industry body Energy UK said suppliers of all sizes were facing \u201cdrastically rising costs\u201d. However, there are signs of some relief on the horizon for consumers later this year. Nolan told The Guardian wholesale costs had begun to fall recently, a trend which could see the regulator announce a lower cap in August, to take effect from October. \u201cIf they [wholesale costs] do indeed continue to fall\u2026 there is a reasonable chance of a price decrease in October,\u201d he said. Energy analysts Cornwall Insight said that, based on wholesale prices it had seen in January, households could expect a \u00a350 decrease in the cap in October. One of the big six companies, npower, last week blamed 900 job cuts on the cap and competition. Nolan said he was disappointed the big six had priced so close to the initial cap but suggested smaller, cheaper suppliers would \u201ccontinue to grow\u201d as a result.",

When we started to explore the platform, it was the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/voiceflowgroup/\">community</a> that drew me in. There were lots of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbqUIYQ7J2rS6C_nk4cNTxQ\">videos</a> and <a href=\"https://university.getvoiceflow.com/\">documentation</a> to explain how I could create functional user flows.

We were pleased by how quickly we were able to complete the port, and the ability to test the prototype through an Amazon developer account enabled the potential to conduct future user testing without coding.</p> <p>But we wanted to test Voiceflow further and give it a real challenge, so next we tried to reproduce an Alexa skill with more technical components like variables, API requests and even permissions for the user\u2019s phone number.</p> <p>Impressed with the capabilities, we decided to try integrating dynamic prototyping into our workflow for the team\u2019s next project.<br><br><strong>Room for improvement<br></strong>Voiceflow has really helped us to imagine what these devices and platforms are capable of more quickly than a traditional digital or paper workflow. The simple act of connecting blocks and variables while seeing the real outcomes breeds confidence that the team is building a shared understanding of the concept. While the tool has been very helpful, there are areas it could improve on. Here are a few examples:<br><br>We\u2019d like to see better sharing options and tools for collaboration. At the moment, you can create and upload a prototype to the Amazon developer console, but only the account owner can use it. So, for example, you can\u2019t simply hand the prototype to a UX researcher and let them carry out a testing session.</p> <ul> <li><p>We\u2019d like to see Google Assistant integration with support for Google\u2019s unique SSML tags, such as the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/ssml#par\">parallel tag</a>. This would really help us design and understand the nuanced differences between the two platforms.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Better tools for visual and multimodal design. Currently we have simple \u201ccard\u201d and \u201cdisplay access for <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-presentation-language/apl-overview.html\">APL</a>, but most of it needs to be hand-coded in JSON and for a designer that isn\u2019t an ideal solution.<br></p></li> <li><p>Better return journey support plus an in-house database solution. This would allow us to create more powerful interactive prototypes.</p></li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, we are still producing final user journeys in a more traditional format, but we are doing so with much shorter feedback cycles and more confidence that the concept is being communicated effectively. We highly recommend trying out more dynamic prototyping tools to help speed up and improve your workflow. There are a number of other interesting tools out there, like <a href=\"https://www.invocable.com/\">Invocable</a>, <a href=\"http://twinery.org/\">Twine</a> and others. We suggest your team try them all and figure out which one works for you.<br><br>We think these solutions are a great addition to the landscape and very much look forward to see more tools like this to enable the design process to voice-enabled digital assistants.</p> <p><em>Find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/nov/06/guardian-voice-lab-introduction\">Voice Lab\u2019s mission</a> or get in touch at voicelab@theguardian.com.</em></p>",

But we wanted to test Voiceflow further and give it a real challenge, so next we tried to reproduce an Alexa skill with more technical components like variables, API requests and even permissions for the user\u2019s phone number. Impressed with the capabilities, we decided to try integrating dynamic prototyping into our workflow for the team\u2019s next project. Room for improvement Voiceflow has really helped us to imagine what these devices and platforms are capable of more quickly than a traditional digital or paper workflow. The simple act of connecting blocks and variables while seeing the real outcomes breeds confidence that the team is building a shared understanding of the concept. While the tool has been very helpful, there are areas it could improve on. Here are a few examples: We\u2019d like to see better sharing options and tools for collaboration. At the moment, you can create and upload a prototype to the Amazon developer console, but only the account owner can use it. So, for example, you can\u2019t simply hand the prototype to a UX researcher and let them carry out a testing session. We\u2019d like to see Google Assistant integration with support for Google\u2019s unique SSML tags, such as the parallel tag. This would really help us design and understand the nuanced differences between the two platforms. Better tools for visual and multimodal design. Currently we have simple \u201ccard\u201d and \u201cdisplay access for APL, but most of it needs to be hand-coded in JSON and for a designer that isn\u2019t an ideal solution. Better return journey support plus an in-house database solution. This would allow us to create more powerful interactive prototypes. Ultimately, we are still producing final user journeys in a more traditional format, but we are doing so with much shorter feedback cycles and more confidence that the concept is being communicated effectively. We highly recommend trying out more dynamic prototyping tools to help speed up and improve your workflow. There are a number of other interesting tools out there, like Invocable, Twine and others. We suggest your team try them all and figure out which one works for you. We think these solutions are a great addition to the landscape and very much look forward to see more tools like this to enable the design process to voice-enabled digital assistants.

No one can afford a \u201creal\u201d ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 \u201cbling rings\u201d Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says \u201cI do\u201d to.</p> <p>I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting divorced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a \u00a320 wedding ring from Argos; I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won\u2019t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that \u201cwho even are you?\u201d look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes \u2013 unless it were, I don\u2019t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.</p> <p>But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you\u2019ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don\u2019t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You\u2019ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That\u2019s not to say a ring doesn\u2019t bring potential negative externalities, since it\u2019s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, \u201cI can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is\u201d, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.</p> <p>Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg\u2019s Beautiful is playing because you didn\u2019t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you\u2019re saying, \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine, except you\u2019ve misspelled \u2018Southwark\u2019, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie\u201d, that\u2019s the ring you\u2019re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea; it\u2019s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with \u201cPoundland\u201d under \u201cWhere did you get your beautiful ring?\u201d, so you don\u2019t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won\u2019t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical.</p>",

Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting divorced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a \u00a320 wedding ring from Argos; I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won\u2019t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that \u201cwho even are you?\u201d look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes \u2013 unless it were, I don\u2019t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog. But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you\u2019ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don\u2019t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You\u2019ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That\u2019s not to say a ring doesn\u2019t bring potential negative externalities, since it\u2019s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, \u201cI can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is\u201d, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap. Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg\u2019s Beautiful is playing because you didn\u2019t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you\u2019re saying, \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine, except you\u2019ve misspelled \u2018Southwark\u2019, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie\u201d, that\u2019s the ring you\u2019re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring. This doesn\u2019t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea; it\u2019s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with \u201cPoundland\u201d under \u201cWhere did you get your beautiful ring?\u201d, so you don\u2019t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won\u2019t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical.",

While he was in prison, Congress had radically expanded the types of crimes that could be used as grounds for deportation, and had made these changes to the law retroactive. So he fought another court battle, to secure his right to remain in the United States, which reinforced his commitment to criminal justice activism. In 2015, he was granted a pardon, and two years later he became a naturalized US citizen.</p> <p>As a grassroots activist and youth organizer, Zheng is focused on the impacts of criminalization and immigration enforcement on Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities. He works across racial and ethnic lines to bring Asian diaspora and immigrant experience into a dialogue on mass incarceration that is often devoid of such voices. He also advocates for solidarity between Asian Americans and African Americans, maintaining that a unified resistance is critical in the struggle against structural racism and pointing to the role played by the prison system and police brutality in aggravating tensions between minority groups. It is crucial, he says, for API communities to reach out to black communities to ask: \u201cHow can we be a better ally to you, so we can create more solidarity when we come together to fight for criminal justice and comprehensive immigration reform?\u201d</p> <h2>When did you begin to come into political consciousness and what inspired your interest in education?</h2> <p>It was through the prison system that I actually was able to learn how to read and write and think critically. But I was just learning about everybody else\u2019s history \u2013 about American history, European history and Latin [American] history. Nobody really learns about Asian American history or south-east Asian history. So I made a proposal to one of the coordinators at the college program. I said: \u201cHey, can we have some elective courses on Asian American literature and studies?\u201d [Myself and several inmates] put it in the form of a proposal. Then we added on other demands, like getting the administration to create a student body and a faculty body, so the students could have an opportunity to express what they wanted to learn and the faculty could decide what to teach. Four people signed the proposal, three Asian Americans and a Jewish brother. And one by one, they made up different reasons to lock us up.</p> <p>They put the three Asians in solitary. During the investigation, they took all our paperwork, all the books that we were reading, and combed through everything that we wrote. I ended up spending 11 months in solitary. We filed a civil rights lawsuit against them, and eventually they settled the case. It was during that process that my peer organization started, the Asian Prisoner Support Committee [co-founded with Viet Mike Ngo and Rico Riemedio \u2013 who with Zheng were known as the \u201cSan Quentin Three\u201d]. The Asian American community had started a movement in the Bay Area to support me and my friends, and it was during that time that I was able to really see how movement-building works, and how powerful the movement could be.</p> <h2>How do you feel about the prison system, as an institution, now? How do detention, deportation and criminalization intersect?</h2> <p>I feel that we should abolish the prison system and the prison-industrial complex. When slavery of African Americans was abolished through the 13th amendment, it was specifically about slavery not being allowed except when [the person] has committed a crime. The whole premise of the 13th amendment is about putting in place a system to continue to enslave African Americans. They put in specific language to make sure that people of color would continue to be exploited as free labor. Whenever you\u2019re in an institution they are able to use you as a commodity, to make money off of your body.</p> <p>[Often] people look at me as a token, as a success story, and use that as a way to say: \u201cOh, look at Eddy. Eddy became so successful, even though he committed a crime. Prison did him some good. That\u2019s why we need the prison system, so we can create opportunities for people to learn.\u201d That type of rhetoric is really the achilles heel of criminal justice reform. [Instead], focus on the lack of opportunity, or the barriers, that were created for the African American community, and this infrastructure [that is] disempowering groups of people. We don\u2019t have to go to prison to become successful or to learn the way. There are holistic ways of healing, there are other ways of engaging individuals if, as a country, or as citizens of this earth, we are invested in that.</p> <p>The prison-industrial complex and the Department of Homeland Security, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) \u2013 essentially they\u2019re the same apparatus, the same system that was set up to target and discriminate against people of color, as well as refugees and immigrants. It\u2019s the same for-profit system that exploits all the poor and sick people who are living in unstable conditions, who have experienced intergenerational trauma in a variety of ways. If you are a US citizen [convicted of a crime, you\u2019re typically] let out, or put on parole or probation. But if you\u2019re not a citizen of the US then you\u2019re just automatically detained and ordered for deportation. Once you\u2019re in detention, you have to go through the whole process of proving why you\u2019re not a threat to society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/voter-suppression-african-american-james-madison-slavery\">Voter suppression carries slavery's three-fifths clause into the present</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Talk about your focus on cross-racial community organizing and solidarity, and the role of the API community in broader discussions of racial divisions in this country.</h2> <p>As a result of [US] foreign policies, \u201cless desirable\u201d groups of people are displaced to different poverty- and violence-stricken areas.

      "bodyText": "Why is Theresa May on an EU diplomatic charm offensive? After MPs passed the Brady amendment last week calling for the Irish backstop to be replaced with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, the prime minister pledged to renegotiate with Brussels in an effort to secure the changes she said parliament had demanded. Since then, officials and ministers have been working up potential proposals in three areas in particular: an exit mechanism; an end date; and the technology-based alternatives favoured by many Brexiters. The prime minister will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, for the first time since her deal was rejected and test the appetite for the kind of legally binding change she says she needs to secure a majority. Does she have a specific proposal? Not yet. Downing Street says officials are working urgently on all three proposals. Daily meetings are being held with the Tory MPs behind the so-called Malthouse compromise, which focuses on technological solutions. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has been working on the other two approaches: an exit clause or a time limit. When Theresa May flies into town on Thursday insisting all three options are still in play, EU officials could be forgiven for thinking the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, was right when he said the phrase \u201calternative arrangements\u201d \u201ccan mean whatever you want them to mean\u201d. She may want to test the potential support for different options, despite senior figures repeatedly insisting the 585-page withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. Is it all about the backstop? No. The government is also working on ways of winning over another group of potential supporters for a tweaked version of May\u2019s deal: Labour MPs. Several Labour MPs have made clear they could not support another referendum and might consider backing a deal, if the government could offer stronger reassurances on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. May and her ministers have met union leaders and MPs in recent days and are drawing up proposals they hope will win over Labour backers already sceptical about a referendum. However, Downing Street believes these are changes that can be achieved through domestic legislation, without having to revisit the Brexit deal. Will there be another \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 next week? It doesn\u2019t look like it. No 10 has said the prime minister will bring back a revised withdrawal agreement for approval by MPs \u201cas soon as possible\u201d but the cabinet has been warned that it is unlikely to be in the next few days. If there is no deal to bring back for approval, the prime minister has promised to table a motion in parliament on 13 February, which MPs could then amend. That was a demand of senior Conservatives, including from within cabinet, who were anxious to avoid no deal, and were threatening to back the Cooper-Boles amendment which would have empowered MPs to decide the next steps, including requesting an extension to article 50. Another such amendment could be voted on next week, or MPs may decide to give the prime minister time to play out her negotiating strategy in Brussels first. Certainly, supporters of a second referendum are again expected to stay their hand. What if she fails to win the support of parliament in another meaningful vote? May\u2019s deal was rejected by an overwhelming majority of 230 last month. She then managed to clinch a narrow victory in the vote on the Brady amendment, but with the more hard-nosed members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) saying even changes to the backstop might not be enough to win them over, there is no guarantee she could scrape a deal through parliament even if Brussels caves in. If a second attempt failed, she could still come back again, though it would surely be clear by that point that backstop tweaks would not be sufficient to get her over the line.

In a letter to the PM, Corbyn set out legally binding commitments including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/corbyn-lays-out-labours-terms-for-backing-may-on-brexit\">close alignment with the single market</a>; keeping UK rights and protections in line with the EU; future UK participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreements on future security arrangements, such as the European arrest warrant. \u201cWe do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response,\u201d writes Corbyn, arguing that Labour believes its proposals would be acceptable to the EU.</p> \n<p>May will arrive in Brussels with Donald Tusk\u2019s warning of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-in-hell-for-those-who-backed-brexit-without-plan\">\u201cspecial place in hell\u201d</a> for Brexit\u2019s cheerleaders still echoing off the walls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0b7f0361-5b22-4c25-a7ba-1d5adc4edbc2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2-Dx4Rnl5Og?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has stoked the flames by tweeting: \u201cWell, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to divide hell.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Antisemitic abuse up, says monitor \u2013 </strong>Jewish community leaders and politicians have condemned a third successive year with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/07/antisemitic-incidents-uk-record-high-third-year-in-row-community-security-trust\">record number of antisemitic incidents</a> in the UK. In 2018 there were 1,652 incidents logged by the Community Security Trust, a 16% increase on 2017. It said the more than 100 cases a month indicated a general atmosphere of intolerance and prejudice.

As Theresa May heads to Brussels today, Jeremy Corbyn has offered the backing of Labour for her Brexit deal if she supports a permanent customs union with the EU. In a letter to the PM, Corbyn set out legally binding commitments including close alignment with the single market; keeping UK rights and protections in line with the EU; future UK participation in EU agencies and funding programmes; and agreements on future security arrangements, such as the European arrest warrant. \u201cWe do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response,\u201d writes Corbyn, arguing that Labour believes its proposals would be acceptable to the EU. May will arrive in Brussels with Donald Tusk\u2019s warning of a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for Brexit\u2019s cheerleaders still echoing off the walls. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has stoked the flames by tweeting: \u201cWell, I doubt Lucifer would welcome them, as after what they did to Britain, they would even manage to divide hell.\u201d * * * Antisemitic abuse up, says monitor \u2013 Jewish community leaders and politicians have condemned a third successive year with a record number of antisemitic incidents in the UK. In 2018 there were 1,652 incidents logged by the Community Security Trust, a 16% increase on 2017. It said the more than 100 cases a month indicated a general atmosphere of intolerance and prejudice. However, there were also spikes related to events in Gaza and the argument over antisemitism in the Labour party. In total there were 173 incidents recorded that explicitly showed anti-Israel motivation alongside antisemitism, while the most common type of incident involved verbal antisemitic abuse. There was a fall of 17% in the number of violent antisemitic assaults. * * * No screen at bedtime \u2013 Children should not be using phones and other devices in their bedrooms or at meals, the UK\u2019s chief medical officers have said, as they launch official guidance for managing screen time.

Watch this chilling interview carefully and you will see how, by deliberately not reacting to Morgan and refusing to acknowledge his victims as human beings, Giles never lets the mask drop. No empathy, no palpable remorse.

      "bodyText": "The Nationals leader Michael McCormack has made his first visit to Menindee since the ecological disaster which led to the death of up to a million fish, claiming \u201cwe\u2019re all experts in hindsight\u201d. The deputy prime minister visited the fish-kill ground-zero site with local Nationals MP Mark Coulton, who was also making his first visit since the mass death was reported early last month. McCormack, who attempted to limit the water returned to the environment even further in the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin plan, calling it an \u201cassault on regional Australia\u201d, and had earlier prescribed the mass deaths to \u201cit just hasn\u2019t rained\u201d, told reporters \u201cwe\u2019re all experts in hindsight\u201d when asked if the river could have been managed better. \u201cThe fact is it hasn\u2019t rained in some catchments for seven long years,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody will have a different opinion on what should or shouldn\u2019t have been done \u2013 the fact is the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, with the CEO, Phillip Glyde, he\u2019s putting into place what the Water Act of 2007 asked him. \u201cThe authority is an independent statutory body, it\u2019s doing what is legislated and been passed in a bipartisan way between all the states and the commonwealth.\u201d A royal commission ordered by the former South Australian Labor government into issues with the Murray-Darling River at its end found gross maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in creating and administering the basin plan had led to the river system\u2019s poor health. The senior counsel to the royal commission, Richard Beasley, has subsequently said politics, not science, dictated how the Murray-Darling Basin plan was implemented, which led to irrigators receiving too much water at the expense of the environment. McCormack, who has followed his predecessor\u2019s lead in defending irrigators in the wake of the fish kill, said the blame pointed at cotton and rice farmers was \u201cnot entirely fair\u201d. \u201cThe fact is in the Cubby Station area there\u2019s only been 300 hectares of cotton grown and they\u2019re growing 1% of cotton across the basin that they could in a generally good season. \u201cThey\u2019ve had no water allocations \u2013 the fact is it is dry and governments can\u2019t make it rain. If we could, we could. It\u2019s a dire situation. \u201cIt will be solved through better water sharing access and we appreciate that. That is why the federal government has asked to have a chair of an independent panel which will look at the fish kill, to look at other provisions of the plan and he will report back to government, back to the agriculture and water resources minister federally, David Littleproud, by 31 March. \u201cWe will take action on his recommendations. I know there are other inquiries going on as well. He also said the government was doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d, acknowledging it was \u201ca crisis\u201d. \u201cMark and I acknowledge that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing everything we can. Mark, as a good, responsible, local member, has turned up today. We have, in good faith listened to the passion and seen the determination and we\u2019ve heard about the devastation that this fish kill incident has caused.\u201d Asked if he would be visiting other towns in the region which are now running out of water, McCormack said he heard from people \u201cin Walgett and other parts\u201d, but made a point of mentioning his workload. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased I have such a good local member, Mark, who is getting out and about in his region and reporting back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is it\u2019s a big nation. You know, I\u2019m dealing with fires in Tasmania, I\u2019m also, you know, hearing about the devastation of the floods in Townsville and Julia Creek and Queensland. \u201cSo, as the deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, it\u2019s a very big nation. When asked about climate change, McCormack pivoted to attack Labor over energy policy differences. \u201cWe are looking at climate, of course, climate has been changing since year dot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more than meeting our emissions targets. We don\u2019t want to deindustrialise Australia, or stop farmers from their agricultural pursuits. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is what the Greens and Bill Shorten would have us do, and have 45% emissions targets which are unrealistic. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything, apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don\u2019t do manufacturing here and push electricity bills into the unaffordable state.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At 5.55am, Talgarth Road, one of the major arteries into west London, is just beginning to clog up with early rush-hour traffic. A man named Dave, his white van pulled over into a loading bay, is putting up a billboard poster by the side of the carriageway. The previous one was an advert for Calvin Klein featuring the model Lara Stone. Over the course of 20 minutes, Dave covers Stone up, expertly pasting rectangles of paper over her, using a ladder for the high ones, then sweeping over with his brush.</p> <p>The first rectangle, in the top left corner, contains a headshot of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the beginning of his Twitter handle. As Dave lines up edges, pastes and brushes, and Stone disappears, a quote emerges from Rees-Mogg. This one wasn\u2019t a tweet; he said it in parliament. \u201cWe could have two referendums. As it happens, it might make more sense to have a second referendum after the renegotiation is completed.\u201d</p> <p>There are three other men here, dressed in hoodies, lumberjack shirts and beanies, lurking around and admiring the work. Their work \u2013 because Richard, Adam and Chris are three of the four key people behind Led By Donkeys, the remainer guerrilla activists highlighting the hypocrisy and lies of politicians by posting their damning quotes on billboards around the country. Less guerrilla now, actually: they\u2019ve gone legit, this hoarding is paid for. Before, they just took them over. The reason it is going up so early is because that\u2019s when Dave operates, mainly for parking reasons. Still, Richard, Adam and Chris are not their real names; they don\u2019t want to be identified.</p> <p>When Dave \u2013 which as far as I know is his real name, he\u2019s just been employed for the job \u2013 is done and has gone, we retreat from the frontline to a nearby Costa, for coffee and pastries, to warm up and for Richard, Adam and Chris to explain themselves. Long-time friends, they work at management level for NGOs and charities. United by a WhatsApp group, by politics, a dislike for Brexit and a need to do something, they also all have young families, children aged between one and seven. It is hard to combine direct action with feeds, drop-offs, homework and bedtime. Their partners are understanding and supportive, they say. They live in London and Bristol. The fourth member lives in Europe, outside the UK, with his non-British partner and kids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d21220b158e7682b73d8d80a9cd518e8f7c9979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d21220b158e7682b73d8d80a9cd518e8f7c9979/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018great deal\u2019 quote on a billboard in Leeds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018great deal\u2019 quote on a billboard in Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is just about boys having a laugh, isn\u2019t it, or the beginnings of a midlife crisis? \u201cI think there is a midlife crisis but it\u2019s on the part of the nation, not on the part of us as individuals,\u201d says Richard. \u201cBritain is having a post-imperialism mid-, possibly late-life crisis where it\u2019s not quite sure what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s just gone and bought a motorbike and a leather jacket, it\u2019s a midlife crisis called Brexit, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out.\u201d</p> <p>Richard, 44, talks the most, but knows it, and stops to allows the others in. Adam, 43, is quiet and measured, but steely, and the bravest when it comes to climbing ladders. Philosophical Chris, 39, the baby of the group, is not unmodel-like himself, and wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a billboard. Chris came up with their name, after the first world war phrase about soldiers \u2013 lions \u2013 being led to their deaths because of the appalling decisions of British generals. \u201cOften we [the British] have a reputation for being boringly sensible and yet here we are in this unreal moment of chaos and masochism and nobody really knows why we\u2019re doing it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re putting up quotes of these donkeys, these leaders, who are leading us off this precipice, highlighting what brought us to this point. It seemed to make sense.\u201d</p> <p>It all began, as most good ideas do, in the pub. They were talking about the infamous David Cameron tweet \u2013 \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me or chaos with Ed Miliband\u201d \u2013 which was doing the rounds again after Theresa May cancelled the vote on her deal in December. And someone said: why don\u2019t they slap it on a billboard, make it the tweet you can\u2019t delete?</p> <p>The next day, on the WhatsApp group, one of them said they had found someone who would print it out for them. They all agreed: \u201cLet\u2019s just fucking do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74778a9a70729c91af229f3fa030b41a9c6f6b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74778a9a70729c91af229f3fa030b41a9c6f6b2e/0_259_4872_2923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Redwood\u2019s tweet, Leeds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Redwood\u2019s tweet, Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was cheaper to do five, so they cobbled together four more tweets \u2013 from Michael Gove, David Davies, John Redwood and Liam Fox \u2013 not really thinking they\u2019d ever put them up. Initial outlay was about 200 quid, plus \u00a390 on a ladder from B&amp;Q. </p> <p>There are no how-to-put-up-a-billboard tutorials on YouTube. The nearest they found was a timelapse video by a man promoting his own poster business. There was a delay on the first night because Richard\u2019s daughter wouldn\u2019t go to sleep, but eventually, one evening in January, they found themselves by the A10 in north London, Adam up the ladder covered in wallpaper paste, bits of paper flapping all over the place, Cameron\u2019s face wrapped around his own head \u2026 Finally, after an hour and a half, it was up.</p> <p>That first one was on top of an ad for Halifax. So they stole the space? \u201cWe temporarily borrowed advertising real estate from a company that could afford to lend it to us,\u201d Richard clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily ask permission but it was public service and therefore totally justified.\u201d They would later borrow from Ford and McDonald\u2019s, too.</p> <p>And it felt good. \u201cThere is the thing about taking it out of the digital zone,\u201d says Adam. \u201cThe actual tangible visceral nature of having these things up on the street and having these guys held to account really works, I think. When we saw that we had that moment of: hold on, this is a thing, it could work.\u201d</p> <p>They got to the pub for last orders (dry January went out of the window). The next morning they tweeted it, someone picked it up and retweeted it, they had 1,000 followers, the Guardian\u2019s Marina Hyde retweeted it, they had 2,000, then 3,000 (now they have 43.6k).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1039b311863827ddad92d84d763e1f79408aa3e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1039b311863827ddad92d84d763e1f79408aa3e3/0_0_1038_623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab\u2019s quote, Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab\u2019s quote, Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Led By Donkeys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no point preaching to the converted, though; they knew they had to get out of London and into leave areas. Sunderland would have been hard when you\u2019ve got kids that wake up at 4.30am, not to mention day jobs. But they took Michael Gove to Romford. And then there was Dover, which felt right because of its central place in the drama, with Dominic Raab producing choice quotes. \u201cThat fucker was going up in Dover even if we got nicked,\u201d says Richard, who holds a special place in his whatever the opposite of heart is (spleen?) for Raab.</p> <p>They talk about Dover the way a band might talk about their breakthrough gig. It was the night of the meaningful vote. They drove down after work in Adam\u2019s Toyota, listening to it all on 5 Live, the lobby bell and everything, with (new) rolls and paste and hi-vis in the back, and the ladder on the roof. They had identified four sites on Google Street View, but when they got there, one of them, on the side of an MOT centre, looked too high. Not for Adam, though: up he went, with Liam Fox\u2019s \u201cthe easiest trade deal in history \u2026\u201d There were barking dogs, sudden floodlights, encounters with pissheads. \u201cJust own it,\u201d said Richard, meaning look the part, and they did.</p> <p>Richard, Adam and Chris did four in Dover that night. As well as Fox, there was Theresa May, \u201cthe Emperor Donkey herself\u201d, with \u201cRemaining a member of the European Union means we will be more secure from crime and terrorism\u201d; Rees-Mogg\u2019s second referendum endorsement; and Raab\u2019s, of course: \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand the full extent of this but \u2026 we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.\u201d</p> <p>They were done at 2am and drove home. It had been brilliant fun, but they had reached a point where they couldn\u2019t carry on doing this as well as being good dads and partners. Also, they had spent about 500 quid of their own money. So the next day they set up a Crowdfunder.</p> <p>They reached their initial target of \u00a310,000 within three hours, and soon they were up to \u00a350,000. \u201cWe were like: \u2018Oh shit\u2019,\u201d says Chris. \u201cWith this comes responsibility.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0823df827ffcb8d27520bf69098b326e8dee2071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0823df827ffcb8d27520bf69098b326e8dee2071/0_128_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Leave.EU quote, Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Leave.EU quote, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Led By Donkeys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was, says Richard, the danger they would end up with millions in the bank \u201cand absolutely no knowledge or wherewithal to spend it. So we did what you never do on Crowdfunder, which is to say stop sending money until we know what to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>What it did mean is that they could now pay for people who knew how to put up billboards to put them up properly, and in places they wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach. Billboards that would stay up, for two weeks or a month, rather than getting ripped down the next day. As in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, their campaign had hit a nerve. People were sending in their fivers and tenners.</p> <p>Not everyone wanted to help. The biggest owners of advertising sites wouldn\u2019t have them, too political (though they were happy to host Ukip). But they found smaller companies with fewer sites who were more accommodating. At the moment they\u2019ve got 30 up, with another 60-plus booked in. They\u2019re all over Britain and they would like more; they\u2019ve got the money for it.</p> <p>They have been shocked and touched by the response. Not just the money, but the messages and support. Once it was a bunch of friends, with a baby in the middle of the night, maybe, searching for what they could find on Iain Duncan Smith or whoever, on Twitter or Google or the They Work For You function of Hansard. Now the crowd is sourcing quotes.</p> <p>A lot of people like them feel frustrated and powerless, \u201cthe idea we\u2019re shifting towards this precipice and nobody is actually going, \u2018Hang on, why is this happening?\u2019\u201d says Chris. \u201cWhen this tiny little idea came out, it was something practical and tangible we can do. It\u2019s that cathartic element of feeling like we\u2019re doing something, and the messages we get from people echo that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e19e340c44567271a3d405a88e9b9f5e6fb73b07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e19e340c44567271a3d405a88e9b9f5e6fb73b07/0_0_1314_789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Michael Gove quote, Rochdale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Michael Gove quote, Rochdale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Led By Donkeys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam agrees. \u201cDoing something that is real and out on the streets has really resonated with people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not so arrogant as to think that four dads with a ladder are going to turn this thing around,\u201d says Richard. \u201cBut a heist was committed in 2016 and it feels like standing outside the bank watching the getaway car screaming into the middle distance with no one tracking them down. OK, it\u2019s two and a half years late, but we are chasing these people down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it makes it even a little bit harder for these guys to come out with the same bullshit lies because they know they\u2019re going to get called out on it, that\u2019s an achievement,\u201d adds Chris. \u201cIntroducing that tiny amount of accountability into our politics is something I would have loved to have been a part of.\u201d</p> <p>Adam, who does a lot of international work, says he knows of people in other countries who want to use the billboards device.

      "bodyText": "At 5.55am, Talgarth Road, one of the major arteries into west London, is just beginning to clog up with early rush-hour traffic. A man named Dave, his white van pulled over into a loading bay, is putting up a billboard poster by the side of the carriageway. The previous one was an advert for Calvin Klein featuring the model Lara Stone. Over the course of 20 minutes, Dave covers Stone up, expertly pasting rectangles of paper over her, using a ladder for the high ones, then sweeping over with his brush. The first rectangle, in the top left corner, contains a headshot of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the beginning of his Twitter handle. As Dave lines up edges, pastes and brushes, and Stone disappears, a quote emerges from Rees-Mogg. This one wasn\u2019t a tweet; he said it in parliament. \u201cWe could have two referendums. As it happens, it might make more sense to have a second referendum after the renegotiation is completed.\u201d There are three other men here, dressed in hoodies, lumberjack shirts and beanies, lurking around and admiring the work. Their work \u2013 because Richard, Adam and Chris are three of the four key people behind Led By Donkeys, the remainer guerrilla activists highlighting the hypocrisy and lies of politicians by posting their damning quotes on billboards around the country. Less guerrilla now, actually: they\u2019ve gone legit, this hoarding is paid for. Before, they just took them over. The reason it is going up so early is because that\u2019s when Dave operates, mainly for parking reasons. Still, Richard, Adam and Chris are not their real names; they don\u2019t want to be identified. When Dave \u2013 which as far as I know is his real name, he\u2019s just been employed for the job \u2013 is done and has gone, we retreat from the frontline to a nearby Costa, for coffee and pastries, to warm up and for Richard, Adam and Chris to explain themselves. Long-time friends, they work at management level for NGOs and charities. United by a WhatsApp group, by politics, a dislike for Brexit and a need to do something, they also all have young families, children aged between one and seven. It is hard to combine direct action with feeds, drop-offs, homework and bedtime. Their partners are understanding and supportive, they say. They live in London and Bristol. The fourth member lives in Europe, outside the UK, with his non-British partner and kids. This is just about boys having a laugh, isn\u2019t it, or the beginnings of a midlife crisis? \u201cI think there is a midlife crisis but it\u2019s on the part of the nation, not on the part of us as individuals,\u201d says Richard. \u201cBritain is having a post-imperialism mid-, possibly late-life crisis where it\u2019s not quite sure what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s just gone and bought a motorbike and a leather jacket, it\u2019s a midlife crisis called Brexit, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out.\u201d Richard, 44, talks the most, but knows it, and stops to allows the others in. Adam, 43, is quiet and measured, but steely, and the bravest when it comes to climbing ladders. Philosophical Chris, 39, the baby of the group, is not unmodel-like himself, and wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a billboard. Chris came up with their name, after the first world war phrase about soldiers \u2013 lions \u2013 being led to their deaths because of the appalling decisions of British generals. \u201cOften we [the British] have a reputation for being boringly sensible and yet here we are in this unreal moment of chaos and masochism and nobody really knows why we\u2019re doing it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re putting up quotes of these donkeys, these leaders, who are leading us off this precipice, highlighting what brought us to this point. It seemed to make sense.\u201d It all began, as most good ideas do, in the pub. They were talking about the infamous David Cameron tweet \u2013 \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me or chaos with Ed Miliband\u201d \u2013 which was doing the rounds again after Theresa May cancelled the vote on her deal in December. And someone said: why don\u2019t they slap it on a billboard, make it the tweet you can\u2019t delete? The next day, on the WhatsApp group, one of them said they had found someone who would print it out for them. They all agreed: \u201cLet\u2019s just fucking do it.\u201d It was cheaper to do five, so they cobbled together four more tweets \u2013 from Michael Gove, David Davies, John Redwood and Liam Fox \u2013 not really thinking they\u2019d ever put them up. Initial outlay was about 200 quid, plus \u00a390 on a ladder from B&amp;Q. There are no how-to-put-up-a-billboard tutorials on YouTube. The nearest they found was a timelapse video by a man promoting his own poster business. There was a delay on the first night because Richard\u2019s daughter wouldn\u2019t go to sleep, but eventually, one evening in January, they found themselves by the A10 in north London, Adam up the ladder covered in wallpaper paste, bits of paper flapping all over the place, Cameron\u2019s face wrapped around his own head \u2026 Finally, after an hour and a half, it was up. That first one was on top of an ad for Halifax. So they stole the space? \u201cWe temporarily borrowed advertising real estate from a company that could afford to lend it to us,\u201d Richard clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily ask permission but it was public service and therefore totally justified.\u201d They would later borrow from Ford and McDonald\u2019s, too. And it felt good. \u201cThere is the thing about taking it out of the digital zone,\u201d says Adam. \u201cThe actual tangible visceral nature of having these things up on the street and having these guys held to account really works, I think. When we saw that we had that moment of: hold on, this is a thing, it could work.\u201d They got to the pub for last orders (dry January went out of the window). The next morning they tweeted it, someone picked it up and retweeted it, they had 1,000 followers, the Guardian\u2019s Marina Hyde retweeted it, they had 2,000, then 3,000 (now they have 43.6k). There is no point preaching to the converted, though; they knew they had to get out of London and into leave areas. Sunderland would have been hard when you\u2019ve got kids that wake up at 4.30am, not to mention day jobs. But they took Michael Gove to Romford. And then there was Dover, which felt right because of its central place in the drama, with Dominic Raab producing choice quotes. \u201cThat fucker was going up in Dover even if we got nicked,\u201d says Richard, who holds a special place in his whatever the opposite of heart is (spleen?) for Raab. They talk about Dover the way a band might talk about their breakthrough gig. It was the night of the meaningful vote. They drove down after work in Adam\u2019s Toyota, listening to it all on 5 Live, the lobby bell and everything, with (new) rolls and paste and hi-vis in the back, and the ladder on the roof. They had identified four sites on Google Street View, but when they got there, one of them, on the side of an MOT centre, looked too high. Not for Adam, though: up he went, with Liam Fox\u2019s \u201cthe easiest trade deal in history \u2026\u201d There were barking dogs, sudden floodlights, encounters with pissheads. \u201cJust own it,\u201d said Richard, meaning look the part, and they did. Richard, Adam and Chris did four in Dover that night. As well as Fox, there was Theresa May, \u201cthe Emperor Donkey herself\u201d, with \u201cRemaining a member of the European Union means we will be more secure from crime and terrorism\u201d; Rees-Mogg\u2019s second referendum endorsement; and Raab\u2019s, of course: \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand the full extent of this but \u2026 we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.\u201d They were done at 2am and drove home. It had been brilliant fun, but they had reached a point where they couldn\u2019t carry on doing this as well as being good dads and partners. Also, they had spent about 500 quid of their own money. So the next day they set up a Crowdfunder. They reached their initial target of \u00a310,000 within three hours, and soon they were up to \u00a350,000. \u201cWe were like: \u2018Oh shit\u2019,\u201d says Chris. \u201cWith this comes responsibility.\u201d There was, says Richard, the danger they would end up with millions in the bank \u201cand absolutely no knowledge or wherewithal to spend it. So we did what you never do on Crowdfunder, which is to say stop sending money until we know what to do with it.\u201d What it did mean is that they could now pay for people who knew how to put up billboards to put them up properly, and in places they wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach. Billboards that would stay up, for two weeks or a month, rather than getting ripped down the next day. As in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, their campaign had hit a nerve. People were sending in their fivers and tenners. Not everyone wanted to help. The biggest owners of advertising sites wouldn\u2019t have them, too political (though they were happy to host Ukip). But they found smaller companies with fewer sites who were more accommodating. At the moment they\u2019ve got 30 up, with another 60-plus booked in. They\u2019re all over Britain and they would like more; they\u2019ve got the money for it. They have been shocked and touched by the response. Not just the money, but the messages and support. Once it was a bunch of friends, with a baby in the middle of the night, maybe, searching for what they could find on Iain Duncan Smith or whoever, on Twitter or Google or the They Work For You function of Hansard. Now the crowd is sourcing quotes. A lot of people like them feel frustrated and powerless, \u201cthe idea we\u2019re shifting towards this precipice and nobody is actually going, \u2018Hang on, why is this happening?\u2019\u201d says Chris. \u201cWhen this tiny little idea came out, it was something practical and tangible we can do. It\u2019s that cathartic element of feeling like we\u2019re doing something, and the messages we get from people echo that.\u201d Adam agrees. \u201cDoing something that is real and out on the streets has really resonated with people.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not so arrogant as to think that four dads with a ladder are going to turn this thing around,\u201d says Richard. \u201cBut a heist was committed in 2016 and it feels like standing outside the bank watching the getaway car screaming into the middle distance with no one tracking them down. OK, it\u2019s two and a half years late, but we are chasing these people down.\u201d \u201cIf it makes it even a little bit harder for these guys to come out with the same bullshit lies because they know they\u2019re going to get called out on it, that\u2019s an achievement,\u201d adds Chris. \u201cIntroducing that tiny amount of accountability into our politics is something I would have loved to have been a part of.\u201d Adam, who does a lot of international work, says he knows of people in other countries who want to use the billboards device. It\u2019s a tactic that can be used whenever and wherever. Which reminds them, they do have actual day jobs to go to. Hang on, quickly \u2013 now what? Well, they\u2019ve got other ideas, such as one to get closer to some of the people saying this stuff, but they won\u2019t say more than that. And they are certainly not going to stop with the billboards, what with all the momentum they\u2019ve got, money in the bank and the quotes that just keep on coming. Don\u2019t put that ladder away Dave \u2026 oh, Dave\u2019s left. And he is a leaver, he admitted quietly earlier.

      "body": "<p>Mark has one of the most coveted jobs in television. As a senior commissioner at one of Britain\u2019s biggest broadcasters, he controls a budget extending to the millions. And every day, a steady stream of independent television producers arrive at his desk desperate to land a pitch. At just 39, Mark is young to wield such power. After making his name as a programmemaker, he initially became a commissioner at a rival broadcaster before being headhunted five years ago. A string of hits later, he is now one of the industry\u2019s biggest players.</p> <p>Yet when we met Mark, and invited him to narrate his career in his own words, a very different account emerged. It is not that he disavowed his success; he is clearly proud of what he has achieved. But what is striking is Mark\u2019s acknowledgment that his upward trajectory, particularly its rapid speed and relative smoothness, has been contingent on \u201cstarting the race\u201d with a series of profound advantages. He is certainly from a privileged background. His parents were both successful professionals and he was educated at one of London\u2019s top private schools before going on to Oxford.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not like I think I am rubbish,\u201d he said towards the end of our interview. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of peers with greater networks and privilege screw up because they just weren\u2019t good enough. But at the same time, it is mad to pretend there\u2019s not been an incredibly strong following wind throughout my career.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of a \u201cfollowing wind\u201d, a gust of privilege, gets to the heart of what we call the class ceiling. It neatly captures the propulsive power provided by an advantaged class background \u2013 how it acts as an energy-saving device that allows some to get further with less effort \u2013 deftly shaping career trajectories, delineating what courses of action are possible, what kind of support is available, and how one\u2019s \u201cmerits\u201d are perceived by others. Equally, the metaphor also describes the experience of the upwardly mobile who, very often, have the wind against them. It is not that such individuals cannot move forward, or never reach the top; just that, generally, it takes longer, happens less frequently and often represents a markedly more labour-intensive, even exhausting experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/22/the-class-pay-gap-why-it-pays-to-be-privileged-podcast\">The class pay gap: why it pays to be privileged \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But thinking about privilege as a prevailing wind is not just more fetishisation of the top; our class backgrounds do not matter only in relation to who has the top salaries, or the most powerful jobs. Instead, privilege affects all sorts of life outcomes, in all sorts of ways and all parts of the class structure. And in each of these domains, the key issue is that when the following wind of privilege is misread as merit, the inequalities that result are legitimised. This leads those who have been fortunate to believe they have earned it on their own, and those who have been less fortunate to blame themselves.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Writing in 1915, the philosopher and social theorist Max Weber observed: \u201cThe fortunate man is seldom satisfied with the fact of being fortunate. Beyond this, he needs to know that he has a right to his good fortune. He wants to be convinced that he \u2018deserves\u2019 it, and above all, that he deserves it in comparison with others \u2026 good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.\u201d</p> <p>Weber could easily have been writing about today. Fast-forward 100 years and the current political fetish for social mobility and meritocracy is clearly motivated by a similar societal yearning for \u201clegitimate fortune\u201d. In fact, this still represents the key rhetorical tool for most politicians when seeking to justify current mushrooming rates of inequality. The <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/oep/article/70/2/301/4102191\" title=\"\">rocketing incomes</a> enjoyed by top earners since the 1980s, we often hear, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/27/boris-johnson-thatcher-greed-good\" title=\"\">perfectly acceptable</a> as long as those from all class backgrounds have fair access to the jobs that generate such disproportionate rewards. Social mobility, in other words, imbues inequality with a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/19/the-myth-of-meritocracy-who-really-gets-what-they-deserve\" title=\"\">meritocratic legitimacy</a>. In the latest iteration of this, as expressed by Theresa May soon after she became prime minister, Britain must become \u201cthe world\u2019s great meritocracy\u201d; this is the primary means to address society\u2019s \u201cburning injustices\u201d.</p> <p>But is getting ahead in contemporary Britain really just a matter of merit; of \u201clegitimate fortune\u201d? Well, having spent the past five years researching who gets in and who gets on in Britain\u2019s elite occupations, our answer is a resounding no. Only 10% of those from working-class backgrounds (<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/otherclassifications/thenationalstatisticssocioeconomicclassificationnssecrebasedonsoc2010\" title=\"\">meaning those</a> whose breadwinning parent did \u201croutine\u201d or \u201csemi-routine\u201d work, or didn\u2019t work) make it into Britain\u2019s higher managerial, professional or cultural occupations \u2013 according to our analysis of more than 100,000 people in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 labour force survey.</p> <p>And access is particularly restricted in areas such as medicine, law and journalism. Only 6% of doctors, for example, are from working-class backgrounds, while the figure among the workforce as a whole is 33%. Some of this can be explained by the advantages enjoyed by those who follow directly in their parents\u2019 footsteps. If you have a parent who is a doctor, you are 24 times more likely to become a doctor. The children of lawyers are 17 times more likely to go into law and the children of those in film and television 12 times more likely to go into these fields.</p> <p>Still, it is important that we don\u2019t fixate on this issue of access. Most academics, policymakers, charities and businesses have tended to make this mistake in the past, implicitly suggesting that the baggage of our class origins somehow disappears once we enter the workplace. We wanted to shift the debate \u2013 from getting in to getting on. And what we found was striking. In contemporary Britain, it quite literally pays to be privileged. Even when those from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering the country\u2019s elite occupations, they go on to earn, on average, \u00a36,400 less than colleagues whose parents did \u201cmiddle-class\u201d professional or managerial jobs \u2013 a nearly 16% class pay gap. This is exacerbated for women, people with disabilities, and most ethnic minorities. Each face a distinct double disadvantage. Women from working-class backgrounds, for example, earn on average \u00a319,000 a year less in elite occupations than men from privileged backgrounds, and the figure is even higher for non-white women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6afae36a430d82e7fe07f1acc47173748a8f1c6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6afae36a430d82e7fe07f1acc47173748a8f1c6e/0_191_4657_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students throw their mortarboards in the air after their graduation ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These numbers are certainly concerning. But it is important not to jump to the conclusion that that they are entirely driven by class prejudice and discrimination. In fact, many readers have probably already started formulating their own explanations for the class pay gap; maybe working-class people are simply younger on average than those from privileged backgrounds, and therefore less far along in their careers? Or perhaps the privileged have higher rates of educational attainment? Maybe they just work harder, or perform better at work?</p> <p>These are plausible mechanisms that deserve careful scrutiny. And some are indeed part of the story. Education does explain some of the gap. Those from privileged backgrounds tend to have higher qualifications and attend more prestigious universities, both of which are associated with higher earnings. Yet significantly, even Oxford and Cambridge, supposedly the ultimate sorting houses of academic ability, do not wash away the advantages of class origins. Graduates from privileged backgrounds still go on to earn \u00a35,000 a year more than their working-class peers.</p> <p>Other important mechanisms are also at work. The privileged are more likely to work in London, in large firms, and in professions such as finance \u2013 all of which are associated with higher pay.</p> <p>But most importantly, even when we adjust for all these factors, along with a range of conventional indicators of merit \u2013 such as hours worked, training and experience \u2013 still half the class pay gap remains. This is worth underlining; even when those from working-class backgrounds are similar to their advantaged colleagues in every way we can measure, they still earn significantly less.</p> <p>The question this raises, of course, is why? To get at this we quickly realised we needed to go beyond survey data. So we brokered access to a number of elite firms, conducting 175 interviews at a large multinational accountancy firm, a successful architecture practice, one of Britain\u2019s biggest television broadcasters, and with self-employed actors. Going behind the closed doors of elite firms revealed a number of hidden mechanisms that propel the privileged forward.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018Hear that?\u201d said Dave, a senior manager at our television broadcaster, as he led us through the aluminium and glass-clad headquarters to our interview room. The layout of each department, we observed as we walked, was exactly the same. There is no spatial demarcation of grade or seniority, and the desks are arranged open-plan. This gives the impression of inclusivity but also, we imagined, means it must be quite hard to remember which department you are in. Dave cupped his hand over his ear: \u201cYou just have to listen to know which floor you\u2019re on. You can tell by the accents. Posh, right? Yep, this is commissioning.\u201d</p> <p>Exploring elite workplaces showed us that the class pay gap is less about those from working-class backgrounds getting paid less for doing the same work and more about the kind of workplace segregation implied by Dave\u2019s comment. And he was right. Only 7% of those in commissioning \u2013 the most prestigious and high-paying department \u2013 were from working-class backgrounds. The figure in HR was 22%. And even more significantly, this segregation was also vertical: only 2.5% of the executive team were from working-class backgrounds. Here, as in most of our case studies, there was a distinct class ceiling.</p> <p>How do we account for this? Well, people tend to presume that career progression rests solely on the labour of individuals. Yet our interviews revealed that people rarely progress in elite occupations based on their own efforts alone. Instead, very often, when our interviewees narrated decisive moments in their careers \u2013 key decisions, new jobs, big promotions \u2013 there were others in their stories who provided a significant hand up. Such help tends to come from two directions.</p> <p>First, we consistently saw the profound advantages afforded to those who can draw upon \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d. This kind of financial patronage is pivotal in propelling careers forward, particularly in precarious areas like the cultural industries. Here money acts as an important early career lubricant, allowing the privileged to manoeuvre into more promising career tracks, resist exploitative employment and take risky opportunities \u2013 all of which increase their chances of long-term success.

Instead, most told us they had chosen television because the culture was informal \u2013 that this was a key sign of TV\u2019s openness. However, the more we delved into this informality, the more we began to understand that it is not a social leveller at all; on the contrary, it constitutes a very subtle and intricate code. In particular, we identified two dimensions of what we termed \u201cstudied informality\u201d. First, this requires a particular package of self-presentation \u2013 casual but hip dress (there was a lot of discussion about the right kind of trainers), a \u201cknowing\u201d, often ironic humour (who knows when to swear in meetings, put their feet up or mock their managers), and a level of familiarity (hugs and kisses rather than handshakes) not normally associated with the professional workplace.</p> <p>There was also another component \u2013 a particular highbrow way of talking about television. This was exemplified at the broadcaster during the \u201ccreative assembly\u201d, where programme ideas were discussed in front of the executive team. The laudable aim of this weekly meeting was to bring staff together from different backgrounds to initiate what the chief creative officer described as a \u201ccollision of different ideas and perspectives\u201d. Yet interviews revealed that the concept had dramatically backfired. Far from disrupting existing hierarchies, the assembly had become a crucible of the already anointed; a gladiatorial encounter where the discussion of television programmes simply acted as a vehicle for commissioners to underline their cultural prowess, jockeying to drop cultural references, or showcase an ever-more arcane mode of aesthetic appreciation. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a game of showing off,\u201d one senior commissioner explained. \u201cI\u2019m like, how \u2026 why are we talking about Of Mice and Men in relation to a programme about lie detectors?\u201d</p> <p>The point here is that although those at the top valued this code, most others admitted in anonymous interviews that it had little connection to the actual work, or to the mainstream programmes being made. This matters because it illustrates how the self-presentational baggage of a privileged class origin is frequently mistaken in elite occupations as a marker of a person\u2019s talent, ability or potential.</p> <p>We also found that behavioural codes are particularly important in certain areas of work. In environments such as television commissioning or financial advisory, for example, the success of the \u201cfinal product\u201d is hard to foretell, and therefore the knowledge and expertise of the professional is inherently ambiguous.

This, we were continually told, was a \u201cpragmatic\u201d firm where managers value transparent and demonstrable technical competence and where clients can \u201csee through the bullshit\u201d, as one partner put it, of self-presentational bluster.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>What happens when people don\u2019t get the platform to showcase their \u201cmerits\u201d, or when their performances of merit are not recognised? In the course of our research, we heard from many people who reported these kinds of experiences. Not all were upwardly socially mobile, but most were. These narratives underlined the uncertainties that flow from not having an economic safety net, the extra labour required if one does not have the advocacy of a sponsor, or the lingering anxiety that stems from failing to convincingly mimic dominant behavioural norms. In such instances, when performances of merit don\u2019t land, we found that the mobile often self-eliminate from pushing forward in their careers.</p> <p>And here we challenge common-sense assumptions about upward mobility. We find that when the mobile enter elite occupations, the lack of fit is deeply felt, and often generates a sense of unease <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/03/returning-to-reims-by-didier-eribon-review\" title=\"\">that lingers</a>. This emotional labour is important to register. And certainly, when examined through the lens of wellbeing rather than economic and occupational achievement, the success of social mobility is much more uncertain.</p> <p>Of course, the performance and recognition of merit is not just affected by a person\u2019s class background. On the contrary, we find strong quantitative evidence \u2013 the first we know of \u2013 that upwardly mobile women and members of (certain) minority ethnic groups face a double earnings disadvantage in elite occupations. Our interview data sheds some light on these intersectional inequalities, particularly the way gender and ethnicity can magnify the visibility of class difference, and increase the scrutiny placed on these individuals in their execution of dominant behavioural codes. It is telling, for example, that no female equivalent exists of the heroic tale of the working-class boy made good. Instead, stereotypes of upwardly mobile women tend to be especially stigmatising, emphasising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/17/lynsey-hanley-how-i-became-middle-class-respectable-experience-of-class-extract\" title=\"\">pretentiousness and pushiness</a>.</p> <p>Mark was legitimately exemplary in all the ways we conventionally think about \u201cmerit\u201d \u2013 he had achieved highly in the education system, had worked hard, and had amassed a wealth of valuable experience. Yet as he freely admitted, he had been given a distinct platform to demonstrate these merits. There was the family money at the start, a safety net that \u201ctided [him] over\u201d when he was jockeying around for his first permanent contract. There were the senior colleagues who fast-tracked him at key moments. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of medieval in television,\u201d he explained. \u201cI mean, I could almost give you my whole trajectory in sponsors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/22/debretts-how-to-be-entitled-can-it-help-outsiders-join-britains-elite\">How to be entitled: can Debrett\u2019s help outsiders join Britain\u2019s elite?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most important was the sense that Mark\u2019s package of merits, and the way he presented them, was readily recognised by senior figures; an instinctive sense that he could \u201csort of fit in with the telly tribe\u201d, \u201cconnect\u201d with colleagues, and understand what was really at stake in settings like the commissioning room. As he recalled of meetings on one high-profile news programme: \u201cIt was instantly recognisable to me, exactly like the common rooms at school and at Oxford. The rules are: it\u2019s good to be right, but it\u2019s better to be funny!\u201d</p> <p>We would argue that this ability to land merit plays a critical role in erecting, and maintaining, Britain\u2019s class ceiling. Of course we don\u2019t mean to say there is no such thing as talent, or that career success is unrelated to individual skill or ability. Instead, our key point is that the identification of merit is inextricably intertwined with the way it is executed, facilitated, and recognised. And more broadly, by shedding light on the ways in which conventional understandings of merit provide, at best, an insufficient explanation for success at the top, we can raise wider questions about an economic system that too often allocates profoundly unequal rewards based on the accident of social origin.</p> <p><em>Names have been changed.

      "bodyText": "Mark has one of the most coveted jobs in television. As a senior commissioner at one of Britain\u2019s biggest broadcasters, he controls a budget extending to the millions. And every day, a steady stream of independent television producers arrive at his desk desperate to land a pitch. At just 39, Mark is young to wield such power. After making his name as a programmemaker, he initially became a commissioner at a rival broadcaster before being headhunted five years ago. A string of hits later, he is now one of the industry\u2019s biggest players. Yet when we met Mark, and invited him to narrate his career in his own words, a very different account emerged. It is not that he disavowed his success; he is clearly proud of what he has achieved. But what is striking is Mark\u2019s acknowledgment that his upward trajectory, particularly its rapid speed and relative smoothness, has been contingent on \u201cstarting the race\u201d with a series of profound advantages. He is certainly from a privileged background. His parents were both successful professionals and he was educated at one of London\u2019s top private schools before going on to Oxford. \u201cIt is not like I think I am rubbish,\u201d he said towards the end of our interview. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of peers with greater networks and privilege screw up because they just weren\u2019t good enough. But at the same time, it is mad to pretend there\u2019s not been an incredibly strong following wind throughout my career.\u201d This idea of a \u201cfollowing wind\u201d, a gust of privilege, gets to the heart of what we call the class ceiling. It neatly captures the propulsive power provided by an advantaged class background \u2013 how it acts as an energy-saving device that allows some to get further with less effort \u2013 deftly shaping career trajectories, delineating what courses of action are possible, what kind of support is available, and how one\u2019s \u201cmerits\u201d are perceived by others. Equally, the metaphor also describes the experience of the upwardly mobile who, very often, have the wind against them. It is not that such individuals cannot move forward, or never reach the top; just that, generally, it takes longer, happens less frequently and often represents a markedly more labour-intensive, even exhausting experience. But thinking about privilege as a prevailing wind is not just more fetishisation of the top; our class backgrounds do not matter only in relation to who has the top salaries, or the most powerful jobs. Instead, privilege affects all sorts of life outcomes, in all sorts of ways and all parts of the class structure. And in each of these domains, the key issue is that when the following wind of privilege is misread as merit, the inequalities that result are legitimised. This leads those who have been fortunate to believe they have earned it on their own, and those who have been less fortunate to blame themselves. * * * Writing in 1915, the philosopher and social theorist Max Weber observed: \u201cThe fortunate man is seldom satisfied with the fact of being fortunate. Beyond this, he needs to know that he has a right to his good fortune. He wants to be convinced that he \u2018deserves\u2019 it, and above all, that he deserves it in comparison with others \u2026 good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.\u201d Weber could easily have been writing about today. Fast-forward 100 years and the current political fetish for social mobility and meritocracy is clearly motivated by a similar societal yearning for \u201clegitimate fortune\u201d. In fact, this still represents the key rhetorical tool for most politicians when seeking to justify current mushrooming rates of inequality. The rocketing incomes enjoyed by top earners since the 1980s, we often hear, are perfectly acceptable as long as those from all class backgrounds have fair access to the jobs that generate such disproportionate rewards. Social mobility, in other words, imbues inequality with a kind of meritocratic legitimacy. In the latest iteration of this, as expressed by Theresa May soon after she became prime minister, Britain must become \u201cthe world\u2019s great meritocracy\u201d; this is the primary means to address society\u2019s \u201cburning injustices\u201d. But is getting ahead in contemporary Britain really just a matter of merit; of \u201clegitimate fortune\u201d? Well, having spent the past five years researching who gets in and who gets on in Britain\u2019s elite occupations, our answer is a resounding no. Only 10% of those from working-class backgrounds (meaning those whose breadwinning parent did \u201croutine\u201d or \u201csemi-routine\u201d work, or didn\u2019t work) make it into Britain\u2019s higher managerial, professional or cultural occupations \u2013 according to our analysis of more than 100,000 people in the Office for National Statistics\u2019 labour force survey. And access is particularly restricted in areas such as medicine, law and journalism. Only 6% of doctors, for example, are from working-class backgrounds, while the figure among the workforce as a whole is 33%. Some of this can be explained by the advantages enjoyed by those who follow directly in their parents\u2019 footsteps. If you have a parent who is a doctor, you are 24 times more likely to become a doctor. The children of lawyers are 17 times more likely to go into law and the children of those in film and television 12 times more likely to go into these fields. Still, it is important that we don\u2019t fixate on this issue of access. Most academics, policymakers, charities and businesses have tended to make this mistake in the past, implicitly suggesting that the baggage of our class origins somehow disappears once we enter the workplace. We wanted to shift the debate \u2013 from getting in to getting on. And what we found was striking. In contemporary Britain, it quite literally pays to be privileged. Even when those from working-class backgrounds are successful in entering the country\u2019s elite occupations, they go on to earn, on average, \u00a36,400 less than colleagues whose parents did \u201cmiddle-class\u201d professional or managerial jobs \u2013 a nearly 16% class pay gap. This is exacerbated for women, people with disabilities, and most ethnic minorities. Each face a distinct double disadvantage. Women from working-class backgrounds, for example, earn on average \u00a319,000 a year less in elite occupations than men from privileged backgrounds, and the figure is even higher for non-white women. These numbers are certainly concerning. But it is important not to jump to the conclusion that that they are entirely driven by class prejudice and discrimination. In fact, many readers have probably already started formulating their own explanations for the class pay gap; maybe working-class people are simply younger on average than those from privileged backgrounds, and therefore less far along in their careers? Or perhaps the privileged have higher rates of educational attainment? Maybe they just work harder, or perform better at work? These are plausible mechanisms that deserve careful scrutiny. And some are indeed part of the story. Education does explain some of the gap. Those from privileged backgrounds tend to have higher qualifications and attend more prestigious universities, both of which are associated with higher earnings. Yet significantly, even Oxford and Cambridge, supposedly the ultimate sorting houses of academic ability, do not wash away the advantages of class origins. Graduates from privileged backgrounds still go on to earn \u00a35,000 a year more than their working-class peers. Other important mechanisms are also at work. The privileged are more likely to work in London, in large firms, and in professions such as finance \u2013 all of which are associated with higher pay. But most importantly, even when we adjust for all these factors, along with a range of conventional indicators of merit \u2013 such as hours worked, training and experience \u2013 still half the class pay gap remains. This is worth underlining; even when those from working-class backgrounds are similar to their advantaged colleagues in every way we can measure, they still earn significantly less. The question this raises, of course, is why? To get at this we quickly realised we needed to go beyond survey data. So we brokered access to a number of elite firms, conducting 175 interviews at a large multinational accountancy firm, a successful architecture practice, one of Britain\u2019s biggest television broadcasters, and with self-employed actors. Going behind the closed doors of elite firms revealed a number of hidden mechanisms that propel the privileged forward. * * * \u2018Hear that?\u201d said Dave, a senior manager at our television broadcaster, as he led us through the aluminium and glass-clad headquarters to our interview room. The layout of each department, we observed as we walked, was exactly the same. There is no spatial demarcation of grade or seniority, and the desks are arranged open-plan. This gives the impression of inclusivity but also, we imagined, means it must be quite hard to remember which department you are in. Dave cupped his hand over his ear: \u201cYou just have to listen to know which floor you\u2019re on. You can tell by the accents. Posh, right? Yep, this is commissioning.\u201d Exploring elite workplaces showed us that the class pay gap is less about those from working-class backgrounds getting paid less for doing the same work and more about the kind of workplace segregation implied by Dave\u2019s comment. And he was right. Only 7% of those in commissioning \u2013 the most prestigious and high-paying department \u2013 were from working-class backgrounds. The figure in HR was 22%. And even more significantly, this segregation was also vertical: only 2.5% of the executive team were from working-class backgrounds. Here, as in most of our case studies, there was a distinct class ceiling. How do we account for this? Well, people tend to presume that career progression rests solely on the labour of individuals. Yet our interviews revealed that people rarely progress in elite occupations based on their own efforts alone. Instead, very often, when our interviewees narrated decisive moments in their careers \u2013 key decisions, new jobs, big promotions \u2013 there were others in their stories who provided a significant hand up. Such help tends to come from two directions. First, we consistently saw the profound advantages afforded to those who can draw upon \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d. This kind of financial patronage is pivotal in propelling careers forward, particularly in precarious areas like the cultural industries. Here money acts as an important early career lubricant, allowing the privileged to manoeuvre into more promising career tracks, resist exploitative employment and take risky opportunities \u2013 all of which increase their chances of long-term success. In contrast, those who lack the insulation of family money described the day-to-day of making a living in these areas a kind of economic chaos, or as one actor put it, \u201clike skydiving without a parachute\u201d. Yet a helping hand does not always push from behind or below. In many elite occupations, support is more likely to come from above. And instead of economic it is often social \u2013 in the form of sponsorship. This process is simple; a senior leader identifies a junior protege and then, often operating beneath formal processes, is able to fast-track their career by brokering job opportunities, allocating valuable work or advocating on their behalf. This was particularly common at our accountancy firm, where most partners talked openly about \u201cbringing through\u201d younger staff to the partnership. And while this was often presented as innocent talent-spotting, we found that sponsor relationships were rarely established on the basis of work performance. Instead, they were almost always forged, in the first instance, through a sense of class-cultural affinity \u2013 shared humour, taste or lifestyle. And, as senior managers across our case studies were themselves overwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds, this acts as another way that progression is rigged in favour of the privileged. And the main reason these helping hands are so effective is that they are largely hidden from public view. Both are perennially downplayed in people\u2019s career narratives. Of course, this strikes to the heart of \u201clegitimate fortune\u201d; most want to believe they deserve their good fortune, as Weber argued. But at the same time such muting, concealing and obscuring means that others working in elite occupations, and the public as a whole, are prevented from knowing the true extent to which elite careers rest on the support of others. This also fundamentally complicates our understanding of \u201cmerit\u201d. It suggests that, to be effective, a person\u2019s merits need to be showcased in the right setting or in front of the right people; they need a platform. As one TV script editor from a working-class background astutely observed of her senior commissioners: \u201cThey\u2019re all really talented, it\u2019s not that. But the reason they are is because they\u2019ve had the opportunities to be, kind of, seen as talented.\u201d * * * Merit is not only assumed to be the sole property of individuals. It is also thought to have a fixed nature \u2013 conventional indicators are widely considered objectively measurable and equally recognised by all.

Some performances \u201cfit\u201d, in other words, and others do not.

These are rooted in the history of these occupations, in what type of people have done this work in the past and how, over time, they have been successful in embedding their own ideas about the \u201cright\u201d way to be at work. In accountancy, for example, and particularly in spaces such as the City (of London), the historical residue of an overwhelmingly privileged (white, male) majority is an enduring emphasis on corporate \u201cpolish\u201d \u2013 encompassing formal dress and etiquette, interactional poise and an aura of gravitas.

In the course of our research, we heard from many people who reported these kinds of experiences. Not all were upwardly socially mobile, but most were. These narratives underlined the uncertainties that flow from not having an economic safety net, the extra labour required if one does not have the advocacy of a sponsor, or the lingering anxiety that stems from failing to convincingly mimic dominant behavioural norms. In such instances, when performances of merit don\u2019t land, we found that the mobile often self-eliminate from pushing forward in their careers. And here we challenge common-sense assumptions about upward mobility. We find that when the mobile enter elite occupations, the lack of fit is deeply felt, and often generates a sense of unease that lingers. This emotional labour is important to register. And certainly, when examined through the lens of wellbeing rather than economic and occupational achievement, the success of social mobility is much more uncertain. Of course, the performance and recognition of merit is not just affected by a person\u2019s class background. On the contrary, we find strong quantitative evidence \u2013 the first we know of \u2013 that upwardly mobile women and members of (certain) minority ethnic groups face a double earnings disadvantage in elite occupations. Our interview data sheds some light on these intersectional inequalities, particularly the way gender and ethnicity can magnify the visibility of class difference, and increase the scrutiny placed on these individuals in their execution of dominant behavioural codes. It is telling, for example, that no female equivalent exists of the heroic tale of the working-class boy made good. Instead, stereotypes of upwardly mobile women tend to be especially stigmatising, emphasising pretentiousness and pushiness. Mark was legitimately exemplary in all the ways we conventionally think about \u201cmerit\u201d \u2013 he had achieved highly in the education system, had worked hard, and had amassed a wealth of valuable experience. Yet as he freely admitted, he had been given a distinct platform to demonstrate these merits. There was the family money at the start, a safety net that \u201ctided [him] over\u201d when he was jockeying around for his first permanent contract. There were the senior colleagues who fast-tracked him at key moments. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of medieval in television,\u201d he explained. \u201cI mean, I could almost give you my whole trajectory in sponsors.\u201d Most important was the sense that Mark\u2019s package of merits, and the way he presented them, was readily recognised by senior figures; an instinctive sense that he could \u201csort of fit in with the telly tribe\u201d, \u201cconnect\u201d with colleagues, and understand what was really at stake in settings like the commissioning room. As he recalled of meetings on one high-profile news programme: \u201cIt was instantly recognisable to me, exactly like the common rooms at school and at Oxford. The rules are: it\u2019s good to be right, but it\u2019s better to be funny!\u201d We would argue that this ability to land merit plays a critical role in erecting, and maintaining, Britain\u2019s class ceiling. Of course we don\u2019t mean to say there is no such thing as talent, or that career success is unrelated to individual skill or ability. Instead, our key point is that the identification of merit is inextricably intertwined with the way it is executed, facilitated, and recognised. And more broadly, by shedding light on the ways in which conventional understandings of merit provide, at best, an insufficient explanation for success at the top, we can raise wider questions about an economic system that too often allocates profoundly unequal rewards based on the accident of social origin.

Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears \u2013 on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew\u2019s plays: <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-the-big-pride-1961-online\">The Big Pride</a> (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean\u2019s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely \u201cpolitical\u201d tells its own story.</p> <p>It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age \u2013 even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/the-guardian-view-on-powells-rivers-of-blood-speech-handle-with-care\">Rivers of Blood speech</a>, in 1968, as a turning point. \u201cAfter that all the good work we\u2019d done before was erased and forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/27/my-crossroads-entrance-came-at-a-time-of-racial-tension\">Melanie in Crossroads</a>, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson.</p> <p>According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell\u2019s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. \u201cHe wanted to show a young, black character who wasn\u2019t defined by her colour,\u201d says Sylvestre. \u201cIt was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I\u2019m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, I love your character.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd8ec03adcd25fc9a3d74a00003d5ff2680f5aa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8ec03adcd25fc9a3d74a00003d5ff2680f5aa0/0_82_1079_647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh from Ocean\u2019s 11 \u2026 Sammy Davis Jr and Yolande Bavan in The Day of the Fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh from Ocean\u2019s 11 \u2026 Sammy Davis Jr and Yolande Bavan in The Day of the Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British diversity. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/10/don-warrington-king-lear-interview\">Warrington</a> went on to star in one of the better offerings: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/20/rising-damp-box-set\">Rising Damp</a>.

The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/oct/22/tvandradio.television1\">Rudolph Walker</a>) as \u201cnig-nog\u201d or \u201csambo\u201d.</p> <p>That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/04/desmonds-at-30-i-wrote-it-for-white-people\">Desmond\u2019s</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We\u2019re guests here, always on our best behaviour, never at ease. No wonder so many of us go round the twist.\u201d So says Don Warrington in Carbon Copy, a television play first broadcast in 1975. Warrington\u2019s character, Albert, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and is reassessing his place in \u201cthe mother country\u201d after a recent awakening of his black identity. Had he been able to see four decades into the future, Albert would doubtless feel even less at ease. Last year\u2019s shaming Windrush scandal, in which British nationals of African-Caribbean heritage were targeted for deportation by the Home Office, demonstrates how some in the UK are still determined to treat black people as \u201cguests\u201d. But Albert might also be depressed at the state of British television 40 years on: how little it built on pioneering dramas like Carbon Copy, and how little is even remembered of them. The title of the British Film Institute\u2019s current season, Forgotten Black TV Drama, is no exaggeration. Most of the titles it gathers together have not been seen by the public since they were first broadcast. Between them they tell a story that is in many ways all too familiar, but in others surprising, perceptive and eerily prescient. In another forgotten drama, 1973\u2019s The Museum Attendant, a black character declares \u201chating immigrants is the only thing that draws English people together\u201d. It is often assumed that US cinema and television blazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen, but British television was ahead of both, argues Stephen Bourne, co-curator of the BFI season. The BBC soap Compact, which began in 1962, had a black magazine photographer, played by Horace James, as a recurring character. ITV hospital drama Emergency \u2013 Ward 10 regularly featured a black doctor, played by Joan Hooley, who embarked on a relationship with a white man \u2013 including a then-controversial interracial kiss. This was in 1964, four years before Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk kissed in Star Trek. And it wasn\u2019t even the first such kiss on British TV (that was in the Armchair Theatre play Hot Summer Night, in 1959). Interracial relationships figure in the forgotten dramas of the BFI season, but they are by no means the sole preoccupation. The works of Jamaican-born writer Barry Reckord, for instance, are about class divisions as much as racial ones. In 1962\u2019s You in Your Small Corner, an educated young black man (played by Reckord\u2019s brother, Lloyd) begins a love affair with a working-class white woman. And in Reckord\u2019s Club Havana, from 1975, Warrington comes from Jamaica to his mother\u2019s Birmingham nightclub and begins an affair with the barmaid, played by a young Julie Walters. His mother dismisses Walters as a \u201ccheap white woman\u201d \u2013 not good enough for her son. In Carbon Copy, too, Albert mingles with the white middle classes. His mother is a wealthy first-generation immigrant. \u201cIn England, people don\u2019t look down on a person for being black,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThey look down on him for being uncultured.\u201d After rediscovering his \u201cblackness\u201d, Albert falls for a British-born black woman, played by Cleo Sylvestre, who is not quite as rapturous about their mystical \u201cAfrican\u201d bond as he is. Nor is she into divisive race politics, favouring class solidarity. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to separate to keep our identity,\u201d Albert tells her. \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get together with people who\u2019ve been screwed just like we are.\u201d \u201cWhy should we assume that all black people that came to Britain after the second world war were working class?\u201d says Bourne, who has researched and written about black British history and culture for 20 years. \u201cThere have been middle-class, affluent black people coming to this country since the year dot. It\u2019s just one of those myths that needs to be addressed.\u201d Reckord came from a well-to-do Jamaican family. He earned a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1950 (brother Lloyd joined him in the UK a year later). Between them the Reckord brothers staged and performed some of the first black British works to be performed \u2013 several of which were adapted for television. There was also Guyana-born Jan Carew and his Jamaican wife Sylvia Wynter, who spent a few fruitful years in Britain in the 1950s. Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears \u2013 on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew\u2019s plays: The Big Pride (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean\u2019s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely \u201cpolitical\u201d tells its own story. It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age \u2013 even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous Rivers of Blood speech, in 1968, as a turning point. \u201cAfter that all the good work we\u2019d done before was erased and forgotten.\u201d Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: Melanie in Crossroads, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson. According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell\u2019s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. \u201cHe wanted to show a young, black character who wasn\u2019t defined by her colour,\u201d says Sylvestre. \u201cIt was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I\u2019m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, I love your character.\u2019\u201d For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British diversity. Warrington went on to star in one of the better offerings: Rising Damp. His character Philip, who claimed to be an African prince but was actually from Croydon, was often the subject of landlord Rigsby\u2019s animosity. Far less sophisticated was Love Thy Neighbour, which wrung crude, cringeworthy racial humour out of a black couple and a white couple living next door to each other. The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (Rudolph Walker) as \u201cnig-nog\u201d or \u201csambo\u201d. That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom Desmond\u2019s. Originally a theatre director, Worrell made his TV debut in 1984, after he won a scriptwriting competition held by the recently launched Channel 4. His play, Just Like Mohicans \u2013 also part of the BFI\u2019s season \u2013 was adapted into a 40-minute TV drama. It is virtually a two-hander: an encounter between an elderly Jamaican widow and a hip-hop-savvy black teenager (future EastEnders regular Gary Beadle) who breaks into her house to burgle her. The relationship steadily morphs from victim-criminal to mother-son, and the play becomes an angry clash of generational values. It was heavily autobiographical, acknowledges Worrell, who was born in St Lucia and moved to London as a child in the mid-60s. \u201cOur parents bought into that whole empire, British thing and wanted to better us and better themselves. But we were on the street. We had to suffer the slings and arrows. We were the kids that suffered Sus\u201d \u2013 \u201csuspected person\u201d laws, a 1980s precursor to stop and search. \u201cWe were walking home from school and being spat at and called all sorts of crap \u2013 and that\u2019s just by the police. Shit happened all the time. So you start to go, what the hell are we here for?\u201d The only positive representation Worrell remembers growing up was Carmen Munroe as a nurse on ITV soap General Hospital (he later cast her in Desmond\u2019s). But they still watched Love Thy Neighbour, he says. \u201cWe watched it because there we were. We could see ourselves on screen, and that was a thrill in and of itself.\u201d There was also the newsreader Trevor McDonald, Worrell adds. \u201cSo it went from the sublime to the ridiculous: Trevor reading the News at 10 and Rudy Walker being called a \u2018nig-nog\u2019 in the same evening.\u201d Desmond\u2019s was arguably the first mainstream series to simply accept black Britons as characters in their own right, and it was a huge hit. \u201cI\u2019ve always said you can sell more in comedy than you can in drama,\u201d says Worrell. \u201cYou can be more hard-hitting. You can bash them over the head and make them laugh at the same time.\u201d Times have moved on and representation has improved immensely on British television but looking back at the passionate, angry, questioning dramas of the 1960s and 70s, something has been lost. Subsequent generations seem to have had less of a platform to engage with these issues seriously \u2013 at least on the small screen. New black British talent is more likely to thrive in the US than at home, looking at the experience of actors such as Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Daniel Kaluuya, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and John Boyega. The continuity has been broken. The contributions of these black dramatists and performers is in danger of being erased, from history and from the archives. It is never too late to start remembering. Forgotten Black TV Drama is at the BFI, London, until 25 February.",

Each reader can make up their own mind about how good the work is. But what is interesting about this rough sex is what it tells us about the current cultural moment. It is supposed to be edgy and transgressive \u2013 in You Know You Want This, it feels deliberately put there to shock \u2013 and yet it\u2019s everywhere. More often than not it is women writing it and female characters desiring it, and frequently those characters are using sadomasochistic sex as a way of processing their own trauma. The #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements have shone a light on abuse and harassment, so it\u2019s no wonder a new generation of women are exploring how that manifests itself in sexual relationships. </p> <p>In Sally Rooney\u2019s much-lauded Normal People, the heroine Marianne brings the legacy of the abuse she has suffered at home into the bedroom:</p> <p>\u201cWill you hit me? she says.</p> <p>For a few seconds she hears nothing, not even his breath.</p> <p>No, he says. I don\u2019t think I want that. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>It also features in Rooney\u2019s 2017 debut novel Conversations with Friends, where Frances, another self-loathing, self-harming heroine asks a man to hit her while in bed: \u201cI felt I was a damaged person who deserved nothing. Would you ever hit me? I said. I mean if I asked you to.\u201d</p> <p>And in Roxane Gay\u2019s 2017 short-story collection, Difficult Women, the female characters are beaten, raped and strangled. Again, trauma is a factor:</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Hit me,\u2019 I said. I begged. I grabbed his hand and curled his fingers into a fist and held his fist to my breastbone. I said, \u2018Please, if you love me, hit me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It has become a common narrative device and not one limited to literary fiction, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/shortcuts/2012/jul/08/fifty-shades-grey-bad-bondage\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey demonstrates</a>. That book was heavily criticised for equating a predilection with BDSM with a traumatic childhood, and indeed these are associations that have dogged the BDSM community for many years. Pamela Stephenson Connolly wrote for this newspaper that \u201cBDSM, played in a safe and consensual manner, is not proof of mental or physical illness, essential badness or emotional damage from trauma or abusive parenting.\u201d</p> <p>This line of thinking has been noted in Rooney\u2019s work. Normal People\u2019s \u201cportrayal of the complexities of submission, dominance and consent can never quite shake the suggestion that Marianne is somehow abnormal, or damaged,\u201d wrote Helen Charman in <a href=\"http://www.thewhitereview.org/reviews/sally-rooneys-normal-people/\" title=\"\">the White Review</a>, suggesting that there was something \u201cVictorian\u201d in the narrative desire to pathologise her. Others, perhaps partly because of her Irishness, have sensed the remnants of a religious morality in Rooney\u2019s writing about sex.</p> <p>However, some women do draw a link between rough sex and trauma. Gay has written extensively about her own rape and its legacy, including fantasising about her attacker. A young woman I interviewed, who asked not to be named, told me of her own rape: \u201cAs gross as it sounds, I used to search for almost identical scenes in porn as it was the only thing I could get off on, even though the experience itself was horrendous.\u201d</p> <p>These are these women\u2019s truths, their lived experiences. No wonder they are cropping up in writing. My own novel has a scene in it of (non-consensual) choking during sex, something many of my female friends have encountered. They cite the transactional nature of dating apps and hardcore porn as factors.</p> <p> But, despite a recent outpouring in writing, it\u2019s been going on for much longer than that. The use of rough sex in fiction is undoubtedly influenced by <a href=\"https://therumpus.net/2013/10/what-men-talk-about-when-they-talk-about-mary-gaitskill/\" title=\"\">Mary Gaitskill</a>, whose excellent collection, Bad Behaviour, came out in 1988 (I was a year old when it was published, and \u2013 reading it as a teenager, I marvelled at just how weird sex could be). It remains the gold standard: nuanced, funny, genuinely transgressive, unapologetic, complicated.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/mary-gaitskill-on-the-relationship-between-love-and-torture\" title=\"\">recent New Yorker interview</a>, Gaitskill was asked about the relationship between love and torture, and she replied: \u201cLove can be a deep feeling, so it becomes connected to other deep feelings, especially but not only sexual feelings. Deep feelings can be tangled together at the roots, and some of them are not always benevolent.\u201d</p> <p>This is a notion that Gaitskill has explored extensively in her work, which tackles gender power dynamics as well as the alienation and disillusionment of advanced capitalist, urban societies. Her women are not rag dolls or victims or voids to be filled \u2013 Gaitskill\u2019s heroines live and breathe, they are complex, and funny. Even when a female character is tied up, debased and degraded she is, as author Suzanne Rivecca writes, \u201cstill ambivalent, still at war, still parsing the ludicrousness of it all in her head. She is still, in short, inescapably herself.\u201d</p> <p>The brittle humour of Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s narrator in 2018\u2019s My Year of Rest and Relaxation comes close to this, but she is one of the few recent writers who has successfully mastered that tension. Nihilistic, tragic, self-hating female characters with mental health issues are more common. Is this where we are at? Fiction needn\u2019t reflect real life, except much of this new wave is being treated as though it does. \u201cSally Rooney gets in your head,\u201d the New Yorker tells us; many thought Roupenian\u2019s Cat Person was a personal essay.</p> <p>Gaitskill released Bad Behaviour at a time when the power dynamic between men and women was shifting, and the fallout is funny. The sex was sometimes dark, but the tone was wry, and the women sharp: \u201cYou have really disappointed me,\u201d a would-be masochist tells her lover in the short story, A Romantic Weekend. The man, in turn, is frustrated by her \u201csomethingness\u201d: \u201cWith other women with whom he had been in similar situations, he had experienced a relaxing sense of emptiness within them that made it easy for him to get inside them and once there, smear himself inside their innermost territory until it was no longer theirs but his.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, for Gaitskill, no one \u2013 man or woman \u2013 comes out well. That\u2019s what makes her stories so good. One wonders what has happened in the intervening decades that so many modern heroines seem as empty and broken as Gaitskill\u2019s pervy men want women to be. They\u2019re no longer putting up a psychological struggle. They\u2019ve internalised it, they <em>want it</em>, even. That\u2019s not to say that some of this writing isn\u2019t brilliant at times, or even important; but nonetheless, I find myself craving a bit more of a fight. Instead, the reader is left feeling bleak and tawdry, as though the battle has been lost.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p>",

Then there was the moment he effortlessly patronised another young woman, student convenor Ellie Kinney \u2013 who, among other things, is a campaigner against nuclear weapons. Humphrys told her she had some \u201cworthy ideas\u201d and asked her if her activism \u201cmade her feel better\u201d, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s not intended to be insulting\u201d. Classic Humphrys, delivered with a slight undertone of contempt towards anything smacking of idealism.</p> \n<p>It should be said that Humphrys, the son of a Welsh hairdresser and who left school at 15, has had many highs in a distinguished journalistic career. He was the first reporter on the scene at the Aberfan disaster in 1966. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/10/bbc-crisis-george-entwistle-resigns\" title=\"\">His demolition</a> of former BBC director general George Entwistle \u2013 Humphrys\u2019 effective boss at the time \u2013 over Jimmy Savile, was forensic and fearless. Fellow BBC radio presenter <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6671537/John-Humphrys-QUIT-Today-programme.html\" title=\"\">Libby Purves wrote</a> in the Daily Mail, which broke the story of Humphrys\u2019 departure, that he was the \u201cscrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier\u201d in the corporation. In an institution where the establishment has traditionally been overrepresented, that was no bad thing.</p> \n<p>But lately he has been wearing his prejudices a bit too readily on his sleeve. The Today programme\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands, has called him the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/01/is-today-programme-losing-its-grip\" title=\"\">\u201clisteners\u2019 champion\u201d</a>, always willing to ask the question that \u201cordinary people\u201d wanted asked. But it seemed Humphrys was increasingly channelling the spirit of a modern Alf Garnett, harrumphing at his neighbours about the ways of the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4f1dc14c-d3f9-4cca-b6c4-b1735cf40050\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oGEGcbZd8Vw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>From wondering whether the Republic of Ireland should<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/26/john-humphrys-suggests-ireland-could-quit-eu-and-join-uk\" title=\"\"> \u201cleave the EU and throw in their lot with this country\u201d</a> to offending the transgender community (after he badgered a trans woman to \u201cprove\u201d her identity), Humphrys has appeared on occasion to delight in his own insensitivity; particularly when it comes to Brexit and women.</p> \n<p>His handling of allegations of sexual harassment in Westminster and other #MeToo cases seemed dismissive and, at times, ludicrous. Interviewing <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5039639/Radio-4-host-John-Humphrys-today-come-fire.html\" title=\"\">William Hague</a>, the Tory peer who has campaigned on behalf of victims of sexual violence, he asked: \u201cThere\u2019s not a danger, is there, that if you conflate mass rape with somebody touching somebody\u2019s knee, perhaps accidentally in the House of Commons, that we get it out of proportion?\u201d Perhaps \u201cpeople will be afraid to ask somebody else out for the evening or indeed ask them out for a proper date, maybe eventually to marry them\u201d.</p> \n<p>Then there was the interview with the then director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, when he suggested \u201cthe scales have been tipped a little too far\u201d in favour of victims in sexual assault cases.

      "bodyText": "On the morning it emerged that John Humphrys would leave the Today programme this year after fronting it for 32 years, there were a few moments right at the end that may have reminded some of his listeners why they had longed for that day to come. There was the faintly incredulous tone with which Humphrys enunciated the words of \u201cheal and shine\u201d, used in a tweet by Yoko Ono. Then there was the moment he effortlessly patronised another young woman, student convenor Ellie Kinney \u2013 who, among other things, is a campaigner against nuclear weapons. Humphrys told her she had some \u201cworthy ideas\u201d and asked her if her activism \u201cmade her feel better\u201d, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s not intended to be insulting\u201d. Classic Humphrys, delivered with a slight undertone of contempt towards anything smacking of idealism. It should be said that Humphrys, the son of a Welsh hairdresser and who left school at 15, has had many highs in a distinguished journalistic career. He was the first reporter on the scene at the Aberfan disaster in 1966. His demolition of former BBC director general George Entwistle \u2013 Humphrys\u2019 effective boss at the time \u2013 over Jimmy Savile, was forensic and fearless. Fellow BBC radio presenter Libby Purves wrote in the Daily Mail, which broke the story of Humphrys\u2019 departure, that he was the \u201cscrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier\u201d in the corporation. In an institution where the establishment has traditionally been overrepresented, that was no bad thing. But lately he has been wearing his prejudices a bit too readily on his sleeve. The Today programme\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands, has called him the \u201clisteners\u2019 champion\u201d, always willing to ask the question that \u201cordinary people\u201d wanted asked. But it seemed Humphrys was increasingly channelling the spirit of a modern Alf Garnett, harrumphing at his neighbours about the ways of the world. From wondering whether the Republic of Ireland should \u201cleave the EU and throw in their lot with this country\u201d to offending the transgender community (after he badgered a trans woman to \u201cprove\u201d her identity), Humphrys has appeared on occasion to delight in his own insensitivity; particularly when it comes to Brexit and women. His handling of allegations of sexual harassment in Westminster and other #MeToo cases seemed dismissive and, at times, ludicrous. Interviewing William Hague, the Tory peer who has campaigned on behalf of victims of sexual violence, he asked: \u201cThere\u2019s not a danger, is there, that if you conflate mass rape with somebody touching somebody\u2019s knee, perhaps accidentally in the House of Commons, that we get it out of proportion?\u201d Perhaps \u201cpeople will be afraid to ask somebody else out for the evening or indeed ask them out for a proper date, maybe eventually to marry them\u201d. Then there was the interview with the then director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, when he suggested \u201cthe scales have been tipped a little too far\u201d in favour of victims in sexual assault cases. No wonder the End Violence Against Women campaign called on the BBC to \u201cstop Humphrys doing these\u201d interviews. The battle for equal pay conducted by BBC China editor Carrie Gracie lost him further friends among the BBC\u2019s female audience. A tape of him talking off-air about the case was leaked:\u201cDear God. She\u2019s actually suggested that you should lose money \u2013 you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Humphrys told the BBC\u2019s Washington correspondent, Jon Sopel. The Sun described his comments as \u201csilly banter between old mates\u201d. Ah, banter. Has there ever been a word more overused by alpha males after their sneering contempt gets them into trouble? In the end, Humphrys agreed to halve his salary of between \u00a3600,000 and \u00a3650,000. On Brexit, Humphrys\u2019 tone when quizzing remainers has made him a lightning rod for all those who believe the BBC is too pro-leave. When journalist Tim Walker called for his Twitter followers to \u201cretweet please if you no longer have confidence in John Humphrys to report impartially on Brexit\u201d almost 7,000 complied. But before the referendum at least, he was believed to be a bit of a remainer. I have no idea whether this is true.

      "bodyText": "When Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself Venezuela\u2019s interim president last month, he appeared to leapfrog a generation of rival opposition leaders and offer a dramatic way past the infighting and tactical differences that had hobbled previous efforts to unseat Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.But the rise of the fresh-faced opposition leader was orchestrated by a Harvard-educated economist with a checkered history in Venezuelan politics, who continues to direct opposition strategy and coordinate with US and regional officials from under house arrest in Venezuela. Interviews with Venezuelan opposition figures and officials in Washington have confirmed that Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a divisive former mayor of a Caracas borough, helped engineer Guaid\u00f3\u2019s meteoric rise \u2013 and still harbours ambitions to become Venezuela\u2019s next president. Since 2017, L\u00f3pez \u2013 a distant relative of the South American revolutionary hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2013 has been confined to his home in the moneyed Chacao district of Caracas where he once served as mayor. But he handpicked Guiad\u00f3 to lead his People\u2019s Will party in congress and continues to play a central role in the campaign to force Maduro from office. \u201cLeopoldo\u2019s in contact with everyone, every day, constantly,\u201d L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife, Lilian Tintori, told the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s been sewing together an opposition that\u2019s totally united and strong and pushing in the same direction, which is what we are seeing now.\u201d L\u00f3pez has long been a polarising figure, advocating a more confrontational approach than some other opposition leaders. \u201cHe is often described as arrogant, vindictive, and power-hungry \u2013 but party officials also concede his enduring popularity, charisma, and talent as an organiser,\u201d a Caracas-based US diplomat wrote in a 2009 cable published by WikiLeaks. After anti-government protests in 2014, L\u00f3pez was given a 14-year prison sentence for inciting violence, following a trial activists denounced as politically motivated and flawed. Moved to house arrest in 2017, L\u00f3pez is barred from speaking to the press and remains under close guard by police who take his photo with a copy of the day\u2019s newspaper every four hours \u2013 \u201clike a hostage\u201d, Tintori said. But using encrypted messaging apps, he remains in contact with other opposition activists in Venezuela, Colombia and the US. Winning over Trump Convinced that support from the White House would be crucial to toppling Maduro, L\u00f3pez and his allies have made a concerted effort to win over the Trump administration. Sources confirmed scores of meetings between US officials and L\u00f3pez surrogates \u2013 including Tintori \u2013 in Washington and around the globe. In February 2017, Tintori dined with Donald Trump at the White House, in a meeting facilitated by Senator Marco Rubio, who has been instrumental in shaping Trump\u2019s Venezuela policy. Hours later, the president tweeted a photo of himself with Tintori, Rubio and Vice-President Mike Pence, calling for L\u00f3pez to be \u201cimmediately\u201d freed. \u201cThe Trump administration took a side, supporting the Venezuelan people because they know how we suffer,\u201d Tintori said. She added that similar lobbying efforts with the Obama administration \u2013 including a meeting with the then vice-president Joe Biden in February 2015 \u2013 had achieved less. The restrictions on L\u00f3pez \u2013 and the fact Tintori\u2019s passport was revoked in September 2017 \u2013 have required him to delegate many diplomatic responsibilities to exiles. One such figure is David Smolansky, a former mayor from L\u00f3pez\u2019s party, People\u2019s Will, who fled Venezuela in disguise in late 2017 when a warrant was issued for his arrest and now lives in Washington. Another is Carlos Vecchio, L\u00f3pez\u2019s friend and fellow a Harvard graduate, who arrived in Washington in 2014, also after fleeing Venezuela. \u201cThis effort we are now seeing really got going when we decided not to participate in the fraudulent elections last May,\u201d said Vecchio, who was recently appointed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to the US. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided to get a real movement going around the world not to recognise Maduro as legitimate on 10 January.\u201d Desperate to build momentum, Vecchio and Smolansky worked their contacts in Washington, including Rubio and the Democrat Bob Menendez. People\u2019s Will members also took advantage of the 175 embassies hosted in the US capital, speaking with diplomats from around the world, especially Latin America. \u201cWe started working to get people not only to declare Maduro as illegitimate, but to recognise the leader of the national assembly as the constitutionally legitimate interim president of Venezuela,\u2019 Vecchio said. The campaign was further boosted last year when Brazil and Colombia elected rightwing leaders, Jair Bolsonaro and Iv\u00e1n Duque, both of whom had campaigned promising a harder line towards Maduro. The multi-pronged diplomatic assault yielded the results L\u00f3pez had been waiting years for when Juan Guaid\u00f3 received a call from Pence on 22 January. A US official with knowledge of the call said Pence promised Guaid\u00f3 that the Trump government would back him if he took the presidential oath amid mass demonstrations planned for the next day. Pence placed the call after receiving Trump\u2019s blessing at an Oval Office meeting also attended by Rubio, three other Florida Republicans and the national security adviser, John Bolton. Guaid\u00f3 took the oath \u2013 and the US was as good as its word, recognising him as Venezuela\u2019s president within minutes. The move took many diplomats and members of the opposition by surprise, but by the evening of 23 January, a dozen Latin American countries and Canada \u2013 who Tintori had also been lobbying \u2013 had followed suit. \u201cGuaid\u00f3\u2019s courageous efforts to restore democracy and constitutional order come at great risk to himself and his family, but he has broad international support as nations worldwide recognise Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s criminal usurper,\u201d Rubio told the Guardian, adding that the US would continue to play an important role, through diplomatic recognition, financial and humanitarian aid. For now, the focus remains on Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 a previously little-known politician transformed into an overnight celebrity. But those close to L\u00f3pez doubt he will stay in the background forever. And some suspect it is only a matter of time until he seeks the keys to the presidential palace himself. \u201cObviously there are aspirations. There are people that want to be there, right?\u201d said Juan Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda, another prominent party member and L\u00f3pez ally. \u201cIn People\u2019s Will we have a candidate, who is Leopoldo.

Absolutely. Absolutely.\u201d But some believe L\u00f3pez\u2019s ambitions could be derailed by the sudden rise of his protege. Guaid\u00f3 has captured the hearts and minds of millions of Venezuelans, and L\u00f3pez may find his dreams of leading Venezuela have to be put on hold. \u201cGuaid\u00f3 is a messianic figure now,\u201d said Vanessa Neumann, president of the risk analysis firm Asymmetrica and occasional adviser to various opposition members. \u201cIf he calls free elections, Guaid\u00f3 will win.

The advice for parents and carers includes: Get enough good-quality sleep. Leave phones outside the bedroom when it is bedtime. Talk about sharing photos and information online, and how photos and words are sometimes manipulated. Make sure you and your children are aware of and abide by their school\u2019s policy on screen time. Take a break after a couple of hours sitting or lying down using a screen. Advise children to put their screens away while crossing the road or doing an activity that needs their full attention. Talk with your children about using screens and what they are watching. A change in behaviour can be a sign they are distressed - make sure they know they can always speak an adult if they feel uncomfortable with screen or social media use. Consider screen-free meal times so you can have face-to-face conversations, with adults giving their full attention to children. Try using features on some devices and platforms to keep track of time spent looking at screens or on social media. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2019.

Hennessy would not say if any of those lawyers were current informants but said she was \u201cconfident in the royal commission\u2019s power to be able to advise anybody if there is any inappropriate current practice\u201d. It\u2019s understood that up to six lawyers have been implicated. Law Council of Australia president Arthur Moses SC told Radio National that the revelations were \u201cvery troubling\u201d and criticised Victoria Police for allowing the practice to occur. He said that lawyers were only allowed to breach client privilege in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d when the safety of a member of the public was at stake. \u201cFor instance if a client tells you that they are going to murder somebody or assault somebody there are exceptions in the ethical obligations of lawyers in those circumstances,\u201d he said. Asked if he was aware of similar arrangements between lawyers and police in New South Wales, Moses said he was \u201cnot at liberty to disclose matters\u201d that were not in the public realm. In a statement, NSW Bar Association president Tim Game SC said the association had met with the director of public prosecutions, the NSW Crime Commission, the Law Enforcement Commission and NSW police to discuss the issue of lawyers acting as informants, and he expected \u201cto be in a position to make further comment in the near future\u201d. NSW Police said it had audited its informant register dating back to 2003. \u201cNo evidence of alleged breaches of legal professional privilege have been identified nor has any conduct similar to that alleged in the Victorian \u2018Lawyer X\u2019 matter become apparent,\u201d it said in a statement. Law Institute of Victoria president Stuart Webb said in a memorandum to members on Wednesday that the organisation was \u201cunaware of any other legal professionals who have breached any obligations of confidentiality\u201d. \u201cWe support the royal commission and its work, and support remedies to ensure the integrity of the justice system is upheld,\u201d Webb said. Victoria Police said that it was unaware until recently that Lawyer X had been registered as an informer in 1995, two years after a good behaviour bond was given for a drug charge that saw two co-accused convicted of drug trafficking. \u201cThis information had not previously been identified due to shortcomings in our record keeping practices related to informers in the mid-1990s,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cThese practices have since been comprehensively improved.\u201d Hennessy said the royal commission was still expected to hand down its preliminary findings on 1 July and that Hyde would not be replaced as a commissioner. Instead chief commissioner Margaret McMurdo will conduct the commission alone and call on outside experts \u201cin the event that she requires the advice and the assistance of those that understand operational intelligence [and] informant management practices.\u201d The royal commission will hold its first directions hearing on 15 February.",

The comments followed reports in the Australian newspaper that as many as six women have made allegations about Doyle to police, dating back to his time as a teacher at Geelong College 40 years ago. Doyle\u2019s lawyer, Nick Ruskin, declined to comment to Guardian Australia. The former Victorian Liberal party leader resigned as mayor in February 2018, two months after a sexual harassment complaint by his council colleague, Tessa Sullivan, was made public. Sullivan resigned following the complaint. Another councillor, Cathy Oake, also made an allegation against Doyle. An independent investigation into the City of Melbourne matters by Ian Freckelton QC, released in March, found that Doyle had sexually harassed both women and made four adverse findings against him. A City of Melbourne staff member has also made allegations. It has been reported that one of the women who have made a formal complaint to police did so after being frustrated at the outcome of the City of Melbourne inquiry. The lord mayor, Sally Capp, defended the City of Melbourne\u2019s handling of the matter, saying: \u201cWe have as an organisation ... been complying with the relevant obligations and responsibilities we have under the [Local Government Act].\u201d A second investigation into allegations connected to Doyle\u2019s role as chairman of Melbourne Health, from which he also resigned in February 2018, was inconclusive. Doyle has repeatedly denied the allegations against him. He has also challenged the Freckelton report in a case that is due before the Supreme Court of Victoria later this month.",

Nicknamed \u201cElhoot\u201d, the singer made music that merged African traditions with western pop. He had become a potent symbol of a different Sudan: less religiously conservative, more secular and outward-looking. He was known as Sudan\u2019s \u201cidol of the youth\u201d, and now those fans are taking to the streets again. They have emerged at the forefront of the recent protests against the regime of president Omar al-Bashir demanding that he stand down. The impetus for the involvement of Elhoot\u2019s still loyal fans is the cultural and charitable organisation the singer set up before his death. Known as the \u201cMoons of the Countryside\u201d, its members have included some who were arrested and killed in the government\u2019s crackdown. One of those killed at a protest in Omdurman, Khartoum\u2019s twin city, was 25-year-old Salih Salih. Bearing pictures of the late singer, he had arrived at the gathering with two younger brothers after the group urged supporters to demonstrate instead of celebrating the anniversary of Abdelaziz\u2019s death. \u201cWe\u2019re not political at all.

If many supporters of Moons of the Countryside are not overtly political, the significance of Abdelaziz as a continuing icon \u2013 not least in the protests \u2013 is more nuanced, touching a younger generation in Sudan that is chafing at social restrictions. Although the regime \u2013 including Bashir, who danced on stage with Abdelaziz \u2013 attempted to co-opt the singer because of his popularity, his relationship with the authorities in Khartoum was fraught. He was frequently arrested and flogged publicly for drinking alcohol. Abdelaziz\u2019s emergence as Sudan\u2019s most popular singer also tracked the eruptions of Sudan\u2019s recent history. Born in October 1967 in Khartoum Bahri, he came to prominence as a singer at a time when his style of music was forbidden on Sudan\u2019s national television and radio. During the years of the war with south Sudan, however, when many singers, artists and politicians had to flee the country during increasing conservative religious intolerance, Abdelaziz stayed in Sudan and continued to perform, risking arrest. \u201cHe told me he just dared to do it in that crazy time,\u201d said Mohamed Wahbi, a journalist and author of the only book on Abdelaziz, The Light Thief, describing the devotion of his fanbase at that time. \u201cThey mimicked his look, his haircut and even the way he spoke. [Now] they want to see a Sudan of social justice and without [religious] public order laws.\u201d For many of the fans who followed him at this time, says history professor Abdullahi Ibrahim, the singer \u201cpresented a symbol of a subculture\u201d. \u201cMahmoud Abdelaziz was always with people and he was outspoken about people\u2019s issues. Many of his songs are about that,\u201d Mohammed Babkir, head of Moons of the Countryside, told the Guardian. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that they humiliated him publicly. They wanted him to join their party and follow their agenda. But he refused, so they punished him,\u201d said Babkir, hours before he himself was arrested last month. He has not been heard from since. Meanwhile, Abdelaziz\u2019s followers have continued to join protests. Reem Osman, 21, is a middle-class student protesting for the first time, and a member of Moons of the Countryside. \u201cIn the past I used to just watch the protests on the TV. But now we\u2019ve reached a very hard point, we lack basic rights in everything,\u201d said Osman. \u201cIf our revolution does not succeed, I will leave Sudan.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asylum seekers and refugees are waiting as long as five years for specialist medical treatment even when it has been formally recommended by the Australian government\u2019s contracted doctors, new data has revealed. Support workers and medical groups have accused the government of maintaining a \u201cdangerous and sometimes fatal\u201d system of care on Manus Island and Nauru, as MPs prepare to vote on a medical transfers bill which could see up to 1,000 people access long-awaited treatment within weeks. The analyses of patient data and letters to MPs calling for urgent and dramatic change come as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res launch a telehealth service to resume treating the patients it was forced to leave behind when it was kicked off Nauru by the Nauruan government last year. Aggregated data from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, seen by Guardian Australia, revealed dozens of people are still waiting for medical transfer years after it was recommended by doctors employed by the federal government\u2019s contracted health provider, IHMS. A medical transfer was recommended by at least one IHMS doctor for half of the sample, as they had been diagnosed with medical conditions that could not be treated on site and needed specialist care. \u201cMedical transfer requests are made sparsely and reluctantly because doctors know they will be blocked by the department,\u201d a former IHMS doctor, Peter Young, said. The data revealed waits of mostly two to three years, but included six people who have waited more than four years for transfer. Two men on Manus Island, aged under 40, were first recommended for transfer more than five years ago. One suffers chronic migraines and headaches, epilepsy and blurred vision, and requires a neurosurgical or neurological consultation, the data sheet said. The other requires orthopaedic treatment, according to the data sheet, and suffers an anterior cruciate ligament injury, arthritis and mental illness. The data, drawn from IHMS medical records of 50 of its 70 casework clients on Manus Island and Nauru, provided a snapshot of what was a far bigger problem, the ASRC said. \u201cThere are over 1,080 people held offshore, and the ASRC has a waiting list of 215 people needing our help to push for desperately needed medical treatment,\u201d said the ASRC detention advocacy manager, Natasha Blucher. \u201cThe crisis is bigger and more severe than the government is saying.\u201d All patients listed in the dataset remain on Manus Island and Nauru, the ASRC said. The Manus Island records only continue until March 2018 \u2013 when IHMS left the island, but the ASRC said none of the patients had been transferred since Pacific International took over. The data release comes as MPs prepare to vote on the migration amendment (urgent medical transfers) bill, which seeks to legislate expedited medical evacuations for refugees and asylum seekers to Australia with the recommendation of two doctors, and without government interference except in cases of national security. The federal government has said allowing doctors to dictate transfers is a threat to national security, while proponents of the bill say it includes ministerial discretion to refuse a transfer on national security grounds. On Thursday News Corp reported unsourced Asio advice that the bill would dismantle the \u201cthird pillar\u201d of the government\u2019s border control policy. It included the concession that up to 1,000 people would be expected to be transferred to Australia within weeks of the bill passing, once the current blocks were lifted. In a letter to all federal MPs this week, Doctors for Refugees said the current barriers to an Australian standard of care raised the question of \u201cwhether the Australian government believes that a group of people under our custody are less deserving of medical care than others\u201d. \u201cThe Australian public has been repeatedly advised by politicians that care provided offshore is broadly comparable to care on mainland Australia, but there is an enormous and growing body of evidence which contradicts this notion. \u201cThe factor which continues to have the most profound negative effect on provision of care in serious cases is the delay/prevention of medical transfers.\u201d Doctors for Refugees said it had reviewed more than 400 cases and found inherent factors including inadequate facilities, geographical isolation, poor communication between medical service providers, bureaucracy, and delays by the Australian Border Force, had led to a lack of adequate medical care. The organisation said that mental illness was implicated in eight of the deaths in the offshore system since 2013. On Thursday the international medical NGO, MSF, announced it would resume treating its patients on Nauru through a telehealth service, in order to address the continuing mental health crisis. The psychological consultations will be available for all former patients who are still on Nauru, including refugees, asylum seekers and Nauruans. \u201cSince our forced departure in October, we continue to hear from patients who are experiencing severe levels of mental health distress and who struggle to access quality psychological care,\u201d said Christine Rufener, a clinical psychologist and MSF mental health activity manager. \u201cThis telehealth service is MSF\u2019s only remaining option to continue to act on our medical and ethical commitment to former patients.\u201d MSF was engaged by the Nauruan government to deliver mental health services on the island from November 2017 and operated an open-door policy treating local Nauruans as well as the asylum seeker and refugee population sent there under Australia\u2019s offshore processing system. However in October the Nauruan government abruptly ordered the medical NGO to cease its services immediately and leave the country, accusing it of conspiring against it. In return, MSF publicly called for the immediate evacuation of all refugees and asylum seekers from Nauru, detailing the extraordinarily high rates of mental illness.",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales fisheries workers are attempting to rescue distressed Murray cod near Menindee in the state\u2019s west by catching them in nets and trucking them to a fish hatchery hundreds of kilometres away. The NSW primary industries department (DPI) confirmed the operation was under way on Thursday morning and was necessary because authorities would be cutting off water flows from Menindee\u2019s weir 32 \u201cin the near future to maintain town water supply\u201d. As part of drought management, WaterNSW has indicated it will cut off flows from weir 32 to maintain water supply to stock and domestic users and high security water licence holders around Lake Wetherill and the weir pool. Cutting off the water flows would make already distressed fish at the site of the state\u2019s mass fish kills more susceptible to danger from low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, the department said. The fish are in the pool immediately downstream of weir 32 and if they can be safely removed will either be trucked in a fish-stocking truck to the Narrandera Fisheries Centre \u2013 590km from Menindee \u2013 to be used in breeding programs or they will be released in the lower Darling near Wentworth, 240km away. Cameron Lay, the NSW DPI\u2019s Murray Darling program leader, said fisheries officers were mid-operation by noon on Thursday and initially focused on a group of 20 to 30 large Murray cod that had accumulated in a single area on the surface of the water. \u201cThey\u2019re exhibiting very unusual behaviour, they\u2019re at the surface of the water and side by side,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to take advantage of a very small source of oxygenated water that\u2019s coming through weir 32.\u201d Lay said the first goal of the operation was to maintain the genetic and cultural connectivity of those particular fish with that part of the river by taking them to the hatchery for use in breeding programs. \u201cThis will allow us to restock the river when conditions improve with direct descendants from the river,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd eventually we\u2019ll return those actual fish back to the Darling river once they\u2019ve finished their role with our breeding program.\u201d Early assessments suggested the 20 to 30 fish were all well enough to be suitable for the breeding program, he said. Once the first group is transported, fisheries officers will decide if more fish from that location need to be moved to the hatchery or downstream. Because of the decision to cut flows from weir 32, there is a risk that more fish kills might follow. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible, however WaterNSW have very few options available because the weir pool is part of critical town water supply,\u201d Lay said. Under WaterNSW definitions, stock and domestic use refers to normal household purposes around the house and garden and drinking water for stock. High security use can apply to town water supply, or to irrigation of permanently established crops, such as orchards. The DPI said relocating the fish was not their preferred solution because of the additional pressure it places on already stressed fish. But it had assessed that the risk of leaving them at their current location was greater because the decision to cut flows from weir 32 would leave the fish more susceptible to threats from low levels of dissolved oxygen. Lay acknowledged that there was a possibility that some of the fish might not survive the rescue attempt. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a risk. We\u2019ve been well aware of that from the beginning of this operation but we consider the risk of leaving them in the river was far greater,\u201d he said. Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, said the plan was a sign of \u201cdesperate times and desperate measures\u201d. \u201cI think there\u2019s some reasonable argument for doing this but we need to know what happens,\u201d he said. He said trucking the fish hundreds of kilometres between Menindee, Wentworth and Narrandera could also be risky. \u201cMy uncertainty is if these fish are already stressed, the question is what would the operation do in terms of causing further stress?\u201d Kingsford said. \u201cAnd the bigger issue is if we\u2019ve got a river without much water in it, how often are we going to have to do this, how often are we going to have to intervene to save fish in this river?\u201d Late on Thursday the department said fisheries officers had removed 20 fish from the river and they were on the road to the hatchery at Narrandera. \u201cThe fish are being taken to Narrandera Fisheries Centre, as it is expected the water quality and monitoring systems there will give them the best chance of recovery,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIt is expected that the 20 Murray Cod will have a productive potential of more than 100,000 fingerlings per year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A deportation flight carrying 29 people landed in Jamaica from the UK on Wednesday amid concern over Home Office tactics.</p> <p>More than 50 foreign national offenders who were being held in detention centres had reportedly been due to leave on the flight. But many of them were able to have their removal cancelled after their lawyers took action.</p> <p>The Titian Airways flight was not listed on the arrivals board at Kingston\u2019s Norman Manley airport when it touched down from Birmingham at 1.43pm local time on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Home Office initially indicated many of those due to be deported were rapists and murderers. Officials provided a breakdown of crimes committed by the offenders on Wednesday that said one person on the flight had been convicted of murder and four of various sexual offences including rape.</p> <p>Fourteen people on the flight \u2013 almost half of those being deported \u2013 had been convicted of drugs offences. Six had been convicted of violent crimes including grievous bodily harm and battery, and three of firearms and weapon offences. One person\u2019s conviction was for dangerous driving.</p> <p>The Home Office said the total combined sentences of the 28 men and one woman on the flight amounted to more than 150 years. Lawyers, human rights activists and others have expressed concern about the charter flight and the last-minute nature of the decisions to remove some people from it.</p> <p>As it landed the plane went to a far corner of the airstrip and police vehicles quickly gathered around it.</p> <p>Officers from the Jamaica Constabulary Force went on board, checked the passenger list and taking people off one by one. It took about an hour before a convoy of vehicles left the airport \u2013 two police cars with flashing blue lights, accompanied by unmarked SUVs, a white police coach and an open-backed truck carrying the passengers\u2019 luggage. They had been restricted to a suitcase each so it was barely a quarter full.</p> <p>They were taken to Harman Barracks, in downtown Kingston, to be processed. About 40 family members, along with onlookers and the press, waited at the gates.</p> <p>A woman in her 70s was waiting for her son and said he had been forced to leave behind the family he raised in the UK. He had travelled frequently to Jamaica before being convicted and jailed for an assault with a knife and later held in a deportation centre.</p> <p>\u201cHe has friends who care for him very much up there [in the UK],\u201d she said. \u201cHe has six kids there and five here, he never forgets his family.\u201d She said he had been fighting deportation and his lawyers managed to get him off a flight in 2018 but not this time. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know he was going to be on this flight, it was last night he found out. If he knew before, people would\u2019ve got things to him, but he\u2019s with his family so he doesn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p> <p>Some people waiting became irate with local media filming the proceedings.</p> <p>One woman, who referred to herself as La La, said she was waiting for a friend.

      "bodyText": "A deportation flight carrying 29 people landed in Jamaica from the UK on Wednesday amid concern over Home Office tactics. More than 50 foreign national offenders who were being held in detention centres had reportedly been due to leave on the flight. But many of them were able to have their removal cancelled after their lawyers took action. The Titian Airways flight was not listed on the arrivals board at Kingston\u2019s Norman Manley airport when it touched down from Birmingham at 1.43pm local time on Wednesday. The Home Office initially indicated many of those due to be deported were rapists and murderers. Officials provided a breakdown of crimes committed by the offenders on Wednesday that said one person on the flight had been convicted of murder and four of various sexual offences including rape. Fourteen people on the flight \u2013 almost half of those being deported \u2013 had been convicted of drugs offences. Six had been convicted of violent crimes including grievous bodily harm and battery, and three of firearms and weapon offences. One person\u2019s conviction was for dangerous driving. The Home Office said the total combined sentences of the 28 men and one woman on the flight amounted to more than 150 years. Lawyers, human rights activists and others have expressed concern about the charter flight and the last-minute nature of the decisions to remove some people from it. As it landed the plane went to a far corner of the airstrip and police vehicles quickly gathered around it. Officers from the Jamaica Constabulary Force went on board, checked the passenger list and taking people off one by one. It took about an hour before a convoy of vehicles left the airport \u2013 two police cars with flashing blue lights, accompanied by unmarked SUVs, a white police coach and an open-backed truck carrying the passengers\u2019 luggage. They had been restricted to a suitcase each so it was barely a quarter full. They were taken to Harman Barracks, in downtown Kingston, to be processed. About 40 family members, along with onlookers and the press, waited at the gates. A woman in her 70s was waiting for her son and said he had been forced to leave behind the family he raised in the UK. He had travelled frequently to Jamaica before being convicted and jailed for an assault with a knife and later held in a deportation centre. \u201cHe has friends who care for him very much up there [in the UK],\u201d she said. \u201cHe has six kids there and five here, he never forgets his family.\u201d She said he had been fighting deportation and his lawyers managed to get him off a flight in 2018 but not this time. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know he was going to be on this flight, it was last night he found out. If he knew before, people would\u2019ve got things to him, but he\u2019s with his family so he doesn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Some people waiting became irate with local media filming the proceedings. One woman, who referred to herself as La La, said she was waiting for a friend. She added: \u201cThe reason why some people come back here with nothing is because they forget their people, they lose contact with friends and family and in those cases, they come back to an island which they may have left as a child. All those years they\u2019ve been there, they do something and they send them back. Everyone for them is over there [in the UK], often their parents but they haven\u2019t got anyone here, you\u2019re sending them back to die.\u201d Anyone without relatives to stay with would be helped by the National Organisation for Deported Migrants (NODM) and other housing charities, said Oswald Dawkins, who runs the NODM. He felt most of those on board would have someone they knew on the island, but he felt the Jamaican government should be doing more to help those sent back. \u201cWe have a flight that arrives here every month from the US but most people don\u2019t even realise it, not even the media,\u201d he said. There are also calls for the UK government to change its stance. The former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw, who has conducted two independent reviews of immigration detention for the Home Office, said the inclusion of people who had lived in the UK since childhood on the flights was \u201cvery cruel\u201d. Shaw recommended in a report published in July 2018 that foreign national offenders who had been in the UK since childhood should not be removed. Omar Khan, of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, expressed concern about the late cancellation of some detainees\u2019 places on the flight: \u201cThese ad hoc reprieves are a reflection of the dysfunctional nature of the system.\u201d He raised concerns about the government\u2019s decision to go ahead with the deportation flight before the publication of the Windrush lessons learned review. Some people were told they would not be flying a few hours before the plane was due to leave. Others were removed from the flight just before it took off and returned to detention centres. Shaw said that while the legislation introduced in 2007 was clear that those who had served sentences of more than a year should be deported, there was some room for manoeuvre. \u201cThe Home Office does have some discretion on this issue.

The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has signalled over the past 48 hours that the opposition is open to examining a new proposition from the government setting up an independent medical review panel to vet medical transfers of asylum seekers from offshore detention. The government has floated the medical review panel to address internal concerns about the condition of people held in offshore detention, and to try and peel parliamentary support away from the crossbench proposal. If the Coalition loses the vote next week, it will be the first time a government has lost a substantial vote on the floor since 1929. The last time a vote was lost, an election was called the next day. Shorten said on Wednesday that Labor \u201cat this stage\u201d remained supportive of the crossbench proposal on medical transfers. But he signalled a possible shift, noting the government\u2019s proposal would be examined by the opposition, and he wasn\u2019t \u201ca purist\u201d. The potential shift by Labor follows a significant intensification of the government\u2019s rhetoric against the crossbench proposal this week. While Scott Morrison declared on Tuesday night during an appearance with the Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones he will \u201csimply ignore it\u201d if the crossbench bill passes, because it was \u201cstupid\u201d \u2013 the government has moved into overdrive to try and kill the proposal and avoid the defeat next week. On Wednesday, the prime minister told reporters if the bill passed, Australia could be forced to take paedophiles, rapists and murderers. Advice from agencies also found its way to the the Australian newspaper on Thursday. The report quoted a \u201cclassified briefing\u201d from the Department of Home Affairs, based on advice from Asio and Australian Border Force, saying up to 1,000 asylum-seekers on Manus Island and Nauru would be expected to start arriving \u201cwithin weeks\u201d of the bill being passed, and being transferred within another four to five weeks. Guardian Australia has asked the prime minister\u2019s office for a copy of the advice. Thus far, it has not been forthcoming. Phelps told Guardian Australia the current system wasn\u2019t working, and parliament needed to find a medical solution to a medical problem. \u201cMedical decisions on urgent temporary medical transfers from Manus Island and Nauru need to be made by doctors and not bureaucrats,\u201d she said. \u201cBureaucrats have a demonstrated history of obstructing and delaying medical treatment. \u201cWhat the Morrison government has offered so far does not go far enough, and no one should cave in to the prime minister\u2019s scare tactics and deliberate misinformation\u201d. \u201cLabor, the Greens and crossbenchers who supported the bill in December should still support it now otherwise seriously ill refugees will be forced to continue to fight for their lives through the courts. \u201cIn some cases, that can be life-threatening.\u201d The bill currently before the parliament was initiated by Phelps, but amended by the South Australian senator Tim Storer. According to briefing materials prepared to explain the bill, it includes a power allowing the minister to refuse a transfer on national security grounds, and it allows the minister to override a transfer recommended by two or more initial treating doctors. The bill establishes an expert medical panel to professionally reassess any transfer rejected by the minister, other than those rejected on national security grounds, and it creates time limits to ensure an efficient process for urgent traumatic medical events. Storer told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe legislation passed by the Senate does not jeopardise the security of our borders. \u201cThe people-smuggling trade has not resumed. Several hundred people are already in Australia for medical reasons with the consent of the government, and claims that this measure will jeopardise the security of our borders are incorrect and yet another distasteful attempt to politicise what is a humanitarian issue.\u201d In an attempt to temper the government\u2019s escalating political rhetoric, Labor has also released legal advice which says the crossbench bill, in its current form, \u201cincludes security checks and empowers the minister to have regard to any security issues, as broadly defined, at multiple stages of the process\u201d. The government has attacked that legal advice, saying the lawyer who prepared it is an active member of the Labor party. The shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, said the Melbourne barrister Matthew Albert, who prepared the advice confirming ministerial discretion on security grounds, was a \u201cvery accomplished lawyer\u201d. Albert has a postgraduate degree in international refugee law from the University of Oxford. \u201cThe most important thing here is the ministerial discretion, and what our advice shows and what others have concluded is that when a minister retains a right to refuse people\u2019s entry to Australia on the basis of national security considerations then that allows us to maintain that strong border protection position that we have in the Labor party,\u201d Chalmers told Sky News on Thursday. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, also urged Labor not to be \u201cspooked\u201d by the government and to hold its ground. \u201cThey\u2019ve [the government] have got nothing.

Adam Schiff, has long said that sending Mueller the transcripts from the probe into Russian election interference would be one of his first actions. Two associates of President Donald Trump have already been charged with lying to the committee, and Schiff has said Mueller should consider whether additional perjury charges are warranted as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. <br></p> <p>As is tradition, the committee will meet behind closed doors. A notice for the meeting says that one of the agenda items is \u201ctransmission of certain committee transcripts to the Department of Justice.\u201d A person familiar with the meeting said the vote is to send the transcripts to Mueller\u2019s office. The person asked not to be named because committee business is confidential. </p> <p>The vote comes the morning after Trump criticized \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d in his State of the Union speech. Schiff has indicated that he will re-open parts of the committee probe that Republicans closed last March, concluding there was no evidence of conspiracy or collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Democrats strongly objected at the time, saying that the Republicans prematurely closed the investigation. </p> </blockquote> <p>Trump associate Roger Stone was charged with lying to the panel after Mueller requested his interview transcript, and the committee voted to release it. </p> <p>Among the transcripts now expected to be released are interviews with Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his longtime spokeswoman, Hope Hicks; and his former bodyguard Keith Schiller. There are dozens of other transcripts of interviews with former Obama administration officials and Trump associates. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5ae693e4b042feedcb84a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-06T13:53:27.167Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo penned an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/cuomo-roe-abortion-trump.html\">op-ed</a> in the New York Times Wednesday responding to Donald Trump\u2019s call in the State of the Union to outlaw abortion rules like the ones the state just passed.</p> <p>\u201cLawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth,\u201d Trump said in the speech, also taking a shot at <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/politics/ralph-northam-third-trimester-abortion/index.html\">comments</a> on the issue by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. \u201cTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb.</p> <p>He\u2019s referring to New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/legislation/reproductive-health-act\">Reproductive Health Act</a>, which allows abortions after 24 weeks if the woman\u2019s health is in danger or if the fetus would not survive outside the womb. Previously, abortions were barred after 24 weeks unless the mother\u2019s life was at risk.</p> <p>Cuomo writes in the new op-ed: </p> <blockquote> <p>As part of their attack on women\u2019s rights, Mr. Trump and his allies are intentionally spreading lies about New York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act. Their goal is to end all legal abortion in our nation.</p> <p>The Reproductive Health Act guarantees a woman\u2019s right to abortion in the first 24 weeks of a pregnancy or when the fetus is not viable, and permits it afterward only when a woman\u2019s life or health is threatened or at risk. Contrary to what its detractors claim, the Reproductive Health Act does not allow abortions minutes before birth, nor does it allow third-trimester abortions \u201cfor any reason.\u201d Third-trimester procedures are extremely rare, making up only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm\">about 1 percent of all abortions</a>. The option is available for exactly the reason stated in Roeand successor cases: to protect the life or health of the woman.</p> <p>Although New York was a trailblazer in protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, we did not update our laws after Roe to conform with the right established by the Supreme Court, particularly regarding a woman\u2019s right to make decisions to protect her health. And in an increasingly fractious political environment, there has been continual anxiety that the court will overrule the Roe precedent.</p> </blockquote> <p>He goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>But these objections aren\u2019t about the rare occasion when a woman has an abortion to protect her health or life. This is about the desire of Mr. Trump and allies on the right to outlaw abortion entirely. It is about bringing America back to the pre-Roe days.</p> <p>Mr. Trump and the religious right are spreading falsehoods about New York\u2019s law to inflame their base. Activists on the far right continue to mislead with the ridiculous claim that the act will allow abortions up to a minute before birth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-06T13:53:48.204Z\">at 1.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c5ae229e4b042feedcb843e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-06T13:41:48.741Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden is speaking to climate change experts who attended Trump\u2019s State of the Union.

In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/05/donald-trump-state-of-the-union-bipartisan-unity\">wide-ranging speech</a>, he claimed investigations of him would hurt the country and renewed his vows to build a wall on the southern US border with Mexico.</p> <p>Lisa Graumlich, dean of the environment college at the University of Washington, studies environmental systems and has used tree-ring data to understand long-term climate trends. She attended the State of the Union address as a guest of Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal.</p> <p>\u201cI have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s\u2026and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when peoples\u2019 grandchildren were alive. And that has changed,\u201d Graumlich said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that future presidents will find themselves in this position, because people are feeling the effects of climate change. There is, I believe, a stronger and stronger call for action.\u201d</p> <p>Joel Clement, who resigned from the Interior Department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change impacts on vulnerable communities, now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist and pretend the science doesn\u2019t exist even if it\u2019s coming from its own agencies,\u201d Clement said. \u201cTo not say anything about it is just ignorance, and it\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5ae15ce4b04a6f567d9ec4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-06T13:41:43.964Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot says Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to end AIDS transmissions by 2030 is contradicted by his own policies.</p> <p>She said in a statement Wednesday morning: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pledge to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years is encouraging, but it is difficult to reconcile this statement with his Administration\u2019s systematic assault on the HIV community \u2013 including undermining access to affordable health insurance and HIV drugs; cutting funds for HIV research; and attacking LGBTQ+ people...A pathway exists for the President to end the HIV epidemic, but he cannot reach this goal by alienating the very communities most affected by it.

The Virginia saga continues with a Virginia congresswoman issuing a brief but damning tweet in support of the woman accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Paul Erickson, the Republican operative boyfriend of Maria Butina (the Russian national who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to influence US politics during the 2016 presidential election) was indicted by a federal grand jury in South Dakota in an entirely separate case involving a chain of assisted living homes. Paul Erickson, the boyfriend of Maria Butina, the Russian national who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to influence US politics during the 2016 presidential election, was indicted by a federal grand jury in South Dakota on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, the Daily Beast is reporting. The case against Erickson, a conservative US political activist and National Rifle Association insider, does not appear to be linked to the foreign agent case against Butina, who tried to infiltrate the NRA and relay intelligence on American politicians to a Russian government official. Erickson was arrested on Feb. 6 and entered a plea of not guilty, according to the court filings. The indictment alleges that Erickson ran a criminal scheme from 1996 to 2018 using a chain of assisted living homes called Compass Care. Erickson also allegedly defrauded investors through a company called Investing with Dignity that claimed to be \u201cin the business of developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the wheelchair.\u201d The indictment says he also ran a fraudulent scheme that claimed to be building homes in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota. Lawyers for Erickson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Virginia Congresswoman spoke out in support of the woman accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley is weighing whether to join the packed Democratic race for president. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast, taking over for Ben Jacobs. Let\u2019s see what the rest of Wednesday has in store for us, shall we? Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring admitted Wednesday morning that he had appeared in blackface in college. The revelation came after he called for the state\u2019s Governor Ralph Northam to resign for appearing in blackface. Virginia\u2019s Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is under even more fire after the woman accusing him of sexual assault came forward in a public statement Donald Trump formally nominated David Malpass to lead the World Bank. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine has reacted to the topsy-turvy day in his state\u2019s politics. A new profile of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s youthful stint in New York has new details of how the former Texas congressman tried to adjust to life after graduating from college there. As the New York Times reports: He seemed like any other punk-minded student: Jawbox T-shirt, hair past his shoulders and a grim insistence that the Smashing Pumpkins had grown pretentious. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill today, Elizabeth Warren couldn\u2019t say whether she had identified as Native American in other legal documents besides her Texas state bar registration. Cory Booker has now weighed in the allegation of sexual assault against Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia. Although Booker has called on Ralph Northam to resign over his blackface scandal, he didn\u2019t go quite as far with Fairfax. Kamala Harris avoided criticizing Elizabeth Warren, her rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, when asked about the latest flap over Warren\u2019s claims of Native American heritage. Special Counsel Robert Mueller will receive a lot of transcripts from the House Intelligence Committee now that they have voted to release them to him. The transcripts were conducted over the past two years when the committee was led by Republican Devin Nunes. A partial list is below. Although Amy Klobuchar appears likely to announce a presidential bid this weekend, there is one potential candidate who can now be safely crossed of the list of Democrats running in 2020. A local reporter in Virginia tweets that they are working on getting a photo of Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring in blackface. CNN will hold a town hall with billionaire Howard Schultz, who is considering mounting an independent presidential bid, next week in Texas. Schultz, who made his fortune running Starbucks, has received significant national attention for his flirtation with a centrist bid for the White House. However, much of it has not been positive. Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office today that he doesn\u2019t think that Stacey Abrams can beat incumbent Republican David Perdue if she runs for Senate in Georgia in 2020. Abrams, who was the losing Democratic gubernatorial nominee in the Peach State in 2018, delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Union on Tuesday night. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney criticized the presidential campaign of her fellow New Yorker Kirsten Gillibrand today and suggested that Gillibrand can\u2019t win a general election. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Maloney said \u201cI\u2019m not supporting her because I feel, at this point, I feel that we have to win Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cAnd if we win Ohio, we win the presidency, in my belief. So I am very interested in candidates that I believe can win Ohio.\u201d Instead, Maloney pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas as candidates who could potentially win. Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown is already set to have one prominent endorser if the three-term senator decides to run for President. Vanessa Tyson\u2019s full statement about Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and her allegations of sexual assault against him is posted below. Trump responds to Adam Schiff\u2019s statement that the House Intelligence Committee will look into his financial affairs by attacking the Democratic congressman. \u201cOn what basis would he do that, he has no basis to do that, he\u2019s just a political hack who is trying to build a name for himself,\u201d said Trump, who went on to say that Schiff was engaging in \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d Trump condemned what he called \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Vanessa Tyson, the woman who has accused Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, has issued a statement about the incident. \u201cWhat began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault,\u201d Ms. Tyson said, adding: \u201cMr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump is formally announcing that David Malpass will be tapped to lead the World Bank. Malpass, the current under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, served in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations before becoming the chief economist at Bear Stearns. The House Intelligence Committee will continue investigation of allegations connecting Donald Trump and the Trump organization to money laundering. In a statement, Adam Schiff, the new Democratic chair of the committee, said: During the prior Congress, the Committee began to pursue credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise related to the business interests of President Trump, his family, and his associates. The President\u2019s actions and posture towards Russia during the campaign, transition, and administration have only heightened fears of foreign financial or other leverage over President Trump and underscore the need to determine whether he or those in his Administration have acted in service of foreign interests since taking office. Unfortunately, these and numerous other avenues of inquiry were not completed during the last Congress. Republicans in a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on climate change questioned the overwhelming science that humans are causing rising temperatures, worsening extreme weather and triggering sea-level rise. That comes as government reports find 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record and that global warming could exceed a 1.5C increase within five years. Judith Curry, the retired chair of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is often called on by Republicans to highlight uncertainties about the causes and impacts of climate change, said there have been worse droughts and weather events in the past. Congressman Louie Gohmert, a Republican from Texas, suggested proposals for a Green New Deal to limit greenhouse gases would eliminate all overseas military bases and cut the military in half, leaving the country vulnerable to Russia, China and the Islamic State. Those type of military provisions have been part of the Green Party\u2019s vision for a Green New Deal but are not part of ongoing discussions led by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gohmert also asked Curry if humans are causing the polar ice caps on Mars to melt, adding \u201cthat\u2019s probably the sun.\u201d Colorado Congressman Doug Lamborn (R) suggested young people advocating for a Green New Deal may not have the life experience or maturity to understand that it\u2019s \u201cliterally impossible.\u201d Other GOP lawmakers said the transition away from fossil fuels would be too expensive, would hurt the poor and would be technologically infeasible. The Republicans\u2019 comments come in stark contrast to Democrats, who highlighted the impacts of climate change in their own districts. New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland was tearing up when apologizing to youth climate activist Nadia Nazar for the problems her generation is inheriting. A new poll from CNN shows that only 22% of Americans support replacing all private health insurance with government health insurance, a stance controversially endorsed by Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Iowa last week. If all three scandal plagued Virginia Democrats resign, the identity of Virginia\u2019s next governor may be determined by a bowl. Under Virginia\u2019s constitution, fourth in line to be governor is the Speaker of the House of Delegates Kirk Cox. The Republican holds his position because of a narrow 51-49 in the Commonwealth\u2019s lower chamber. There was a tie race for the deciding seat and the deadlock was broken by names from a bowl. The Republican\u2019s name was chosen and instead of a House of Delegates evenly split on partisan lines, Republicans ended up with a one seat majority. This seems to be the current state of play among Virginia Democrats It is not every day that a Capitol Hill briefing on marginal tax rates draws a packed house. But these are unusual times. The attendance was perhaps due in no small part to congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s ability to turn \u201carcane\u201d policy matters, as one panelist described it, into progressive rallying cries. Since she suggested a 70% marginal tax rate on income exceeding $10 million, the proposal has spread like wildfire. It has already become a defining issue of the 2020 campaign and the idea was ridiculed by the billionaires gathered at Davos. On Wednesday, the House Progressive Caucus convened a panel of lawmakers, experts and economists to discuss how to translate the progressive plan into a legislative reality. \u201cFor the last 20, 25, 30 years we\u2019ve not been allowed to talk about taxes \u2013 at all,\u201d said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. In a graphic showing countries\u2019 total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, the US unsurprisingly lagged behind Canada and Scandinavian countries. \u201cWhat do you get out of that?,\u201d he asked. \u201cHealth care. Free tuition. Paid leave. All of the social benefits we utterly lack in this country \u201c In brief remarks, Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats had for too long allowed conservatives to define progressive policies, which she said created the turned taxes into a \u201cboogieman [with a] negative association\u201d. \u201cIt should be a tool,\u201d she said, to help pay for policies such as Medicare for all and a Green New Deal. The freshman Democrat from New York also noted that her conservative critics expected the proposal would create a \u201cscandalous moment\u201d. Instead, she pointed to polling showing that a majority of Americans, and a significant percentage of Republican voters support the concept. She said: \u201cWe respect the intellect of the public enough to trust them to understand what we have to say.\u201d Virginia Senator Mark Warner told reporters on Capitol Hill that he was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d about attorney general Mark Herring wearing blackface in college. The two-term Democrat had previously called on Ralph Northam to resign after Northam\u2019s disastrous press conference on Saturday. Former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu all but ruled out a presidential bid in an interview this morning. Landrieu, a member of a prominent Louisiana dynasty, drew national attention with his decision to take down Confederate statues in the Crescent City in 2017. This led to some hype that he might go from City Hall to the White House as a moderate Southern Democrat. However, he said when asked about a presidential bid on CNN this morning, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. A lot of people have asked me that. I never say never, but at this point in time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d Nancy Pelosi was skeptical of Trump\u2019s proposal to cure childhood cancer while meeting with the House Democratic Caucus this morning. The House Intelligence Committee just voted to release all witness transcripts to the Department of Justice and to special counsel Robert Mueller. This was something Republicans had declined to do when they controlled the House and had been delayed since the Democratic takeover of Congress as Republicans took their time in naming members to the committee. As Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has now admitted to wearing blackface in college, details of a private meeting that Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who is facing an allegation of sexual assault, have just leaked out This is a good recap of the current state of politics in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mark Herring has now issued a statement about wearing blackface at a party in 1980 where he says he dressed as rapper Kurtis Blow. Mark Herring, the second in line to succession to be Virginia\u2019s governor says he wore blackface at a party in college. The governor, Ralph Northam, admitted to doing so in a dance contest and the first in line, lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, is facing an allegation of sexual assault. The far left Democratic Socialists of America have issued their response to Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech last night and it is an attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The increasingly bizarre situation in Virginia has taken another turn. First, Governor Ralph Northam was plunged into a scandal over a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page. Although Northam insisted that it wasn\u2019t him in the photo, he did acknowledge wearing blackface for a Michael Jackson dance contest in 1984. As Democrats almost universally called for Northam to resign, his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, then faced an allegation of sexual assault, further complicating the situation. Fairfax has denied the allegation and insisted he had a consensual sexual encounter with the accuser. Now, it seems the third in line of succession, Attorney General Mark Herring may face his own scandal. It seems that Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan really didn\u2019t enjoy the State of the Union last night. Democrats calling attention to climate change in dual House hearings are meeting resistance from Republican lawmakers. \u201cThe majority of Americans consider climate change to be a moral and economic imperative, and they\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d said House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva, from Arizona. He noted the last few years have been the hottest recorded and that ice sheets are melting faster than expected. Democrats who have taken control of the House for the first time since early 2011 are planning to focus on climate change throughout February. The House science committee will hold another hearing next week. Their efforts come as government scientists announce today that 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record and warn the \u201cimpacts of long-term global warming are already being felt.\u201d Rep. Rob Bishop, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican from Utah, jokingly thanked Grijalva for making February the month of climate change hearings. \u201cI appreciate the fact that you picked the shortest month of the year to do that,\u201d he said, adding that the panel should instead focus on black history month, wildfires and a maintenance backlog at the National Park Service. The committee has jurisdiction over the public lands handled by the Interior Department. Public lands and the fossil fuel development on them account for a significant portion of US greenhouse gas emissions. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) testified that his state has suffered from more intense hurricanes, mudslides in the mountains and drought that has killed crops. He said that transitioning to clean energy would save money spent on adaptation and healthcare. At a simultaneous House Energy and Commerce hearing on climate change, Republicans took aim at the Green New Deal, a proposal from some Democrats that is meant to eliminate inequity, create jobs and reduce the greenhouse gases that heat the planet. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts are expected to release a high-level document laying out the tenets of a Green New Deal this week. Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, the ranking Republican on that panel\u2019s climate change subcommittee, said such a proposal would be \u201cradical\u201d and include \u201cwealth transfer schemes.\u201d He said a top-down strategy for reducing emissions \u201cmay not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem.\u201d Shimkus said fossil fuels and nuclear power will remain the top sources of power. The Bulwark has a tribute to Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official. It notes the unique career of the Anglo-American conservative activist and how rare it was for a figure like him to ever get a White House job. Sebastian Gorka is a man of many distinctions. He was one of the first Breitbart alums to be tapped to serve a U.S. president. The first deputy assistant to a president to also be a fugitive from justice in a foreign county. And the only White House employee to ever be confused with an Olmec head. In short: At some point in the medium-future, Donald Trump will be gone, the executive branch will return to something resembling normalcy, and people like Seb Gorka won\u2019t be allowed within sniffing distance of political power. So we ought to appreciate him while we have him. Few presidential advisors ever struggled with security clearance the way Gorka did. Shortly before he was fired, he had his clearance revoked while he was on vacation. And even now, two years after his departure, the fact of his clearance is being investigated by the Democrats. Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard repeatedly refused to label Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator, as an \u201cenemy or adversary\u201d of the United States. In an interview on MSNBC, the four-term congresswoman from Hawaii declined to criticize Assad. Gabbard has visited Assad in Syria and has been one of the few American politicians to defend his regime, which is responsible for the death of over 500,000 people and led to five million people fleeing the country. The woman who accused Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault deserves \u201cdue process,\u201d the chair of the Democratic National Committee said. \u201cWe need to always take these allegations seriously,\u201d chairman Tom Perez said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, according to Politico. \u201cI said this whenever this issue has come up. We must accord respect to an accuser and we must accord due process to the accused.\u201d \u201cI believe she is entitled to due process,\u201d he said. Texas Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke was greeted by climate change protesters in New York Tuesday at an event where he said he would announce a decision about a 2020 presidential run by the end of the month. Demonstrators blasted the former Congressman for breaking a pledge not to accept campaign donations from donors in the fossil fuel industry, and pushed him to throw his weight behind the Green New Deal. \u201cIt\u2019s a very corrosive influence. You can\u2019t be taking money from the people you\u2019re supposed to legislate against and regulate,\u201d said Gustavo Gordillo, 31, a Democratic Socialists of America member from Manhattan, who joined a group of protesters outside the PlayStation theater, where O\u2019Rourke was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey. \u201cWe want to make sure that we can count on him to propose an aggressive, comprehensive plan.\u201d Organizers said they plan to target other potential Democratic presidential candidates to press them to get behind an aggressive climate plan. But O\u2019Rourke, who lost a bid against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz last year but gained a national following in the process, has sparked a backlash among a small but vocal group of progressive activists who believe he is not liberal enough. O\u2019Rourke was removed from a list of signers of Oil Change USA\u2019s pledge not to accept fossil fuel money after Sludge reported that he got $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry. His spokesman told the Huffington Post he is \u201csupportive of the concept\u201d of a Green New Deal. In his interview with Winfrey at a taping of her program \u201cOprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations,\u201d O\u2019Rourke gave himself an end of the month deadline to decide on a presidential run, saying he wanted to help unify the country and make sure it lives up to its promise. \u201cIf I can play some role in helping the country to do that, by God I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Pressed for a timeline on an announcement, he said, \u201cThe serious answer is really soon. Before the end of the month.\u201d Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell is asking for prayers for her ailing husband, former Rep. John Dingell, saying his health has \u201centered a new phase.\u201d The Congresswoman missed Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union Tuesday night to be with her 92-year-old husband. There\u2019s a hint of progress in negotiations toward a border security deal before a stopgap government funding bill expires. \u201cHopefully the lesson has been learned that shutting down the government is not a legitimate negotiating tactic,\u201d New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chair of the Democratic caucus, said at a press conference Wednesday. He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d there would be a deal. Jeffries hinted at how a deal could come together: Democrats may be willing to support \u201cenhanced fencing\u201d in certain places, which could be an area of \u201cbipartisan consensus.\u201d \u201cSome sort of physical barrier or medieval border wall from sea to shining sea is ridiculous,\u201d he said, adding that much of the land that would be needed for such a wall is private property or sacred land for Native Americans. Former Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has delayed planned testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, which had been scheduled for Friday, until Feb. 28. \u201cIn the interests of the investigation, Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony has been postponed until February 28th,\u201d Committee chairman Adam Schiff said, according to MSNBC. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he\u2019s trying to talk his wife into running for Congress. \u201cListen, the state would be incredibly lucky if Mary Pat Christie would run for office,\u201d the Republican said Tuesday night at a book signing, according to the New Jersey Globe. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to convince her that maybe she should run for Congress. I think she would be fabulous.\u201d If the former New Jersey first lady ran, it would be against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents Montclair. Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu is likely a no on running for president, he tells CNN this morning. Two undocumented immigrants who were employed by Donald Trump\u2019s golf clubs were among the guests at the State of the Union. \u201cIt was hard to be face to face with him and realize he didn\u2019t change his position, especially for those of us who helped his businesses prosper,\u201d one of the women, Sandra Diaz, told the New York Times after the speech. \u201cI had the trust to be inside his home and serve him.\u201d Trump\u2019s businesses have initiated a purge and fired a number of unauthorized immigrants since it was revealed that he for years employed people in the country illegally. Senator Bernie Sanders praised Stacey Abrams speech in response to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union, calling it \u201cvery, very effective.\u201d \u201cLet me also just congratulate Stacey Abrams for her very, very effective response to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday,\u201d according to the Hill. \u201cNow I think we all know why she would have been a great governor of Georgia.\u201d The GOP, meanwhile, branded her with an unflattering nickname, Stacey Abrams\u2019 speech in response to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union is touching off speculation about a potential presidential run. The Georgia Democrat and former state representative made an unsuccessful run for governor last year, but came close in an overwhelmingly Republican state. The House intelligence committee is expected to vote Wednesday to send more than 50 interview transcripts from its now-closed Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller, the Associated Press reports. It\u2019s the panel\u2019s first act since Democrats took control of the House. From AP: The panel\u2019s new chairman, California Rep. Adam Schiff, has long said that sending Mueller the transcripts from the probe into Russian election interference would be one of his first actions. Two associates of President Donald Trump have already been charged with lying to the committee, and Schiff has said Mueller should consider whether additional perjury charges are warranted as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. As is tradition, the committee will meet behind closed doors. A notice for the meeting says that one of the agenda items is \u201ctransmission of certain committee transcripts to the Department of Justice.\u201d A person familiar with the meeting said the vote is to send the transcripts to Mueller\u2019s office. The person asked not to be named because committee business is confidential. The vote comes the morning after Trump criticized \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d in his State of the Union speech. Schiff has indicated that he will re-open parts of the committee probe that Republicans closed last March, concluding there was no evidence of conspiracy or collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Democrats strongly objected at the time, saying that the Republicans prematurely closed the investigation. Trump associate Roger Stone was charged with lying to the panel after Mueller requested his interview transcript, and the committee voted to release it. Among the transcripts now expected to be released are interviews with Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his longtime spokeswoman, Hope Hicks; and his former bodyguard Keith Schiller. There are dozens of other transcripts of interviews with former Obama administration officials and Trump associates. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo penned an op-ed in the New York Times Wednesday responding to Donald Trump\u2019s call in the State of the Union to outlaw abortion rules like the ones the state just passed. \u201cLawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth,\u201d Trump said in the speech, also taking a shot at comments on the issue by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. \u201cTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb. He\u2019s referring to New York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act, which allows abortions after 24 weeks if the woman\u2019s health is in danger or if the fetus would not survive outside the womb. Previously, abortions were barred after 24 weeks unless the mother\u2019s life was at risk. Cuomo writes in the new op-ed: As part of their attack on women\u2019s rights, Mr. Trump and his allies are intentionally spreading lies about New York\u2019s Reproductive Health Act. Their goal is to end all legal abortion in our nation. The Reproductive Health Act guarantees a woman\u2019s right to abortion in the first 24 weeks of a pregnancy or when the fetus is not viable, and permits it afterward only when a woman\u2019s life or health is threatened or at risk. Contrary to what its detractors claim, the Reproductive Health Act does not allow abortions minutes before birth, nor does it allow third-trimester abortions \u201cfor any reason.\u201d Third-trimester procedures are extremely rare, making up only about 1 percent of all abortions. The option is available for exactly the reason stated in Roeand successor cases: to protect the life or health of the woman. Although New York was a trailblazer in protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, we did not update our laws after Roe to conform with the right established by the Supreme Court, particularly regarding a woman\u2019s right to make decisions to protect her health. And in an increasingly fractious political environment, there has been continual anxiety that the court will overrule the Roe precedent. He goes on: But these objections aren\u2019t about the rare occasion when a woman has an abortion to protect her health or life. This is about the desire of Mr. Trump and allies on the right to outlaw abortion entirely. It is about bringing America back to the pre-Roe days. Mr. Trump and the religious right are spreading falsehoods about New York\u2019s law to inflame their base. Activists on the far right continue to mislead with the ridiculous claim that the act will allow abortions up to a minute before birth. The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden is speaking to climate change experts who attended Trump\u2019s State of the Union. Here\u2019s what two of them had to say: A climate scientist and a former government expert in the audience for Donald Trump\u2019s speech said this will likely be the last administration that can forego talking about climate change. Trump didn\u2019t mention rising temperatures or extreme weather, although he did tout the country\u2019s status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations. In a wide-ranging speech, he claimed investigations of him would hurt the country and renewed his vows to build a wall on the southern US border with Mexico. Lisa Graumlich, dean of the environment college at the University of Washington, studies environmental systems and has used tree-ring data to understand long-term climate trends. She attended the State of the Union address as a guest of Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal. \u201cI have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s\u2026and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when peoples\u2019 grandchildren were alive. And that has changed,\u201d Graumlich said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that future presidents will find themselves in this position, because people are feeling the effects of climate change. There is, I believe, a stronger and stronger call for action.\u201d Joel Clement, who resigned from the Interior Department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change impacts on vulnerable communities, now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist and pretend the science doesn\u2019t exist even if it\u2019s coming from its own agencies,\u201d Clement said. \u201cTo not say anything about it is just ignorance, and it\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot says Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to end AIDS transmissions by 2030 is contradicted by his own policies. She said in a statement Wednesday morning: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pledge to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years is encouraging, but it is difficult to reconcile this statement with his Administration\u2019s systematic assault on the HIV community \u2013 including undermining access to affordable health insurance and HIV drugs; cutting funds for HIV research; and attacking LGBTQ+ people...A pathway exists for the President to end the HIV epidemic, but he cannot reach this goal by alienating the very communities most affected by it. Any legitimate plan must begin by righting these wrongs.\u201d A West Virginia woman has been indicted on charges she threatened to kill Donald Trump. From the Associated Press: A federal grand jury in Wheeling on Tuesday indicted 25-year-old Taryn Corrinne Henthorn of Middlebourne. Prosecutors say Henthorn made the threat on Facebook and elsewhere last month. Henthorn faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of three counts if convicted. It\u2019s unclear if Henthorn has a lawyer. Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, mixing a rhetorical call for unity with a hard line on issues like immigration and abortion, and getting in a shot at \u201cridiculous partisan investigations,\u201d which he claimed could ruin the economy. Democrats are unsurprisingly unimpressed. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday morning on CNN that Trump \u201cwas like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\u201d \u201cAnd the excitement was all in the Mr Hyde part,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the enthusiasm was on the divisive issues. It was not a good speech. The president is hurting, he knows he is hurting, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to dig himself out of the hole.\u201d Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams delivered the party\u2019s response Tuesday night. But the substantive response comes today, when the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will kick off its legislative business in earnest. A House committee will hold its first hearing on gun violence in years, according to the Associated Press. Two other committees are holding hearings on climate change. Three will be discussing healthcare protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, told AP. Democrats got a bit of a slow start with their legislative agenda because of the government shutdown, but are now trying to make up for lost time. On the schedule today, per AP: The House Judiciary Committee holds its first hearing on gun violence in at least eight years. The Natural Resources Committee kicks off a month of hearings on climate change, its first sustained look at the issue in a decade. The Foreign Affairs Committee will debate the war in Yemen, and consider a war powers resolution to halt U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition. The Oversight Committee will hold a hearing on ethics in the executive branch. The Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing taking stock of the recent government shutdown.",

      "body": "<p>Among the concerns facing today\u2019s social media maven: how can one scroll through Instagram and enjoy a bag of potato chips without getting their phone all greasy?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/22/say-cheese-cooking-in-the-age-of-instagram\">Say cheese: cooking in the age of Instagram</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a dilemma Steve Jobs was never able to solve, but that hasn\u2019t stopped today\u2019s innovators. A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-greasy-snacks-smearing-your-phone-japan-has-found-a-solution-11549217201\">Wall Street Journal</a>. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don\u2019t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: \u201cI can just take it and chug it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/koikeya_cp/status/1067963152615129088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u5bd2\u3044\u51ac\u3002<br>\u5f7c\u306e\u624b\u3092\u96e2\u3057\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>\u3067\u3082\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3082\u30ab\u30e9\u30e0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e7\u304c\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044\u3002<br><br>\u305d\u3093\u306a\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u3001\u30ef\u30f3\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9\u3002 <a href=\"https://t.co/1VnFYxQmm1\">pic.twitter.com/1VnFYxQmm1</a></p>&mdash; \u30b3\u30a4\u30b1\u30e4\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011 (@koikeya_cp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koikeya_cp/status/1067963152615129088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 29, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips \u201ca new snack style humankind has been waiting for\u201d, the Journal reports. But it\u2019s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.</p> <p>Nearly a decade ago, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/21/the-potato-chip-hand-lets-you-eat-chips-protects-your-fingers-from-getting-greasy-video/\">TechCrunch</a> reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It\u2019s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI9OzHQBqpk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wI9OzHQBqpk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>McDonald\u2019s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course \u2013 with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal \u2013 but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/05/03/the-mcdonalds-frork-a-utensil-whose-main-purpose-is-to-poke-the-internet/?utm_term=.3d4705623458\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/05/05/i-tried-to-use-the-mcdonalds-frork-it-was-actually-kind-of-fun/?utm_term=.6e968f52d971\">Washington Post</a> pieces on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2018/06/21/mcdonalds-wants-you-to-keep-your-greasy-fingers-off-your-phone-on-national-selfie-day/?utm_term=.77574746d624\">fry-centric tech</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08zs_WFJukM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/08zs_WFJukM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why the brilliant minds at McDonald\u2019s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkTDeeAgoge/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Among the concerns facing today\u2019s social media maven: how can one scroll through Instagram and enjoy a bag of potato chips without getting their phone all greasy? It\u2019s a dilemma Steve Jobs was never able to solve, but that hasn\u2019t stopped today\u2019s innovators. A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don\u2019t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: \u201cI can just take it and chug it.\u201d Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips \u201ca new snack style humankind has been waiting for\u201d, the Journal reports. But it\u2019s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles. Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It\u2019s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone. McDonald\u2019s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course \u2013 with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal \u2013 but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech. Perhaps that\u2019s why the brilliant minds at McDonald\u2019s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start. According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cchoose between eating and posting\u201d selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video. It\u2019s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free \u2013 \u201cOur awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,\u201d a marketing planner said on the company\u2019s blog \u2013 but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon.com trumpets the fact that this is \u201creally a thing\u201d. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay. One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating \u2013 I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you\u2019re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment.

Saker, who had been bowling coach since 2016, served under Darren Lehmann and, following Lehmann\u2019s resignation in the wake of last year\u2019s ball tampering scandal, current coach Justin Langer. \u201cDavid and I have had ongoing discussions over the past nine months about his role with the team, and we agreed it\u2019s the right time to head in a different direction in the best interests of the team,\u201d Langer said. Troy Cooley has been appointed as his replacement for the upcoming ODI series against India and Pakistan and will oversee the bowling group as Australia prepare for the defence of their World Cup title and an Ashes series. Australia head to India for two Twenty20 internationals later this month before playing a five-game ODI series against the No 2-ranked India in March. Langer\u2019s side then travel to the UAE for another five-match ODI series, against Pakistan, before heading to the UK for the start of the World Cup at the end of May and a Test series against England in August. \u201cIn discussions with David about the needs of the team, and the unprecedented schedule ahead, it became clear to both of us that this was the right time for David to step away,\u201d Cricket Australia\u2019s high performance manager Belinda Clark said. \u201cWe will provide further information on the coaching structure surrounding the World Cup and Ashes in due course.\u201d Saker, who enjoyed success with the England men\u2019s team and Victoria, was involved in the development of Australia\u2019s current crop of fast bowlers, spearheaded by Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazelwood. He said he had enjoyed his time with the team over the past three season and is now looking forward to a new coaching role. Saker had previously spoken of his desire to be a potential successor to Lehmann in 2017, when he filled in as head coach during a ODI tour of India. It is unclear how much Saker\u2019s relationship with his charges had deteriorated this summer, if at all, but Starc notably had credited NSW\u2019s bowling coach Andre Adams for helping to end his form slump. Australia\u2019s fast bowlers had plenty of knockers during the Test series against India \u2013 and even Saker was publicly critical of their approach at the SCG. He revealed during that match that \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201canimated\u201d discussions took place behind closed doors. \u201cThat\u2019s not like me usually ... I know I was not the only one. JL [Langer] wasn\u2019t happy. The bowlers know that,\u201d Saker said. \u201cThe bowlers wanted one thing. Tim [Paine] wanted one thing ... you could see there was some confusion.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BBC Radio 4 has lost three-quarters of a million listeners in the last year, according to official figures that show the challenge facing the corporation\u2019s speech radio stations from commercial rivals. Figures for the final three months of 2018 show the BBC\u2019s flagship news and current affairs station reached 10.5 million Britons a week, down 750,000 on the same period last year, while BBC 5 Live lost 10% of its audience in the last 12 months and is now listened to by fewer than 5 million people a week. At the same time, the commercial talk radio station LBC achieved its highest audience in its 46-year history, reaching 2.2 million listeners a week as they tuned in to more opinionated programming from the likes of Nick Ferrari, James O\u2019Brien and Nigel Farage. The official Rajar figures show the challenges the BBC is up against at a time when commercial rivals are paying big money to lure away its stars. The UK\u2019s three major commercial radio networks are investing heavily in new, digital-only outlets in the belief that the proliferation of digital radios and smart speakers such as Amazon\u2019s Echowill encourage people to try new stations. As a result, the BBC\u2019s share of total radio listening has slipped to 50.9%, with the long-term decline suggesting the corporation will be overtaken by the commercial sector at some point in the next year. The BBC\u2019s director of radio, James Purnell, has previously said he was not concerned with such metrics and was instead focusing on developing the audience for the much-criticised BBC Sounds app and ensuring its output was relevant to the next generation through increased investment in podcasting and online audio. The period covered by the Rajar figures was shortly before a substantial changeover in the world of radio that saw several high-profile presenters switch stations including Chris Evans to Virgin Radio, Zoe Ball and Sara Cox starting new shows on BBC Radio 2 and Simon Mayo leaving to start a new classical music station. BBC Radio 1 also lost half a million listeners, though the new Greg James breakfast show added 300,000 people to its audience when listeners aged 10 and over were included. Radio 4\u2019s Today programme is now listened to by 6.8 million listeners a week, only a slight dip on the same period last year. On Wednesday John Humphrys confirmed he would be leaving the station after 32 years with the programme. Elsewhere in the commercial radio sector Bauer Media\u2019s Magic network has hit a record high of 4.2 million listeners, while Global\u2019s Heart network is reaching 9.7 million listeners a week. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wireless Group, the third-biggest UK commercial radio group, has made a substantial investment in the likes of Virgin Radio and TalkRadio, but listener figures suggest it is still struggling to build an audience. Despite outbidding the BBC for sports rights and hiring Jeremy Kyle, Matthew Wright and Eamonn Holmes, the audience for its national stations has only edged up slightly from a low base and it remains a comparative minnow in the industry. Virgin Radio only attracted 447,000 listeners a week at the end of 2018, a far cry from the 9 million who tuned in to the final months of Evans\u2019s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. His bosses will be hoping this figure jumps substantially in the coming months, aided by his high-profile arrival, heavy advertising and cross-promotion from the Sun newspaper.",

      "bodyText": "Record numbers of students from China and Hong Kong are applying for places at British universities, overtaking the number of applicants from Wales, according to official figures. Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) shows a spike in demand for undergraduate places from mainland China and a small rise in applications from the EU, despite fears over Brexit. The figures taken from Ucas\u2019s January deadline, when the bulk of undergraduate applications are made, show a 1% decline in UK applicants, but a 9% surge from international candidates meant the total number of applications went up for the first time in three years. The number of applications from China and Hong Kong rose from more than 17,000 last year to 21,000 this year. In contrast, only 18,850 applications came from Wales, meaning that if those trends are sustained there will soon be more undergraduates from China studying at British universities than from Wales. Last year there were also more than 100,000 postgraduate students from China and Hong Kong at British universities, out of nearly 350,000 full-time postgraduates. Overall the numbers will come as a relief to the higher education sector, after widespread concern that the Brexit crisis would erode applications from within the EU and outside Europe. \u201cIt is very welcome news that students from the EU and China continue to see UK universities as top world class destinations,\u201d said Chris Skidmore, the universities minister for England. British universities have redoubled their recruitment efforts overseas, while for European applicants it may be their last chance to access lower tuition fees and student loans before Britain exits the EU. International students from outside the EU generally pay much higher fees and are not eligible for loans from the UK government. Clare Marchant, Ucas\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201c\u2018In this time of uncertainty, it\u2019s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.\u201d Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of British universities, said despite the latest figures the UK risked falling behind rivals such as New Zealand. \u201cWe are calling for a new graduate visa that will make the UK more attractive to international students, allowing a wider range of employers in all parts of the UK to benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world,\u201d Jarvis said. Application rates from within the UK also appear to have defied predictions of a fall-off driven by rising student debt. Despite a 2% fall in the number of 18-year-olds in the population, the proportion from that age group applying to university jumped to nearly 39% in England, while in Wales there was a rise to above 32%. \u201cThe unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study,\u201d Marchant said. Policymakers will be pleased to see a narrowing in the gap in applications from the least and most advantaged households, with 23% of young people living in areas of low educational attainment now applying for places. The results came against a background of uncertainty over funding, with a review commissioned by Theresa May expected to recommend tuition fees be cut to \u00a36,500-\u00a37,000 from their current level of \u00a39,250. \u201cTo drive social mobility and strengthen the economy, the current post-18 education review should recommend policies to support access for anyone who has the potential to benefit from a university education,\u201d said Jarvis. Universities UK this week launched a national campaign asking the government to keep funding study abroad opportunities for British students if the UK cannot remain a member of the pan-European Erasmus student programme after Brexit.",
