      "body": "<p>With days to go until the polls open for the European parliament elections, most political parties are finding it a struggle to convey the relevance of the EU to voters (in 2014, voter turnout was just 42%). Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage to Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\u2019s Alexander Gauland, have been united in their criticism of the Brussels \u201celite\u201d.</p> \n<p>They focus on the \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d running the EU institutions. Yet there\u2019s an elite they don\u2019t notice \u2013 and of which they are members. The EU\u2019s institutions, and its parliamentary seats, are all but closed to people who aren\u2019t white.</p> \n<p>This is more evident than ever in the run-up to the current elections. Countless political debates are taking place on the future of the EU, but without a person of colour in sight. Apparently the future of Europe is white. White people debate with other white people on issues as wide as climate disaster, economic policy, migration and security. Buzzwords such as populism and nationalism are thrown around, and yet the undeniable whiteness of the EU institutions goes unremarked.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/europe-greens-european-elections-kingmakers\">Europe's Greens ready to be kingmakers in EU elections</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While campaigners occasionally lament the lack of women in high positions in the EU\u2019s bodies, very little has been said about the abysmal representation of people of colour, despite estimates that at least 50 million people in Europe come from ethnic minorities. There has never been a black or brown European commissioner, nor has a black or brown person held any of the top positions of the parliament or council. In the current parliament, representation of people of colour is less than 3%, and Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/labour-figures-unite-in-support-of-italian-mep-cecile-kyenge\" title=\"\">C\u00e9cile Kyenge</a> is the sole black woman.</p> \n<p>After May, Europe\u2019s race problem looks like it will get worse. The threat of the far right is well documented, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/salvini-aims-to-forge-far-right-alliance-ahead-of-european-elections\" title=\"\">renewed efforts</a> to unite rightwing anti-immigration parties across the continent. Yet the European aversion to talking about race equality has meant the issue of representation has gone unnoticed. </p> \n<p>My organisation, the European Network Against Racism, <a href=\"https://www.enar-eu.org/Election-Breakdown-Ethnic-minority-candidates-in-the-2019-European-Parliament\" title=\"\">analysed candidate lists</a> for the elections to find out how racially diverse the EU institutions will be after May. We found the lack of representation extraordinary. Fewer than 3% of all European parliament candidates are people of colour; and an even lower proportion is likely to be elected. As it stands, racial diversity in the European parliament will remain stagnant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b9367419-0f4e-48de-9763-ff2873b22838\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yAUl9OvaGgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Why aren\u2019t we improving? Migration and changing demographics mean that Europe\u2019s population is increasingly diverse, but this is not translating into electoral politics.</p> \n<p>It is clear that the EU institutions have failed to make racial diversity a priority. This is apparent within the internal staff of the European institutions as much as elected officials. A hashtag has even been launched, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-blind-to-diversity-whiteout-european-parliament/\" title=\"\">#BrusselsSoWhite</a>.</p> \n<p>National parties play a huge role.

      "bodyText": "With days to go until the polls open for the European parliament elections, most political parties are finding it a struggle to convey the relevance of the EU to voters (in 2014, voter turnout was just 42%). Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage to Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\u2019s Alexander Gauland, have been united in their criticism of the Brussels \u201celite\u201d. They focus on the \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d running the EU institutions. Yet there\u2019s an elite they don\u2019t notice \u2013 and of which they are members. The EU\u2019s institutions, and its parliamentary seats, are all but closed to people who aren\u2019t white. This is more evident than ever in the run-up to the current elections. Countless political debates are taking place on the future of the EU, but without a person of colour in sight. Apparently the future of Europe is white. White people debate with other white people on issues as wide as climate disaster, economic policy, migration and security. Buzzwords such as populism and nationalism are thrown around, and yet the undeniable whiteness of the EU institutions goes unremarked. While campaigners occasionally lament the lack of women in high positions in the EU\u2019s bodies, very little has been said about the abysmal representation of people of colour, despite estimates that at least 50 million people in Europe come from ethnic minorities. There has never been a black or brown European commissioner, nor has a black or brown person held any of the top positions of the parliament or council. In the current parliament, representation of people of colour is less than 3%, and Italy\u2019s C\u00e9cile Kyenge is the sole black woman. After May, Europe\u2019s race problem looks like it will get worse. The threat of the far right is well documented, with renewed efforts to unite rightwing anti-immigration parties across the continent. Yet the European aversion to talking about race equality has meant the issue of representation has gone unnoticed. My organisation, the European Network Against Racism, analysed candidate lists for the elections to find out how racially diverse the EU institutions will be after May. We found the lack of representation extraordinary. Fewer than 3% of all European parliament candidates are people of colour; and an even lower proportion is likely to be elected. As it stands, racial diversity in the European parliament will remain stagnant. Why aren\u2019t we improving? Migration and changing demographics mean that Europe\u2019s population is increasingly diverse, but this is not translating into electoral politics. It is clear that the EU institutions have failed to make racial diversity a priority. This is apparent within the internal staff of the European institutions as much as elected officials. A hashtag has even been launched, #BrusselsSoWhite. National parties play a huge role. Even when parties do include minority candidates on their lists, they are rarely at the top, or in the safe seats. Left-leaning parties are overwhelmingly more inclusive than their rightwing counterparts, putting forward around 60% of all the candidates of colour. The Labour party in Britain, La France Insoumise and Sweden\u2019s Social Democrats came out top for racial representation \u2013 so if the UK does exit the EU, this will be an undeniable blow for diversity. Yet the left is not projected to grow in the next parliament, and the most diverse group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, is projected to lose around 40 seats. We only found 16 minority candidates on the lists of the centre-right European People\u2019s party group, across all 28 member states. Even fewer will be elected. There are some positive stories: things are looking good for La France Insoumise candidate Le\u00efla Chaibi, and a number of candidates from across Sweden\u2019s political spectrum, including Jessica Polfj\u00e4rd, Evin Incir and the list leader for the Swedish Greens, Alice Bah Kuhnke. These candidates are bringing great hopes for a feminist, anti-racist European politics. We know that just having people of colour in office cannot guarantee racial progress. Representation is only one step along the way, and must be followed by a true commitment to fairer policies on equality and migration. Yet if the EU institutions and parties fail to represent citizens of colour, they\u2019ll prove to be not so different from the racists and nationalists who are simply more explicit in their belief that Europe is white. The EU\u2019s lack of racially diversity is in itself a crisis of legitimacy. The EU needs to reimagine itself. Migrants, minorities and people of colour are an undeniable fact of Europe\u2019s reality. It\u2019s time Europe reflected that. \u2022 Sarah Chander is advocacy officer at the European Network Against Racism",

If the Greens/EFA group in the European parliament finds itself in a position to shape events, it will exert maximum pressure, firstly, on climate policy, Eickhout said. \u201cWe will want to see not just words, but deeds.\u201d The Greens will also demand social justice when it comes to who will foot the bill for the green transition. \u201cWe have to move towards the principle that the polluter pays,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people cannot be expected to pay.\u201d Finally, the party will expect in exchange for its backing a radical change of tack from the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) group, which has come under heavy fire for its lukewarm criticism of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and his continued attacks against the EU and the rule of law. \u201cIn a lot of places the rule of law is threatened,\u201d Eickhout said. \u201cNot just in Hungary and Poland; you see it now creeping into Italy, Austria \u2013 a steady undermining of the judiciary, the media, NGOs, academics \u2026 We have to decide: are we a Europe that will defend democratic values, or just a collection of strong national states?\u201d",

Whatever the results, they will leave untouched the fundamental problems that have created the chasm between large sections of the electorate and mainstream parties.</p> <p>The debate has been dominated by the rise of the Brexit party. For some, it\u2019s a distillation of far-right sentiment, for others the means to break the mould of politics. In reality, it\u2019s neither. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/20/leader-of-pro-brexit-party-catherine-blaiklock-resigns-over-anti-islam-messages\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> has a long history of playing to racist and reactionary themes.

If it survives, and when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/13/brexit-party-policies-eu-elections-farage\" title=\"\">finally decides</a> on its policies, it will probably end up as a kind of Tory-party-in-exile, though more nationalist and populist.</p> <p>But that\u2019s also why it\u2019s no mould-breaker. With no membership, no democratic means of shaping policy and, indeed, no policies (at least until after the election), it\u2019s an expression of the hollowed-out character of contemporary politics, not a means of restoring substance to political debate. What\u2019s transforming politics is the inability of Labour or the Tories to speak to their constituencies. The shambles of the Brexit process has only deepened the sense in sections of the electorate that their voices are unheard, their votes ignored.</p> <p>The key question, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/09/fear-cultural-loss-fuelling-anger-with-elites-across-europe\" title=\"\">as I\u2019ve argued before</a>, is: \u201cWho will give shape to disaffection?\u201d No party, old or new, is addressing that.

The Brexit party will no doubt emerge triumphant, the Tories crushed, Labour humiliated and the Greens and the Lib Dems will make sufficient gains to claim a modicum of success. Whatever the results, they will leave untouched the fundamental problems that have created the chasm between large sections of the electorate and mainstream parties. The debate has been dominated by the rise of the Brexit party. For some, it\u2019s a distillation of far-right sentiment, for others the means to break the mould of politics. In reality, it\u2019s neither. Nigel Farage has a long history of playing to racist and reactionary themes. But the Brexit party, so far, is not a creature of the far right. If it survives, and when it finally decides on its policies, it will probably end up as a kind of Tory-party-in-exile, though more nationalist and populist. But that\u2019s also why it\u2019s no mould-breaker. With no membership, no democratic means of shaping policy and, indeed, no policies (at least until after the election), it\u2019s an expression of the hollowed-out character of contemporary politics, not a means of restoring substance to political debate. What\u2019s transforming politics is the inability of Labour or the Tories to speak to their constituencies. The shambles of the Brexit process has only deepened the sense in sections of the electorate that their voices are unheard, their votes ignored. The key question, as I\u2019ve argued before, is: \u201cWho will give shape to disaffection?\u201d No party, old or new, is addressing that. Until they do, there is unlikely to be much change to the zombie-like character of British politics. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",
