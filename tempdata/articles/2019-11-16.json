The home secretary, Priti Patel, made a last-minute intervention to block a rescue operation to bring British orphans and unaccompanied minors home from Syria, it emerged. Vince Cable predicted the election would end in a hung parliament, sparking a referendum and another general election. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats said there is a \u201cone in a million\u201d chance that Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. Labour\u2019s manifesto could be released this Thursday, according to social media posts from two shadow cabinet ministers following a meeting today. Police are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud after claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit party figures to persuade them to stand down in the general election after Labour peer Lord Falconer wrote to the Metropolitan police commissioner and director of public prosecutions calling for an investigation into what he said were \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d. Michael Gove dismissed the claims peerages were offered as \u201cnonsensical\u201d although he referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s admission that \u201cconversations may have taken place\u201d However, Brexit party MEP Ben Habib rebuffed the Tory denials: \u201cThey\u2019re being economical with the truth for sure.\u201d The Liberal Democrats came under renewed criticism over their \u201cmisleading\u201d leaflets. The fact-checking charity Full Fact warned that the misrepresentation of polling data to claim electoral advantage over rivals could have long-term implications for trust in politicians. A record number of women are expected to stand in next month\u2019s general election. More than 1,100 women have registered as candidates, making up a third of nominations, marking an increase from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015. The Conservative party has said it will triple tree-planting rates if it wins the general election, while the Liberal Democrats have promised they will plant twice as many trees as the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has hit back at Boris Johnson after the prime minister claimed his plans to nationalise the UK\u2019s broadband network were part of a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d. He tweeted that the Conservatives would dismiss proposals, if made today, to create the NHS as \u201chealth communism\u201d. The government is coming under heightened scrutiny after Brexit party officials alleged that key figures among their ranks were offered government positions and peerages in exchange for standing aside in Labour-held marginals. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has come out this afternoon saying: Nothing would surprise me about the Conservatives these days given what they\u2019ve been prepared to do. If Boris Johnson\u2019s prepared to lie to the Queen, lie to the country, you know, I\u2019m going to stop being shocked at where his lack of boundaries lies. In an interview, the Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: I think it\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s happened here. It really is. If what Nigel Farage suggests is true, that Brexit Party members have been approached by senior Conservatives asking to step down with the result being peerages, what state of affairs is our politics in? It\u2019s an absolute outrage. This could be political corruption of the highest order and in addition to that it could be seen as criminal activity. This cannot be accepted. There should be undoubtedly an investigation into the situation. Earlier, speaking on behalf of the government, Michael Gove said: The Prime Minister acknowledged that there may have been \u2018conversations\u2019 between senior Tories and people in the Brexit Party, but flatly denied there had been any offers of peerages, saying that was \u2018just not the way we operate\u2019. Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib, when asked if the Tory Party\u2019s denials were a lie, told Sky: Well I\u2019m saying they\u2019re being economical with the truth for sure. Absolutely. It has been going on. Without a shadow of a doubt. Meanwhile, the SNP has demanded a Cabinet Office probe into the allegations. Tommy Sheppard, the party\u2019s candidate for Edinburgh East and its Cabinet Office spokesman, said the allegations \u201cgo to the heart of the abuse of the peerage system\u201d: While the SNP campaign every day to outline our positive vision for Scotland, the Westminster parties seem more consumed with dodgy back-room deals to rig the system in their own favour. This is unacceptable. This is from the Observer\u2019s Mark Townsend. Evidence that could lead to criminal charges against an anti-abortion group targeting a prominent Labour MP has been passed by police to the criminal prosecution authorities. The Metropolitan Police has submitted a case file to the Crown Prosecution Service and asked for advice over whether the targeting of Stella Creasy last month by supporters of the UK branch of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR UK), an American anti-abortion organisation, constituted harassment. The development comes as a separate group has surfaced in Creasy\u2019s Walthamstow constituency with the stated aim of ousting her for her pro-choice stance. The Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA), which is opposed to equal marriage and abortion, says it will focus on attempting to depose the heavily pregnant Labour candidate, who led successful Westminster efforts to decriminalise terminations in Northern Ireland. The University of Bolton\u2019s student union president Ansh Sachdeva has taken the prime minister Boris Johnson on a short tour through the Chancellor\u2019s Mall building where donations of clothing, food, toiletries, other essentials and even phone chargers have flooded in. Johnson hailed the \u201cincredible response\u201d from the community after appeals were made via social media to help students displaced from the fire. He had brief handshakes with a number of the affected students and also met Prof William Morris, the university\u2019s deputy chair of the board of governors, who told the Prime Minister: It\u2019s been a terrific response, just marvellous. Luckily nobody was badly hurt, the fear here was tangible. The PM then travelled to the town centre where Dave Keelan, assistant chief fire officer at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, showed him the fire-damaged building and the ongoing recovery effort. A record number of women are expected to stand in next month\u2019s general election. More than 1,100 women have registered as candidates, making up a third of nominations, marking an increase from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015. The Guardian\u2019s Molly Blackall reports: The Labour party has become the first major political party in the UK to offer a majority of female candidates, with 53% of nominated candidates women \u2013 an 11% increase since the last election. Women make up 30% of the Conservative nominations, up just 1% since 2017, while the Liberal Democrats have increased their gender balance by 29% since the last election, to reach 31%. Of the Green party\u2019s candidates, 41% are female \u2013 the second highest of the major parties \u2013 followed by the Scottish National party\u2019s 34%. A quarter of Plaid Cymru\u2019s candidates are women, with the Brexit party fielding 20%. Vince Cable predicts the election will end in a hung parliament, sparking a referendum and another general election. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats said there is a \u201cone in a million\u201d chance that Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. \u201cThe idea of Jeremy Corbyn winning and becoming Prime Minister, one in a million. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Cable told Sophy Ridge on Sky News. \u201cI think we\u2019re faced with either a Johnson majority, it could happen. Although I think more likely, no majority, but hung in a different way, with more of us and more SNP.\u201d When asked if Corbyn gets into Number 10 in the event of a hung parliament, Vince said: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t and we\u2019ve been absolutely clear we couldn\u2019t possibly allow that to happen. \u201cIt would probably be some more neutral figure and then leading into a referendum to resolve the Brexit issue and another General Election soon after that.\u201d Labour\u2019s manifesto could drop this Thursday, according to social media posts from two shadow cabinet ministers. In a video posted on her Twitter account, shadow education secretory Angela Rayner said: \u201cToday I am going to our manifesto meeting where the trade unions, senior members of the Labour party, and the shadow cabinet will all get together to decide what goes in our manifesto. \u201cThank you to everyone who has contributed so far. My lips are going to have to be sealed until Thursday when we formally annouce it.\u201d Dan Carden, the shadow secretary of state for international development, also tweeted that the manifesto will be announced on Thursday The home secretary, Priti Patel, made a last-minute intervention to block a rescue operation to bring British orphans and unaccompanied minors home from Syria, the Observer has revealed. Patel was backed by several other ministers, including the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, when she objected to the extraction of British children from the war-ravaged country during National Security Council meetings last month and internal discussions. Mark Townsend, the Observer\u2019s home affairs editor, reports: More than 60 British minors, including at least three orphans, had been identified, and a quick and safe route identified to take them out of north-east Syria and then to Erbil, Iraq, where they would be flown home direct to the UK. It has also emerged that not only had the extraction plan been prepared but that a number of councils in the UK had offered the care package and reintegration programme necessary for the children following their arrival in the UK. The charity Save the Children, which has officials working in north-east Syria, described the resistance from ministers such as Patel as \u201cgrievous irresponsibility\u201d and said that \u201cplaying politics\u201d with children\u2019s lives was unacceptable. Nicola Sturgeon campaigns in Arbroath, Scotland. The first minister is visiting pro-Brexit communities in north-east Scotland to warn against the economic harm that will be done by a Tory Brexit A 71-year-old told Boris Johnson to deliver on his Brexit promises or face receiving an \u201cunpleasant\u201d letter. Johnson was out campaigning in Mansfield for Tory candidate Ben Bradley, who won the seat from Labour in 2017 by a majority of 1,057. While Johnson was warmly received by the residents in the four houses they visited in Millersdale Avenue, one woman sought reassurances from Johnson. This is from PA Media: Susan Kitchen, 71, answered at the third house and held her dog Peggy while speaking to the PM about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. She said afterwards her heart was going \u201cten to the dozen\u201d and she was \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d to see Mr Johnson. She told the PA news agency: \u201cI told him I was worried about the deal he was making and asked him specifically if their laws could overrule our laws because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \u201cHe said no, absolutely not, so I says to him if you\u2019re wrong I\u2019m going to write you a letter - and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d This is from PA Media: Boris Johnson has been told to deliver on his Brexit promises or face receiving an unpleasant letter. The prime minister knocked on doors in Mansfield in a bid to boost the election cause of Tory candidate Ben Bradley, who won the seat from Labour in 2017 by a majority of 1,057. They received a positive response from the four houses they visited in Millersdale Avenue, although one resident sought assurances over the Brexit deal on offer.

She said: \u201cJesus Christ, I cannot believe you are outside my mum and dad\u2019s house. I cannot believe you\u2019re in our street. \u201cYou have definitely got our vote. We do not like Jeremy (Corbyn).\u201d Camm told PA: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s here. I wish I was kind of dressed a bit more appropriately and didn\u2019t come running out in my socks, but it\u2019s good though.\u201d Johnson received a positive response at the second property while at the final house one man greeted him by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you young man.\u201d Further planned Nottinghamshire visits to plant a tree, in connection with one of the party\u2019s pledges, and to meet farmers were cancelled due to a change in the PM\u2019s schedule. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has planted a tree in north London at a campaign event. The move was intended to highlight the Lib Dem pledge to plant 60m trees a year if they gain power. The battle to win this election will be fought on many fronts and there will be many, many trees. The Conservative party has said it will triple tree-planting rates if it wins the general election, while the Liberal Democrats have promised they will plant twice as many trees as the Tories. Boris Johnson announced a \u00a3640m Nature for Climate fund which would increase tree planting in England, with the government aiming to work with the devolved administrations to boost tree-planting rates to 30,000 hectares every year, which the party said could mean 30m more trees. But the Liberal Democrats have said they will plant 60m trees every year, describing it as \u201cthe largest tree-planting programme in UK history\u201d. The party leader, Jo Swinson, planted a tree in north London at a campaign event this morning to highlight the party\u2019s pledge. As reported by Frances Perraudin this morning, the UK is one of the least forested countries in Europe, with just 10% of England covered by woodland, compared with 31% of France and 37% of Spain. The Brexit party MEP Ben Habib has said he thinks staying in the European Union would be better than going ahead with Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement. Habib sees the prime minister\u2019s deal as \u201cmuch worse\u201d than remaining in the bloc and that Johnson needs to be steered away from his plan. Habib told Sophy Ridge on Sky: \u201cWhat we really need to do is get the prime minister to pivot away from the withdrawal agreement.\u201d He added: \u201cI see the withdrawal agreement as much worse than remain, frankly,\u201d and that under Johnson\u2019s deal Northern Ireland would be \u201cbereft\u201d. Asked if it is the official Brexit party position that remaining in the EU is better than the prime minister\u2019s deal, he said: \u201cThat may or may not be our position. That\u2019s certainly my view.\u201d Explaining his party\u2019s decision not to stand in Tory-held seats, Habib said his party feared creating a hung parliament or giving power to the Labour party. \u201cThe key for us was to try and get a leave-sympathetic majority of parliamentarians in parliament, and we could have cut that cake in a number of different ways, but the way we decided to do it was to simply stand down against the Tories in those 317 seats,\u201d he said. When asked why the Brexit party was still standing in marginal seats held by Labour MPs, he said: \u201cWhat we\u2019d hoped was that the Tories would respond positively to the enormously generous offer that we made two weeks ago which was for them to stand down in the 150-odd seats that they haven\u2019t won for over a hundred years in the Labour heartlands.\u201d The shadow cabinet and other senior figures are slowly arriving at the party\u2019s clause V meeting in London, and have had their own messages for protesters calling on Labour to back freedom of movement. But who had the best response? The leader of Unite the Union, Len McCluskey, arriving moments after Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, approached protesters and shouted over them: \u201cI\u2019m going to support free movement, and I support migrant workers.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: \u201cEnd racism.\u201d The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, spoke briefly about Labour\u2019s immigration policy, saying: \u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019ve got international staff \u2013 nurses and doctors who continue to work for the NHS.\u201d Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have both thanked emergency services after a large fire at a student accommodation building in Bolton. Images posted on social media showed firefighters tackling the blaze on the top floors of a six-storey building. One witness described the fire as \u201ccrawl[ing] up the cladding like it was nothing\u201d. If you are looking for a break from the hectic news cycle this morning, check out the Guardian\u2019s Gary Younge. In the first of a three-part series he returns to his home town, Stevenage, to see how the bellwether constituency views the election. This is a tale of two Lewises. One, Lewis Silkin, was the minister for town and country planning in Labour\u2019s post-war government. Stevenage, the country\u2019s first new town built in 1946, was his baby. He envisioned it becoming a \u201cgay and bright place\u201d that would take the community-minded \u201cspirit of the slums\u201d and place it in the middle of the countryside with wonderful amenities and good municipal houses with gardens front and back. The other is Lewis Hamilton, Formula One champion and Stevenage\u2019s most famous son, who misspoke during the Sports Personality of the Year awards last year. In an unscripted moment, he said: \u201cIt really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums.\u201d He immediately corrected himself and later apologised. Somewhere up there Silkin stared down mouth agape, while back in Stevenage many looked on askance. Stevenage has no slums. That was the whole point. But it has seen better days. The police are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud after claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit party figures to persuade them to stand down in the general election. The Labour peer Lord Falconer has written to the Metropolitan police commissioner and director of public prosecutions calling for an investigation into what he said were \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d. Falconer said these allegations should be investigated as a matter of urgency in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the election. The Met said: \u201cThe MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] has received two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the 2019 general election. \u201cThe MPS special inquiry team is responsible for investigating all such criminal allegations. Both allegations are currently being assessed. \u201cThe MPS will not be providing comment about individual cases.\u201d The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has refused to back freedom of movement ahead of Labour\u2019s clause V meeting on Saturday. Burnham described immigration as a \u201cdifficult\u201d issue on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge show as there were \u201cstill different perspectives\u201d within the Labour party. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re right to be talking about a practical deal that keeps us as close to Europe as possible,\u201d he said. When asked whether he thinks Labour should back a position where free movement of people ends after Brexit, Burnham said: \u201cI think the public voted for change in the way the immigration arrangements work with Europe. \u201cTo deny that I think would be to deny what many people were saying when they went to vote in 2016, and that\u2019s just in my view, a fact. And it doesn\u2019t help politicians, it doesn\u2019t help parliament, if they look like they\u2019re kind of cocooned away from that public view. \u201cBut I think what we shouldn\u2019t do is introduce wholesale change. Just some greater management of the system.\u201d Burnham added he saw evidence of free movement allowing the undercutting of wages, where people were brought in by agencies from other European countries. \u201cThose are the issues that need to be addressed,\u201d he said. The Liberal Democrats have been criticised for their selective use of polling data on leaflets. The factchecking charity Full Fact has warned that attempts to mislead voters by using polling data to claim electoral advantage over rivals could have long-term implications for trust in politicians. Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent, reports that leaflets across the country show the Liberal Democrats appear to be using bar charts to press home a message that they have a good chance of winning, even in seats where the likes of the Tories\u2019 Jacob Rees-Mogg or Labour stalwarts are seen as unlikely to be dislodged. In some leaflets the party omitted spectacular results for the Brexit party in bar charts showing the European election results, while in others it projected local election results to forecast wins in the general election. The party has also been criticised for using data from Flavible, an obscure company that is not a member of the British Polling Council. Good morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin and welcome to the politics live blog. We\u2019re liveblogging every weekend as well as weekdays during the election. Lucky you! All eyes will be on Labour\u2019s manifesto, which Jeremy Corbyn vowed would \u201cknock your socks off\u201d. The manifesto will be finalised in today\u2019s clause V meeting and immigration has re-emerged as a key battleground. The Daily Telegraph reported that Corbyn faces a frontbench split, referring to claims that a draft version of Labour\u2019s manifesto contains a commitment to freedom of movement. The newspaper quoted a shadow cabinet source as saying: \u201cIf we maintain a close relationship with the single market then we are going to have to maintain freedom of movement. That\u2019s a given.\u201d The Independent reported that policies of extending free movement and giving foreign nationals the right to vote in all UK elections, which passed at the party\u2019s annual conference on Saturday, are expected to be watered down or scrapped. Meanwhile, Wiley, the so-called godfather of grime, has come out in support of Corbyn. The endorsement follows reports that some of the artists involved with the Grime4Corbyn movement, which launched two years ago with the aim of connecting energised fans with the Labour leader\u2019s politics, now question the effectiveness of the campaign. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the action and keeping you updated on all the developments. To send me your tips and favourite Wiley songs, your best bet is to tweet me @aamnamohdin",

Nine years later, <a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1983/1983-labour-manifesto.shtml\" title=\"\">in 1983</a>, another iconoclastic Labour manifesto proposed controls on the City of London and unilateral nuclear disarmament.
