      "bodyText": "A third fish kill has occurred near Menindee on the Darling River overnight after temperatures plummeted following days of hot weather. The latest fish kill follows an incident on 6 and 7 January in which hundreds of thousands of native fish, including Murray cod, golden perch and bony bream died around the Menindee weir. There was also another mass kill before Christmas. \u201cThis is likely worse than the last time,\u201d said local Graeme McCrabb, who on Monday morning was down at the water\u2019s edge at the back of the township, above Weir 32. \u201cI\u2019ve just picked up a 50cm golden perch, and there are tens of thousands of little bony bream, dead. \u201cThere are fish all around me just gasping for breath,\u201d he said. McCrabb said he had not spotted any Murray cod, which can grow to a metre and be up to 40 or 50 years old. But he said that during the previous fish kill the Murray cod had been the last to surface. Menindee tourism operator Rob Gregory told Guardian Australia he could see thousands of dead fish on Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re down on the edge now and there\u2019s quite a lot of fish dying in front of us at the moment,\u201d he said. Gregory said there had been a couple of cooler days in the area, and the fish may have died on Sunday, sunk to the bottom of the river and then floated up on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, we\u2019re seeing the fish that are the only ones left that are dying now. It\u2019s certainly disheartening there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d he said. Gregory urged the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to sort out the management of the basin. \u201cToday is the day they need to get on a plane here and have a look for themselves what mismanagement is doing,\u201d he said. Berejiklian suggested the mass kill could not have been avoided, saying \u201cwe cannot control the weather\u201d. \u201cUnder the current circumstances, if we could have avoided it we will,\u201d she told reporters in Sydney. \u201cI was advised the sudden drop in temperature makes it conducive, unfortunately, for the fish to be deprived of oxygen.\u201d The federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the Murray-Darling was \u201cfacing the makings of an ecological disaster\u201d. \u201cThis is not standard, this is not normal. This is a disaster,\u201d he told reporters in Melbourne. NSW regional water minister Niall Blair said aerators had been installed between the fish kill events but it was difficult to prevent. \u201cUnfortunately though we\u2019re expecting the conditions to potentially continue to deteriorate,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney. He said there have also been reports of trout deaths in the Thredbo River. Blair defended his state government\u2019s water release management practices and said he\u2019s looking to head out to the area as soon as possible. An interim investigation by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, released last week, found the previous deaths were likely to have been caused by \u201cseveral related and compounding factors resulting in low oxygen in the river\u201d. The report also confirmed the second incident on 6 January involved the \u201cunprecedented\u201d death of \u201chundreds of thousands of fish\u201d. The report blamed \u201cthermal stratification in which a warmer surface layer of about one metre of water sat above a cooler deeper layer (2-3m) of water with very low dissolved oxygen\u201d. \u201cThese conditions were conducive to blue-green algal blooms in the surface layers,\u201d it said. \u201cAnother substantial drop in air temperatures from 46C to 28C on January 4 and 5 associated with cold fronts passing through the region again caused layers of water with different dissolved oxygen levels to mix, reducing the overall dissolved oxygen available,\u201d the report said. There was also a release from Pamamaroo Lake which is thought to have put high salt levels into the river. Locals had feared fluctuations in water temperature could trigger another fish kill. Menindee has been sweltering under temperatures above 40C. There has been little or no flow in the Darling River, due to the extended drought conditions. McCrabb said the Department of Primary Industries staff had left, as had the clean-up crew sent in to deal with the earlier fish kill. On Monday morning a Department of Primary Industry spokeswoman said fisheries officers were en route to assess the situation in the Menindee weir pool and neighbouring sections of the Darling River. \u201c[The fish kill] is likely linked to some rain and cooler temperatures in the Menindee area following an extended period of very hot weather,\u201d the spokeswoman said.",

Finally, 40 years after the war, she wrote her children a heartbreaking letter that became the basis of her memoir Inherit the Truth.

As Anita <a href=\"https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-lasker-wallfisch/542306\" title=\"\">told the German parliament</a>: \u201cIt is about making certain that it can never \u2013 never ever \u2013 happen again.\u201d</p>",

Why was I picking my face when I was two?\u201d Because I was absent, replied Anita. \u201cThe reason you were always absent was because of the Holocaust, because your mission was to build back some kind of a life.\u201d I hope Anita didn\u2019t mean what she said next. \u201cTo me, anyone who has got a roof over their head and enough food \u2013 forget the trauma.\u201d But we mustn\u2019t forget this trauma, be it to witnesses like Anita or their children like Maya, who will soon inherit the unsought burden of fighting humanity\u2019s tendency to forget what we must remember. As Anita told the German parliament: \u201cIt is about making certain that it can never \u2013 never ever \u2013 happen again.\u201d",

Among the tens of thousands who waited in line to hear Harris speak were tech workers and school administrators; doctors from Berkeley and members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Harris\u2019 sorority; an Oakland high school student preparing to vote for the first time; and an IT worker who had been shaken by the resurgence of racism during Obama\u2019s second term. Harris \u201csounds like another version of Obama\u201d, said Mark Olford, 46, who spent more than a decade working in IT in Australia, and said he was troubled on his return to find America seemed to have taken several steps backward on racism. Electing a candidate of color would help, Olford said, arguing that white political candidates seemed less invested in the struggles of minorities in America. Bahja Johnson, 29 and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historic black sorority Harris joined in college, said she would have questions about how well Harris lives up to that campaign slogan: \u201cFor the people.\u201d But Johnson also said she wanted to focus for a day on the historic nature of the campaign. \u201cThis is a black woman running for president,\u201d Johnson said, adding that the Harris campaign was tremendously important for women of color even if they do not end up choosing her as their candidate. \u201cYou can\u2019t be it until you see it,\u201d Johnson said her mother had always told her. Her friend Lauren Zabel, who works in tech, said: \u201cKamala is an intersectional candidate. She has an Indian mother and a black father. Her husband is Jewish. She\u2019s a stepmother. I think a lot of people can relate to that.\u201d Both women said Harris\u2019 tough questioning of Trump supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last October made them feel she was representing them in a room of powerful men determined to secure the appointment. \u201cIf she can hold her own there,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cshe can hold her own anywhere.\u201d But both had questions about Harris\u2019 record as a prosecutor, and her choices when as Zabel put it, it came to \u201cputting people of color in jail\u201d. In a new book, Harris embraces the Black Lives Matter movement and calls for swift action on police brutality. But she is facing scrutiny for the tensions between her progressive rhetoric as a senator and her record as San Francisco district attorney and attorney general of California, particularly on policing, sex work, trans rights and prisons. Activists in San Francisco and Oakland say she ignored calls to use her office to hold police accountable for the killings of black and Latino men. Johnson on Sunday said she wanted to give Harris a chance to speak to her own record, \u201cbefore I start to tear apart her platform\u201d. Taylor Nelson, 17, a high schooler from Oakland, said the rally was her first step in preparing to vote for the first time. Harris\u2019 positions on gun reform, birth control and the border would be important, she said. \u201cI am happy it\u2019s a lot of women running,\u201d Nelson added. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard have also declared their candidacies. There were dissenting voices on Sunday, too. Dina Asfaha, 20, from Berkeley, stood in the street wearing two posters attacking Harris\u2019 record and arguing that Harris was \u201cfor the ruling class\u201d and not \u201cfor the people\u201d. Harris \u201chijacks leftist language language\u201d and \u201cweaponizes her identity\u201d, said Asfaha, who noted she herself was a black woman. A member of the local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, she said she supported the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders for president in 2020. With her announcement a week ago, Harris joined a crowded Democratic primary field. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former Republican mayor of New York City, former vice-president Joe Biden and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke are also considering runs, as are senators including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohioand Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg have declared campaigns. Controversy continued on Sunday over the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz\u2019s apparent plan to run as an independent.",

She plays a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking. Rashmi is complex, edgy and selfish \u2013 everything you wouldn\u2019t expect of a Pinto character. After all, the Indian actor, who made her name in Danny Boyle\u2019s phenomenally successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/09/slumdog-millionaire-review-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Slumdog Millionaire</a>, has spent much of her career playing eye candy. And she is sick of it.</p> <p>Love Sonia is relentless. A debt-ridden father sells his teenage daughter Preeti to a landlord, who then trafficks her to a brothel in Mumbai. Her sister Sonia, brilliantly played by newcomer Mrunal Thakur, goes in search of her, and is also ensnared in the trafficking web. She is anally raped to preserve her value as a virgin. Having lost her virginity, she is stitched so she can once again be sold as untouched. Just when you think things can\u2019t get worse, they do.</p> <p>Pinto\u2019s older sex worker appears to befriend Sonia, but ultimately betrays her to protect herself. This is a world without love or loyalty and reflects a stark reality. Last year, India was named the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-dangerous-poll-exclusive/exclusive-india-most-dangerous-country-for-women-with-sexual-violence-rife-global-poll-idUSKBN1JM01X\" title=\"\">by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of 550 experts on women\u2019s issues</a>. </p> <p>Love Sonia has been 10 years in the making. Pinto was first shown an early version of the script by director Tabrez Noorani the day after she finished shooting Slumdog Millionaire. Noorani, a line producer on Slumdog Millionaire, wrote Love Sonia after helping to rescue trafficked women from brothels. But it took another decade to finesse the script, get financial backing and find the right Sonia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1b32a4a33bb2ce072f279d870eba2430588246c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1b32a4a33bb2ce072f279d870eba2430588246c/0_34_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freida Pinto in Love Sonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freida Pinto in Love Sonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BIG STUFF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Slumdog Millionaire, in which Pinto played Latika, a street kid described as \u201cthe most beautiful girl in the world\u201d, she was keen for a more demanding role. But in hindsight, she says she wasn\u2019t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. \u201cI thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading.\u201d Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. She winces when she recalls a question she asked one of them. \u201cI said: \u2018Hypothetically speaking, if you had a chance to leave this world, let\u2019s say you fell in love and found somebody who\u2019d treat you right for once, would you escape?\u2019 And she said to me: \u2018Madam, love only exists in your world. In my world, there is just betrayal.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/love-sonia-review-sex-trafficking-drama-tabrez-noorani\">Love Sonia review \u2013 flawed but powerful sex-trafficking drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trajectory of Pinto\u2019s career in the years after Slumdog certainly didn\u2019t suggest she would ever make a hard-hitting film about sex trafficking. Time after time, she played the vapid love interest, characters so underwritten that they struggled to be one-dimensional. So in Woody Allen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/17/you-will-meet-a-tall-dark-stranger-review\" title=\"\">You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger</a>, Josh Brolin\u2019s author, Roy, spends his time staring longingly out of the window at Pinto\u2019s Dia in the flat opposite. When he confesses this to her, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be someone\u2019s muse.\u201d In Terence Mallick\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/knight-of-cups-review-film-terrence-malick-christian-bale\" title=\"\">Knight of Cups</a>, she is a pouting femme fatale who states: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wreak havoc in men\u2019s lives any more.\u201d In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/02/miral-review\" title=\"\">Miral</a>, directed by Julian Schnabel, she plays a Palestinian heroine whose boyfriend tells her she has \u201cbeautiful eyes\u201d, while an Israeli interrogator tells her: \u201cYou have a beautiful face \u2026 you won\u2019t recognise it when you get out of here.\u201d Some of the world\u2019s best-known directors have been so fixated on her looks that they forgot to create a character for her. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t go past what they saw on the outside,\u201d Pinto says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s their problem, not mine, right, because I know what I can bring to the table as talent.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a strange, decade-long career, including an unexplained extended break. Meanwhile, off-screen she has been an assertive force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? \u201cCompletely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.\u201d </p> <p>Pinto takes me through some of her experiences, with jaw-dropping honesty. She loved working with Brolin on the Allen film (\u201cJosh taught me to relax because I would get really worked up before each take \u2013 I was too nervous to breathe and my body would stiffen\u201d), but has nothing positive to say of her part. \u201cI was just the muse, the ingenue.\u201d Would she work again with Allen, who has been accused by his daughter Dylan of sexual assault (an allegation he denies)? \u201cNo. Absolutely not. I wouldn\u2019t work with him because I\u2019m in solidarity with women who have come out with their stories, whether they are proven or not. I\u2019m just going to stick to what my gut instinct tells me. I\u2019m 34 years old, I\u2019ve worked for 11 years in this industry, I\u2019m not desperate and I will never be desperate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8987a05727853334e88408aea027a39014474d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8987a05727853334e88408aea027a39014474d60/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The most beautiful girl in the world\u2019 \u2013 Pinto in Slumdog Millionaire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The most beautiful girl in the world\u2019 \u2026 Pinto in Slumdog Millionaire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then it is on to another unhappy experience, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, made in 2011. Pinto was looking forward to playing a smart, independent-minded primatologist.

Have you seen Jane Goodall wearing high heels and running on the Golden Gate Bridge? I don\u2019t think so. I spoke to one of the producers and asked why I was put in high heels because it didn\u2019t make sense for my character \u2013 if she was so hands-on with animals, she needed freedom of movement and her body language needed to be different. I wish I\u2019d been more confident in putting my case forward back then, but I remember asking him what his reference was and I was told Megan Fox from Transformers and I was like \u2013 that is a completely different film.\u201d Again, she doesn\u2019t write off the experience \u2013 she got to work with some of her favourite actors, including Andy Serkis and John Lithgow \u2013 but she does write off her role in the film.</p> <p>Pinto is not finished yet.

I hurt the poor boy\u2019s feelings.\u201d How did he react? \u201cApparently he was very upset. My mum told me he never sang again after that.\u201d</p> <p>She studied English literature, and after graduating in 2005 went into modelling. Two years later, she was cast in Slumdog Millionaire, despite having no acting experience. The film won eight Oscars, including best picture and director.

We\u2019re two different parts of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Did she ever think of sticking two fingers up at the film industry and walking way? \u201cYeah, I did. And it cost me two and a half years. I didn\u2019t work for two and a half years.\u201d At 28, she says, she had an existential crisis. \u201cI thought: is this something I really want to do, or am I just doing it because I got this amazing start to my career and now this is all I know how to do?\u201d</p> <p>So she waited for a good job to come along.

L\u2019Or\u00e9al denies altering her skin tone but she says: \u201cI\u2019m sure they did, because that\u2019s not the colour of my skin you saw in a few of the campaigns.\u201d </p> <p>Did she complain? \u201cI said to my agent after the first controversy that I would like to see the pictures before, and I would like to be able to question them on colour correction.\u201d She also insisted on having a clause written into her contract. \u201cAll the brands, including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, have a skin-lightening range that they sell in India and I made them put it in my contract that I would not touch that with a barge pole. If you don\u2019t put it in your contract before you sign on, they can come and you will be compelled to do it.\u201d After she protested about the skin-lightening, she says, it never happened again. (L\u2019Or\u00e9al has been approached for a comment.) </p> <p>Pinto has lived in Los Angeles for nine years, and says she feels at home there; her boyfriend, adventure photographer Cory Tran, is also LA-based.

Pinto\u2019s underground activist Jas Mitra was a formidable character, leading from the front. She says this was the start of her reinvention as an actor. At one point Jas says to one of the men in her life: \u201cThe first chance you get, you reduce me to my looks.\u201d I tell her it feels personal \u2013 that it could be aimed at directors such as Allen or Mallick. \u201cYep!\u201d she says, with a broad smile. She says that bit of dialogue was the result of a conversation she had with Guerrilla director John Ridley. \u201cI talked to John about looks and how they hold people back and I told him how crazy it is to be a little fed up to be told you\u2019re beautiful. I know I sound ungrateful, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m very grateful for what I have, but I\u2019m fed up of hearing other people tell me that or remind me of that.\u201d</p> <p>As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn\u2019t done well.\u201d But she says she is not going to judge the film\u2019s success by its box-office takings \u2013 highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important.</p> <p>In many ways, Pinto is just starting out as an actor \u2013 and still has much to prove. But despite everything she has said today, she insists there is nothing she would change. If she hadn\u2019t done all the naff work, she says, she wouldn\u2019t be where she is now \u2013 and it\u2019s great to have got her existential crisis out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m glad the reality check happened. Now I think I can finally say I\u2019ve figured things out for myself.\u201d</p> <p><em>Love Sonia is on general release</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Freida Pinto\u2019s role in her new film Love Sonia is shocking. She plays a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking. Rashmi is complex, edgy and selfish \u2013 everything you wouldn\u2019t expect of a Pinto character. After all, the Indian actor, who made her name in Danny Boyle\u2019s phenomenally successful Slumdog Millionaire, has spent much of her career playing eye candy. And she is sick of it. Love Sonia is relentless. A debt-ridden father sells his teenage daughter Preeti to a landlord, who then trafficks her to a brothel in Mumbai. Her sister Sonia, brilliantly played by newcomer Mrunal Thakur, goes in search of her, and is also ensnared in the trafficking web. She is anally raped to preserve her value as a virgin. Having lost her virginity, she is stitched so she can once again be sold as untouched. Just when you think things can\u2019t get worse, they do. Pinto\u2019s older sex worker appears to befriend Sonia, but ultimately betrays her to protect herself. This is a world without love or loyalty and reflects a stark reality. Last year, India was named the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking, by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of 550 experts on women\u2019s issues. Love Sonia has been 10 years in the making. Pinto was first shown an early version of the script by director Tabrez Noorani the day after she finished shooting Slumdog Millionaire. Noorani, a line producer on Slumdog Millionaire, wrote Love Sonia after helping to rescue trafficked women from brothels. But it took another decade to finesse the script, get financial backing and find the right Sonia. After Slumdog Millionaire, in which Pinto played Latika, a street kid described as \u201cthe most beautiful girl in the world\u201d, she was keen for a more demanding role. But in hindsight, she says she wasn\u2019t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. \u201cI thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading.\u201d Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. She winces when she recalls a question she asked one of them. \u201cI said: \u2018Hypothetically speaking, if you had a chance to leave this world, let\u2019s say you fell in love and found somebody who\u2019d treat you right for once, would you escape?\u2019 And she said to me: \u2018Madam, love only exists in your world. In my world, there is just betrayal.\u2019\u201d The trajectory of Pinto\u2019s career in the years after Slumdog certainly didn\u2019t suggest she would ever make a hard-hitting film about sex trafficking. Time after time, she played the vapid love interest, characters so underwritten that they struggled to be one-dimensional. So in Woody Allen\u2019s You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Josh Brolin\u2019s author, Roy, spends his time staring longingly out of the window at Pinto\u2019s Dia in the flat opposite. When he confesses this to her, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be someone\u2019s muse.\u201d In Terence Mallick\u2019s Knight of Cups, she is a pouting femme fatale who states: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wreak havoc in men\u2019s lives any more.\u201d In Miral, directed by Julian Schnabel, she plays a Palestinian heroine whose boyfriend tells her she has \u201cbeautiful eyes\u201d, while an Israeli interrogator tells her: \u201cYou have a beautiful face \u2026 you won\u2019t recognise it when you get out of here.\u201d Some of the world\u2019s best-known directors have been so fixated on her looks that they forgot to create a character for her. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t go past what they saw on the outside,\u201d Pinto says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s their problem, not mine, right, because I know what I can bring to the table as talent.\u201d It has been a strange, decade-long career, including an unexplained extended break. Meanwhile, off-screen she has been an assertive force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? \u201cCompletely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.\u201d Pinto takes me through some of her experiences, with jaw-dropping honesty. She loved working with Brolin on the Allen film (\u201cJosh taught me to relax because I would get really worked up before each take \u2013 I was too nervous to breathe and my body would stiffen\u201d), but has nothing positive to say of her part. \u201cI was just the muse, the ingenue.\u201d Would she work again with Allen, who has been accused by his daughter Dylan of sexual assault (an allegation he denies)? \u201cNo. Absolutely not. I wouldn\u2019t work with him because I\u2019m in solidarity with women who have come out with their stories, whether they are proven or not. I\u2019m just going to stick to what my gut instinct tells me. I\u2019m 34 years old, I\u2019ve worked for 11 years in this industry, I\u2019m not desperate and I will never be desperate.\u201d Then it is on to another unhappy experience, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, made in 2011. Pinto was looking forward to playing a smart, independent-minded primatologist. But it didn\u2019t work out that way. \u201cI felt completely undermined as the only female perfomer in the film who wasn\u2019t given a task other than to be a primatologist in frickin\u2019 high heels and follow the men around. Have you seen Jane Goodall wearing high heels and running on the Golden Gate Bridge? I don\u2019t think so. I spoke to one of the producers and asked why I was put in high heels because it didn\u2019t make sense for my character \u2013 if she was so hands-on with animals, she needed freedom of movement and her body language needed to be different. I wish I\u2019d been more confident in putting my case forward back then, but I remember asking him what his reference was and I was told Megan Fox from Transformers and I was like \u2013 that is a completely different film.\u201d Again, she doesn\u2019t write off the experience \u2013 she got to work with some of her favourite actors, including Andy Serkis and John Lithgow \u2013 but she does write off her role in the film. Pinto is not finished yet. Now we are on to Black Gold, a historical epic about the scramble for oil in the Arabian desert in the 1920s. \u201cIn Black Gold, what was I? Like a princess who had no say, who was just in love \u2026 I can\u2019t even remember the story, that\u2019s how bad it is.\u201d And she is really trying hard to remember her character now. \u201cOh my God! What was my role? I have no frickin clue! Oh my God, that\u2019s terrible.\u201d In 30 years of interviewing, I have never heard somebody trash their career so comprehensively \u2013 or honestly. Pinto is on a brief visit to Britain from Los Angeles, where she now lives, to promote Love Sonia. We meet at the central London hotel where she is staying. She arrives quietly, orders a camomile tea and gets on with it. Pinto is, of course, gorgeous; slightly built, but strong-looking. She is also bright, intense and combative. In her tracksuit top and bottoms and surprisingly large trainers (size eight and a half), she resembles a Hollywood action hero. Her accent is a weird global confection \u2013 cut-glass English, Indian, American, with an upward Aussie inflection. She says people tell her she sounds South African. Pinto was born in Mumbai (then still Bombay) to Mangalorean Catholics \u2013 her mother was a school principal, her father a bank manager. She went to convent school and was a confident, outspoken girl. She says she soon felt stymied by the dogma of the church. \u201cI was 13 or 14 when I heard a priest talk about homosexuality in a sermon.

(L\u2019Or\u00e9al has been approached for a comment.) Pinto has lived in Los Angeles for nine years, and says she feels at home there; her boyfriend, adventure photographer Cory Tran, is also LA-based. She often spends time in Mumbai, where her parents and sister still live. In 2017, she returned to the screen with Guerrilla, a TV drama about Britain\u2019s black power movement. Pinto\u2019s underground activist Jas Mitra was a formidable character, leading from the front. She says this was the start of her reinvention as an actor. At one point Jas says to one of the men in her life: \u201cThe first chance you get, you reduce me to my looks.\u201d I tell her it feels personal \u2013 that it could be aimed at directors such as Allen or Mallick. \u201cYep!\u201d she says, with a broad smile. She says that bit of dialogue was the result of a conversation she had with Guerrilla director John Ridley. \u201cI talked to John about looks and how they hold people back and I told him how crazy it is to be a little fed up to be told you\u2019re beautiful. I know I sound ungrateful, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m very grateful for what I have, but I\u2019m fed up of hearing other people tell me that or remind me of that.\u201d As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn\u2019t done well.\u201d But she says she is not going to judge the film\u2019s success by its box-office takings \u2013 highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important. In many ways, Pinto is just starting out as an actor \u2013 and still has much to prove. But despite everything she has said today, she insists there is nothing she would change. If she hadn\u2019t done all the naff work, she says, she wouldn\u2019t be where she is now \u2013 and it\u2019s great to have got her existential crisis out of the way. \u201cI\u2019m glad the reality check happened. Now I think I can finally say I\u2019ve figured things out for myself.\u201d Love Sonia is on general release",

Finally, perhaps I\u2019m biased as I\u2019m Swiss, but I can\u2019t help but remark that the the evil trifecta of VAR, inviting more nations to international tournaments, and European clubs pressuring for a super league all started after the demise of Sepp Blatter.

      "bodyText": "Here is David Hytner\u2019s report from Stamford Bridge: Some Chelsea reaction from the official organ. While the match report is being readied, have some transfer news. That 14-second delay didn\u2019t work out for anyone, did it? Fuller quotes from Hudson-Odoi from that flash interview and on Bayern Munich. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t say, but you know I will just keep working hard and you never know what happens. Chat with Bayern Munich? \u201cI can\u2019t say, I haven\u2019t, I haven\u2019t\u2026(inaudible). Tracy Caton\u2019s earlier email has set off some reactions. First, Eduoard: \u201cMay I second Tracy Caton ? I\u2019m a perfectly calm and reasonable person who can discuss politics without showing much emotion. but VAR seriously triggers me. It will kill the passion and \u201cmagic moments\u201d in the sport, which is what it boasted above all over other sports. It\u2019s sad to think that moments like Manchester United winning in 1999 in the last minutes would probably be utterly ruined by VAR now. All that for decisions that are still controversial and showing that applying the rulebook draconianly isn\u2019t all that. Finally, perhaps I\u2019m biased as I\u2019m Swiss, but I can\u2019t help but remark that the the evil trifecta of VAR, inviting more nations to international tournaments, and European clubs pressuring for a super league all started after the demise of Sepp Blatter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d Second, James Russell. \u201cLet\u2019s leave out the swearing and concentrate on the logic She hasn\u2019t watched it so doesn\u2019t have a first-hand opinion on the decisions but criticises the system anyway.\u201d Hudson-Odoi and Willian did a quick bit of post-match chat. HO: \u201cI am delighted, we did very well.\u201d W: \u201cWe deserved to go through. My second was a great combination with Olivier Giroud, and a great goal.\u201d HO: \u201cWe worked really hard in training. We pulled it back from the Arsenal game.\u201d W: \u201cWe have to continue in the same way, we can\u2019t go up and down.\u201d HO (on his goal): \u201cIt think it\u2019s definitely one of highlights. Andreas picked me out well. I learned it [the finish] from him [Willian].\u201d HO (on his future): \u201cI don\u2019t, I can\u2019t say. We will have to see what happened. I can\u2019t say.\u201d Hudson-Odoi has just thrown his shirt into the crowd, where a grateful young fan is the recipient. Will that be the last time? And that\u2019s the last of it. Chelsea just too good for Wednesday, whose players look exhausted with all the effort they put in. 90+2 min: Willian really wants that hat-trick. He cuts in from the left, and hits a singeing shot wide of the opposite post. He has been outstanding. 90 min: Merciful release for Wednesday in just two minutes being added on. 89 min: Jorginho has been brought on to pass Sheff Wed to death. Hudson-Odoi clearly fancied another but is tackled as he attempts some showboating. 87 min: Willian got a knock, and is limping a little, but clearly fancies a hat-trick. Chelsea are pushing on for more, and Giroud fancies a goal. Jorginho\u2019s chip is superb, and then Giroud tries an aerial volley. It doesn\u2019t go in, and all is smiles, but therein a reason he has scored just one Premier League goal and Chelsea have turned to Higua\u00edn. 85 min: Off comes Ross Barkley, who has been quiet, for Jorginho, who won\u2019t get to link with Higua\u00edn tonight. Willian starts the move himself, Giroud holds the ball up and his flick finds the Brazilian, whose finish is unerring. 82 min: And that\u2019s the end for Higua\u00edn, as Giroud comes on. Giroud, who was last January\u2019s answer to Chelsea\u2019s striker problem. 81 min: Bannan\u2019s long ball is nowhere near Forestieri. Chelsea then pile on the pressure. Higua\u00edn makes one last attempt to get into the penalty box but the ball never arrives from Hudson-Odoi. 79 min: Willian tries to link up with Higua\u00edn but the link-up play was not on the right wavelength. Similar is attempted with Kovacic, and with Olivier Giroud stripped and ready on the sidelines, the chances of a debut goal have ebbed into nothingness. 77 min: Willian shows off his work-rate by chasing down some Sheffield Wednesday shadows when the game is surely won. 75 min: The game has petered out somewhat. It looks as if Higua\u00edn will be playing the full 90 minutes. Will he get his goal? For Sheff Wed, off go George Boyd and Fletcher and on come Lucas Joao and Atdhe Nuhiu 73 min: The Wednesday fans are filling the night sky with noise, as they often do. Usually a big away support. Theirs is, of course, a big club fallen on hard times. 71 min: Tracy Caton emails in: \u201cNot watching the game so no idea if the \u201cdecisions\u201d were \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. But I know that the Wednesday fans have it right: VAR is COMPLETE ******* **** Pochettino can see it - I ask myself why the media as a whole is complicit in the introduction of this needless unfair (potentially) extremely corrupt system which is going to seriously damage football.\u201d 70 min: Wednesday pushing on a bit now, but far too late, of course. Like England in the West Indies, as watched by Steve Bruce, they left themselves with far too much to do. 69 min: Wednesday sub: Fernando Forestieri is on for Pelupessy. 67 min: By the way, that assist for Hudson-Odoi came from a fine pass by Christensen. Such bright, youthful prospects at Chelsea, but how long they linger and how much chance they get is the question. 66 min: The Agnew plan is in tatters, and Chelsea have made a sub. Ampadu comes off, and Loftus-Cheek gets a much-needed run-out. What a goal, and how much does the price-tag go up? Lovely pass to find him, a cut inside and a shot that Westwood might have done better with. 63 min: Chance for Higua\u00edn, as an Ampadu cross meets his ample forehead. He can\u2019t, though, get enough power and direction on the ball. 61 min: Chelsea content to play the ball around midfield. A change is going to come soon. If it\u2019s Hudson-Odoi, then he seems likely to be eating fr\u00fchst\u00fcck rather than breakfast in the near future. 60 min: Chelsea not exactly going for the throat. This game is now meandering. Adam Reach forces Wednesday\u2019s first corner. Bannan\u2019s corner, though, is as foul as his language has been. 57 min: Steven Fletcher robs Kovacic, but is baulked on the edge of the Chelsea box. Chelsea break but meet the same fate on the edge of the Wednesday box. Barry Bannan is still complaining to the referee. 55 min: Chelsea look the more likelier team by far. Wednesday\u2019s efforts concentrated on officialdom. Adam Reach is telling his nearest linesman that Alonso has been diving. 53 min: Chance for Chelsea! Lots of chances. Willian gets to the byline and both Kovacic and Higua\u00edn cannot get close to the ball. Hudson-Odoi can only run the loose ball down a blind alley. 52 min: Barry Bannan, voice of the fans, is having a real go at the referee. It was him who led the delegation during that flurry of penalty claims and counterclaims. 51 min: Kovacic, Higua\u00edn and Hudson-Odoi misread each other\u2019s intentions, then Caballero makes a handling error at the other end. Wednesday make nothing of the territory that gains them. 49 min: Wednesday have begun this half as passively as they did the first. The replay back at Hillsborough appears the plan and that will arrive via a late equaliser. 47 min: Barkley is fouled by Pelupessy, and then has a nip back. The Chelsea player is lucky the free-kick stayed Chelsea\u2019s. Marcos Alonso, charges up the flank, and fires in a cross that is missed by everyone, reason being that it was an absolute rocket. 46 min: Higua\u00edn, in gloves, gets the game back underway, after sharing a joke with ref Andre Marriner. Look away now, suspicious Owls fans. The players are back out and off we go. Spurs will not be the next round, after this happened, as seen by Dom Fifield. Joe Ludlam emails in: \u201cEvening, biased opinion from a Wednesday fan here. The VAR decisions were both correct, but an uncontested drop-ball for the Chelsea keeper didn\u2019t feel like a fair outcome for Wednesday as VAR clearly showed a corner should have been awarded. If VAR is to be accepted, that needs looking at. The fact Chelsea scored almost straight from it doesn\u2019t help.\u201d VAR has been the star, with Wednesday\u2019s \u2018penalty\u2019 ruled out and Chelsea\u2019s given the kite mark of safety. Boos for the referee and Willian from the away fans. Wednesday, aside from that penalty, have not been able to make much of an impression on a pedestrian Chelsea. Higua\u00edn may not be at 100 percent sharpness. 45+2 min: Chelsea happy to keep the ball moving. Then Hudson-Odoi and Azplicueta force a corner. Wednesday defenders get the ball clear. 45 min: Two minutes added on to the half, which seems skinny, considering all the VAR-related delays. 44 min: Referee Marriner made himself even more unpopular with the Owls when he waves on an advantage when Wednesday wanted a free-kick they launch players forward for. He will be booed from the field, no doubt about it. 43 min: Higua\u00edn does look, it has to be said, a little tired. He has done plenty of chasing, to be fair to him. 42 min: A reversed pass from Kovacic is aimed at Higua\u00edn, who just fails to get there. A semblance of understanding being struck up there? And just wait until the striker is reunited with Jorginho. 41 min: Chelsea passing it around the back, with no semblance of a high press by Sheffield Wednesday attackers. That idea of keeping it tight until half-time is being acted on. 39 min: Higua\u00edn runs down the channel to the right of the Wednesday goal but nobody else is there to back him up. Chelsea have not exactly been dynamic in attack. 38 min: Hutchinson - in a revenge attack? - flails into a tackle on Kovacic. He is lucky to escape a yellow card. Morgan Fox is not so lucky, as he is carded for his second hack at Hudson-Odoi. 36 mins: Loud cheers as Sheff Wed win a foul as Kovacic knocks Hutchinson over. Irony rains down. 34 mins: \u201cVAR is ****ing ****,\u201d according to the Wednesday fans. If you can\u2019t beat a giant, best to have been done over by The Man and the Deep State. 33 min: Hudson-Odoi, down the right, is fouled by Fox. The boos ring out from the Owls contingent as Willian takes it; is that because he scored the penalty? 32 min: Sheffield Wednesday have a chance to break but Pelupessy and Reach are on different wavelengths and the ball was allowed to run off the touchline. A shame, really. 30 min: Now, what precisely do the Owls do now? The sensible plan would be to keep it tight, and last until half-time. A replay shows that Higua\u00edn wanted to take the penalty but Willian regretted to inform him that he was the penalty taker around here. 28 min: Boos from the South Yorkshire contingent as Willian takes a corner. Neither Rudiger or Christensen could make anything of that. 26 min: The Wednesday players are angry and plead injustice, but both questions were correct. The game might have been better if their penalty had been allowed to stand, but that\u2019s as far as it goes. VAR saps such romance. A stutter step, and Westwood is sent the wrong way as Willian converts. Azpilicueta turns in the box and is fouled by Hutchinson. VAR is called for, but there can be no doubt. That was a cleaning out of the Chelsea captain. The decision is overturned. Ampadu got to the ball first and a drop-ball is given. Steve Agnew looks aghast. And Ampadu, who was beside himself, can breathe again. Pelupessy burst into the box and Ampadu came across him. Penalty given! VAR is called for by the crowd and Andre Marriner waits to hear news from the videodrome. 20 min: Sheff Wed could do with pushing on a bit here, as the ball is coming straight back at them. They have defended well enough, but can\u2019t last this out, surely. 19 min: Close! Hudson-Odoi, who has been quiet, gets involved, then Kovacic bi-sects the defence with a great pass. Higuain\u2019s touch is a tad laboured as he spins and Lees is able to block the ball. 17 min: Higua\u00edn concedes his first foul in English football, after leaving his elbow Hutchinson. No card; it was accidental. 16 min: Amapadu, in Hutchinsonian style, wallops a shot from distance. It ends up in the Shed End. 14 min: Sheffield Wednesday singing of Steve Bruce\u2019s Barmy Army? Is that in reference to his trip to the West Indies? 12 min: Sam Hutchison, against his old club, saw glory after the ball came to him after a move that was begun by Fletcher. He wanted it too much and his shot ended up somewhere in Brompton Cemetery. 11 min: Westwood comes to the edge of his area to claim a headed back-pass. He was far quicker to that than Higua\u00edn. 10 min: Higua\u00edn receive his first foul in English football as Lees clatters him. The resultant free-kick is caught by Westwood and with some comfort. 9 min: Steven Fletcher, the Scottish Higua\u00edn, has taken a bang to the head. He should be OK to continue, though. 8 min: Christensen, with one Premier League start to his name, and almost certainly not the new JT, steps forward. A sighting of Higua\u00edn, but Thorniley comes across twice to intercept the ball. The first touch eventually comes, with a tidy enough lay-off to Kovacic. 6 min: Wednesday get the ball clear after Chelsea win their first corner. Higua\u00edn is yet to see a sight of the ball. Perhaps he would struggle in the Championship. Wednesday are sat very deep. 4 min: Ampadu looks likely to be enjoying plenty of possession. The teenager has played more for Wales than Chelsea until this fixture. 3 min: The ball is shepherded back to Kieren Westwood, back in the team now that Jos Luhukay has left. The Irishmen is one of the best keepers in the EFL. 1 min: Some good voice from the Sheff Wed contingent as Adam Reach, after some good pressing, gets a shot on goal. The ball took a slight deflection, such that Caballero had little problem in the Chelsea goal. And away we go. The referee has sounded his whistle. Steve Agnew speaks. The lads have been in good spirits. I spoke to Steve [Bruce] and he was very excited. We will enjoy it and attack it with some determination. Steve trusts us, [Agnew and Stephen Clemence] to observe the players and pick the team and try and stay in the tie. You never know. Gianfranco Zola, who is handling media duties, has been talking about Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. You can see his ability and his desire to do well, we are looking forward to seeing that from him today. We want to see how he can integrate, we are expecting him to fit the system well. On (Hudson-Odoi\u2019s move to Bayern): I believe there is something, he has been training well. He deserves to play, and let\u2019s see how it goes. For us he is an important player. He is playing and has been on the bench. Let\u2019s see if we can come together with something. Fancy some red-hot transfer gossip? The fifth round draw will be made tomorrow night, ahead of Barnet\u2019s game with Brentford, where this chap will almost certainly be present, barring an apocalypse. After booking their place at Wembley in the Carabao the other night, this FA looks an open run for Chelsea, if they can beat the Owls. No Arsenal, Liverpool and, it seems, no Spurs. Which leaves just the Manchester giants. And should two of those clubs pull each other, then it\u2019s a free-ish ride to the final. Over in South London, a shock is in store. Sheffield Wednesday have made two changes. Young defender Jordan Thorniley comes into the defence, with Michael Hector ineligible to face the parent club he has never played a game before in three and a half years of their ownership of him. Marco Matias has been dropped in favour of Joey Pelupessy bolstering the midfield. Aside from Higua\u00edn, that is an underpowered Chelsea XI, with eight changes from Thursday night\u2019s League Cup semi with Spurs. Ruben Loftus-Cheek only on the bench, though, as he is recovering from injury. A trio of Ampadu, Barkley and Kovacic will man the midfield. Louise Taylor got the lowdown on life at Hillsborough from caretaker boss Steve Agnew. Steve Bruce was in the West Indies, for reasons Agnew explains. Will Higua\u00edn be a success at Chelsea? There is no guarantee, you know. In analogue fashion, here\u2019s the teams once more: Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Christensen, Alonso, Ampadu, Barkley, Kovacic, Willian, Hudson-Odoi, Higuain Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Palmer, Lees, Thorniley, Fox, Hutchinson, Bannan, Pelupessy, Reach, Boyd, Fletcher That\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi starting despite that transfer request, and Higuain starting too. Be interesting to compare him to Steven Fletcher today.... The Chels The Owls There was a time, not so long ago, that Chelsea and Sheffield Wednesday were running mates, and there used to be quite something of a rivalry between the two clubs. They didn\u2019t used to like each other very much at all. The pair came up from the old Second Division at the end of the 1983-4 season, and by the start of the Premier League era, Sheff Wed were looking down at Chelsea, among the poorer relations of the whole new ball game of the time. Later, while Chelsea had Gianfranco Zola and Gianluca Vialli, Wednesday had Benito Carbone and Paolo di Canio. But the start of the century is where the paths diverged. The Owls were relegated at the end of the 1999-2000 season, never to return since, and Chelsea were soon enough the richest club around. When Antonio Conte was binned, in could come Mauricio Sarri, the brightest coach in Serie A. When Wednesday fired Jos Luhukay, they turned to Steve Bruce, though Brucie hasn\u2019t actually turned up yet, as he has been watching England getting thumped in the West Indies. He is due to start work on February 1, just as the transfer window closes. Good thing too, as his new club don\u2019t have a brass tanner to spend. Steve Agnew continues as caretaker; last time he was at Stamford Bridge was on the occasion of Middlesbrough\u2019s relegation at the end of the 2016-17 season. Chelsea, meanwhile, have Gonzalo Higuain on loan and this week reached the League Cup final. Time and football are such cruel mistresses.",

      "bodyText": "A cross-party group of MPs is confident it will be able to use an amendment to the immigration bill going through parliament to stop people being held indefinitely in immigration detention centres. Harriet Harman, the chair of the joint committee on human rights, has persuaded the former Brexit secretary David Davis and other former Conservative ministers to back the move, which would stop thousands of foreigners facing deportation every year being held in detention for more than 28 days. The Home Office has yet to approve the proposal but Harman, a former deputy Labour leader, said she was \u201cvery confident\u201d her amendment would be accepted because of the strength of her case and the breadth of cross-party support. She said new figures released to her committee by the Home Office backed the case for reform, because they disproved claims that most of those held in detention centres for more than 28 days pending deportation were in the category of \u201cforeign national offenders\u201d \u2013 people who have previously served at least a year in jail. In the 1990s there were only 250 places where migrants might be held in detention before being deported, and even then these were often not full, she told the Guardian. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got 2,500 places, and they are bursting at the seams.\u201d Thousands of people every year are held for more than a month in the detention centres and in some cases people have been kept locked up for two years or more. Harman said that in the past it was often assumed most of those detained for more than a month were foreign national offenders. But the Home Office sent figures to her committee showing that in 2017 10,331 people were detained for more than 28 days and 7,015 \u2013 about 70% \u2013 were not in the offender category. \u201cFor every individual traumatised by indefinite detention, that\u2019s reason to change the policy. But it is now happening on such a scale that it is really important to deal with it,\u201d Harman said. \u201cThe Windrush cases have shown the extent to which the Home Office is capable of acting in a completely arbitrary way. In the light of the injustices exposed by Windrush, and in the light of the fear that this could be inflicted on some of EU nationals after Brexit, it would be really quite wrong for the Home Office to insist that they strike down this amendment.\u201d On Monday MPs will debate the second reading of the immigration and social security coordination (EU withdrawal) bill, the legislation that will impose new immigrationcontrols on EU nationals after Brexit. The Harman amendment, which is also backed by Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, and Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary, would make it illegal for anyone to be held in a detention centre for more than 28 days unless a judge ordered a further 28-day extension. Initially the proposed law would not cover foreign national offenders but the amendment would also allow the home secretary to extend it to cover them at a later point, by order. Harman said the home secretary, Sajid Javid, had agreed to meet MPs backing the amendment, which will be debated at a later stage in the bill\u2019s passage through parliament. She said she expected him to be accommodating because he could understand the \u201cpolitical arithmetic\u201d in the Commons.",

Blackburn\u2019s whip seems unique.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the only reason this intrinsically Indigenous object survived is due to its very transformation into a European instrument of discipline.</p> <p>For in Blackburn\u2019s possession, and transformed into the whip, it returned with him and Supply to Portsmouth in 1792. Blackburn died the next year on his posting to the West Indies but the whip, along with his papers, remained as revered, precious objects of a celebrated seafarer in the Blackburn family\u2019s possession until the 1990s when they went under the hammer at Christies, London.</p> <p>A South Australian dealer purchased the club/whip (along with a small cosh which Blackburn probably carried for self-defence). The South Australian Museum eventually purchased both.</p> <p>Many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Indigenous cultural artefacts were collected by members of the early fleets and the convicts they transported (Phillip, the first governor, tried to regulate their acquisition, trade and theft). While many made their way into private and public collections in Europe and elsewhere, none can be definitively provenanced to the first fleet as clearly as the Blackburn club/whip.</p> <p>If you\u2019re fortunate enough \u2013 as I\u2019ve been \u2013 to see the object, which is in storage at the South Australian Museum, at close quarters, its symbolism is profound and deeply moving. I found it \u2013 and continue to find it \u2013 both repellent and intriguing. It is compelling for its power to embody and evoke so much history, as a source of so much of what happened after the fleet\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>Anthropologist John Carty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/04/reuniting-indigenous-sticks-with-their-stories-the-museum-on-a-mission-to-give-back\">the South Australian Museum\u2019s head of humanities</a>, who showed me the object in 2017, says: \u201cIt\u2019s an object that sits between two systems of law, two systems of meaning. Coming from that first moment in our shared history, it can\u2019t help but evoke all those stories and silences that lie between us as Australians.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most affecting objects in our museum, and probably any Australian museum. It makes the hairs stand up to see it. Some people cry. Everyone falls quiet. But it\u2019s like the club/whip breaks a bigger silence. You see it in people\u2019s faces. That\u2019s the power of an object like this. It takes the abstraction out of history, the distance out of time. It pulls you into that moment, that beginning, in which we are all implicated. That beginning that we still struggle to talk about.\u201d</p> <p>Jones, meanwhile, writes of how the object \u201crepresents two systems of law, and something essential in the histories of two cultures is entwined in it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAboriginal and European people stepped through the mirror of contact into each other\u2019s worlds. Blackburn\u2019s whip is a relic of that transition. Indeed, its inversion from club into whip helped to ensure its preservation for two centuries ... had Blackburn retained it as an Aboriginal curiosity rather than converting it for his own personal use, the artefact is unlikely to have survived.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/dec/05/can-we-handle-the-truth-indigenous-australians-depend-on-it\">Can we handle the truth?

The Supply commander was involved in the earlier kidnapping, at Phillip\u2019s orders, of Arabanoo, from who, Blackburn said, \u201clittle was learned\u201d because the English couldn\u2019t (not surprisingly) understand him.</p> <p>They did, however, come to translate one word \u2013 \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 into English. Arabanoo died of smallpox under Phillip\u2019s captivity during the epidemic that swept the colony, thanks to European arrival.</p> <p>It is unlikely that Blackburn\u2019s whip was ever used against Aboriginal people or, indeed, the first fleet convicts.<em> </em>The fleet\u2019s sailors were sometimes disciplined for a range of malfeasances like disobedience, insolence, stealing and drunkenness, with a maximum of 12 lashes.</p> <p>As non-Indigenous Australia once again throws itself an elaborate celebration to mark European invasion and settlement, it\u2019s worth contemplating Blackburn\u2019s whip and all its profound evocations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If a single item could encapsulate the clash of Indigenous and European cultures and laws that began with the arrival of the first fleet, it is almost certainly one held in the collection of the South Australian Museum. Blackburn\u2019s whip comprises a sturdy piece of fashioned wood, bulbous at one end, attached with four knotted strands of rope at its tapered extremity. It is, for all intents and purposes, a late 18th century cat o\u2019 nine tails, an instrument of punishment in the navy \u2013 where one in five English sailors was said to meet with the lash \u2013 and Imperial penal system. But it is so much more than that. The wooden handle is actually an Aboriginal weapon \u2013 at once a bludgeon and a missile of the sort carried by Indigenous men of what is now the greater Sydney area from Botany Bay, where the first fleet arrived on 18 January 1788, and Port Jackson, to which Arthur Phillip\u2019s tall ships relocated eight days later. Indigenous men routinely carried such clubs for tribal self-protection and, later, as the post-invasion European pastoral front line expanded amid the spread of black-white wars and battles, as weapons against settlers, soldiers and militias. Precisely how, when or where the wooden club was acquired by Berkshire-born David Blackburn, commander of His Majesty\u2019s brig, Supply \u2013 the ship which led the fleet into Botany Bay and later Port Jackson \u2013 is undetermined. The club/whip is the only documented wooden artefact from the first fleet\u2019s encounter with Aboriginal people that still survives. As Philip Jones, historian and South Australian Museum curator writes in Ochre and Rust \u2013 Artefacts and Encounters on Australian Frontiers, \u201cOnly a handful of artefacts with a Port Jackson or Botany Bay provenance can be recognised today, and none are unambiguously associated with the first fleet. Blackburn\u2019s whip seems unique.\u201d Perhaps the only reason this intrinsically Indigenous object survived is due to its very transformation into a European instrument of discipline. For in Blackburn\u2019s possession, and transformed into the whip, it returned with him and Supply to Portsmouth in 1792. Blackburn died the next year on his posting to the West Indies but the whip, along with his papers, remained as revered, precious objects of a celebrated seafarer in the Blackburn family\u2019s possession until the 1990s when they went under the hammer at Christies, London. A South Australian dealer purchased the club/whip (along with a small cosh which Blackburn probably carried for self-defence). The South Australian Museum eventually purchased both. Many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Indigenous cultural artefacts were collected by members of the early fleets and the convicts they transported (Phillip, the first governor, tried to regulate their acquisition, trade and theft). While many made their way into private and public collections in Europe and elsewhere, none can be definitively provenanced to the first fleet as clearly as the Blackburn club/whip. If you\u2019re fortunate enough \u2013 as I\u2019ve been \u2013 to see the object, which is in storage at the South Australian Museum, at close quarters, its symbolism is profound and deeply moving. I found it \u2013 and continue to find it \u2013 both repellent and intriguing. It is compelling for its power to embody and evoke so much history, as a source of so much of what happened after the fleet\u2019s arrival. Anthropologist John Carty, the South Australian Museum\u2019s head of humanities, who showed me the object in 2017, says: \u201cIt\u2019s an object that sits between two systems of law, two systems of meaning. Coming from that first moment in our shared history, it can\u2019t help but evoke all those stories and silences that lie between us as Australians. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most affecting objects in our museum, and probably any Australian museum. It makes the hairs stand up to see it. Some people cry. Everyone falls quiet. But it\u2019s like the club/whip breaks a bigger silence. You see it in people\u2019s faces. That\u2019s the power of an object like this. It takes the abstraction out of history, the distance out of time. It pulls you into that moment, that beginning, in which we are all implicated. That beginning that we still struggle to talk about.\u201d Jones, meanwhile, writes of how the object \u201crepresents two systems of law, and something essential in the histories of two cultures is entwined in it\u201d. \u201cAboriginal and European people stepped through the mirror of contact into each other\u2019s worlds. Blackburn\u2019s whip is a relic of that transition. Indeed, its inversion from club into whip helped to ensure its preservation for two centuries ... had Blackburn retained it as an Aboriginal curiosity rather than converting it for his own personal use, the artefact is unlikely to have survived.\u201d Through this object hundreds, thousands, of early frontier stories can be linked including that of Bennelong, the complex, enigmatic Indigenous man captured by Phillip and who evolved into something of a diplomat between the local Eora tribes and English. The Supply commander was involved in the earlier kidnapping, at Phillip\u2019s orders, of Arabanoo, from who, Blackburn said, \u201clittle was learned\u201d because the English couldn\u2019t (not surprisingly) understand him. They did, however, come to translate one word \u2013 \u201cbad\u201d \u2013 into English. Arabanoo died of smallpox under Phillip\u2019s captivity during the epidemic that swept the colony, thanks to European arrival. It is unlikely that Blackburn\u2019s whip was ever used against Aboriginal people or, indeed, the first fleet convicts. The fleet\u2019s sailors were sometimes disciplined for a range of malfeasances like disobedience, insolence, stealing and drunkenness, with a maximum of 12 lashes. As non-Indigenous Australia once again throws itself an elaborate celebration to mark European invasion and settlement, it\u2019s worth contemplating Blackburn\u2019s whip and all its profound evocations.",

As the league\u2019s former CEO Richard Scudamore explains: \u201cEveryone who sees it will say, \u2018Wow\u2019. Heads of state, prime ministers \u2013 they all want a photo with the trophy. It\u2019s what we like to call soft power.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/please-help-me-refugee-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi-tells-of-his-thai-jail-ordeal\">'Please help me': refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi tells of his Thai jail ordeal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But sometimes soft power is not enough. The velvet boot needs iron studs. And when it comes to the shocking case of the jailed Bahraini national team player Hakeem al-Araibi, football needs to go in two-footed.</p> <p>Sunday marked two months since Al-Araibi\u2019s detainment in Thailand after he was hit with an Interpol red notice following his arrival in Bangkok on his honeymoon. It originated from the same Bahraini authorities who tortured him in 2012, forcing him to flee the country, and was quickly withdrawn by Interpol, which should never have applied it in the first place. Yet Al-Araibi still languishes in prison \u2013 facing extradition back to Bahrain and a 10-year prison sentence for apparently vandalising a police station, even though he was playing in a televised match at the time.</p> <p>It would be farcical if it was not so tragic. To make matters more alarming, Al-Araibi suspects the hand of Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa \u2013 a member of the ruling Bahrain royal family and the powerful president of the Asian Football Confederation \u2013 is behind his imprisonment because he was publicly critical of the Sheikh when the latter ran for Fifa president. \u201cThis is nothing to do with my conviction,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/please-help-me-refugee-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi-tells-of-his-thai-jail-ordeal\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian last week</a>. \u201cBahrain wants me back to punish me, because I talked to the media in 2016 about the terrible human rights and about how Sheikh Salman is a very bad man who discriminates against Shia Muslims.\u201d In a response to the outcry, the Bahraini government has insisted Al-Araibi\u2019s life is not in danger and he had only to return home and appeal his conviction because its court system was \u201cindependent and transparent\u201d in line with international standards.</p> <p>At least in the last few days wheels have finally whirred into action, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/fifa-urges-thailand-release-bahraini-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi\" title=\"\">Fifa writing to Thailand\u2019s government</a> expressing concern and asking for Al-Araibi to be returned to Australia, which granted him refugee status in 2017. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, who has championed the case of refugees and welcomed a refugee team to the Rio Olympics, has also urged a solution \u201cbased on human and humanitarian values\u201d.</p> <p>These are classic acts of soft power. But with Al-Araibi stuck in jail awaiting a deadline of 8 February for Bahrain to apply for his extradition, they are not enough.

Football has said it is going to uphold human rights. So football needs to save Hakeem.\u201d</p> <p>It would certainly help if more footballers spoke out, joining those from Australia where Al-Araibi was playing for Pascoe Vale FC before he was detained. Imagine the impact of prominent Premier League players shouting about the injustice of the case, or using the #SaveHakeem hashtag?

      "bodyText": "There is a striking story in The Club, Jonathan Clegg and Joshua Robinson\u2019s new book on how the Premier League went global, that illustrates football\u2019s inimitable ability to tickle the erogenous zones of the powerful. It turns out that when British prime ministers want to make deals, their secret weapon is the Premier League trophy. As the league\u2019s former CEO Richard Scudamore explains: \u201cEveryone who sees it will say, \u2018Wow\u2019. Heads of state, prime ministers \u2013 they all want a photo with the trophy. It\u2019s what we like to call soft power.\u201d But sometimes soft power is not enough. The velvet boot needs iron studs. And when it comes to the shocking case of the jailed Bahraini national team player Hakeem al-Araibi, football needs to go in two-footed. Sunday marked two months since Al-Araibi\u2019s detainment in Thailand after he was hit with an Interpol red notice following his arrival in Bangkok on his honeymoon. It originated from the same Bahraini authorities who tortured him in 2012, forcing him to flee the country, and was quickly withdrawn by Interpol, which should never have applied it in the first place. Yet Al-Araibi still languishes in prison \u2013 facing extradition back to Bahrain and a 10-year prison sentence for apparently vandalising a police station, even though he was playing in a televised match at the time. It would be farcical if it was not so tragic. To make matters more alarming, Al-Araibi suspects the hand of Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa \u2013 a member of the ruling Bahrain royal family and the powerful president of the Asian Football Confederation \u2013 is behind his imprisonment because he was publicly critical of the Sheikh when the latter ran for Fifa president. \u201cThis is nothing to do with my conviction,\u201d he told the Guardian last week. \u201cBahrain wants me back to punish me, because I talked to the media in 2016 about the terrible human rights and about how Sheikh Salman is a very bad man who discriminates against Shia Muslims.\u201d In a response to the outcry, the Bahraini government has insisted Al-Araibi\u2019s life is not in danger and he had only to return home and appeal his conviction because its court system was \u201cindependent and transparent\u201d in line with international standards. At least in the last few days wheels have finally whirred into action, with Fifa writing to Thailand\u2019s government expressing concern and asking for Al-Araibi to be returned to Australia, which granted him refugee status in 2017. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, who has championed the case of refugees and welcomed a refugee team to the Rio Olympics, has also urged a solution \u201cbased on human and humanitarian values\u201d. These are classic acts of soft power. But with Al-Araibi stuck in jail awaiting a deadline of 8 February for Bahrain to apply for his extradition, they are not enough. It is time for Fifa and the IOC to threaten serious sporting sanctions if he is not released. It is a move that Brendan Schwab, the executive director of the World Players Association \u2013 which has worked tirelessly on Al-Araibi\u2019s case \u2013 believes is overdue. \u201cWhat we have to do as people involved in sport is to think through how we can maximise our leverage,\u201d he told me. \u201cSporting sanctions are one of the key things.\u201d Schwab, who is a lawyer and a trade union official, points out that Fifa\u2019s rules on human rights protections compel the organisation as well as the AFC and the Bahrain and Thai FAs to help secure Al-Araibi\u2019s freedom. \u201cWe realise that requires leveraging governments but football is uniquely positioned to do that because it has rules on human rights,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if those rules are not upheld then football associations are not entitled to be part of the international football community. Football has said it is going to uphold human rights. So football needs to save Hakeem.\u201d It would certainly help if more footballers spoke out, joining those from Australia where Al-Araibi was playing for Pascoe Vale FC before he was detained. Imagine the impact of prominent Premier League players shouting about the injustice of the case, or using the #SaveHakeem hashtag? British football is a global business, after all, with surveys suggesting that a larger percentage of the population in Thailand watches the Premier League than the UK. But this goes beyond football given that Bahrain is one of many Gulf states using sport to soften its image. It sponsors the Bahrain-Merida cycling team, led by the former Giro D\u2019Italia and Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali, as well as hosting a Formula One grand prix, despite the 2011 race being cancelled after months of demonstrations against the regime. Yet the reality is that after those protests, 150 professional sports people were widely reported to have been arrested, detained, tortured, imprisoned or excluded from their sports for taking part in the pro-democracy demonstrations \u2013 including Al-Araibi, who now faces the chilling prospect of returning to the place he does not want to call home. Worryingly, Al-Araibi admits he is losing hope as he sits in his small concrete cell awaiting his fate. \u201cI am so scared of being sent back to Bahrain,\u201d he says. \u201cSo scared because 100% they will arrest me, they will torture me again, possibly they will kill me.\u201d However, Schwab insists that all is not lost in a case which he describes as a litmus test for football and human rights, and for all refugee athletes. \u201cI think that Fifa and the IOC needs to be talking sporting sanctions and the athletes need to be talking human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if those two things happen we will save Hakeem.\u201d",

During a recent bonding session with my teenager, we watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/01/carrie-the-film-that-captured-the-true-horror-of-being-a-teenager\" title=\"\">Carrie</a> together. What is shocking now about the 1976 horror movie is not just how brilliant it is, \u2013 and brilliantly short \u2013 but also that opening shower scene. All that pubic hair on the teenage girls. \u201cWhere has it all gone?\u201d I wondered, as my daughter shifted uncomfortably in her chair.</p> <p>I thought about it again reading about why so many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/21/cervical-cancer-smear-test-rate-plummets-survey-young-women-smearforsmear-campaign\" title=\"\">young women are reluctant</a> to have cervical smears. The latest statistics are alarming; the worst for 21 years. Only <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/27/cervical-cancer-screening-rate-falls-lowest-least-21-years/\" title=\"\">71.4% of women</a> in England who should be screened are getting tested. Between the ages of 25 and 49, women should have a smear test every three years, and currently only 69.1% do. Coverage is better for older women, with more than 76% showing up for screening. Robert Music, chief executive at Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said the figures were \u201chighly frustrating and, coupled with rising cervical cancer diagnoses, an enormous worry\u201d. Not to put too fine a point on it, cervical cancer kills. Yet, if it is detected early, most women are fine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women\u2019s bodies remain mysterious to us if we are mainly concerned about how we look, rather than how we feel in them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why did I connect pubic hair with this health issue? When asked why they won\u2019t have a smear test, many young women talk about \u201cbeing judged\u201d. They feel they need to be waxed or shaved, they worry that their vulvas and vaginas will not smell or look right. They feel embarrassed and awkward and frightened. To which one can only say, look, the doctors and nurses really have seen it all before. Society has come a long way since the 1800s, when it was believed that any kind of \u201cpelvic examination\u201d would cause women to become sex maniacs, so really, only prostitutes could be examined. It is true, too, that no one enjoys a smear test. Having a cold metal speculum put inside you ranks up there with having your breasts squashed between glass plates for a mammogram in terms of pleasure I would say. It\u2019s that phrase doctors use for all horrible things: \u201ca bit uncomfortable\u201d. </p> <p>But the fear and ignorance surrounding cervical smear tests isn\u2019t just about pain. They reflect how women\u2019s bodies remain mysterious to us if we are mainly concerned about how we look rather than how we feel about them, or in them. The gaze with which some women judge their own labia as misshapen or abnormal is an internalised male gaze. Often it has come from the ramped-up, lowered-down expectations of porn. We become ashamed of what is inside us, however we prettify it up.</p> <p>There are two conversations going on at once here: we have a culture of sexual openness, hook-ups, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/11/periods-menstruation-liberation-women-activists-abigail-radnor\" title=\"\">free bleeding</a> and jokes about vaginas in public. At the same time, female bodies are still dirty, troublesome and never perfect enough. The situation is confused by the insistence that the word \u201cwoman\u201d itself is problematic for parts of the trans community. Even Cancer Research UK talks about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/14/cancer-research-removes-word-women-smear-campaign-amid-transgender/\" title=\"\">anyone who has a cervix</a>\u201d needing to get tested, a usage it defends on the basis that transgender men are at risk of cervical cancer. Many nurses who carry out routine screening tests say this is worse than useless. The reality is we also need to reach women who don\u2019t have English as a first language and the very many women who hardly know what a cervix is. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/25/chloe-delevingne-cervical-cancer-smear-test-live-tv-victoria-derbyshire-show-combat-stigma\">Chloe Delevingne has cervical cancer smear test on live TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of it makes me feel we are spiralling backwards. The speculum, once seen as a danger to proper ladies \u2013 basically a \u201csteel penis\u201d \u2013 was reclaimed in the 60s by feminists and feminist doctors who set up free clinics. In<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Downer\" title=\"\"> 1971 Carol Downer</a>, an American feminist, walked into a bookshop in LA, pulled down her pants and inserted a speculum. She invited other women in the shop to come and look at her cervix. These sessions with speculums, torches and mirrors were self-help at a time when abortion was still a crime in the US.

      "bodyText": "God I miss pubic hair. During a recent bonding session with my teenager, we watched Carrie together. What is shocking now about the 1976 horror movie is not just how brilliant it is, \u2013 and brilliantly short \u2013 but also that opening shower scene. All that pubic hair on the teenage girls. \u201cWhere has it all gone?\u201d I wondered, as my daughter shifted uncomfortably in her chair. I thought about it again reading about why so many young women are reluctant to have cervical smears. The latest statistics are alarming; the worst for 21 years. Only 71.4% of women in England who should be screened are getting tested. Between the ages of 25 and 49, women should have a smear test every three years, and currently only 69.1% do. Coverage is better for older women, with more than 76% showing up for screening. Robert Music, chief executive at Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said the figures were \u201chighly frustrating and, coupled with rising cervical cancer diagnoses, an enormous worry\u201d. Not to put too fine a point on it, cervical cancer kills. Yet, if it is detected early, most women are fine. Why did I connect pubic hair with this health issue? When asked why they won\u2019t have a smear test, many young women talk about \u201cbeing judged\u201d. They feel they need to be waxed or shaved, they worry that their vulvas and vaginas will not smell or look right. They feel embarrassed and awkward and frightened. To which one can only say, look, the doctors and nurses really have seen it all before. Society has come a long way since the 1800s, when it was believed that any kind of \u201cpelvic examination\u201d would cause women to become sex maniacs, so really, only prostitutes could be examined. It is true, too, that no one enjoys a smear test. Having a cold metal speculum put inside you ranks up there with having your breasts squashed between glass plates for a mammogram in terms of pleasure I would say. It\u2019s that phrase doctors use for all horrible things: \u201ca bit uncomfortable\u201d. But the fear and ignorance surrounding cervical smear tests isn\u2019t just about pain. They reflect how women\u2019s bodies remain mysterious to us if we are mainly concerned about how we look rather than how we feel about them, or in them. The gaze with which some women judge their own labia as misshapen or abnormal is an internalised male gaze. Often it has come from the ramped-up, lowered-down expectations of porn. We become ashamed of what is inside us, however we prettify it up. There are two conversations going on at once here: we have a culture of sexual openness, hook-ups, free bleeding and jokes about vaginas in public. At the same time, female bodies are still dirty, troublesome and never perfect enough. The situation is confused by the insistence that the word \u201cwoman\u201d itself is problematic for parts of the trans community. Even Cancer Research UK talks about \u201canyone who has a cervix\u201d needing to get tested, a usage it defends on the basis that transgender men are at risk of cervical cancer. Many nurses who carry out routine screening tests say this is worse than useless. The reality is we also need to reach women who don\u2019t have English as a first language and the very many women who hardly know what a cervix is. All of it makes me feel we are spiralling backwards. The speculum, once seen as a danger to proper ladies \u2013 basically a \u201csteel penis\u201d \u2013 was reclaimed in the 60s by feminists and feminist doctors who set up free clinics. In 1971 Carol Downer, an American feminist, walked into a bookshop in LA, pulled down her pants and inserted a speculum. She invited other women in the shop to come and look at her cervix. These sessions with speculums, torches and mirrors were self-help at a time when abortion was still a crime in the US. DIY gynaecology empowered millions of women to understand their own anatomy. Women began teaching each other about speculums and vaginal self-examination and took mirrors to the doctors so that they could see inside themselves. It was a radical act: women\u2019s bodies were not objects for others but belonged to them. Look, I\u2019m not asking for constant fanny gazing if you don\u2019t feel up to it, but if not dying of ignorance means asking the doctor to warm up the speculum, or telling them it hurts, then do it. But if fear of what we look like \u201cdown there\u201d means cancer rates are rising then it really is time to start examining ourselves, examining our bodies, and examining what our contemporary culture demands of young women. Far from being liberated, women\u2019s relationship to their bodies, in terms of both pleasure and pain, appears to be even more troubled than it used to be. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s draft domestic abuse bill introduces some important provisions but still risks failing thousands of women in the UK, including many migrant survivors who must choose between staying with their abuser and risking destitution, detention or deportation if they report their treatment. The decimation of refuges and specialist domestic violence services compounds this issue (Want to tackle domestic abuse? Then make sure women\u2019s refuges are properly funded, 23 January). Some 60% of all refuge referrals have to be turned away, which rises to 80% for BAME women. This must be put right by properly funding services, ensuring survivors are not handed over to immigration enforcement when they report abuse, and abolishing the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d rule for domestic abuse victims so that no woman is denied safety, security and support. Human rights laws oblige the government to protect every woman in the UK from violence \u2013 regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality or immigration status. This bill cannot become a missed opportunity \u2013 the government must equally protect all survivors of domestic abuse. Corey Stoughton Advocacy director, Liberty, Karla McLaren Government and political relations manager, Amnesty International UK, Sian Hawkins Head of campaigns and public affairs, Women\u2019s Aid Federation of England, Sam Smethers Chief executive, The Fawcett Society, Andrea Simon Public affairs manager, End Violence Against Women Coalition, Jane Gordon Legal director, Sisters for Change, Gill Walton Chief executive, Royal College of Midwives, Jasbinder Bhatoa Solicitor/senior legal officer, Rights of Women, Lucila Granada Director, Latin American Women\u2019s Rights Service, Marchu Girma Grassroots director, Women for Refugee Women, Vivienne Hayes CEO, Women\u2019s Resource Centre, Bryony Walker Campaigns director, Level Up, Nik Noone CEO, Galop, Rosie Lewis Deputy director &amp; VAWG services manager, The Angelou Centre, Sandhya Sharma Sessional Worker, Safety4Sisters North West, Halaleh Tahiri Executive director, Middle Eastern Women and Society Organisation \u2022 The UK\u2019s landmark domestic abuse bill is a step in the right direction, putting the spotlight on perpetrators and empowering survivors to seek justice. It is an important moment for all the UK campaigners who have pushed for changes to be made. However, survivors of violence worldwide also need to feel supported. Globally, five women die every hour from domestic abuse, and much more is needed to tackle the barriers to access to justice for women and girls \u2013 be they barriers within the legal system, or external barriers such as economic inequality, lack of police and other services, and shame or stigma associated with violence against women and girls. In the poorest countries, where ActionAid works, women are at an even higher disadvantage. Through its reforms of the justice system to treat survivors fairly, the British government can play a global role in influencing other countries to follow suit. We need a unified, properly resourced system that changes attitudes at every level of society and ends violence against women and girls for good. Anne Quesney Women\u2019s rights advocacy senior specialist, ActionAid UK \u2022 The proposed domestic abuse bill, while meritable in most respects, is misguided in its references to so-called \u201clie-detector\u201d tests (Lie-detectors for offenders and protection for victims in domestic violence bill, 21 January). The use of polygraphy for supposedly detecting dishonesty is pure pseudoscience. The devices detect nervousness but the notion that dishonesty can be inferred is fallacious. A \u201csuspicious\u201d question can evoke more nervous response regardless of actual guilt. The notions that lying can be revealed by such signs as wiggling feet or looking a particular way are likewise malign pseudoscience. Naturally those lobbying to sell such things will come up with excuses to believe otherwise. But such pseudotechnology should have no place in government policy and it should not be allowed to sneak in on the back of otherwise meritable legislation.

He\u2019s still learning and will still get better.\u201d Stuart Broad expressed his disappointment in a newspaper column at missing out \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m bowling the best I\u2019ve ever bowled. I believe that 100 per cent. Everyone in this England group knows it too\u201d \u2013 and will surely be restored. It may come a Test too late on what is expected to be a less seamer-friendly surface at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. On the two-spinner, three-seamer attack deployed in Bridgetown, which saw Jimmy Anderson and Ben Stokes bowled into the ground as Sam Curran, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid struggled, Bayliss was unrepentant. He said: \u201cYou make those decisions thinking the five guys you pick are going to bowl as well as we know they can do. Take Stokes and Anderson out, maybe one spell of Moeen, and we were far from our best in this match. We have a bit of work to do there. \u201cIt was down to Curran or Broad. The gut feel was Curran; he has done well for us over the last seven games. It didn\u2019t work out like that, the young bloke has had his first bad Test in his career. It won\u2019t be his last but he\u2019s a good young player who will learn from it.\u201d Like Root, Bayliss hopes England follow a \u201crollercoaster\u201d recent trend that has seen harrowing Test defeats followed up with victory. \u201cThe boys are in the dressing room hurting and I\u2019d be worried if they weren\u2019t. But we\u2019ve been in this situation before and come out and played some good cricket. So I\u2019m looking forward to the next Test.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lionel Messi scored for a sixth consecutive La Liga game as champions Barcelona saw off a gutsy Girona side 2-0 in a Catalan derby on Sunday to go five points clear at the top of the standings. Nelson Semedo struck with his weaker left foot to send Barca into the lead in the ninth minute, which was played on a rain-swept afternoon at Girona\u2019s Montilivi stadium after LaLiga\u2019s ambitious plan to stage the game in Miami fell through. Girona had defender Bernardo Espinosa sent off in the 51st minute for a second booking. Liga\u2019s top scorer Messi, then lobbed goalkeeper Bono to net his 18th league goal of the season.

Bayern Munich secured their fifth successive Bundesliga win with a 4-1 victory over Stuttgart to cut the gap to leaders Borussia Dortmund back to six points. Stuttgart frustrated Bayern in the first half as Anastasios Donis cancelled out Thiago\u2019s opener. Serge Gnabry put Bayern back into the lead when he collected the ball on the edge of the area and his strike deflected in off Christian Gentner. Lewandowski hit the post from the spot, but the reigning Bundesliga champions pulled clear through Leon Goretzka, who met Joshua Kimmich\u2019s corner to nod home. Lewandowski made amends for his penalty miss six minutes from time. Fiorentina scored twice with 10 men and saw their opponents miss a late penalty as they won 4-3 at Chievo on Sunday in an extraordinary Serie A match which also produced one of the most unusual video assistant referee decisions of the season. Luis Muriel gave Fiorentina a fourth-minute lead, before Chievo thought they had levelled when Fiorentina goalkeeper Alban Lafont sent a goal kick straight to Emanuele Giaccherini, who fired into the net. But the VAR ruled that the forward had encroached when the kick was taken and disallowed the goal. The Flying Donkeys then had a penalty appeal turned down and were still protesting when Marco Benassi scored a second for Fiorentina. Mariusz Stepinksi headed one back for Chievo and Benassi turned villain on the hour when he blocked a goalbound shot with his arm on the line, was sent off and Sergio Pellissier levelled from the spot kick. With the game going from one end to the other, Federico Chiesa broke clear to put Fiorentina ahead, then Chievo were awarded another penalty for handball by Gerson but this time Pellissier\u2019s effort was saved. Chiesa added a fourth and Filip Djordjevic headed one back. Atalanta forward Duvan Zapata missed a penalty but scored an equaliser one minute later as his side hit back from three goals behind to draw 3-3 at home to Roma in Serie A. Edin Dzeko gave Roma a third-minute lead, sweeping the ball home after Nicolo Zaniolo chested it into his path and struck again on the break in the 33rd minute. Stephan El Shaarawy added a third but Timothy Castagne pulled one back before half-time when he headed in Alejandro G\u00f3mez\u2019s cross.

The Colombian made amends one minute later, running on to G\u00f3mez\u2019s pass to place his shot past Olsen and make it 3-3. There was also a dramatic comeback at Parma where visitors Spal scored three times in the final 20 minutes to win 3-2. Two goals from Roberto Inglese, the first from a penalty, put Parma in the driving seat. Mattia Valoti scored less than two minutes after coming off the bench to begin the fightback and Andrea Petagna headed the equaliser. Mohamed Fares blasted the winner with three minutes left.

What she doesn\u2019t say is that the poll is designed to make a change in RCP stance inevitable and could easily do so even if a majority oppose it. It uses a three-way question (for, against, neutral on the RCP stance) to which there must be a 60% result in the vote to maintain the status quo. If not, the RCP stance will change to a default so-called \u201cneutral\u201d. With a virtually guaranteed outcome, this is a sham poll with a rigged outcome.

      "body": "<p>It was October 12, 1968 and Steve Percy was on Wood Green High Street. This wasn\u2019t unusual in itself. North London born and bred, Percy would often go there with his family. The problem was with the timing. It was a Saturday afternoon and, while Percy was shopping, Barnet were playing at home.</p> <p>\u201cFor some reason we were in Wood Green and before we knew it, it was about half past three,\u201d says Percy, recollecting the experience of his 13-year-old self. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m not going to get to Barnet now.\u2019 I made it home round about the time the game would have finished and managed to find the result. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, it was a 5-1 win against Worcester City.\u201d</p> <p>Percy can remember the moment clearly, as it was the last time he missed a Barnet home game. That\u2019s 50 years and counting, a run that stretches 1,377 matches (his run of consecutive matches home and away is a greater total, 2,020, but runs for a shorter period of time). In terms of devotion it\u2019s equivalent to a religious faith, though there are some differences: when it came time to commemorate his achievement Percy, instead of receiving a blessing from a cleric, was paraded on the pitch at the Hive before the National League match against Solihull Moors.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those unexplained things,\u201d says Percy of how he got the bug. \u201cI\u2019d missed probably seven or eight games before that Worcester thing. But after that I intentionally tried to make every match. Touch wood I\u2019ve had nothing serious enough to stop me going since. Only on a handful of occasions have I felt rough on the day. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t had the run going, I might not have gone but you seem to feel better once you\u2019re there.\u201d</p> <p>Percy, 63, may sometimes have ignored his health in favour of supporting Barnet but that\u2019s not all; he has also ignored his brother\u2019s wedding. \u201cI did miss it, because Barnet were at home to Telford on the same day,\u201d he says. \u201cLuckily it was at home. Rush back after the game, quick change and I made the reception by 6pm. So it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d</p> <p>Currently Percy is enjoying the best of times, with Barnet having reached the fourth round of the FA Cup (they have done it twice before, Percy was there both times). He enjoyed the third-round away day at Bramall Lane, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/sheffield-united-barnet-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Barnet beat Sheffield United 1-0</a>, but considers the draw against Brentford a bit of a letdown. It will be a derby between teams known as the Bees, but that is no consolation to Percy. \u201cWe call them the fake Bees,\u201d he says. \u201cNot sure why they\u2019re called bees at all beyond the fact their name starts with B. I\u2019ve certainly never seen a bee with red and white stripes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea5f390bdd0e0f9cc50dd33ca82b807b61ecedc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea5f390bdd0e0f9cc50dd33ca82b807b61ecedc/0_240_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnet players celebrate the win at Sheffield United that earned a fourth-round FA Cup tie at home to Brentford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barnet players celebrate the win at Sheffield United that earned a fourth-round FA Cup tie at home to Brentford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people will recognise the obsessive passion that has allowed Percy to maintain his streak all this time, other people will boggle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s inclined to be on the pessimistic side all the time as a fan. And when you lose you feel so down,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to balance that with the euphoria of when you win. You can\u2019t describe the highs when you do it. We\u2019ve won the Conference three times and won the Southern League first division south, won the Southern League cup, been to Wembley in the FA Trophy in 1972, though unfortunately we didn\u2019t turn up on the day. Those sort of highs are worth the lows.</p> <p>\u201cThe best part over all the many years I\u2019ve been going has been making so many friends, including a lot of players and managers. I\u2019m very close to Barry Fry, he went to my 60th birthday. We\u2019ve had our disagreements, mainly about football. In the early days we were really on a shoestring budget and Barry used to get in about seven or eight really good players but the other three were absolutely crap. And there was no back up. It was so frustrating, but you know you can\u2019t help but like Barry.\u201d</p> <p>Not just a supporter but a volunteer, Percy chaired the supporters\u2019 committee at Barnet for many years. The club has, in a way, been like a second family. \u201cEveryone knows each other at Barnet and if you support a Premier League side you\u2019d have to admit that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve known officials and players at the club and a lot of players\u2019 wives in the past. They\u2019ve been like sisters or mothers, in a way, but you can\u2019t really describe it unless you\u2019re a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the lower leagues have not been immune to the changes made by clubs at the top of the game. Percy laments a professionalisation which has separated players from fans. He also notes the way the new ground, which opened in 2013, has disrupted the community that built up around the Underhill stadium.</p> <p>\u201cNowadays people, including at our club, don\u2019t get to see the players,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the old days you\u2019d sometimes go out with them on a pub crawl after the game. Nowadays, even at our level, if something happened in the evening it would be plastered all over the papers. It was just a different culture in those days but it was very enjoyable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73f86013d944627088c87364d61efcca70318a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73f86013d944627088c87364d61efcca70318a5/0_82_3300_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnet in action against Bath in the FA Trophy in December.

But In the last few years we\u2019ve lost so many people I knew well. The move over to the Hive, which is about six and a half miles away from Underhill, has not gone down well and people have moved away that you knew when you were young. And I\u2019m afraid that as I\u2019m getting older the worst thing of all is that people are departing not just football, but the world.\u201d</p> <p>Percy says he has no targets left for his streak, just to pursue it for as long as his health will allow. As for his team, some wishes do remain. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us get back into the Football League and preferably stabilise in League One,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we could be the Walsall of London. But if there\u2019s one thing missing for me personally, it\u2019s that I\u2019d love to win the FA Trophy. Avenge that final of 1972. It\u2019s something I\u2019d like to set right, before they put me in a box.\u201d</p>",

The move over to the Hive, which is about six and a half miles away from Underhill, has not gone down well and people have moved away that you knew when you were young. And I\u2019m afraid that as I\u2019m getting older the worst thing of all is that people are departing not just football, but the world.\u201d Percy says he has no targets left for his streak, just to pursue it for as long as his health will allow. As for his team, some wishes do remain. \u201cI\u2019d like to see us get back into the Football League and preferably stabilise in League One,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we could be the Walsall of London. But if there\u2019s one thing missing for me personally, it\u2019s that I\u2019d love to win the FA Trophy. Avenge that final of 1972. It\u2019s something I\u2019d like to set right, before they put me in a box.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential contender Juli\u00e1n Castro said on Sunday the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz will give Donald Trump \u201chis best hope of getting re-elected\u201d if he chooses to launch an independent run for the White House. Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary under Barack Obama, is part of a growing field of declared candidates for the Democratic nomination. Schulz is a long-term Democratic donor and has flirted with a run since stepping down from the coffee giant last year. He has reportedly hired experienced advisers and in an interview with CBS 60 Minutes to be broadcast on Sunday, he reportedly said that if he does jump into the race, it will be as an independent. On Monday, he will release From the Ground Up, a autobiography subtitled: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America. Interviewed on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Castro was asked about Schultz\u2019s contention that Democrats and Republicans \u201care engaged, every single day, in revenge politics\u201d, and are thus not acting in the interest of the American people. He said he had \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for the businessman, based in part on encounters while he was in government. \u201cObviously,\u201d Castro said, \u201cif he runs, it\u2019s going to make an impression on the race. But \u2026 I have a concern that if he did run \u2026 essentially it would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting re-elected.\u201d Castro cited a recent poll which said Trump would not be able to beat any one of seven Democratic candidates to run against him. \u201cSo his only hope,\u201d he said, \u201cif things stayed the same \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 is essentially to get somebody else, a third party, to siphon off those votes. And I don\u2019t think that that would be in the best interest of our country. We need new leadership. \u201cAnd so, you know, I would suggest to Mr Schultz to truly think about the negative impact that that might make.\u201d The survey in question, from Public Policy Polling, showed Trump unable to gain more than 42% support in match-ups with Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have all declared runs, and against Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker, who have not formally pitched in. Castro was not mentioned. Schultz has long supported Democrats and Democratic causes but that has not shielded him from criticism within the party. Tina Podlowski, the party chair in Schultz\u2019s home state, Washington, told the Associated Press: \u201cFor somebody who is professing to be a lifelong Democrat, I think to be running as an independent in this particular cycle is not a wise thing to do.\u201d The former Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted that a possible Schultz run was \u201cthe only good news [Trump] received in an otherwise dismal week\u201d. Another former Obama adviser, Dan Pfeiffer, said \u201cthis half-baked idea \u2026 will pose an existential threat to a Democrat in what will likely be 2020 race decided by a few votes in a handful of states\u201d. Recent presidential elections have been affected by strong showings from candidates outside the Democratic and Republican parties. In 1992, the conservative Ross Perot siphoned votes from then president George HW Bush, who lost to Bill Clinton. In 2000, Al Gore lost the race to succeed Clinton to Bush\u2019s son, George W Bush, because \u2013 some say, though others say not \u2013 Green candidate Ralph Nader showed strongly in Florida. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton despite losing the national popular vote by nearly 3m. Jill Stein, the Green candidate, and Gary Johnson, a Libertarian, attracted millions of supporters. Trump won in the electoral college thanks to narrow victories in key northern and midwestern states. In Pennsylvania, for example, his margin of victory over Clinton was just over 44,000 votes. Just under 50,000 Pennsylvanians voted for Stein, and nearly 150,000 for Johnson.",

      "bodyText": "More than half of all magistrates courts in England and Wales have closed since 2010, forcing defendants, witnesses, police, lawyers and justices of the peace to travel sometimes more than 50 miles to access local justice. The full scale of the closures is revealed in data published by the Guardian and the House of Commons library. Since the coalition government came to power in 2010, 162 of the 323 magistrates courts in England and Wales have shut \u2013 a loss of 50.2% of the estate. The latest was Maidenhead magistrates court in the prime minister\u2019s constituency. Most have been sold. The controversial Ministry of Justice (MOJ) efficiency exercise is directly tied to the need to generate funds for a \u00a31.2bn digital modernisation programme, which came under the spotlight following a meltdown of court computer systems this week. As large gaps open up in the courts network in Wales, East Anglia and the North of England, HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) has confirmed it is considering whether to pay for taxis to ferry defendants and witnesses from the most remote parts of the country to hearings. The distance model developed by HMCTS requires that 95% of the population should be able to travel to court from their homes by public transport leaving at 7.30am and arriving by 9.30am. It also specifies that 98% of the population should be able to reach court by 10.30am, which implies a three-hour journey to court and a further three hours back \u2013 a total of six hours travelling on a court attendance day. Concern about the shutdowns is rising up the political agenda. The Commons\u2019 justice select committee has launched an inquiry into HMCTS\u2019s reforms. Among questions it is addressing are the impact of closures, reductions in staffing and how far online systems and video hearings can be \u201ca sufficient substitute for access to court and tribunal buildings\u201d. Including crown courts, county courts and tribunals, since 2010 more than 250 hearing centres have ceased operating. So far \u00a3223m has been raised by sales. Treasury funding for the courts digital programme stipulates that a third must be raised by selling courthouses. HMCTS and the MoJ justify the closures on the grounds that crime rates have fallen and large numbers of courthouses are operating at less than 40% capacity. The agency is developing justice websites and remote video screens, which, it is argued, will mean fewer journeys to court. Critics fear savings will only be achieved by displacing costs on to other agencies. The MoJ has declined to give a commitment about halting closures: six more magistrates courts are scheduled to shut this year. A study by Dr Olumide Adisa of the University of Suffolk found that local court closures have led to an increase in the number failing to attend hearings. The MoJ disputes such figures, saying the rate of defendant non-appearances did not change at the time most closures were enforced, although it concedes figures rose last year. Sue James, a solicitor at Hammersmith law centre in west London, suspects a similar problem is emerging among claimants fighting repossession orders, leading to more evictions. Housing work in London has been transferred to Clerkenwell county court. She believes \u201cpeople are not turning up\u201d at more distant and unfamiliar courts. A row erupted last year over a case raised by a Telford solicitor, John McMillan, of a defendant from Shropshire who had to attend a remand hearing in Kidderminster and make a 53-mile journey back home via Birmingham. McMillan says the man missed the last bus in Shrewsbury and ending up walking home in the dark long after midnight. The MoJ does not accept the details, maintaining that the man could have left Kidderminster earlier. The justice minister, Lucy Frazer, said: \u201cThe closure of any court is not taken lightly \u2013 it only happens following full public consultation and when communities have reasonable access to alternative courts. \u201cWe are reinvesting every penny raised from selling these underused buildings into modernising the justice system to provide swifter and easier access to justice for all.\u201d The MoJ is consulting on guidelines for future closures. John Bache JP, the national chair of the Magistrates Association, said: \u201cJustice should, wherever possible, be administered locally and, with half of all magistrates courts having closed since 2010, many courts are already worryingly remote from the communities that they serve. \u201cA more dispersed court estate will affect the retention and recruitment of magistrates, as some will have to step down if their local court closes and people will be less likely to apply in the first place if the nearest court is not in their immediate area.

Internal Revenue Service employees, border security workers, corrections officers and others required to work during the shutdown without pay were told on Sunday they would be compensated in short order, as would employees barred from their jobs during the shutdown. \u201cSome of them could be [paid] early this week, some of them may be later this week,\u201d the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBut we hope that by the end of this week all of the back pay will be made up, and of course the next payroll will go out on time.\u201d But for some workers living paycheck-to-paycheck, the road back to normalcy is blocked by obstacles such as charges for missed debt payments, damaged credit ratings and doubts about future job security. Those doubts were stoked by Trump\u2019s threat on Friday to shut the government down again \u201cif we don\u2019t get a fair deal from Congress\u201d before temporary funding runs out on 15 February. Mulvaney said Trump was serious about the threat, despite an estimate by the economist Stephen S Fuller of George Mason University that the shutdown cost the Washington DC regional economy $1.6bn in January and that 112,500 federal contractors \u2013 as opposed to full employees \u2013 would not receive back pay. The estimate was first reported in the Washington Post. \u201cYeah I think he actually is,\u201d Mulvaney told CBS, asked whether Trump was prepared to repeat the shutdown. \u201cKeep in mind he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border. He does take this very seriously.\u201d While the US public overwhelmingly blamed Trump for the shutdown, the Republican party sought to blame Democrats, a sign of potential trouble ahead as negotiations between the sides resume. \u201cDemocrats have held our government hostage for weeks but thanks to President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s leadership, the government will reopen and federal workers will be paid in the next few days,\u201d the national GOP tweeted. The message was echoed by Mulvaney, who denied that Trump had lost the shutdown showdown to Democrats. \u201cNo, I think what you\u2019ve seen here is the president seeing an opportunity,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday. Democrats indicated to Trump that they would agree to money for border security in the next round of budget talks now under way, Mulvaney said. The Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, a key potential crossover vote for any Republican budget proposal, said Democrats were looking for a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to immigration reform \u2013 which could indicate room for compromise or, given the vexed history of such attempts, daunting complications ahead. \u201cWe have proven it\u2019s hard for us because with the president and White House and the legislature, we have locked horns on this thing \u2013 no wall, all wall, halfway in between,\u201d Manchin told CBS. \u201cLet the professionals tell us what it takes to keep us safe.\u201d A minority of the US public supports Trump\u2019s plan to erect a wall on the southern border with Mexico, and Trump\u2019s average disapproval rating spiked during the shutdown from 52% to 56%. Critics of the border wall plan say it would be a waste of money to address a problem the president grossly exaggerates and which in any case would be better addressed by spending on a combination of technology and personnel. Trump campaigned for the White House on a promise to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it. He has claimed a new trade deal will produce sufficient savings to meet the second half of his promise. Most analysts doubt it.",

Alas, that project \u2013 which reached its high point in Cameron\u2019s legislation for marriage equality in 2013 \u2013 now lies in ashes. The whole point of Conservatism is not to submit to the siren call of teleology: the belief that history has an implacable direction. In a crisis of this nature, the proper role of Tories should be to cut through the infantile rhetoric, robotic platitudes and Vogon insistence that \u201cresistance is useless!\u201d, and show true statesmanship. Instead, we see \u2013 with some outstanding exceptions \u2013 a party cravenly fetishising the 2016 referendum as if no further expression of popular opinion on Brexit were possible; behaving as if the only thing that matters is to get out of the EU by 29 March, regardless of the overwhelming empirical evidence that there is no viable deal, and that a no-deal exit would be a total catastrophe (necessitating, among many other unpleasant measures, a framework for martial law). Look at them all: fiddling with the backstop while the treaty of Rome burns (or at least the page that bears Edward Heath\u2019s signature). It is uniquely dispiriting to see intelligent Conservatives cheerleading or appeasing this drive towards disaster. Politicians always tell me that the demands of the life are worth it because of the agency you get to exercise. Well, where is that agency right now? Where are the Tories prepared to risk their careers and to say that the instruction given by the electorate in 2016 cannot be delivered in a way that does not do terrible harm to those same voters and their children? To be clear: I haven\u2019t undergone a conversion. My values have not changed. But the Conservative party is morphing into something I find alien and repellent. Like a listing galleon, holed below the waterline, it sails away stubbornly; dragging the nation towards a storm of unknown adversity, peril and pain. \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist",

Some major Premier League clubs had urged Gavin Patterson, 51, the chief executive of BT who steps down at the end of the month, to step forward but he did not apply for the role.

These days, identifying foreign bugs for biocontrol and then carrying out the testing can take several years, sometimes a decade or more, says Sathyamurthy. More than a dozen invasive weeds are being worked on at the CSIRO facility. It is also collaborating with US government scientists on native Australian plants that have become pests across the Pacific, such as the earleaf acacia that is causing problems in Florida\u2019s Everglades. A bright green native Australian beetle with a distinctive red stripe on its back is being tested as a possible agent for release in Florida, where the fast-growing acacia is managing to outcompete native species in southern areas. In another greenhouse, Sathyamurthy is surrounded by another \u201cweed of national significance\u201d called Parkinsonia \u2013 a prickly bush that is well-established in Queensland, the Northern Territory and parts of Western Australia, and that gets in the way of livestock accessing water and outcompetes native species.

While it\u2019s too early to be sure of the success, Sathyamurthy says the moths are surviving and will now be stripping the leaves off the weeds, holding back their progress. A common response when the public hears about biocontrol programs, says Sathyamurthy, is to point to one introduction that went badly wrong \u2013 the cane toad. Cane toads were deliberately introduced in Queensland in 1935 by the state government\u2019s Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations \u2013 a group set up to support the industry and part-financed by a levy paid by growers \u2013 to help the industry deal with cane beetles attacking sugar cane roots. No tests were carried out beforehand to find out what impact the toad might have on the environment, or even if it would actually eat the beetles.

If we get our policies and regulation right, the electricity system of the future could look something like this:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/tony-abbott-played-us-for-a-fool-on-electricity-prices-will-we-be-played-agaib\">Tony Abbott played us for fools on electricity prices. Will we be played again? | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>1. Big on wind and solar</strong></h2> <p>In future, the bulk of our electricity will come from the most affordable technologies \u2013 wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). In areas with the best renewable resources, big wind and solar projects connected to transmission lines will generate electricity to power Australia\u2019s industry, transport, cities and exports.</p> <p>Modelling by the <a href=\"http://ceem.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/100pc%20RE%20-%20Research%20Summary-2016-03-02a.pdf\">University of New South Wales</a> suggests that wind generation could supply up to 70% of Australia\u2019s electricity needs, while modelling by <a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.com.au/sites/default/files/entr_final_report_web.pdf\">CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia</a> found that wind and solar could provide nearly all generation in future. UNSW\u2019s analysis, backed up by AEMO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and-forecasting/Integrated-System-Plan\">Integrated System Plan</a>, also found that many of the best solar and wind sites in Australia were in remote locations \u2013 renewable energy zones, needing new transmission investments to harvest these amazing resources.</p> <h2><strong>2. Lots of different technologies in different locations</strong></h2> <p>These solar and wind farms will be spread across the country, sharing their output, because in a huge continent the size of Australia, the wind is almost always blowing somewhere.</p> <p>The supply gaps will then be filled with a range of on-demand renewables and storage, such as concentrating solar thermal with storage, pumped hydro, batteries (grid and domestic), sustainable bioenergy and more.</p> <p>A study by <a href=\"http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/resources/assets/1708BlakersREAust.pdf\">Andrew Blakers at Australian National University</a> found that pumped hydro could provide enough backup for a grid entirely powered by wind and solar power.</p> <p>Hold on \u2026 hydropower in the dry continent of Australia? Yes, they have identified 22,000 potential sites, mainly off-river reservoirs in hilly terrain or abandoned mine sites, and just 0.1% of those could meet all of Australia\u2019s storage needs in a 100% renewable grid.</p> <p>This means we will move from a power system paradigm of baseload (big thermal generators) and peaking plants (quick-start gas) to one where our bulk energy is supplied by variable renewables and dispatchable renewables, and storage will fill the gaps.</p> <h2><strong>3. Small, so everyone can benefit</strong></h2> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.com.au/sites/default/files/entr_final_report_web.pdf\">CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia</a>, between 30% and 45% of the country\u2019s future energy generation will be local and customer-owned \u2013 in homes, businesses and communities. This means solar panels on every sunny roof, and batteries in households and commercial buildings. In apartment blocks, there will be microgrids powered by solar and batteries. Renters will join community solar projects and landlords will be required to make properties more energy efficient. When you go to the shopping centre and plug in your electric car, it will be shaded by solar panels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/nov/21/coal-power-stations-are-old-and-dirty-here-are-five-ways-to-end-australias-energy-war\">Coal power stations are old and dirty. Here are five ways to end Australia's energy war | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4. Demand is as important as supply</strong></h2> <p>Future electricity use will be much more dynamic. When the sun is shining or a gale is blowing, smart software will send a signal to energy users to turn on their pumps and fill up their batteries.</p> <p>When wind generation is low, batteries will be signalled to turn on. This is called demand response. As the <a href=\"https://renew.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Renewable_Grid_by_2030.pdf\">Alternative Technology Association\u2019s</a> 100% Renewable Grid report found, this approach can deliver reliable grid electricity and lower energy bills \u2013 a win-win.</p> <p>We will also need to use energy much more efficiently, and more thandouble productivity. Our houses, buildings, equipment, appliances, transport and industrial processes all need to become more efficient.</p> <h2><strong>5. Poles and wires \u2013 we\u2019ll </strong><strong> build them only when we need them</strong></h2> <p> Our electricity grid will continue to act as an essential service. However, households and businesses will be incentivised to use the local grid infrastructure through revised tariffs and peer-to-peer energy trading.</p> <p>And while households will draw less electricity from the grid than they do now (thanks to energy efficiency or rooftop solar), the demand for electricity overall will increase as we power up domestic transport and industrial processes, ensuring that the grid we need is affordable for all.</p> <p>In some places though, where it\u2019s cost effective, edge of grid communities will be slowly taken off the grid. As the poles and wires become too expensive to maintain for just a few users, these communities will be powered by renewable microgrids and storage.</p> <h2><strong>6. Industry and transport go renewable too, and not just in Australia</strong></h2> <p>A pathway that gets us zero pollution energy by 2050 requires that we get to zero-pollution electricity as soon as possible. The electrification of many things that currently run on gas or liquid fuels is a crucial step.</p> <p>Taking the pollution out of our transport and industrial sectors means helping them make the switch from fossil fuels to other energy sources. As our grid gets cleaner, it will make even more sense to switch from other fuels to electricity. Examples include switching from:</p> <ul> <li><p>petrol to electric vehicles, which<a href=\"https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/article/downloads/ISF_100%25_Australian_Renewable_Energy_Report.pdf\"> according to University of Technology Sydney</a> could save Australians $400bn in imported oil between now and 2050;</p></li> <li><p>gas to electric (or geothermal) heat-pumps for heating.</p></li> </ul> <p>Transforming our transport sector to make it powered by 100% renewable energy will also require mode-shifting to greater public and active transport. In future, heavy transport, such as our garbage trucks, are likely to be powered by renewable hydrogen.</p> <p>In the industrial sector, we will see the rise of renewable industry precincts where heat-intensive industries can access renewable heat from bioenergy, concentrating solar thermal and renewable hydrogen production. These precincts will also be the key locations for Australia\u2019s renewable export industries \u2013 energy-intensive products and the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-11/hydrogen-breakthrough-could-fuel-renewable-energy-export-boom/8518916\">production of renewable hydrogen and ammonia</a>. Our renewable exports will support countries such as Japan, South Korea and Indonesia to move towards 100% renewable energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/australia-could-hit-100-renewables-much-sooner-than-most-people-think\">Australia could hit 100% renewables sooner than most people think | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>7. Resilient to extreme weather</strong></h2> <p>While doing our fair share to cut pollution will help avert the worst aspects of climate change, we cannot avoid the warming that is already locked into the system. As such our future electricity system will have to cope with more extreme weather events. During these, urban and rural areas will be able to island themselves, having sufficient capacity to power themselves as standalone grids for at least six to 12 hours. This creates a more resilient and reliable electricity system \u2013 the Danish electricity system operator already does this to better manage their system.</p> <p>Such a transition has engineering and policy challenges that must be addressed, but with our smartest minds on the job, creating this energy system of the future is already under way. The biggest question that remains is \u2013 will we do it at the speed that climate change demands?</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicky Ison (@nickymison), founding director of the Community Power Agency and research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney.

      "bodyText": "Liberal party donor and coal plant owner Trevor St Baker is proposing with the help of his mates in government to build two new coal power stations in Australia at the expense of taxpayers. However, the big four banks and the big three energy companies are not having a bar of it. Indeed the majority of Australia\u2019s energy companies are working towards a very different future for the country\u2019s energy system, a future powered by clean, renewable energy. There are now at least nine studies conducted during the decade that have analysed how Australia can move from an electricity system based on polluting coal and gas to one powered by the sun, wind and waves. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) \u2013 the body tasked with making sure we have energy when we need it \u2013 found there were \u201cno fundamental limits to 100% renewables\u201d, and that the current standards of the system\u2019s security and reliability would be maintained. These studies show different pathways towards 100% renewable energy, but what they all agree on is that it can be achieved. So how would it work? If we get our policies and regulation right, the electricity system of the future could look something like this: 1. Big on wind and solar In future, the bulk of our electricity will come from the most affordable technologies \u2013 wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). In areas with the best renewable resources, big wind and solar projects connected to transmission lines will generate electricity to power Australia\u2019s industry, transport, cities and exports. Modelling by the University of New South Wales suggests that wind generation could supply up to 70% of Australia\u2019s electricity needs, while modelling by CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia found that wind and solar could provide nearly all generation in future. UNSW\u2019s analysis, backed up by AEMO\u2019s Integrated System Plan, also found that many of the best solar and wind sites in Australia were in remote locations \u2013 renewable energy zones, needing new transmission investments to harvest these amazing resources. 2. Lots of different technologies in different locations These solar and wind farms will be spread across the country, sharing their output, because in a huge continent the size of Australia, the wind is almost always blowing somewhere. The supply gaps will then be filled with a range of on-demand renewables and storage, such as concentrating solar thermal with storage, pumped hydro, batteries (grid and domestic), sustainable bioenergy and more. A study by Andrew Blakers at Australian National University found that pumped hydro could provide enough backup for a grid entirely powered by wind and solar power. Hold on \u2026 hydropower in the dry continent of Australia? Yes, they have identified 22,000 potential sites, mainly off-river reservoirs in hilly terrain or abandoned mine sites, and just 0.1% of those could meet all of Australia\u2019s storage needs in a 100% renewable grid. This means we will move from a power system paradigm of baseload (big thermal generators) and peaking plants (quick-start gas) to one where our bulk energy is supplied by variable renewables and dispatchable renewables, and storage will fill the gaps. 3. Small, so everyone can benefit According to CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia, between 30% and 45% of the country\u2019s future energy generation will be local and customer-owned \u2013 in homes, businesses and communities. This means solar panels on every sunny roof, and batteries in households and commercial buildings. In apartment blocks, there will be microgrids powered by solar and batteries. Renters will join community solar projects and landlords will be required to make properties more energy efficient. When you go to the shopping centre and plug in your electric car, it will be shaded by solar panels. 4. Demand is as important as supply Future electricity use will be much more dynamic. When the sun is shining or a gale is blowing, smart software will send a signal to energy users to turn on their pumps and fill up their batteries. When wind generation is low, batteries will be signalled to turn on. This is called demand response. As the Alternative Technology Association\u2019s 100% Renewable Grid report found, this approach can deliver reliable grid electricity and lower energy bills \u2013 a win-win. We will also need to use energy much more efficiently, and more thandouble productivity. Our houses, buildings, equipment, appliances, transport and industrial processes all need to become more efficient. 5. Poles and wires \u2013 we\u2019ll build them only when we need them Our electricity grid will continue to act as an essential service. However, households and businesses will be incentivised to use the local grid infrastructure through revised tariffs and peer-to-peer energy trading. And while households will draw less electricity from the grid than they do now (thanks to energy efficiency or rooftop solar), the demand for electricity overall will increase as we power up domestic transport and industrial processes, ensuring that the grid we need is affordable for all. In some places though, where it\u2019s cost effective, edge of grid communities will be slowly taken off the grid. As the poles and wires become too expensive to maintain for just a few users, these communities will be powered by renewable microgrids and storage. 6. Industry and transport go renewable too, and not just in Australia A pathway that gets us zero pollution energy by 2050 requires that we get to zero-pollution electricity as soon as possible. The electrification of many things that currently run on gas or liquid fuels is a crucial step. Taking the pollution out of our transport and industrial sectors means helping them make the switch from fossil fuels to other energy sources. As our grid gets cleaner, it will make even more sense to switch from other fuels to electricity. Examples include switching from: petrol to electric vehicles, which according to University of Technology Sydney could save Australians $400bn in imported oil between now and 2050; gas to electric (or geothermal) heat-pumps for heating. Transforming our transport sector to make it powered by 100% renewable energy will also require mode-shifting to greater public and active transport. In future, heavy transport, such as our garbage trucks, are likely to be powered by renewable hydrogen. In the industrial sector, we will see the rise of renewable industry precincts where heat-intensive industries can access renewable heat from bioenergy, concentrating solar thermal and renewable hydrogen production. These precincts will also be the key locations for Australia\u2019s renewable export industries \u2013 energy-intensive products and the production of renewable hydrogen and ammonia. Our renewable exports will support countries such as Japan, South Korea and Indonesia to move towards 100% renewable energy. 7. Resilient to extreme weather While doing our fair share to cut pollution will help avert the worst aspects of climate change, we cannot avoid the warming that is already locked into the system. As such our future electricity system will have to cope with more extreme weather events. During these, urban and rural areas will be able to island themselves, having sufficient capacity to power themselves as standalone grids for at least six to 12 hours. This creates a more resilient and reliable electricity system \u2013 the Danish electricity system operator already does this to better manage their system. Such a transition has engineering and policy challenges that must be addressed, but with our smartest minds on the job, creating this energy system of the future is already under way. The biggest question that remains is \u2013 will we do it at the speed that climate change demands?

But XT is part of a trolling syndicate and Gorman is a journalist who, after writing a story for the ABC in 2010 about gay men choosing surrogacy, in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/queensland-paedophile-peter-truong-sentenced-for-30-years-jail\">unknowingly profiled two people who were later convicted for paedophilia</a>, found herself besieged by predator trolls, the kind that move in on a target like a Swat team.</p> <p>As well as the barrage of tweets shaming her, a family photo wound up on the fascist social network Iron March, and she was mocked by a popular American conservative blogger who denounced her as part of a paradigm that \u201creduces reporters to the role of propagandists, whose job is to parrot the publicity of radical gay-rights activists\u201d.</p> <p>Her new book, Troll Hunting, may sound like it\u2019s coming in swinging, but her mission, as she tells Guardian Australia, is to \u201ctry and bring a humanity to it all, to the victims and the perpetrators\u201d.

She also talks to those close to the late TV presenter Charlotte Dawson, whose trolls have mysteriously vanished since her suicide, and her own husband, Don, about his misgivings about the book.</p> <p>There are a couple of trolls that Gorman has interviewed regularly who remain an unknown quantity; a mystery, an imminent danger. With others, like XT, there\u2019s a strange kind of intimacy. Don calls one her \u201ctroll husband\u201d. A friend compares the dynamic to Stockholm syndrome.</p> <p>But Gorman does go in hard with her subjects. As she explains, there\u2019s a certain liberation that comes from being a journalist interviewing a troll \u2013 \u201cas long as you\u2019re prepared to get threats of being sent dick pics or be called a lying whore\u201d \u2013 because all bets are off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you drill right down deep, a lot of these guys fell through the cracks as kids</p> <footer> <cite>Ginger Gorman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She gives the example of having once interviewed Anu Singh, who murdered her boyfriend Joe Cinque in 1997. Psyching herself up to ask direct questions made Gorman feel nauseous. By contrast, with the trolls \u201cI could ask the most offensive, personal stuff. And they never balk at it because that\u2019s part of their culture.\u201d</p> <p>In her book, Gorman covers off the online experiences of commentators Catherine Deveny and Guardian Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/van-badham\">Van Badham</a>, but she says some feminists were unimpressed that she was amplifying trolls. \u201cThey said, \u2018All they want is power. Why are you engaging with them?\u2019 I found that incredible. I\u2019m engaging with them because I want to know what they want. I don\u2019t condone what they do, but you have to ask the question: \u2018Why are they doing this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She attempts to answer this both through a psychologist who\u2019s a psychopathy expert and, in a chapter titled \u201cThe Internet Was My Parent\u201d, by prodding the trolls themselves. \u201cIf you drill right down deep, a lot of these guys fell through the cracks as kids,\u201d she says.</p> <p>One, \u201cmeepsheep\u201d, put to her that white men are seen as so privileged that they don\u2019t need help. Yet as Gorman has observed, many trolls experience mental health and substance-use problems. \u201cThat was quite confronting for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAs journalists we need to examine our own beliefs and take them apart in the context of what we\u2019re writing about, not just like spit stuff out hook, line and sinker.\u201d</p> <p>But while empathy can be dredged for the foulest behaviour, Gorman doesn\u2019t forget that her subjects have targeted some of the most vulnerable people on the internet. \u201cWe can\u2019t have marginalised voices driven out of these spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be really idealistic about it, the reason that people like Vint Cerf created the internet was so we would all have access to information and we could all use our voices.

      "bodyText": "A man, \u201cXT\u201d, is going cold turkey. He\u2019s withdrawing from black market Xanax, which he\u2019s been using to self-medicate feelings of loneliness, a breakup, a traumatic childhood. In another hemisphere, many time zones away, Ginger Gorman puts aside her day\u2019s work to distract him from his physical and mental distress. They wind up exchanging funny dating stories until XT thinks he can sleep. \u201cMate, when you wake up can you tell me if you\u2019re all right?\u201d Gorman says. It\u2019s an example of how the internet can be a lifeline between strangers. But XT is part of a trolling syndicate and Gorman is a journalist who, after writing a story for the ABC in 2010 about gay men choosing surrogacy, in which she unknowingly profiled two people who were later convicted for paedophilia, found herself besieged by predator trolls, the kind that move in on a target like a Swat team. As well as the barrage of tweets shaming her, a family photo wound up on the fascist social network Iron March, and she was mocked by a popular American conservative blogger who denounced her as part of a paradigm that \u201creduces reporters to the role of propagandists, whose job is to parrot the publicity of radical gay-rights activists\u201d. Her new book, Troll Hunting, may sound like it\u2019s coming in swinging, but her mission, as she tells Guardian Australia, is to \u201ctry and bring a humanity to it all, to the victims and the perpetrators\u201d. If that sounds bleeding-heart lefty to you, well it\u2019s something she\u2019s grappling with, too. Gorman\u2019s a feminist, her mother\u2019s family is Jewish, and she has a Filipino-Australian husband. She\u2019s everything trolls love to hate. To examine the \u201chuman fallout\u201d of trolling, Troll Hunting draws on expertise from all sides, such as Mia Garlick, Facebook\u2019s director of policy for Australia and New Zealand, and an investigative journalist, Luke McMahon, who some call \u201cAustralia\u2019s number-one troll hunter\u201d and who \u2013 with an SBS journalist, Elise Potaka \u2013 provided the AFP and FBI with the identity of Joshua Goldberg. She also talks to those close to the late TV presenter Charlotte Dawson, whose trolls have mysteriously vanished since her suicide, and her own husband, Don, about his misgivings about the book. There are a couple of trolls that Gorman has interviewed regularly who remain an unknown quantity; a mystery, an imminent danger. With others, like XT, there\u2019s a strange kind of intimacy. Don calls one her \u201ctroll husband\u201d. A friend compares the dynamic to Stockholm syndrome. But Gorman does go in hard with her subjects. As she explains, there\u2019s a certain liberation that comes from being a journalist interviewing a troll \u2013 \u201cas long as you\u2019re prepared to get threats of being sent dick pics or be called a lying whore\u201d \u2013 because all bets are off. She gives the example of having once interviewed Anu Singh, who murdered her boyfriend Joe Cinque in 1997. Psyching herself up to ask direct questions made Gorman feel nauseous. By contrast, with the trolls \u201cI could ask the most offensive, personal stuff. And they never balk at it because that\u2019s part of their culture.\u201d In her book, Gorman covers off the online experiences of commentators Catherine Deveny and Guardian Australia\u2019s Van Badham, but she says some feminists were unimpressed that she was amplifying trolls. \u201cThey said, \u2018All they want is power. Why are you engaging with them?\u2019 I found that incredible. I\u2019m engaging with them because I want to know what they want. I don\u2019t condone what they do, but you have to ask the question: \u2018Why are they doing this?\u2019\u201d She attempts to answer this both through a psychologist who\u2019s a psychopathy expert and, in a chapter titled \u201cThe Internet Was My Parent\u201d, by prodding the trolls themselves. \u201cIf you drill right down deep, a lot of these guys fell through the cracks as kids,\u201d she says. One, \u201cmeepsheep\u201d, put to her that white men are seen as so privileged that they don\u2019t need help. Yet as Gorman has observed, many trolls experience mental health and substance-use problems. \u201cThat was quite confronting for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAs journalists we need to examine our own beliefs and take them apart in the context of what we\u2019re writing about, not just like spit stuff out hook, line and sinker.\u201d But while empathy can be dredged for the foulest behaviour, Gorman doesn\u2019t forget that her subjects have targeted some of the most vulnerable people on the internet. \u201cWe can\u2019t have marginalised voices driven out of these spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be really idealistic about it, the reason that people like Vint Cerf created the internet was so we would all have access to information and we could all use our voices. I don\u2019t think I can leave this [subject] behind until there\u2019s a monumental societal shift to make it fairer and less terrifying.\u201d When Australians targeted by trolls contact Gorman in despair, she refers them to the Australian eSafety Commission, which she considers to be groundbreaking: \u201cThey\u2019ve got limited remit but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d Ahead of the press cycle for her book, she started a course of specialised therapy, referred by the DART centre for trauma in journalism.

Whether through astute coaching recruitment, patient and persistent belief in youth promotion, or the consistent steady hand of a football operations manager like Ante Kovacevic, the Reds have regularly delivered while other clubs have failed. Ironically, one of these successful adaptees, Gombau, was relieved of his duties at Western Sydney Wanderers last season for delivering a seventh-place finish after inheriting a squad reeling from the 11th hour pre-season departure of beloved foundation coach Tony Popovic. With Babbel having already lost as many games as his much-maligned predecessor, and won less than half as many, the wisdom of last season\u2019s sacking seems highly questionable. The Wanderers hierarchy faces a similar dilemma: to accept another season without finals football (at a club that should realistically never miss out on a top-six berth given its financial clout and infrastructure) and show support to a beleaguered coach \u2013 or hit the reset button again. That WSW chairman Paul Lederer has already penned an open letter to supporters backing Babbel amid continued unrest suggests the club may have learned from at least some of the errors of last season. Indeed there are mitigating circumstances surrounding Babbel\u2019s lack of success. Having sacked Gombau six months into a three-year contract, the German was landed with five players secured in deals before their former mentor was moved on \u2013 Nick Fitzgerald, Bruce Kamau, Ruon Tongyik, Tarek Elrich, and Jordan O\u2019Doherty were not Babbel signings, nor would he necessarily have re-signed Janjetovic on a four-year deal, signed off the same month Gombau was dismissed. In Patrick Ziegler, Alexander Baumjohann and more recently Kwame Yeboah you get a hint of what a Babbel spine might look like \u2013 that is if injury had not marred their debut seasons, especially of the centre back. Star import Steven Taylor has played every minute for the Phoenix this campaign, with his on-field leadership often cited as a major factor in the Nix\u2019s renaissance under Mark Rudan. Ziegler has played just over a third of Wanderers\u2019 games this season, and was most notably absent in all three capitulations in recent weeks.

Having won almost half of their 50-plus games at their home fortress, Parramatta Stadium, their record at the soulless Spotless Stadium and the even more ghoulish ANZ Stadium is a paltry one-in-four wins. However, the central conundrum remains. If you are going to sign a foreign coach, either invest the time and energy into acquainting them properly with the league, or be prepared to accept difficulties in transition and back them with time to learn and adapt on the job. To do otherwise is to commit your club, and your fans, to a continuous cycle of \u201cfrustration\u201d.",

After the second world war, the US was nostalgic for French culture, and when Columbia Records commissioned an English-language album of chanson classics, the young Legrand was hired to steer it \u2013 and found himself with an 8m-selling hit.</p> <p>By his mid-20s, Legrand was able to call the shots as a composer and arranger on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1958, he even had more than sufficient clout to hire Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bill Evans \u2013 three of the hippest and most acclaimed young jazz musicians of the decade \u2013 to play sidemen\u2019s roles on his <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/legrand-jazz-mw0000188286\" title=\"\">Legrand Jazz session</a>.</p> <p>Michel was born in the Paris suburb of B\u00e9con-les-Bruy\u00e8res into a family with strong musical connections.

Legrand, Demy and the film\u2019s lead, Catherine Deneuve, collaborated on the Hollywood homage Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (The Young Girls of Rochefort, 1967), with Gene Kelly. Legrand also wrote for Gilles Grangier and Yves All\u00e9gret, and for Joseph Losey \u2013 most notably in 1971 on the Palme d\u2019Or winner <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHNFbRI79EM\" title=\"\">The Go-Between</a>.</p> <p>Through close relationships with the jazz-enthusiastic chanson singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/09/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Claude Nougaro</a> and the Belgian singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/27/jacques-brel-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Jacques Brel</a>, Legrand not only began to develop a personal repertoire of original songs, but to consider performing them himself. He collaborated on the lyrics with other writers including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eddy-marnay-123601.html\" title=\"\">Eddy Marnay</a> and Jean Dr\u00e9jac, and worked on the occasional forays into songwriting by the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/27/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7oise Sagan</a>.</p> <p>In 1968, Legrand moved to Los Angeles, during which time he composed the award-winning scores to The Thomas Crown Affair and then, two years later, Summer of \u201942. Legrand later said that Jewison cut the highly charged seven-and-a-half-minute chess game scene between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in The Thomas Crown Affair to fit the music, which begins with a solo harp and ends with a big band playing a jazz waltz. </p> <p>As well as the Oscars, between 1971 and 1975 Legrand won five Grammy awards, and in this period was on his way to becoming one of the US\u2019s most popular Frenchmen. A sharp and witty raconteur, he appeared on television chatshows, and for relaxation worked at <a href=\"https://www.laweekly.com/music/five-historic-la-jazz-spots-4169733\" title=\"\">Shelly\u2019s Manne Hole club</a> in Los Angeles with the great double bassist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/04/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Ray Brown</a>. In the next decade, he composed for Clint Eastwood and Orson Welles, for Streisand\u2019s Yentl, and the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983). </p> <p>During this time Legrand also played a lot of jazz, making three albums with a regular trio featuring the bassist <a href=\"http://www.marcmichellebevillon.com/\" title=\"\">Marc-Michel Le B\u00e9villon</a> and the drummer Andr\u00e9 Ceccarelli, and bringing together the celebrated American saxophonists Phil Woods and Zoot Sims to join him in a septet to make the 1982 album After the Rain. He released a solo vocal album, and staged his own oratorio, inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as part of the celebrations for the bicentenary of the French Revolution, in 1989.</p> <p>Legrand\u2019s search for new challenges found one that even he could not pull off when he directed the unsuccessful semi-autobiographical film Cinq Jours en Juin (1989), but leading a big band in the next decade found him on more secure ground \u2013 he toured widely, and accompanied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Ray Charles</a>, Diana Ross and Bj\u00f6rk with it. Legrand composed for Jean Guidoni\u2019s 1995 album Vertigo and participated in an award-winning show at the Casino de Paris with Guidoni the following year. </p> <p>In 1997, with the playwright Didier Van Cauwelaert, he worked on Le Passe Muraille, a quirky musical adapted from a 1943 Marcel Aym\u00e9 short story about an unassuming clerk who can walk through walls. The show went to Broadway as Amour five years later, and its lead singer Melissa Errico became an important muse for Legrand. They worked together for six years on the album Legrand Affair (2011).</p> <p>In his later years, Legrand remained ready for surprises, even if the world was beginning to treat him as a grand old man. Stars queued up to perform his hits in a celebration at the Louvre in 2000; and the French government made him an officier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 2003.</p> <p>When his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/09/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Nougaro</a> died in 2004, he recorded Legrand Nougaro, where the composer and a bespoke jazz band accompanied tapes of his friend\u2019s voice in new performances of the Toulouse singer\u2019s songs \u2013 including the previously unheard Mon Dernier Concert. </p> <p>In 2009 Legrand came to Britain with a repertoire combining his biggest hits and a selection of jazz favourites, and a lineup including his longterm partner, the harpist Catherine Michel and the singer Alison Moyet. The following year, he conducted the Moscow Virtuosi chamber group in Russia, for the two-CD set The Music of Michel Legrand. And for his 80th birthday Christmas album the following year \u2013 No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl!! No\u00ebl!!! \u2013 Legrand was joined by Rufus Wainwright, Jamie Cullum and Iggy Pop.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I hit 80,\u201d he said, \u201cI knew that the last chapter of my work would be classical. So I wrote a piano concerto that I recorded myself, a cello concerto, a harp concerto, some sonatas. I wrote a huge ballet. I\u2019m very proud of that. It\u2019s a good final chapter.\u201d</p> <p>Last September, Legrand conducted orchestral arrangements of music from his soundtracks with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, against projections of the scenes they originally accompanied, at the Royal Festival Hall, in London.</p> <p>He lived his last years as he had lived his earliest ones as a precocious music student in Paris \u2013 guided, as he said, by the \u201cambition \u2026 to live completely surrounded by music. My dream is not to miss out anything. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never settled on one musical discipline. I love playing, conducting, singing and writing, and in all styles. So I turn my hand to everything \u2013 not just a bit of everything. Quite the opposite, I do all these activities at once, seriously, sincerely and with deep commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Legrand had three marriages. The first, to Christine Bouchard, a model, and second, to the actor and producer Isabelle Rondon, ended in divorce. In 2014, he married the actor Macha M\u00e9ril.</p> <p>He is survived by Macha and his four children, Dominique, Herv\u00e9, Benjamin and Eug\u00e9nie.</p> <p>\u2022 Michel Jean Legrand, composer and musician, born 24 February 1932; died 26 January 2019</p>",

Legrand, who has died aged 86, made deadpan reference to that phenomenon when he played at Ronnie Scott\u2019s club in London in 2011 \u2013 announcing that it was his ambition to meet \u201cone of the 19 people who ever saw The Happy Ending\u201d, the 1969 Hollywood film for which he wrote his classic love song What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life? But if some of the film vehicles for Legrand\u2019s artistry were outlasted by his music, several became famous, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and Norman Jewison\u2019s The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), with Noel Harrison singing The Windmills of Your Mind, which won Legrand\u2019s first Oscar, for best film theme song, in 1969. Another Oscar followed for The Summer of \u201942 two years later \u2013 this time for best film music. Its theme, The Summer Knows, was recorded later that year by Barbra Streisand, whose 1983 film, Yentl, won him his third Oscar, again for best music. Legrand\u2019s songwriting skills flowered in the early 1950s through intimate acquaintance with the modern chanson movement in Paris, at first as a gifted piano accompanist.

He also composed for Jacques Demy, most notably on the innovative Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) \u2013 a reappraisal of the film musical, combining a realist perspective with a narrative in which songs replaced dialogue.

When his friend Nougaro died in 2004, he recorded Legrand Nougaro, where the composer and a bespoke jazz band accompanied tapes of his friend\u2019s voice in new performances of the Toulouse singer\u2019s songs \u2013 including the previously unheard Mon Dernier Concert. In 2009 Legrand came to Britain with a repertoire combining his biggest hits and a selection of jazz favourites, and a lineup including his longterm partner, the harpist Catherine Michel and the singer Alison Moyet. The following year, he conducted the Moscow Virtuosi chamber group in Russia, for the two-CD set The Music of Michel Legrand. And for his 80th birthday Christmas album the following year \u2013 No\u00ebl! No\u00ebl!! No\u00ebl!!! \u2013 Legrand was joined by Rufus Wainwright, Jamie Cullum and Iggy Pop. \u201cWhen I hit 80,\u201d he said, \u201cI knew that the last chapter of my work would be classical. So I wrote a piano concerto that I recorded myself, a cello concerto, a harp concerto, some sonatas. I wrote a huge ballet. I\u2019m very proud of that. It\u2019s a good final chapter.\u201d Last September, Legrand conducted orchestral arrangements of music from his soundtracks with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, against projections of the scenes they originally accompanied, at the Royal Festival Hall, in London. He lived his last years as he had lived his earliest ones as a precocious music student in Paris \u2013 guided, as he said, by the \u201cambition \u2026 to live completely surrounded by music. My dream is not to miss out anything. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never settled on one musical discipline. I love playing, conducting, singing and writing, and in all styles. So I turn my hand to everything \u2013 not just a bit of everything. Quite the opposite, I do all these activities at once, seriously, sincerely and with deep commitment.\u201d Legrand had three marriages. The first, to Christine Bouchard, a model, and second, to the actor and producer Isabelle Rondon, ended in divorce. In 2014, he married the actor Macha M\u00e9ril. He is survived by Macha and his four children, Dominique, Herv\u00e9, Benjamin and Eug\u00e9nie. \u2022 Michel Jean Legrand, composer and musician, born 24 February 1932; died 26 January 2019",

Stone told Congress he had no contact with two alleged intermediaries to WikiLeaks, when in fact, prosecutors showed, he was in frequent contact with both parties, including 30 text messages exchanged with one party on the very day Stone denied it. \u201cThey\u2019re right, I did forget on some occasions that I had text messages and emails \u2013 that are entirely exculpatory,\u201d Stone told ABC. \u201cI will prove in court that any failure of memory on my part was without intent and would be immaterial. I am human and I did make some errors but they\u2019re errors that would be inconsequential within the scope of this investigation.\u201d Stone could spend years in prison if convicted, although such a sentence could be reduced if he cooperated with prosecutors, a step taken by others in the Russia inquiry including the former national security adviser Michael Flynn and deputy campaign chair Rick Gates. Stone also told ABC he had not destroyed any evidence relevant to Mueller\u2019s inquiries. Apart from Stone\u2019s apparent contacts with WikiLeaks, prosecutors have shown that campaign figures: had hundreds of contacts with Russian operatives including discussions of US-Russia policy held an in-person meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer promising \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton offered internal polling from the campaign to a Russian with links to military intelligence and lied systemically about that activity, even as the Trump Organization pursued plans to develop a building in Moscow and Trump invited Russian hackers to target his opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Mueller\u2019s work is not yet done,\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, said in a separate interview on ABC. \u201cWe can see clues of that in the grand jury activity.\u201d A second figure identified by prosecutors as part of the alleged chain connecting the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, the conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, denied on Sunday that he had advance knowledge of what WikiLeaks planned to publish during the election about Clinton. The denial contradicted evidence laid out in the Stone indictment, which refers to Corsi as \u201cPerson 1\u201d. The indictment includes an email from Corsi to Stone in which Corsi claims knowledge of what \u201chackers\u201d attacking the election intend to do and recommends coordinated action the Trump campaign should take \u2013 which the campaign subsequently took. \u201cTime to let more than [Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta] be exposed as in bed w/enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC,\u201d the email, from 2 August 2016, reads. \u201cThat appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke \u2013 neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for Foundation debacle.\u201d Two weeks later, Trump began bringing up Clinton\u2019s health on the campaign trail. \u201cTo defeat crime and radical Islamic terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina,\u201d he said in a speech in Wisconsin. \u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have that strength and stamina.\u201d Weeks later, WikiLeaks released an email between top Clinton campaign advisers in which one wrote: \u201cHard to think of anything more counter-productive than demanding Bernie\u2019s medical records\u201d \u2013 a reference to her primary opponent Bernie Sanders that the political right spun as proof that Clinton had a health secret to hide. On Sunday, Corsi denied any contacts with WikiLeaks and said his reference in the email to Stone about Clinton\u2019s health was just an educated guess. \u201cI did just connect the dots and figure it out on my own,\u201d Corsi said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cI admit that\u2019s hard to accept \u2026 remarkably, often I\u2019m correct.\u201d Whatever the inconsistencies in their public statements, Corsi and Stone remain staunch defenders of Trump \u2013 for now \u201cI don\u2019t recall that Roger ever said that he was under instructions from anyone in the campaign\u201d to contact WikiLeaks, Corsi said. \u201cI\u2019m not a human tape recorder \u2026 But I\u2019m going to do my best to tell the truth.\u201d",

Italy didn\u2019t get in the Six Nations by saying: \u2018Hello, we\u2019re Italy, can you give us permission to be involved?\u2019 No, we did it by beating good teams and showing that we had progressed.\u201d In short, Parisse says, they earned it. The trouble is, this is Italy\u2019s 20th season in the championship and they have never finished even so high as third. Right now, they are on a 17-game long losing streak in the competition. When Parisse says \u201cwe don\u2019t win consistently\u201d what he really means is that they don\u2019t win at all. How many times can one man keep getting knocked down? \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person that\u2019s very positive anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get excited when people say: \u2018Wow, what a good player\u2019, or \u2018You\u2019re playing well\u2019, and I don\u2019t get down when people say I played badly. I just continue on, follow myself, trying every time to be positive. Even when I stop playing I\u2019ll be the same person, in everything I do, I never give up.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>David Neiwert has lived in his Seattle neighbourhood for decades. But it, like the US, has changed beyond recognition around him. Once upon a time, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/23/alt-america-english-uprising-review\" title=\"\">journalist and author of the book Alt-America explains</a>, \u201cmost of the houses were older, but they were cheap. They were places where working-class people who work on these fishing boats out here\u201d \u2013 he gestures towards the docks at Salmon Bay \u2013 \u201ccould live, right? You know, 500 bucks a month. It all got torn down during the gentrification phase and replaced with multistorey condos that cost $1,500 or $2,000 a month.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon, whose headquarters are in Seattle, \u201cchanged the city\u201d, he says. \u201cAll the folks who work on those fishing boats are still in the neighbourhood, but they\u2019ve got no place to live. They\u2019re all living on the street.\u201d He offers a characteristic wry grin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of motor homes around the neighbourhood now.\u201d</p> <p>Neiwert has spent his career studying far-right movements. Alt America analyses their growth over the past several decades, and looks at how authoritarianism and conspiracy thinking have come to hold sway over US politics. Neiwert believes that the far right\u2019s surge, the election of Donald Trump and mass homelessness in Seattle all spring from a common root: the deliberate assault on democracy by the US right and the Republican party.</p> <p>For several decades following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/crash-1929-wall-street-what-the-great-depression-reveals-about-our-future\" title=\"\">Great Depression, when capitalism and liberal democracy teetered</a> on the brink, Republicans and Democrats \u201cagreed to defend democracy, and defend the values of democracy because it benefited them all by following basically FDR\u2019s program. Now, we\u2019ve lost that because conservatives have decided they are no longer willing to submit to any kind of government run by liberals,\u201d Neiwert says. \u201cThe current conservative movement has decided it no longer wishes to be part of a liberal democracy.\u201d</p> <p>The principal reason, he thinks, is greed. \u201cBy the time they got to the 1980s when Ronald Reagan was president, all they cared about was: \u2018Well, fuck you, you can\u2019t take my money away. You can\u2019t tax me!\u2019 Politics has become so focused on economics that we\u2019ve lost sight of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>For Neiwert, Trumpism is the apogee of the decades-long drive to create a dog-eat-dog economy. The chaos that this has unleashed, and the deliberate promotion of anti-democratic sentiment, has led conspiracy theories and authoritarianism to permeate the political right \u2013 and the brain of the current occupant of the White House. Neiwert says that \u201cauthoritarianism appeals to our desire for security and safety and control. When fearfulness and chaos are being promoted, authoritarianism ramps up.\u201d</p> <p>He points to a recent example of incipient authoritarianism \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/23/controversy-students-mock-native-american-strikes-national-chord\" title=\"\">young men from Covington Catholic college</a> in Kentucky who hooted and taunted in the face of a Native American man on the National Mall. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another indication of how we\u2019re radicalising this generation of young men,\u201d Neiwert says. \u201cThe rabbit hole they\u2019re falling down leads to white nationalism, but the pathway is authoritarianism.\u201d He mentions the new media landscape that has been crafted to appeal to young men, such as the \u201cauthoritarianism lite\u201d offered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\" title=\"\">the likes of Jordan Peterson</a>. \u201cThese young men are being conditioned to develop authoritarian personalities.\u201d</p> <p>Authoritarianism, in turn, uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/conspiracy-theories-internet-survivors-truth\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory to drive a wedge between a movement\u2019s followers and the world</a>. \u201cConspiracy thinking ensures that the authoritarian leader has their followers\u2019 loyalty because they thereby enter his version of reality.\u201d He offers a concrete example: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/21/donald-trump-lies-factcheckers\" title=\"\">When Trump is lying nakedly</a>, but all of his followers still believe him, well, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.</p> <p>\u201cDemocracy is about people actually linking arms, and having the franchise, and real political power resting with them, not with the people at the top.

At the rally, Neiwert moves easily among a crowd of AR-15-toting members of the Three Percenters group, who oppose what they call the tyranny of the gun restrictions, and who are named after the supposed proportion of the American population who fought against Britain in the revolutionary war. That day, they were there to protest what they called leftwing media bias. Neiwert, who they would probably lump in with leftwing media, was unfazed.</p> <p>If he looks at home among the self-styled rebels on the radical right, it is because, in a complicated way, this is his tribe. Neiwert grew up as a rural Republican in the years before the Republican party went, he says, \u201ccompletely over the cliff\u201d. His childhood in the 1960s and 1970s was spent in south-east Idaho, as a scion of a German-American clan who arrived in the state as pioneers. Although his family were Methodist, the area was predominantly Mormon. At the time, he says, elements of the Mormon church were heavily entwined with the conspiracy-minded, anti-communist John Birch Society. This was known for proclaiming far-reaching communist conspiracies in every area of American life (it has enjoyed a small resurgence in the Trump era, although nowadays it talks more about \u201cthe deep state\u201d). \u201cThat\u2019s probably part of why I\u2019m immune to conspiracism,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I got exposed to it at a pretty early age and I think by the time I was 12, 13, 14, I\u2019d figured out that it was 90% bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>As a boy he hunted and fished in the great wilderness of the inland west, and in college he worked on campaigns for Republican politicians. Almost as soon as he left college to work as a reporter, he was confronted by the first in a long string of far-right surges.</p> <p>His work as a reporter on smalltown papers, and later as an environmental journalist, brought him face to face with a succession of movements that were seeking to push back \u2013 sometimes violently \u2013 against the encroachments of a modern, pluralistic world. From the late 70s, he saw activists associated with the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion \u2013 in which ranchers and farmers demanded that the federal government cede control over public lands, and spread conspiratorial stories about environmentalists, and misinformation about the law and the constitution. A strong anti-environmental strand remains in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/patriot-movement-oregon-militias-donald-trump-election-2016\" title=\"\">the so-called Patriot Movement</a>, the umbrella term for far-right nationalist, anti-government, pro-gun and often survivalist groups. The occupation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\" title=\"\">Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon</a> demanded that the federal government hand back its land to the states so it could be opened once more for unfettered economic exploitation.</p> <p>At the same time, \u201cdamaged men\u201d who had returned from Vietnam were heading into the wilds of Idaho and Montana to build a survivalist movement. Eventually, some of this became entwined with the militia uprising of the 1990s. \u201cBut by the 90s,\u201d Neiwert says, \u201cI would say three-quarters of the guys that I would see joining militias were Larpers.\u201d This term, derived from \u201clive-action role playing\u201d, is for those who have lots of shiny weapons and equipment, but precious little training or smarts.</p> <p>Then, as now, the problem was what he calls \u201cthe McVeigh factor\u201d, referring to Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf war veteran who killed 171 people when he bombed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/oklahoma-city-bombing-20-years-later-key-questions-remain-unanswered\" title=\"\">a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1996</a>. In a comprehensive study of domestic terrorism in the US that he authored in 2017, Neiwert found many incidents of extremists plotting various horrific acts of terrorism, \u201cbut they\u2019re rarely competent enough to pull it off. But the guys who concern you, obviously, are the Tim McVeighs, the ones who are competent, the ones who have the military training.\u201d</p> <p>The US\u2019s endless wars still produce a steady stream of veterans, a small but alarming proportion of whom have joined or even formed far-right groups in recent years. Parts of the fragmenting \u201calt-right\u201d have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/15/sovereign-citizens-rightwing-terrorism-hate-us-government\" title=\"\">displayed a growing interest in paramilitary organisation</a>, and groups such as the Three Percenters encourage veterans to join their ranks.</p> <p>Despite all this Neiwert still sees a reluctance of mainstream media organisations to properly cover the far right because, he says, of a fear of being accused of \u201cliberal media bias\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3175e31a1722cd34a8bc54372ac1bbe104752b73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3175e31a1722cd34a8bc54372ac1bbe104752b73/0_0_1996_2090/955.jpg\" alt=\"The Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City following the truck bomb blast on 19 April 1995.\" width=\"955\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Alfred P Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City following the truck bomb blast on 19 April 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Longstreath/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After McVeigh\u2019s bombing, the militia movement stalled. But Neiwert argues that the far right never went away, and what we see now is the result of decades of momentum. Soon enough, prominent figures in conservative media began in earnest to build an alternative reality in which to envelop their audiences. After 9/11, he says, he saw \u201cthe conservative movement really starting to develop rhetoric and behaviour that I thought was deeply authoritarian, especially towards critics of the war\u201d.</p> <p>In his 2009 book The Eliminationists, Neiwert explained how this post-9/11 authoritarianism was fuelled by increasingly lurid fantasies in conservative media of destroying liberals, Muslims and other perceived enemies. These bubbled away throughout the presidency of Barack Obama, himself the subject of endless conspiracy theorising. Trump, of course, became the principal pusher of the idea that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. His subsequent presidential campaign was powered by authoritarian and conspiratorial fantasy. And so, Alt-America has its president.</p> <p>But can the problems Neiwert points to actually be remedied? \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that we\u2019ve dug ourselves a really deep hole and we have a really long way to dig up.\u201d He believes that while Trump is likely to lose in 2020, the movement, and the party, that propelled him to power will continue to have a malign effect.</p> <p>One important step to challenge this would be media reform. He says that the internet and corporate ownership of local media have \u201cbasically gutted the ability of local newspapers to cover local news, gutted the ability of larger newspapers to do consumer and investigative reporting\u201d. Social media, a paradise for conspiracy theorists, is filling the gap.</p> <p>Political reform is also needed. \u201cThe Democrats need to become more progressive and stop being afraid of their progressive wing.\u201d The Republican party as it stands, he thinks, may be too toxic to change, but the US does need a legitimate conservative force that is loyal to democracy.</p> <p>If nothing else, Trump\u2019s election has disclosed some home truths to a group of Americans who \u201cwere asleep, but now maybe are awake\u201d, he says. Among these truths are \u201cthat America is not over its racism. That we still have a lot of work to do. That we still have a long way to go to become an equitable and fair nation that lives up to the values that it proclaims to the rest of the world.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, Trump\u2019s all about \u2018make America great again\u2019. It\u2019s this idea that this American exceptionalism will never die. And it has to die,\u201d he says. He looks out of his window once more, over a neighbourhood partly buried under the glass, steel and concrete of the gentrifiers.</p> <p>\u201cIt has to die because it\u2019s killing us.\u201d</p>",

The occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in Oregon demanded that the federal government hand back its land to the states so it could be opened once more for unfettered economic exploitation. At the same time, \u201cdamaged men\u201d who had returned from Vietnam were heading into the wilds of Idaho and Montana to build a survivalist movement. Eventually, some of this became entwined with the militia uprising of the 1990s. \u201cBut by the 90s,\u201d Neiwert says, \u201cI would say three-quarters of the guys that I would see joining militias were Larpers.\u201d This term, derived from \u201clive-action role playing\u201d, is for those who have lots of shiny weapons and equipment, but precious little training or smarts. Then, as now, the problem was what he calls \u201cthe McVeigh factor\u201d, referring to Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf war veteran who killed 171 people when he bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1996. In a comprehensive study of domestic terrorism in the US that he authored in 2017, Neiwert found many incidents of extremists plotting various horrific acts of terrorism, \u201cbut they\u2019re rarely competent enough to pull it off. But the guys who concern you, obviously, are the Tim McVeighs, the ones who are competent, the ones who have the military training.\u201d The US\u2019s endless wars still produce a steady stream of veterans, a small but alarming proportion of whom have joined or even formed far-right groups in recent years. Parts of the fragmenting \u201calt-right\u201d have displayed a growing interest in paramilitary organisation, and groups such as the Three Percenters encourage veterans to join their ranks. Despite all this Neiwert still sees a reluctance of mainstream media organisations to properly cover the far right because, he says, of a fear of being accused of \u201cliberal media bias\u201d. After McVeigh\u2019s bombing, the militia movement stalled. But Neiwert argues that the far right never went away, and what we see now is the result of decades of momentum. Soon enough, prominent figures in conservative media began in earnest to build an alternative reality in which to envelop their audiences. After 9/11, he says, he saw \u201cthe conservative movement really starting to develop rhetoric and behaviour that I thought was deeply authoritarian, especially towards critics of the war\u201d. In his 2009 book The Eliminationists, Neiwert explained how this post-9/11 authoritarianism was fuelled by increasingly lurid fantasies in conservative media of destroying liberals, Muslims and other perceived enemies. These bubbled away throughout the presidency of Barack Obama, himself the subject of endless conspiracy theorising. Trump, of course, became the principal pusher of the idea that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. His subsequent presidential campaign was powered by authoritarian and conspiratorial fantasy. And so, Alt-America has its president. But can the problems Neiwert points to actually be remedied? \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that we\u2019ve dug ourselves a really deep hole and we have a really long way to dig up.\u201d He believes that while Trump is likely to lose in 2020, the movement, and the party, that propelled him to power will continue to have a malign effect. One important step to challenge this would be media reform. He says that the internet and corporate ownership of local media have \u201cbasically gutted the ability of local newspapers to cover local news, gutted the ability of larger newspapers to do consumer and investigative reporting\u201d. Social media, a paradise for conspiracy theorists, is filling the gap. Political reform is also needed. \u201cThe Democrats need to become more progressive and stop being afraid of their progressive wing.\u201d The Republican party as it stands, he thinks, may be too toxic to change, but the US does need a legitimate conservative force that is loyal to democracy. If nothing else, Trump\u2019s election has disclosed some home truths to a group of Americans who \u201cwere asleep, but now maybe are awake\u201d, he says. Among these truths are \u201cthat America is not over its racism. That we still have a lot of work to do. That we still have a long way to go to become an equitable and fair nation that lives up to the values that it proclaims to the rest of the world. \u201cI mean, Trump\u2019s all about \u2018make America great again\u2019. It\u2019s this idea that this American exceptionalism will never die. And it has to die,\u201d he says. He looks out of his window once more, over a neighbourhood partly buried under the glass, steel and concrete of the gentrifiers. \u201cIt has to die because it\u2019s killing us.\u201d",

When Vivianne Miedema scored in under two minutes, her 16th of the season making her already the highest ever goalscorer in a single WSL season, the former leaders looked on course for an easy victory. </p> <p>But in a game played in a not particularly friendly sprit, with yellow cards stacking up, and amid a furious hailstorm, Arsenal only secured their win via a questionable 81st minute penalty, awarded for a foul on Danielle van de Donk by Jade Moore, and scored by Kim Little. Katie McCabe\u2019s long-range shot in injury time sealed the points and a scoreline that was more than a little harsh on Reading. </p> <p>Assistant coach Aaron D\u2019Antino was in charge of Arsenal, due to manager Joe Montemurro being laid up in bed at home with the flu, and saw his team secure a vital three points, laying down a marker for fellow title challengers Chelsea and Manchester City, who both kicked off later. Arsenal, who had lost 2-1 to Chelsea a fortnight ago, could assume a temporary leadership of the table. </p> <p>Miedema achieved her record with seven matches still left of the season to play. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-27T14:54:02.621Z\">at 2.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4dc09ce4b0a585f6e877a9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-27T14:31:22.574Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">That's full-time: Reading 0-3 Arsenal.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A handy win for Arsenal, in which Vivianne Miedema broke the all-time season record for the WSL, and they never had to get out of second gear. Reading have cause to complain about their opponents\u2019 strong arm approach and what looked a very soft goal for the second. With both Chelsea and Manchester City looking on course for three points, this was vital. This title race is very much alive, and Arsenal are back on track, even if they did appear a little underpowered by their long injury list. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-27T14:34:51.836Z\">at 2.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4dc02fe4b024f0efeaf8a3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-27T14:30:27.137Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Goal!

That 2-1 Chelsea win at Arsenal a couple of weeks ago removed all margin for error for today\u2019s away team. They have played a game less than current leaders Manchester City but two recent defeats removed the advantage they once held.

Arsenal have to steady themselves before there is another fortnight off for the FA Cup. <br><br>Reading, in fifth place, but way off the battle for the title, welcome new signing Rakel H\u00f6nnud\u00f3ttir to the squad, though the striker only begins today\u2019s match on the bench.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal got back to winning ways with a win in which the scoreline belied the difficulty of their afternoon. When Vivianne Miedema scored in under two minutes, her 16th of the season making her already the highest ever goalscorer in a single WSL season, the former leaders looked on course for an easy victory. But in a game played in a not particularly friendly sprit, with yellow cards stacking up, and amid a furious hailstorm, Arsenal only secured their win via a questionable 81st minute penalty, awarded for a foul on Danielle van de Donk by Jade Moore, and scored by Kim Little. Katie McCabe\u2019s long-range shot in injury time sealed the points and a scoreline that was more than a little harsh on Reading. Assistant coach Aaron D\u2019Antino was in charge of Arsenal, due to manager Joe Montemurro being laid up in bed at home with the flu, and saw his team secure a vital three points, laying down a marker for fellow title challengers Chelsea and Manchester City, who both kicked off later. Arsenal, who had lost 2-1 to Chelsea a fortnight ago, could assume a temporary leadership of the table. Miedema achieved her record with seven matches still left of the season to play. A handy win for Arsenal, in which Vivianne Miedema broke the all-time season record for the WSL, and they never had to get out of second gear. Reading have cause to complain about their opponents\u2019 strong arm approach and what looked a very soft goal for the second. With both Chelsea and Manchester City looking on course for three points, this was vital. This title race is very much alive, and Arsenal are back on track, even if they did appear a little underpowered by their long injury list. Filis gets a touch almost instantly, and sets up McCabe for a crashing finish from long range, fully 25 yards out, and that rounds it all off. 90+3 min: Arsenal sub: On come Filis, for her debut, for Veje. 90+3 min: And another! Honnundottir fires straight at the goalie, after a fine dummy from Remi Allen. Good work, but a disappointing shot. 90+2 min: Yet another Reading chance on goal. Arsenal are clearly tired. Jo Potter hits from distance. 90+1 min: Another Williams chance, as Reading go in search of a consolation. That came as a result of Peyraud-Magnin, in Arsenal\u2019s goal, being too quick to get the game restarted. 90 min: Another Williams free-kick, but this one is not good, and it dips and swerves in entirely the wrong direction. Four minutes have been added on to this game. 89 min: A Reading attack - it\u2019s been a while. Honnundottir shows neat control and awareness in setting up a chance for Fara Williams. 87 min: Another Reading change. On comes Jade Bailey for Chaplen. This is, though, a lost cause. 86 min: On the sideline, Moore, who made that penalty challenges, appears to be trying to explain what happened. Innocence is being protested. Let us recall that it was Moore whose contact lens slipped, too. 85 mins: Reading change and on comes Rakel Honnundottir for Moore, the Icelandic player making her debut. 83 min: Another look at the penalty and it might have been an arm, or a thigh obstructing Van de Donk. 82 min: That looked a lucky penalty for Arsenal. Van de Donk fell over, but was it a foul or her losing her balance? They\u2019ll take it, not least because Chelsea are now leading Birmingham. Calm as you like, Little steps up and scores low to her right. Van de Donk turns in the box, and Jade Moore is ruled to have fouled. Had, though, the Dutch player instead tripped on the ball? 78 min: Mead\u2019s long ball is flicked into the path of Miedema, who looked to be tripped but no foul. Mead then gets the ball down the wing, Kim Little looks favourite to score but Pacheco\u2019s tackle stops a certain goal. 76 min: Van de Donk tries to get away in midfield, but loses the ball. Allen is booked for kicking the ball away after a foul is given. 75 min: Another Arsenal yellow card, with Beth Mead leaving some afters on Harding. There is an undercurrent bubbling under this match. 73 min: Arsenal\u2019s need for a win is doubled as Manchester City have taken the lead already against Brighton. 72 min: The Reading bench looks unamused, faces as dark and gloomy as the skies above them. The word is that they are not happy with Arsenal\u2019s persistent fouling. 70 min: Reading pushing on far more than Arsenal. Van Den Donk has barely had a sniff of the ball. It\u2019s been a bitty game. 68 min: McCabe, another one on a booking, is penalised for a foul on Bruton, but no second yellow. She is, though, surely on sudden death now 66 min: Harding, on a yellow, clatters into Mead, goes straight through her, in fact. But that is ruled a fair challenge. In the men\u2019s game, there might have been a bit more writhing from the victim. 65 min: Reading\u2019s Jade Moore is down and the problem appears to be her contact lens. That\u2019s a painful one, and not easy for the physio. Thankfully, the problem is sorted soon enough. 63 min: Another Arsenal free-kick on the left. Mead again takes, Bloodworth is free in the box but her header is poor when she had the freedom of Buckinghamshire to nod the second. 61 min: Mead\u2019s corner comes in, and Louise Quinn comes forward to head over. 60 min: Veje is brought down by a scrabbling Natasha Harding. A yellow card, and deservedly so. McCabe takes the free-kick, but can\u2019t beat the first defender. It\u2019s a corner. 58 min: Chaplen tries another Reading shot from long range. That is either the limit of ambitions or the belief Peyraud-Magnin is weak from distance. 57 min: Arsenal\u2019s great start to this half, just like the first, has faded fast, and they don\u2019t have a goal to boast this time, either. Reading looking more likely? Their problem is the final ball. 55 min: Peyraud-Magnin looks winded but will be fine. Fara Williams takes a corner that Allen gets to but cannot keep down. 53 min: Pacheco is tripped and Reading have another free-kick. Potter takes and Williamson gets the ball clear. But Reading eventually get the ball back, and Fara Williams\u2019 shot is headed goalwards until Peyraud-Magnin makes a fine, and brave, save. The goalie is down hurt after that. 52 min: Arsenal make a sub. On comes Danielle van de Donk for Kuyken, whose debut is at an end. That should increase Arsenal\u2019s threat level. 49 min: Veje forces a corner. Mead takes it short and gets the return, and then pings the ball into the box. Moloney beats it away. Arsenal piling it on, colour-coded notes being adhered to, and Miedema is again the target for a pass into the area. 48 min: Another chance for Miedema, but the ball was just a little too high for her as she ends up heading the ball behind her. Then, Mitchell, from left-back, swings the ball in for Mitchell, and McCabe\u2019s header is smothered. 47 min: Arsenal seek another quick start to the half but the ball is cleared by Reading\u2019s defenders when Miedema was again the target. 46 min: We are back underway. Miedema\u2019s goal, her 16th of the season, is an all-time record for the WSL. And there are seven games to go. Prolific, as the Opta lads might say in their single-word conclusion to tweets. This is the top tune that has been belting out of the Adams Park PA for the entirety of the break. Half-time reading. Both Chelsea men and women\u2019s team play later. Here\u2019s one for the men\u2019s team on the strikers\u2019 graveyard Stamford Bridge can be. After that early Arsenal goal, this has been an even contest, with Reading giving a couple of scares to the team looking to go back to the top. Aaron D\u2019Antino delays his entry into the dressing room; he probably has plenty to say, and his colour coding has perhaps run in the fierce rain. 45 min+3: Arsenal\u2019s Bloodworth makes a sliding challenge on Bruton that might have resulted in a penalty. Bruton hurdled it, perhaps too honest for her own good. 45 min: Four minutes were added on at the end of the half, after a couple of injuries. There is time for Remi Allen to turn and hit a shot at goal that has Peyraud-Magnin scrabbling. That was as dangerous as Reading have been this half. 44 min: Arsenal play some delightful link-up play in midfield, before McCabe tries to find Miedema, before a desperate ball is cleared. On the bench, the Arsenal coach, and manager for the day, Aaron D\u2019Antino, is piling on the notes, and is even changing the pen colour. That\u2019s fastidious stuff. 43 min: Arsenal\u2019s Williamson steps up from central defence, and tries a shot. It\u2019s a little too high and wide to be worth her while. 41 min: Arsenal by far the more threatening team here, if Reading have had more of the ball. Mead, who has been a star on the flank, surges on from the right and has space to shoot on goal. Her attempt misses, skewing just wide. 39 min: Miedema again on the scene as there is panic in the Reading box. Moloney can only claw the ball to Kuyken, whose attempted lob is cleared. That was close to a debut goal for the 17-year-old, but she couldn\u2019t get enough on it. 37 min: This time, Fara Williams\u2019s kick is launched deep into the Arsenal box, but is cleared with ease. There were not enough bodies in the box, to go all Mick Channon in 1986. 36 min: Harding shapes for a Reading long throw, but again goes short. And another chance for a free-kick after McCabe is booked for what seems to be a case of totting-up. 35 min: It has to be said that the feared deluge has not arrived, in goal terms at least. Both defences have done well, aside from that early goal for Arsenal. 33 min: Remi Allen is clearly made of stern stuff. There seems to be no question of her not carrying on. 32 min: This looks nasty. Arsenal\u2019s Little went for the ball and Remi Allen jumped over her, and took a very nasty landing. Looks like her neck could be the problem, which is a worry. Dazedly, she gets back up. And a thumbs up to the manager suggests she is OK. 30 min: Chaplen is fouled by Bruton. Chance for another free-kick, taken by Potter. The ball worms out to Molly Bartrip, whose shot is blocked. Arsenal were back in numbers. 28 min: Miedema limps off, but looks to be coming back on, though her right hip seems to be the problem. 27 min: Close for Arsenal! Little, out to Mead, and then a header from Miedema, which is well saved by Grace Moloney in the Reading goal. Bad news for Arsenal is that Miedema is receiving treatment. 26 min: A replay of that incident suggests Arsenal got a little lucky. The hail, which has now stopped, looked even more brutal in slo-mo. 24 min: Reading build from the back, and play it slow, but are not being helped by a wind that is clearly blasting into their faces. They do have a free-kick as Mitchell is booked for Arsenal. Fara Williams hits this into the wind, but decides to dink the ball in. Lauren Bruton was clattered into for what looked a possible penalty. Miedema cleaned her out completely. But, but got the ball. Just. Maybe. 21 min: Kuyken, the teenager, comes back to sweep up some Reading danger. The home team are being held at arm\u2019s length. And the hail and rain keeps coming. It\u2019s brutal. 18 min: Miedema takes up the ball and goes on a windy solo run; she had nobody in support. A backheel to close it reveals her lack of options and a bit of tiredness. Meanwhile, it is hailing, and the hailstones look as big as pebbles. Grim conditions perhaps the reason for a game that has not caught fire just yet. 16 min: Reading win a throw on the right flank. They line up for this one like a rugby line-up. Harding then launches it behind her, and the ball finds its way back to Peyraud-Magnin too easily. 15 min: Kelly Chambers is wrapped up warm, and her subs are sat under a blanket. It\u2019s 5 degrees in Wycombe together and a little windy. 13 min: A foul on Little results in a quickly taken free-kick but Arsenal do look to be taking things slow, happy to retain the ball. Bartram has to come across to stop the ball getting to Miedema. 11 min: That was Miedema\u2019s 23 goal in all competitions this season, and she is hunting more. 10 min: Reading\u2019s build-up is somewhat slow, and Arsenal are defending with some comfort. 9 min: Reading, at last, have an attack and Brooke Chaplen was given a brief sight of goal before the ball was cleared. 8 min: Meade and Veje, who supplied Miedema for the goal, are finding far too much space on the flanks for Arsenal. 6 min: Miedema again looks to be causing problems, but Beth Meade\u2019s pair of crosses are cleared, and hurriedly. Then Williamson is penalised for a foul. 4 min: That was exactly the opposite of the start Reading manager Kelly Chambers, who expressed her worries about her team before this game, didn\u2019t want. Brings back memories of that 6-0. Miedema finds space in the box to collect a cross from the left, takes the ball down and scores with ease. That didn\u2019t take long. 1 min: Reading have lined up with a diamond formation, while Arsenal are playing 3-4-3. Looks like they fancy goals. Kick-off: Adams Park, Wycombe, looks resplendent if not exactly full. The sound of Faithless\u2019s Insomnia booms out. If I am not mistaken, Faithless are local heroes from the Thames Valley. Anyway, away we go. Reading have lost not won a match since November, and lost 6-0 in the last WSL meeting between the teams. The major team news for Arsenal is the absence of manager Joe Montemurro, who laid up in bed with the flu. Aaron D\u2019Antino, also an Australian, will be masterminding matters from the dug-out. It is getting tight at the top. That 2-1 Chelsea win at Arsenal a couple of weeks ago removed all margin for error for today\u2019s away team. They have played a game less than current leaders Manchester City but two recent defeats removed the advantage they once held. And Chelsea, who had previously given up on the title, are lurking with serious intent, and host Birmingham later this afternoon. Arsenal have to steady themselves before there is another fortnight off for the FA Cup. Reading, in fifth place, but way off the battle for the title, welcome new signing Rakel H\u00f6nnud\u00f3ttir to the squad, though the striker only begins today\u2019s match on the bench. And here are the teams.",

There were two women there, one he didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>\u201cFirst they made a joke asking him was he a \u2018tree-hugging hippy\u2019 but then they asked him if he was affiliated with Isis. Isis wasn\u2019t even a word in his vocabulary. He was terrified. He didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the officers were satisfied that Smith\u2019s son was not the next Osama bin Laden.

I said, \u2018have you been questioning my son under Prevent?\u2019 She said they had to because of regulations, schools were having to do this. This was such a shock.

      "bodyText": "Ifhat Smith\u2019s son was 13 years old when he was questioned by school officials and asked if he was affiliated to the jihadist group Islamic State. Smith was shocked when she ultimately realised her child had been questioned under the government\u2019s Prevent strategy \u2013 but was left baffled when she discovered the interrogation was triggered by his use of the term \u201ceco-terrorist\u201d in a classroom discussion about environmental activists. The boy was in a French class at his school in Islington, north London, when he used the phrase to describe some images. Nothing was said at the time. He went home, enjoyed the weekend and returned to school on Monday. \u201cHe was in a French lesson, someone came in, said something to the teacher and the teacher pointed at him. They said, \u2018follow me,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe had never been in trouble at school. He was really nervous. There were two women there, one he didn\u2019t know. \u201cFirst they made a joke asking him was he a \u2018tree-hugging hippy\u2019 but then they asked him if he was affiliated with Isis. Isis wasn\u2019t even a word in his vocabulary. He was terrified. He didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.\u201d Ultimately, the officers were satisfied that Smith\u2019s son was not the next Osama bin Laden. He was asked to return to class and the subject was never raised again. When Smith\u2019s son returned from school and told her what happened, she immediately called the head of his year group. \u201cThe penny dropped. I said, \u2018have you been questioning my son under Prevent?\u2019 She said they had to because of regulations, schools were having to do this. This was such a shock. I\u2019d heard little bits about Prevent, I just thought it\u2019s something so far removed from us, we\u2019re not going to be affected by this.\u201d The experience of Smith\u2019s son reflects the central concern surrounding the government\u2019s Prevent strategy for years: that it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. There have been numerous similar reports over the last 15 years: an eight-year-old questioned by Prevent after his teachers mistook his T-shirt slogan for Isis propaganda, a 17-year-old referred because he wore a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d badge to school and a student of counter-terrorism questioned after an official spotted him reading a textbook entitled Terrorism Studies. After years of pressure from individuals, campaigners and politicians, the government has finally agreed to address these concerns with an independent review of the Prevent strategy. One of four strands of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest, Prevent was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. Its stated purpose is designed to steer people vulnerable to all forms of extremism away from violence and essentially from becoming terrorists capable of violence. The Channel programme, an arm of Prevent, mentors those identified as at risk of radicalisation. Since 2012 more than 1,200 people had been supported by Channel. The controversy surrounding the approach deepened in July 2015, when the government introduced a statutory duty on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism. Rob Faure Walker, a secondary school teacher in Tower Hamlets and a PhD candidate investigating the impact of counter-extremism discourses in educational settings, saw the impact of the duty first-hand when children suddenly stopped talking about specific issues for fear they would be targeted by Prevent officers \u2013 a so-called \u201cchilling effect\u201d. \u201cThe most profound example I had was a kid who was a devout Muslim telling me he was scared of practising his religion in school for fear of a referral,\u201d he said. Walker said that as a teacher he came to realise that having robust discussions with children on difficult topics \u2013 such as those who expressed frustration with western foreign policy or made racist remarks \u2013 actually helped ensure such views did not lead to violence. \u201cIn my experience what is now being targeted as extremism was part of the mechanism that pathways to violence were diverted,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then Prevent comes in and starts to specifically target those types of conversations, putting a duty on me as a teacher to report those conversations as extremism \u2013 and it\u2019s based on a false premise that the airing of extreme views is a predictor for violence.\u201d Longstanding critics of Prevent have cautiously welcomed the review, which will be launched within six months of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism and border security bill passing into law. Yasmine Ahmed, the director of the NGO Rights Watch UK, which in 2016 produced a landmark report on the impact of Prevent, said it was essential for a full and transparent review to took place to ensure its legitimacy. \u201cWe think it\u2019s essential given serious human rights concerns \u2013 particularly the impact on children in schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Prevent strategy is not a hard security measure, we\u2019re not talking about torture.

      "bodyText": "Just outside Venezuela\u2019s borders its refugees are under few illusions that they will be able to return home any time soon. Tensions may be rising between Washington and Caracas, with talk of regime change on everyone\u2019s lips, but for ordinary Venezuelans, leaving their country remains the most attractive option. Tens of thousands cross into C\u00facuta, a punishingly hot city of 600,000 people on Colombia\u2019s eastern border with Venezuela, every day. Most come to briefly work or shop for goods unavailable or prohibitively expensive in Venezuela, others for hospital visits. But for about 5,000 a day, the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge that divides the two countries is the last they will see of their homeland for the foreseeable future. Siblings Antonio and Gabriela Yany have fled Maracay in northern Venezuela, and are heading to Bogot\u00e1 to join their parents who left last year. \u201cWe have nothing to eat, we go hungry for days and our salaries buy us nothing,\u201d Antonio said, as he waited outside a bus terminal in C\u00facuta, a city on Colombia\u2019s eastern border with Venezuela. \u201cThings aren\u2019t changing anytime soon there.\u201d Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with severe shortages of staple foods and basic medicines. Hyperinflation has rendered the currency practically worthless, and crime is widespread. The dire situation has triggered an exodus of Venezuelans, arguably the largest mass migration in Latin America\u2019s history. More than 3 million have now fled, with more than a million in Colombia. The UNHCR has projected that 2 million more people could leave Venezuela this year. Meanwhile, there is uncertainty around who leads the country. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro sits in the presidential palace but his leadership is no longer recognised by the United States, Canada and a dozen Latin American countries. They favour Juan Guaid\u00f3, the young leader of the opposition-held congress who last Wednesday declared himself interim president until free and fair elections are held. \u201cMaduro is a dictator and a clown, he laughs away while his people are starving,\u201d said Alfonso Castro, who fled Venezuela last year. He now lives in C\u00facuta and helps other migrants cart their luggage across the bridge for coins. \u201cGuaid\u00f3 is a blessing. If he takes power I\u2019ll go home to my family tomorrow.\u201d When Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that \u201call options are on the table\u201d should Maduro not cede power, implying the possibility of US military intervention, Castro was joyous. \u201cI pray overnight that Uncle Sam\u2019s soldiers come,\u201d he said, grinning widely. However, discussions of who will emerge victorious in the battle for the presidency remain largely academic for many Venezuelans struggling to get by in Colombia. \u201cThere may be discussions about new leaders but all of that is going on in Caracas,\u201d said Felipe Mu\u00f1oz, the Colombian government\u2019s border tsar who was in C\u00facuta to cut the ribbon on a new health centre set up by international NGOs. \u201cYou ask anyone here, they\u2019ll tell you that all they care about is feeding their families.\u201d It is that desperation that led Keymar Luna make the journey to C\u00facuta, where she is waiting to catch a bus to the nearby town M\u00e1laga, where her husband moved last year. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret how difficult life is there,\u201d the young woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible to have to leave your own country, and to leave your family. Nobody wants that.\u201d Analysts see no end in sight to the misery, despite the possibility of regime change in Caracas. \u201cI see it getting worse before it gets better,\u201d said Trisha Brury, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s deputy director for Colombia. \u201cThe only good thing to come out of the chaos in Caracas is that more attention is being brought to this humanitarian crisis.\u201d It is not only Colombia receiving refugees and migrants, with Brazil \u2013 which borders Venezuela to the south \u2013 another destination for those fleeing the crisis. Migrants who have fled to the troubled Brazilian border town of Pacaraima express fear, cynicism, confusion and cautious optimism over the possibility their country\u2019s spiralling crisis could lead to change. But there was no consensus that Gua\u00eddo\u2019s move to declare himself president would work unless the Venezuelan army did not back him. Yasmira Veliz, 50, a former teacher from Caracas now helping at a Catholic church to serve breakfasts to 700 migrants every morning, said Gua\u00eddo\u2019s self-declaration was unconstitutional. \u201cYou can\u2019t nominate yourself president,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what the solution is? To kill Maduro. This is the way out.\u201d Also helping serve the rudimentary breakfast of coffee with milk, bread and fruit to hundreds of migrants early on Friday morning was Delia P\u00e1rica, 41, a former nurse. She agreed with Veliz: \u201cMaduro will not deliver up power. He prefers to die,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the US goes to war against Venezuela Russia will support it [the regime].\u201d Both women welcomed the confrontational stance of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, towards Maduro. \u201cWe feel safe in Brazil,\u201d said P\u00e1rica. Others sought to find humour in the humanitarian crisis. \u201cVenezuela has two presidents and two assemblies!\u201d joked Helinger Cordova, 25, a shop-worker from Matur\u00edn who has been in Brazil for a year. \u201cThere will be a change. We don\u2019t know if it will be for the better.\u201d So far there has not been a spike in the numbers of migrants crossing the border. Numbers in recent days have varied from 500 to 900, and the Brazilian army running relief efforts said its contingency plans mean it has the capacity to handle up to 1,200 newcomers a day. \u201cWe are prepared for a possible wave from the other side,\u201d said Col Jos\u00e9 Rinaldo, who runs the army base in Pacaraima. The northern Brazilian state of Roraima has experienced an influx of tens of thousands of migrants in Pacaraima and the state capital Boa Vista, where many sell clothes, plants or stitch shoes on the street. Roraima\u2019s new governor, Antonio Denarium, from Bolsonaro\u2019s right-wing Social Liberal party, has declared a state of financial emergency citing debts, salary delays and the risk of collapse of health, education and security services.",

It deprives a hi-tech company of the rights to stay away from politics, focus on technology and market.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, in many ways Huawei is used to scrutiny over its political associations. Critics point the finger at the possible connections between its founder Ren Zhengfei\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/08/the-giant-that-no-one-trusts-why-huaweis-history-haunts-it\">and the Chinese government</a>.</p> <p>Ren, 74, a former engineer for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, has been a party member since 1978 and was deemed one of 100 entrepreneurs who safeguarded \u201cthe leadership of the Chinese Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>Huawei is also one of China\u2019s so-called \u201cnational champions\u201d\u2019 referring to companies whose global expansion is considered in the national interest.</p> <p>Critics say Huawei\u2019s rapid expansion is suspicious. Founded in 1987 and focused on selling telecom equipment in rural areas of China, it has grown into the world\u2019s largest supplier of telecoms equipment and second largest smartphone maker. It operates in more than 170 countries, employing about 180,000 people.</p> <p>Others point to Huawei\u2019s corporate structure, describing it as opaque. Huawei has long claimed that it is an employee-owned company, with Ren holding just 1.4% and the rest distributed among employees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3975a510304ecd8fd03a42496cb5f14c2371cd96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3975a510304ecd8fd03a42496cb5f14c2371cd96/0_101_3119_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A guard tries to block photos from being taken outside the Canadian embassy in Beijing.

Huawei and me personally have never received any request from any government to provide improper information,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet Huawei, like all companies operating in China, would have no choice but to supply information to Chinese security. China\u2019s national intelligence law requires all organisations and individuals to \u201csupport, provide assistance, and cooperate in national intelligence work\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese telecom company Huawei is at the centre of an increasingly tense standoff between China and the US. What began as a trade spat and grievances over corporate intellectual property theft has developed into a global standoff involving \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d, death sentences and allegations of Chinese espionage. Huawei\u2019s senior executive Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December over allegations of sanctions violations and awaits extradition to the US. Meanwhile, three Canadians remain in police custody in China; one of them was sentenced to death this month. Washington, meanwhile, has said it will file a formal extradition request for Meng by the 30 January deadline. The US is reportedly investigating Huawei for stealing trade secrets while US lawmakers are calling for a ban on selling American-made chips and other components to the company. Last week, Vodafone became the latest company to flag concerns over Huawei, announcing a decision to \u201cpause\u201d use of the company\u2019s equipment in its core mobile phone networks. Oxford University and the Prince\u2019s Trust, Prince Charles\u2019s charity, said this month they would no longer accept donations from Huawei. Huawei and its defenders have tried to paint the company as an innocent bystander, politicised against its will. Global Times editor Hu Xijin tweeted this month that: \u201cBy escalating its crackdown on Huawei, the US sets a bad precedent of applying McCarthyism in hi-tech fields. It deprives a hi-tech company of the rights to stay away from politics, focus on technology and market.\u201d Yet, in many ways Huawei is used to scrutiny over its political associations. Critics point the finger at the possible connections between its founder Ren Zhengfei\u2019 and the Chinese government. Ren, 74, a former engineer for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, has been a party member since 1978 and was deemed one of 100 entrepreneurs who safeguarded \u201cthe leadership of the Chinese Communist party.\u201d Huawei is also one of China\u2019s so-called \u201cnational champions\u201d\u2019 referring to companies whose global expansion is considered in the national interest. Critics say Huawei\u2019s rapid expansion is suspicious. Founded in 1987 and focused on selling telecom equipment in rural areas of China, it has grown into the world\u2019s largest supplier of telecoms equipment and second largest smartphone maker. It operates in more than 170 countries, employing about 180,000 people. Others point to Huawei\u2019s corporate structure, describing it as opaque. Huawei has long claimed that it is an employee-owned company, with Ren holding just 1.4% and the rest distributed among employees. \u201cThere are so many doubts about Huawei,\u201d said Li Datong, an outspoken commentator and former journalist. \u201cThat Huawei is able to expand and hold a large share of the market has people wondering what other power there is behind the company? Everyone knows the answer,\u201d he said. The US has been wary of Huawei\u2019s state links since at least 2010, with the former head of the CIA claiming evidence of espionage \u2013 allegations that have not been proved.

Concerns about Huawei\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government have led US politicians and telecoms executives to call for banning Huawei from the rollout of the 5G network in the US, the next generation of the cellular technology. New Zealand and Australia have already moved to block the use of Huawei\u2019s equipment as part of the 5G rollout citing similar concerns. In the UK, BT said in December it had removed Huawei equipment from parts of its network after the head of MI6 said it was time for the UK to decide whether it was \u201ccomfortable with Chinese ownership of these platforms\u201d. Huawei has pledged to spend $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) to alleviate those security concerns. Poland, where a Chinese employee of Huawei has been arrested on allegations of spying, has called on the European Union and Nato to decide whether to exclude Huawei from their markets. Even the Chinese firm\u2019s sideline business in solar panels is under investigation. American politicians have claimed the firm\u2019s panels \u201cmay pose a threat to our nation\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d An effective ban in the western world would be a blow to Huawei but it is likely the company can weather a fight with just the US.

Many shoppers were forced to cancel their trips, while parts of the bus network ground to a halt and road traffic was at a standstill, as fans hoped to catch a glimpse of James Charles, who is known for his online makeup guides. The American was in town to open a shop for Morphe Cosmetics, with rows of police and security guards struggling to hold back thousands of people, mainly teenage girls, who had been gathering at the Bullring shopping centre since early in the morning. The sheer mass of people and cars heading into the city centre caused havoc, with the BBC reporting that some drivers abandoned their vehicles overnight after giving up hope of getting out. The teenager from upstate New York has earned more than 10 million followers on both Instagram and YouTube for his makeup videos, with brands queuing up to sign lucrative endorsement deals.

      "body": "<p>If you are looking forward to your first stiff drink after a dry January, be warned: it may feel bittersweet. You may feel you deserve an alcoholic beverage after toughing it out all month \u2013 but have you forgotten what it feels like to wake up haunted by worries about what you said or did the night before? These post-drinking feelings of guilt and stress have come to be known colloquially as \u201changxiety\u201d. But what causes them?</p> <p>David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London, is the scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked\" title=\"\">who was fired</a> in 2009 as the government\u2019s chief drug adviser for saying alcohol is more dangerous than ecstasy and LSD. I tell him I have always assumed my morning-after mood was a result of my brain having shrivelled like a raisin through alcohol-induced dehydration. When Nutt explains the mechanics of how alcohol causes crippling anxiety, he paints an even more offputting picture.</p> <p>Alcohol, he says, targets the Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor, which sends chemical messages through the brain and central nervous system to inhibit the activity of nerve cells. Put simply, it calms the brain, reducing excitement by making fewer neurons fire. \u201cAlcohol stimulates Gaba, which is why you get relaxed and cheerful when you drink,\u201d explains Nutt.</p> <p>The first two drinks lull you into a blissful Gaba-induced state of chill. When you get to the third or fourth drink, another brain-slackening effect kicks in: you start blocking glutamate, the main excitatory transmitter in the brain. \u201cMore glutamate means more anxiety,\u201d says Nutt. \u201cLess glutamate means less anxiety.\u201d This is why, he says, \u201cwhen people get very drunk, they\u2019re even less anxious than when they\u2019re a bit drunk\u201d \u2013 not only does alcohol reduce the chatter in your brain by stimulating Gaba, but it further reduces your anxiety by blocking glutamate. In your blissed-out state, you will probably feel that this is all good \u2013 but you will be wrong.</p> <p>The body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. It is a little like when you eat a lot of sweets and your body goes into insulin-producing overdrive to get the blood sugar levels down to normal; as soon as the sweets have been digested, all that insulin causes your blood sugar to crash. When you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate \u2013 a situation that leads to anxiety, says Nutt. \u201cIt leads to seizures as well, which is why people have fits in withdrawal.\u201d</p> <p>It can take the brain a day or two to return to the status quo, which is why a hair of the dog is so enticing. \u201cIf you drank an awful lot for a long time,\u201d says Nutt, \u201cit might take weeks for the brain to readapt. In alcoholics, we\u2019ve found changes in Gaba for years.\u201d</p> <p>To add to the misery, the anxiety usually kicks in while you are trying to sleep off the booze. \u201cIf you measure sleep when people are drunk, they go off to sleep fast. They go into a deeper sleep than normal, which is why they sometimes wet the bed or have night terrors. Then, after about four hours, the withdrawal kicks in \u2013 that\u2019s when you wake up all shaky and jittery.\u201d</p> <p>Imbalances in Gaba and glutamate are not the only problem. Alcohol also causes a small rise in noradrenaline \u2013 known as the fight-or-flight hormone. \u201cNoradrenaline suppresses stress when you first take it, and increases it in withdrawal,\u201d says Nutt. \u201cSevere anxiety can be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain.\u201d</p> <p>Another key cause of hangxiety is being unable to remember the mortifying things you are sure you must have said or done while inebriated \u2013 another result of your compromised glutamate levels. \u201cYou need glutamate to lay down memories,\u201d says Nutt, \u201cand once you\u2019re on the sixth or seventh drink, the glutamate system is blocked, which is why you can\u2019t remember things.\u201d</p> <p>If this isn\u2019t ringing any bells, it may be because hangxiety does not affect us all equally, as revealed by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918305762?via%3Dihub#!\" title=\"\">a study published </a> in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Researchers quizzed healthy young people about their levels of anxiety before, during and the morning after drinking alcohol. According to one of the authors, Celia Morgan, professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter: \u201cThe people who were more shy had much higher levels of anxiety [the following day] than the people who weren\u2019t shy.\u201d The team also found a correlation between having bad hangxiety and the chance of having an alcohol use disorder. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s playing a role in keeping problematic drinking going,\u201d says Morgan.</p> <p>One theory as to why very shy people might be more at risk of hangxiety and alcoholism is the possibility that alcohol\u2019s seesaw effect on Gaba levels is more pronounced in them. Their baseline Gaba levels may be lower to start with, says Morgan. \u201cIt could also be a psychological effect \u2013 people who are more highly anxious are more prone to rumination, going over thoughts about the night before, so that\u2019s another potential mechanism.\u201d</p> <p>However, the study\u2019s findings have wider implications \u2013 after all, most drinkers lean on alcohol as social lubrication to some degree.</p> <p>The bad news is that there seems to be little you can do to avoid hangxiety other than to drink less, and perhaps take painkillers \u2013 they will at least ease your headache. \u201cTheoretically, ibuprofen would be better than paracetamol,\u201d says Nutt, \u201cbecause it\u2019s more anti-inflammatory \u2013 but we don\u2019t know how much of the hangover is caused by inflammation. It\u2019s something we\u2019re working on, trying to measure that.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan suggests trying to break the cycle. \u201cBefore drinking in a social situation you feel anxious in, try fast-forwarding to the next day when you\u2019ll have much higher anxiety levels. If you can\u2019t ride that out without drinking, the worry is that you will get stuck in this cycle of problematic drinking where your hangxiety is building and building over time. Drinking might fix social anxiety in the short term, but in the long term it might have pretty detrimental consequences.\u201d Exposure therapy is a common treatment for phobias, where you sit with your fear in order to help you overcome it. \u201cBy drinking alcohol, people aren\u2019t giving themselves a chance to do that,\u201d says Morgan.</p> <p>But there might be hope for the future. Nutt is involved in a project to develop a drink that takes the good bits of alcohol and discards the damaging or detrimental effects. \u201cAlcosynth\u201d, as it is currently called, drowns your sorrows in the same way as alcohol, but without knocking the Gaba and glutamate out of kilter. \u201cWe\u2019re in the second stage of fundraising to take it through to a product,\u201d he says. \u201cThe industry knows [alcohol] is a toxic substance. If it was discovered today, it would be illegal as a foodstuff.\u201d</p> <p>Until Alcosynth reaches the market, Nutt says his \u201cstrong\u201d message is: \u201cNever treat hangxiety with a hair of the dog. When people start drinking in the mornings to get over their hangxiety, then they\u2019re in the cycle of dependence. It\u2019s a very slippery slope.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>I have a sad confession to make: I used to love BBC\u2019s Question Time so much that I would only go out on a Thursday night if it meant coming home in time to watch it live. Now it just makes me sad. With public discourse increasingly polarised, all views cheered or jeered by a baying crowd online and off, Question Time is the public square where we get to watch bears being poked. It not only televises the deep divisions in the country, but the uncomfortable position the BBC adopts to straddle them.</p> \n<p>Since replacing the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby with Fiona Bruce, the show has stirred up a hornets\u2019 nest of right/left division in just three episodes, ending last week with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46996475/question-time-fiona-bruce-happy-to-clarify-polls-remarks\" title=\"\">a clarification</a> about whether Labour or the Tories were ahead in opinion polls, which reminded us why BBC bureaucracy is the subject of such satire.</p> \n<p>To recap: Bruce\u2019s second episode prompted loud support from Conservative voices such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WestminsterWAG/status/1088579950016413697\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2019/01/25/question-time-episode-3-review-fiona-bruce-rises-madnesswith/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a> but more than 100 complaints over the show\u2019s treatment of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and a Momentum petition for an apology.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/21/diane-abbott-labour-question-time-fiona-bruce-repeated-tory-propaganda\">Diane Abbott: Fiona Bruce 'repeated Tory propaganda'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By replacing Dimbleby with a BBC newsreader best known for helping members of the public sell things they find in the attic on Antiques Roadshow, the BBC hoped to find a figurehead who spoke for the ordinary viewer. She is more shire than Westminster; no wonder the Telegraph,<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/f/fiona-bruce/\" title=\"\"> which sends Bruce to report on nice holidays</a>, loves her.</p> \n<p>The affair raises important issues for the BBC about impartiality and trust. Ofcom, currently <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/124422/BBC-annual-report.pdf#page=26\" title=\"\">reviewing</a> its news division, said when it was launched: \u201cAs national debates become more polarised, it becomes harder for broadcasters to be seen to be accurate and impartial. The BBC has to ensure it devotes the appropriate resources to maintain its position.\u201d</p> \n<p>Here are some suggestions. First, spend time and money on basic fact-checking. The presenter of Question Time does not need to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hansard, but a proper knowledge of that day\u2019s opinion polls is pretty much baseline. When a politician claims their party is \u201clevel-pegging\u201d in the polls, the presenter cannot sneer, as Bruce did, \u201cyou\u2019re behind, Diane\u201d without knowing for sure they are right. Again, this is not just a criticism of Bruce. Why was there no producer whispering in her ear \u201cactually Fiona, the polls are little more complicated than that.\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"334d40af-c814-4274-9d9d-8182b22d8f60\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MDx0reH1euU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Everyone makes mistakes, even the best, most knowledgeable journalists muck it up, especially when live on air and dealing with tricky politicians and panellists. Why can\u2019t the BBC simply admit an error quickly and with grace and move on? Instead, its often weird approach makes things worse.</p> \n<p>Having failed to offer clarification by the end of the Abbott show, the BBC instead issued a weird statement 24 hours later mentioning \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d social media comments. Then on Twitter it stated: \u201cA YouGov poll published on the day of the programme suggested a lead for the Conservatives. Diane Abbott was also right that some other polls suggested Labour either as ahead or tied, and we should have made that clear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, Bruce waited until halfway through the next show to issue another clarification of sorts. \u201cI just want to pick up on something from last week\u2019s programme,\u201d she began. \u201cThere was some discussion about opinion polls \u2026 I was talking about a poll which came out on the day of the programme which suggested the Conservatives were ahead. The shadow home secretary mentioned some other, earlier polls which showed Labour in the lead and we should have made that context clear, and I\u2019m really happy to do that now.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/shortcuts/2019/jan/21/question-time-diane-abbott\">Question Time is broken \u2013 here are five ways to fix it </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The timing was to \u201cfit in\u201d with the flow of the show, but the tone was a bit \u201cyou ordinary people out there probably don\u2019t even care about the polls.\u201d Which may be true, but everyone who pays for it cares about the BBC getting it right and not being too grand to admit when it gets stuff wrong. It simply needs to be transparent rather than defensive when it makes mistakes, which are tiny in comparison with its vast output but nonetheless magnified not just by its vexatious critics but its own flat-footed reactions.</p> \n<p>The increasingly fractious treatment of people in the public eye is enough to make anyone defensive, of course. BBC journalists talk privately of being so hounded after admitting minor errors they vow never to do it again unless forced.</p> \n<p>Finally \u2013 and this is more difficult for a broadcaster keen to generate debate and maintain audience figures \u2013 Question Time needs to stop being so confrontational. The editor, Hilary O\u2019Neill, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/question-time-editor\" title=\"\">promised \u201cadrenaline-packed Thursday nights\u201d</a> when she was appointed. Yet 18 months later few seem concerned that the hormone not only sets pulses racing but closes the ability to think clearly.</p> \n<p>Ever since the appearance of the far-right leader Nick Griffin in 2009 gave the show its highest-ever ratings of 8 million, the show has increasingly courted controversial guests. Hence, Nigel Farage appears more frequently than his position would perhaps warrant.</p> \n<p>Seek out controversy by all means but realise that the end result is a dead bear, not valid debate.</p> \n<p>Of all the issues facing the BBC, the calm marshalling of facts is the most important, mostly because it is the central weapon against allegations of false equivalence. On climate change, the BBC no longer insists on seeking out the one voice who rejects the consensus. Impartiality does not mean saying that both sides are the same, when facts suggest that they are not. Fear of abuse does not help here either.</p> \n<p>One example from Question Time in recent weeks that has prompted fewer headlines concerns a comment Bruce made about the referendum campaigns. When an audience member said leave ran a \u201cdirty campaign\u201d, Bruce responded that there had been \u201cquestions over both leave and remain\u201d.</p> \n<p>Paul Lashmar, the investigative journalist behind the documentary Who Paid for Brexit?, complained to the BBC that remain\u2019s use of occasionally inaccurate economic forecasts was not the same as being fined and investigated by the National Crime Agency.

      "bodyText": "I have a sad confession to make: I used to love BBC\u2019s Question Time so much that I would only go out on a Thursday night if it meant coming home in time to watch it live. Now it just makes me sad. With public discourse increasingly polarised, all views cheered or jeered by a baying crowd online and off, Question Time is the public square where we get to watch bears being poked. It not only televises the deep divisions in the country, but the uncomfortable position the BBC adopts to straddle them. Since replacing the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby with Fiona Bruce, the show has stirred up a hornets\u2019 nest of right/left division in just three episodes, ending last week with a clarification about whether Labour or the Tories were ahead in opinion polls, which reminded us why BBC bureaucracy is the subject of such satire. To recap: Bruce\u2019s second episode prompted loud support from Conservative voices such as Sarah Vine and the Telegraph but more than 100 complaints over the show\u2019s treatment of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and a Momentum petition for an apology. By replacing Dimbleby with a BBC newsreader best known for helping members of the public sell things they find in the attic on Antiques Roadshow, the BBC hoped to find a figurehead who spoke for the ordinary viewer. She is more shire than Westminster; no wonder the Telegraph, which sends Bruce to report on nice holidays, loves her. The affair raises important issues for the BBC about impartiality and trust. Ofcom, currently reviewing its news division, said when it was launched: \u201cAs national debates become more polarised, it becomes harder for broadcasters to be seen to be accurate and impartial. The BBC has to ensure it devotes the appropriate resources to maintain its position.\u201d Here are some suggestions. First, spend time and money on basic fact-checking. The presenter of Question Time does not need to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hansard, but a proper knowledge of that day\u2019s opinion polls is pretty much baseline. When a politician claims their party is \u201clevel-pegging\u201d in the polls, the presenter cannot sneer, as Bruce did, \u201cyou\u2019re behind, Diane\u201d without knowing for sure they are right. Again, this is not just a criticism of Bruce. Why was there no producer whispering in her ear \u201cactually Fiona, the polls are little more complicated than that.\u201d Everyone makes mistakes, even the best, most knowledgeable journalists muck it up, especially when live on air and dealing with tricky politicians and panellists. Why can\u2019t the BBC simply admit an error quickly and with grace and move on? Instead, its often weird approach makes things worse. Having failed to offer clarification by the end of the Abbott show, the BBC instead issued a weird statement 24 hours later mentioning \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d social media comments. Then on Twitter it stated: \u201cA YouGov poll published on the day of the programme suggested a lead for the Conservatives. Diane Abbott was also right that some other polls suggested Labour either as ahead or tied, and we should have made that clear.\u201d Then, Bruce waited until halfway through the next show to issue another clarification of sorts. \u201cI just want to pick up on something from last week\u2019s programme,\u201d she began. \u201cThere was some discussion about opinion polls \u2026 I was talking about a poll which came out on the day of the programme which suggested the Conservatives were ahead. The shadow home secretary mentioned some other, earlier polls which showed Labour in the lead and we should have made that context clear, and I\u2019m really happy to do that now.\u201d The timing was to \u201cfit in\u201d with the flow of the show, but the tone was a bit \u201cyou ordinary people out there probably don\u2019t even care about the polls.\u201d Which may be true, but everyone who pays for it cares about the BBC getting it right and not being too grand to admit when it gets stuff wrong. It simply needs to be transparent rather than defensive when it makes mistakes, which are tiny in comparison with its vast output but nonetheless magnified not just by its vexatious critics but its own flat-footed reactions. The increasingly fractious treatment of people in the public eye is enough to make anyone defensive, of course. BBC journalists talk privately of being so hounded after admitting minor errors they vow never to do it again unless forced. Finally \u2013 and this is more difficult for a broadcaster keen to generate debate and maintain audience figures \u2013 Question Time needs to stop being so confrontational. The editor, Hilary O\u2019Neill, promised \u201cadrenaline-packed Thursday nights\u201d when she was appointed. Yet 18 months later few seem concerned that the hormone not only sets pulses racing but closes the ability to think clearly. Ever since the appearance of the far-right leader Nick Griffin in 2009 gave the show its highest-ever ratings of 8 million, the show has increasingly courted controversial guests. Hence, Nigel Farage appears more frequently than his position would perhaps warrant. Seek out controversy by all means but realise that the end result is a dead bear, not valid debate. Of all the issues facing the BBC, the calm marshalling of facts is the most important, mostly because it is the central weapon against allegations of false equivalence. On climate change, the BBC no longer insists on seeking out the one voice who rejects the consensus. Impartiality does not mean saying that both sides are the same, when facts suggest that they are not. Fear of abuse does not help here either. One example from Question Time in recent weeks that has prompted fewer headlines concerns a comment Bruce made about the referendum campaigns. When an audience member said leave ran a \u201cdirty campaign\u201d, Bruce responded that there had been \u201cquestions over both leave and remain\u201d. Paul Lashmar, the investigative journalist behind the documentary Who Paid for Brexit?, complained to the BBC that remain\u2019s use of occasionally inaccurate economic forecasts was not the same as being fined and investigated by the National Crime Agency. There has been no response yet. These are difficult issues and, in the hurly-burly of a political debate, no one will always get it right. Bruce made a great start in her first week acting on behalf of the audience. The presenter of Question Time needs to speak for the audience, not play to it; a journalist, not a celebrity. Ofcom\u2019s own research suggests that the BBC gets it right most of the time, with high scores for trust and accuracy. The BBC could argue that the \u201cordinary people\u201d who watch the show, rather than sad journalists who like to comment, don\u2019t care about political spats and Twitter apoplexy. But those pesky opinion polls show that they do care about the BBC, as should we all.",

      "bodyText": "Most tennis players dream of winning a grand slam title, very few get anywhere close. At the age of 21, Naomi Osaka has two grand slam titles and when she wakes up on Monday morning, she will find No 1 next to her name on the world ranking list. It does not get much better than this. Yet it could do, quickly. Osaka\u2019s 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Petra Kvitova in an outstanding final at the Australian Open not only sealed her place at the top of the game but also proved her win at the US Open was no flash in the pan. Though Serena Williams, whom she beat in New York, will continue to chase the two grand slam titles she needs to break the all-time record of 24, Osaka is well-placed to usurp her as the biggest player in the sport. Consider the facts. Osaka is the first woman to win consecutive grand slam titles since Williams in 2015. She is the first woman to follow her maiden grand slam title by winning the next one since Jennifer Capriati in 2001. Going into 2018, she had not won a title and was ranked 72. In the space of 10 months she has won three big tournaments, Indian Wells, the US Open and the Australian Open. Consistent, powerful, a superb athlete and with an ability to find inner calm under pressure, she has everything required to stay at the top. However, just a couple of hours after her victory here Osaka said she felt her success had been a long time coming. \u201cIn my mind, I would have liked to win this tournament last year, and I still have nightmares about a forehand I hit against [Simona] Halep when I had break point and I hit it out,\u201d she said. \u201cShe went to the final after I lost to her. In the French Open, I played against [Madison] Keys and she went to the semis. I feel like every match I play, I have chances, so it always haunts me. If you are talking about if I thought I would win another grand slam before the US Open, I think possibly Wimbledon, I would have thought I had a chance, but then [Angelique] Kerber destroyed me.

Osaka had already signed four sponsorship deals since the US Open and, with her stock rising even more, the Japanese market alone will be hugely lucrative. Osaka will fly back to Florida this week where she can catch up with her family, including her sister Mari, also a tennis player. The French Open and Wimbledon will soon be on the agenda, though, and Osaka feels she can excel on any surface. \u201cI have always felt like I could maybe be an all-court player,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time I played all the grand slams, I got to the third round in all of them.

      "body": "<p>The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the attempted rape and sexual assault charges against her predecessor Alex Salmond will have no impact on her drive for independence.</p> <p>Sturgeon told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One that the case for independence was \u201cbigger than any one man\u201d and confirmed she would set out her plans for a second independence referendum in the coming weeks.</p> <p>She was being interviewed in the wake of the disclosure that Salmond, 64, had been arrested and charged last week on nine counts of sexual assault, two of attempted rape, two charges of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace.</p> <p>Salmond, a former first minister and Scottish National party leader, vociferously denied wrongdoing. He insisted after his appearance at Edinburgh sheriff court on Thursday that he was innocent of the 14 charges against him.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters outside court, Salmond said: \u201cLet me say from the outset, I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever. [I] refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court.\u201d</p> <p>It emerged on Saturday that Salmond will continue hosting his weekly politics chatshow for the Kremlin-funded Russian broadcaster RT, despite the charges and his court appearance.</p> <p>RT, an English-language television and online news channel based in London, said in a brief statement on Saturday that the chatshow would remain on air \u201cat this time\u201d.</p> <p>Interviewed by Marr, Sturgeon said last week\u2019s developments \u201cwere a shock to absolutely everyone, there is no denying that\u201d. She added that she could not comment any further on the case.</p> <p>Asked whether the charges against Salmond would damage the SNP or affect her quest for independence, Sturgeon said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it has an impact on the future political and constitutional direction of Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cThe case for independence is bigger than any one man. It\u2019s bigger than any one woman. It\u2019s not about individual personalities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about what is best for the country now and in the longer term. It\u2019s about how we put ourselves in the best position to protect our interests and build prosperity and fairness in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon has been due to update the Scottish parliament and voters on her plans for a second independence vote since last autumn but had delayed doing so until the outcome of the Brexit negotiations became clear.</p> <p>Her original attempt to use Brexit as the justification for a second referendum backfired after the SNP lost 21 of its 56 Westminster seats in the 2017 snap general election.</p> <p>Popular support for independence has slightly increased in recent months amid the turmoil over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy but opinion polls show support for leaving the UK is still six to 10 points behind remain, excluding the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d.</p> <p>RT said on Saturday it was not able to comment on the court appearance. It added: \u201cThis matter does not concern anything related to the Alex Salmond Show or RT, and The Alex Salmond Show will continue on air as usual at this time.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to note, irrespective of the findings on this matter in court, that we believe firmly in the principles of a fair trial, including both the right to justice for victims and the presumption of innocence, and that we utterly condemn sexual misconduct in any form.\u201d</p> <p>The chatshow is made for RT by Slainte Media, which is jointly owned and produced by Salmond and the former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who like Salmond, lost her seat in the 2017 snap general election.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Ahmed-Sheikh was fined \u00a33,000 and found guilty of professional misconduct by the Scottish Solicitors\u2019 Discipline Tribunal for mishandling a trust fund set up at Hamilton Burns, the former legal firm she helped run.</p> <p>The tribunal said she and her business partner, had shown disregard for the rules by failing to keep proper accounts.The pair insisted they had made no personal profit or been dishonest. The Scottish Solicitors\u2019 Discipline Tribunal accepted that the pair\u2019s actions had been \u201cgenuine but erroneous\u201d, and it was agreed that there was no suggestion of dishonesty or personal benefit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the attempted rape and sexual assault charges against her predecessor Alex Salmond will have no impact on her drive for independence. Sturgeon told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One that the case for independence was \u201cbigger than any one man\u201d and confirmed she would set out her plans for a second independence referendum in the coming weeks. She was being interviewed in the wake of the disclosure that Salmond, 64, had been arrested and charged last week on nine counts of sexual assault, two of attempted rape, two charges of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace. Salmond, a former first minister and Scottish National party leader, vociferously denied wrongdoing. He insisted after his appearance at Edinburgh sheriff court on Thursday that he was innocent of the 14 charges against him. Speaking to reporters outside court, Salmond said: \u201cLet me say from the outset, I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever. [I] refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court.\u201d It emerged on Saturday that Salmond will continue hosting his weekly politics chatshow for the Kremlin-funded Russian broadcaster RT, despite the charges and his court appearance. RT, an English-language television and online news channel based in London, said in a brief statement on Saturday that the chatshow would remain on air \u201cat this time\u201d. Interviewed by Marr, Sturgeon said last week\u2019s developments \u201cwere a shock to absolutely everyone, there is no denying that\u201d. She added that she could not comment any further on the case. Asked whether the charges against Salmond would damage the SNP or affect her quest for independence, Sturgeon said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it has an impact on the future political and constitutional direction of Scotland. \u201cThe case for independence is bigger than any one man. It\u2019s bigger than any one woman. It\u2019s not about individual personalities. \u201cIt\u2019s about what is best for the country now and in the longer term. It\u2019s about how we put ourselves in the best position to protect our interests and build prosperity and fairness in Scotland.\u201d Sturgeon has been due to update the Scottish parliament and voters on her plans for a second independence vote since last autumn but had delayed doing so until the outcome of the Brexit negotiations became clear. Her original attempt to use Brexit as the justification for a second referendum backfired after the SNP lost 21 of its 56 Westminster seats in the 2017 snap general election. Popular support for independence has slightly increased in recent months amid the turmoil over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy but opinion polls show support for leaving the UK is still six to 10 points behind remain, excluding the \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d. RT said on Saturday it was not able to comment on the court appearance. It added: \u201cThis matter does not concern anything related to the Alex Salmond Show or RT, and The Alex Salmond Show will continue on air as usual at this time. \u201cIt is important to note, irrespective of the findings on this matter in court, that we believe firmly in the principles of a fair trial, including both the right to justice for victims and the presumption of innocence, and that we utterly condemn sexual misconduct in any form.\u201d The chatshow is made for RT by Slainte Media, which is jointly owned and produced by Salmond and the former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who like Salmond, lost her seat in the 2017 snap general election. Earlier this month, Ahmed-Sheikh was fined \u00a33,000 and found guilty of professional misconduct by the Scottish Solicitors\u2019 Discipline Tribunal for mishandling a trust fund set up at Hamilton Burns, the former legal firm she helped run. The tribunal said she and her business partner, had shown disregard for the rules by failing to keep proper accounts.The pair insisted they had made no personal profit or been dishonest. The Scottish Solicitors\u2019 Discipline Tribunal accepted that the pair\u2019s actions had been \u201cgenuine but erroneous\u201d, and it was agreed that there was no suggestion of dishonesty or personal benefit.",

No one, however, should take black women\u2019s support for Harris for granted.</p> <p>Like many people of color and progressives, Harris\u2019s previous record gives me serious pause. Any candidate for office who has been a prosecutor in a racially biased criminal justice system must account for the ways in which she minimized that system\u2019s harm or perpetuated its failures. At various points throughout her career, Harris has supported policies that have contributed to a broken criminal justice system that harms people of color at disproportionate and alarming rates.</p> <p>As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris blocked<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ff-federal-judges-order-state-to-release-more-prisoners-20141114-story.html\"> the release of non-violent offenders on the premise that they may lower the prison labor pool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uclalawreview.org/an-interrogation-and-response-to-the-predominant-framing-of-truancy-2/\">threatened to enforce a one-year prison </a>sentence for parents whose children were truant. Policies like these disproportionately harm low-income families. Truancy policies that impose jail sentences are often coupled with<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121186/truancy-laws-unfairly-attack-poor-children-and-parents\"> court fees of $300</a> an unexcused absence.</p> <p>The court fees, (and possible loss of employment due to incarceration) could prove dire for families already living below the poverty line. Equally important, there is no <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121186/truancy-laws-unfairly-attack-poor-children-and-parents\">empirical evidence</a> that incarcerating parents for truancy is an effective strategy for increasing school attendance. There is however, <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/29113012/Truancy-report4.pdf\">evidence</a> that while truancy is an issue faced in many schools in America, families most affected by harsh enforcements are those with low incomes and families of color.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As many Democratic candidates have proven to us in the past, when the price of our loyalty is that low, we get very little in return</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, the abuse of power and other forms of prosecutorial misconduct is a <a href=\"http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/epidemic_of_brady_violations_decried_in_kozinski_opinion\">glaring problem</a> in the criminal justice system. Yet Harris <a href=\"https://observer.com/2015/03/california-prosecutor-falsifies-transcript-of-confession/\">defended</a> a Kern county prosecutor who committed \u201coutrageous government misconduct\u201d by reportedly falsifying the confession of a defendant who was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/kamala-harris-truths-we-hold-review/579430/\">later used to threaten a life sentence</a>\u201d.</p> <p>These are not facts that can be ignored, despite the enthusiasm around Harris, and even an innate impulse I feel to protect her. Black female candidates are poorly represented in our politics. I am worried about the inevitable sexist and racist attacks Harris will probably endure during this campaign. Simply existing as a black woman ensures that Harris is constantly under siege. America is both painfully unforgiving of our mistakes and fully committed to profiting from our success. It is a challenging intersection to navigate, and even the slightest mistake can prove fatal.</p> <p>Still: black women, people of color and progressives supporting Harris need to ask tough questions about this record. This may feel like unnecessary scrutiny of an already vulnerable candidate. Yet, supporting her without at least inquiring about her decisions as a prosecutor would be tantamount to pledging our allegiance to symbolism. As many Democratic candidates have proven to us in the past, when the price of our loyalty is that low, we get very little in return. And despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">thinly veiled </a>assumptions that black people are politically apathetic, our collective voting power is undeniable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/democratic-2020-president-candidates-wall-street\">These 2020 hopefuls are courting Wall Street.

Relying on our vote without earning it and developing a strong plan to address<a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/\"> systemic inequality</a> is no longer enough.</p> <p>Black women and people of color cannot afford to equate seeking accountability and strong policies with disloyalty. In fact, loyalty to our community requires us to demand the most from candidates seeking the highest office in the country. It is our duty to help them reckon with the ways they may have harmed us in the past. And it is our responsibility to demand a clear plan on how they will fight for us in the future. We deserve nothing less.</p> <p>Despite obvious concerns, I remain hopeful about Harris. But more importantly, I am committed to helping ensure my community is no longer courted during election season and disregarded once the votes are cast.

No one, however, should take black women\u2019s support for Harris for granted. Like many people of color and progressives, Harris\u2019s previous record gives me serious pause. Any candidate for office who has been a prosecutor in a racially biased criminal justice system must account for the ways in which she minimized that system\u2019s harm or perpetuated its failures. At various points throughout her career, Harris has supported policies that have contributed to a broken criminal justice system that harms people of color at disproportionate and alarming rates. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris blocked the release of non-violent offenders on the premise that they may lower the prison labor pool and threatened to enforce a one-year prison sentence for parents whose children were truant. Policies like these disproportionately harm low-income families. Truancy policies that impose jail sentences are often coupled with court fees of $300 an unexcused absence. The court fees, (and possible loss of employment due to incarceration) could prove dire for families already living below the poverty line. Equally important, there is no empirical evidence that incarcerating parents for truancy is an effective strategy for increasing school attendance. There is however, evidence that while truancy is an issue faced in many schools in America, families most affected by harsh enforcements are those with low incomes and families of color. Furthermore, the abuse of power and other forms of prosecutorial misconduct is a glaring problem in the criminal justice system. Yet Harris defended a Kern county prosecutor who committed \u201coutrageous government misconduct\u201d by reportedly falsifying the confession of a defendant who was \u201clater used to threaten a life sentence\u201d. These are not facts that can be ignored, despite the enthusiasm around Harris, and even an innate impulse I feel to protect her. Black female candidates are poorly represented in our politics. I am worried about the inevitable sexist and racist attacks Harris will probably endure during this campaign. Simply existing as a black woman ensures that Harris is constantly under siege. America is both painfully unforgiving of our mistakes and fully committed to profiting from our success. It is a challenging intersection to navigate, and even the slightest mistake can prove fatal. Still: black women, people of color and progressives supporting Harris need to ask tough questions about this record. This may feel like unnecessary scrutiny of an already vulnerable candidate. Yet, supporting her without at least inquiring about her decisions as a prosecutor would be tantamount to pledging our allegiance to symbolism. As many Democratic candidates have proven to us in the past, when the price of our loyalty is that low, we get very little in return. And despite thinly veiled assumptions that black people are politically apathetic, our collective voting power is undeniable. The power of black people\u2019s organizing, voices and votes have delivered historical elections for this country. We have used strategic grassroots organizing and voting to turn red states blue, as we did by unseating the Republican incumbent Ray Moore in Alabama. The brilliant campaign ran by Stacey Abrams was another example of the ways in which we can shake the table and serve as the impetus for political progress. This power is recognized by politicians, but recognition is no longer enough. Relying on our vote without earning it and developing a strong plan to address systemic inequality is no longer enough. Black women and people of color cannot afford to equate seeking accountability and strong policies with disloyalty. In fact, loyalty to our community requires us to demand the most from candidates seeking the highest office in the country. It is our duty to help them reckon with the ways they may have harmed us in the past. And it is our responsibility to demand a clear plan on how they will fight for us in the future. We deserve nothing less. Despite obvious concerns, I remain hopeful about Harris. But more importantly, I am committed to helping ensure my community is no longer courted during election season and disregarded once the votes are cast. And that means challenging candidates I might otherwise want to protect \u2013 including Kamala Harris.

While Marwand wonders if the injury is payback for how he once threw stones at Budabash during a previous visit six years earlier, there\u2019s a sense, too, that the episode has pricked his worries about being an outsider in his ancestral homeland, where the language wrongfoots him and the diet gives him diarrhoea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At one point, Marwand\u2019s father encourages his son to forget about US \u201cTV and movies\u201d and instead tell \u201cour stories\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Organising the novel around the hunt for Budabash is a cute way to signal that it\u2019s a shaggy dog story. Dawood falls ill and has to give up the search; Gul goes missing in the village\u2019s maze of compounds.

But you suspect that finding crafty ways to hold his reader\u2019s hand isn\u2019t a job Kochai really relishes.

When Marwand tells us he\u2019s forgotten \u201csimple things\u201d in Pashto \u2013 \u201clike how a maamaa is your mom\u2019s brother and a kaakaa is your dad\u2019s\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a neat way to handle the kind of exposition such a project requires. But you suspect that finding crafty ways to hold his reader\u2019s hand isn\u2019t a job Kochai really relishes. Having got our attention, he powerfully reminds us that the onus to communicate lies with us, too, as Watak\u2019s story is finally told over six pages near the end \u2013 in untranslated Pashto. \u2022 99 Nights in Logar by Jamil Jan Kochai is published by Bloomsbury Circus (\u00a316.99).

The cuts are part of a plan to slash \u00a31.5bn from Tesco\u2019s cost base as chief executive Dave Lewis tries to rebuild profits which have never recovered from the 2014 accounting scandal. If the cuts go ahead fishmonger, butcher and baker jobs at the store giant could be at risk, along with counter staff. The report suggested some counters would close while others would have opening hours cut. The plans would affect most of Tesco\u2019s 732 largest stores, it said. The Guardian understands Tesco is also considering stripping out yet another layer of senior staff from its store management as part of its cost-saving plan. Since Lewis took over in 2014 there have been successive rounds of job cuts. This time last year 1,700 employees were affected when the retailer stripped out a layer of middle management. It also closed its Cardiff call centre with a loss of 1,100 jobs. With more than 300,000 UK employees and more than 3,400 stores, Tesco is the UK\u2019s biggest private sector employer but its business model is under attack from the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Bryan Roberts, global insights director at research firm TCC Global, said getting rid of extras such as deli counters would \u201calienate\u201d some shoppers and remove a key point of difference with the discounters. \u201cThese counters don\u2019t contribute a lot to sales but the shoppers who do use them typically spend more and are more loyal,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the aura of being a fresh food grocer and you lose something if you take them away.\u201d Last year Tesco launched new discount chain Jack\u2019s in a bid to stem the flow of shoppers to cheaper rivals but sales figures for the key Christmas period revealed a sea change in shopping habits has taken place in the UK with two-thirds of households heading to Aldi or Lidl for some festive fare. Tesco could also lose its market leadership this year if the competition watchdog approves Sainsbury\u2019s plan to buy Asda. Tesco said: \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to run our business more simply and efficiently. Whenever we make changes in our business, colleagues are always the first to know.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In book publishing, it seems, they still do fairytales. Really not very long ago, Angie Thomas was a secretary to a bishop at a megachurch in Jackson, Mississippi. At nights \u2013 and during quiet periods in the day, she furtively admits \u2013 she worked on a young adult novel inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. She had previously written a children\u2019s book, but hadn\u2019t had any interest from agents. \u201cYeah, I had more than 150 rejections for that one,\u201d says Thomas matter-of-factly. Thomas\u2019s break came when she cold-contacted a literary agent who was doing a Twitter Q&amp;A. The story speeds up now: the novel became <em>The Hate U Give </em>(<em>THUG</em>), a YA sensation about a 16-year-old girl called Starr who witnesses her friend Khalil being shot by the police and turns to activism. <em>THUG</em>, published in early 2017, went straight into the bestseller chart in the US and stayed there for a year. It was a hit here too, and named overall winner of the 2018 Waterstones children\u2019s book prize. It has now sold more than 2m copies globally. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/28/the-hate-u-give-review-articulate-mainstream-drama-about-america-racial-strife\" title=\"\">a film adaptation was released,</a> which has been a critical and commercial success.</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s definitely surreal,\u201d says the 31-year-old Thomas, on the phone from Jackson. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. It does feel like a dream I\u2019m going to wake up from.\u201d Her agent now is one of the 150-plus who turned down her first book. \u201cSo I hold that over his head,\u201d she says, and giggles.</p> <p>Now Thomas is back with a follow-up, <em>On </em><em>the Come Up</em>. Like <em>THUG</em>, it is set in Garden Heights, a fictional inner-city neighbourhood that is deprived and predominantly black. But while her debut was more issue-led, <em>On </em><em>the Come Up </em>is perhaps more personal to Thomas. The book\u2019s protagonist, 16-year-old Bri, is obsessed with hip-hop \u2013 as Thomas herself is \u2013 and wants to make it as a rapper. When Bri\u2019s mother loses her job (as a secretary at a church, as it happens), and the family is faced with running out of food and then eviction, Bri has to fast-track her ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started the book, I thought about what was the most traumatic thing in my life,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cAnd fortunately for me, it wasn\u2019t losing a friend like Starr did, but unfortunately it was that experience of my mom losing her job and my family going into that crisis mode.\u201d Thomas was a teenager at the time, being home-schooled because she was experiencing mental health problems brought on by bullying. Her mother, who had been a teacher, oversaw Angie\u2019s education and looked after her own sick mother. \u201cYeah, it was a challenge,\u201d Thomas goes on. \u201cWe were living off the benefits my grandmother received and, even with that, there were days when we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have enough food. So this book was definitely from my own experience.\u201d</p> <p>Starr and Bri are both strong, independent characters, but they are also very different. \u201cI compare Bri and Starr to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/07/tupac-notorious-big-rivalry-endures\" title=\"\">Biggie and Tupac</a>,\u201d laughs Thomas. \u201cWithout the beef! Tupac was very community-orientated, and that\u2019s how Starr is. But Bri, similar to Biggie, she\u2019s about making it, she\u2019s about seeing her dreams come to life. She\u2019s about trying to save her family, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. So that\u2019s where they\u2019re different, but they\u2019re similar in the fact that they are both powerful young women who know they have voices, and they both understand how they can use those voices to affect an entire generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6530f789407824b7b2c726889a11c0b27d3375a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6530f789407824b7b2c726889a11c0b27d3375a5/0_808_4529_4528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Angie Thomas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Angie Thomas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imani Khayyam/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas, meanwhile, has become a role model in her own right. The campaign <a href=\"https://diversebooks.org/\" title=\"\">We Need Diverse Books</a> was started after a US study showed that, of the 3,200 children\u2019s books published in 2013, only 93 featured black people as the main character. The problem was further highlighted when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/09/marley-dias-1000-black-girl-books-hits-target-with-outpouring-of-donations\" title=\"\">American schoolgirl Marley Dias</a> attempted to find 1,000 books where the protagonist was a black girl and failed. \u201cWhen a 12-year-old kid calls you out, you need to change,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cAnd I can see it slowly changing. There\u2019s been a shift within the past few months where more than half of the books on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for young adults were by authors of colour featuring main characters of colour, and that\u2019s huge.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas certainly knows what it\u2019s like to look at the publishing industry and find its walls impenetrable. \u201cRejection is always hard, and a lot of rejection is really hard,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what helped me was the community of unpublished authors out there on the internet, so you can connect and you can weep and mourn together. And I always had to remind myself that it only takes one yes to change everything. That\u2019s what I tell aspiring writers now. I know writers who had 500 rejections, and more than that \u2013 but you just have to keep going and hope that you do get that one yes.\u201d</p> <h2>Questions from famous fans</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b00f9896da996d30b954c94814dcad8aca505052\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00f9896da996d30b954c94814dcad8aca505052/239_490_1711_2139/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Cottrell Boyce\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Frank Cottrell-Boyce</strong></h2> <p><strong>Screenwriter and novelist</strong></p> <p><strong>A story for you \u2013 I took </strong><em><strong>THUG</strong></em><strong> with me on a long journey. Was saving the last chapter as a treat. The woman opposite me \u2013 as old as me, no way a </strong><strong>young </strong><strong>adult! \u2013 kept eyeing my copy, so I offered it to her while I got on with my work. When we arrived, she looked pleadingly at me. I said: \u201cOK, you can keep it. I\u2019ll get another copy.\u201d She looked so relieved. She literally could not bring herself to put it down. I think one reason it has appealed to so many people is that despite its darkness, it\u2019s a very positive book, full of understanding. We don\u2019t do religion in the UK, but I wondered if your faith had played a part in that?</strong><br><strong>Angie Thomas </strong>First of all, that is a beautiful story. It always amazes me when I hear not just of people who connected with the book but people who are willing to share their own copy, because as a reader, I think I\u2019d be too selfish. So thank you for being better than me! But yes, my faith is a huge part of who I am in every single thing that I do. It literally defines me. I tell people: \u201cI love Jesus, but I cuss; thankfully he still loves me.\u201d And often, as a Christian, I find myself around people who are like, \u201cWell, why would you want to address something like racism?\u201d But the fact is, especially here in America, Sunday is the most segregated day of the week. And I think it\u2019s important for someone like me to speak up on this and to take a stand and hopefully to shed some light on the darkness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"04c92e178c37037ea5e927b419a85db294b19743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04c92e178c37037ea5e927b419a85db294b19743/379_0_1334_1666/801.jpg\" alt=\"Yomi Adegoke.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Yomi Adegok</strong><strong>e</strong></h2> <p><strong>Co-author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/black-girl-woman-bible-elizabeth-uviebinene-yomi-adegoke-slay-your-lane\" title=\"\">Slay in </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/black-girl-woman-bible-elizabeth-uviebinene-yomi-adegoke-slay-your-lane\" title=\"\">Your Lane: </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/black-girl-woman-bible-elizabeth-uviebinene-yomi-adegoke-slay-your-lane\" title=\"\">The Black Girl Bible</a></strong></p> <p><em><strong>On </strong></em><em><strong>the Come Up</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>THUG</strong></em><strong> take place in the same fictional neighbourhood of </strong><strong>Garden Heights</strong><strong>.

Black girls are already stereotyped so much and put into boxes so much, I never wanted anyone to assume that every single young lady in Garden Heights is like Starr or even like [her half-sister] Kenya. So now we have someone like Bri who is different from both of them. She\u2019s her own person. She has her own personality. She has her own struggle.</p> <p>Someone recently asked me, did I think that Starr and Bri would get along? I think they would have their little clashes every now and then, but they would get along because both of them care deeply about others, and about their families and their community, and they can find common ground on that. It\u2019s just they have different approaches to address the things that affect them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ca32c695fb15220e4595f8cf4cdd3613002d5dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca32c695fb15220e4595f8cf4cdd3613002d5dc2/401_110_728_910/400.jpg\" alt=\"Nikesh Shukla\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Nikesh Shukla</strong></h2> <p><strong>Author of most recently, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-who-wrote-destiny-9781786492807.html\">The One Who Wrote Destiny</a>, and co-editor of forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9780349700359\">The Good Immigrant USA</a></strong><br></p> <p><strong>Give us your top five rappers and why (I think we can </strong><strong>assume Tupac is </strong><strong>No 1)\u2026</strong><br>I should have known he\u2019d ask that question!

She\u2019s one of the best rappers of all time, and not enough people say that. Biggie for sure. As a Tupac fan, I\u2019m sure people will be like, \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d But you have to give respect where it\u2019s due: Biggie had the most amazing use of wordplay and his flow was iconic. Then I have to say Kendrick Lamar. He\u2019s new and everything, but I have to throw him in because he continues to be himself in an industry that often promotes being someone you\u2019re not. And my fifth one, it\u2019s either Jay-Z or Andr\u00e9 3000, but I\u2019m going to go with Andr\u00e9 3000. As a southerner, Outkast was the group for me, and it was always amazing to see some rappers from the south who not only rapped well but they brought a lot of respect to us as a region when it comes to hip-hop. Usually with hip-hop it was always east coast versus west coast and the south was forgotten, but Outkast, they gave us a voice. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9f56ad39b0076da1e35c4e3f5d4203c7ad4f737a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f56ad39b0076da1e35c4e3f5d4203c7ad4f737a/0_704_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kit de Waal.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Kit de Waal</strong></h2> <p><strong>Author of My Name Is Leon and the editor of forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/10/kit-de-waal-where-are-all-the-working-class-writers-\" title=\"\">Common People: An Anthology of Working Class Writers</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Where do you see literature, particularly fiction, fitting in to acts of resistance?</strong><br>If nothing else, fiction has empowered a lot of people in the act of resistance. <em>The Hate U Give</em>, I know, has birthed several young activists and I\u2019m so happy with that, I\u2019m so proud these young people have decided to speak up and speak out on things that concern them. There was one young lady in Texas, it started out with her deciding she was going to speak up for the book when it was <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-hate-u-give-katy-texas-school-district-ban.html\" title=\"\">challenged by the school district</a>. And that led to her becoming an activist in her own right in other areas. So I think books can empower.</p> <p>Rudine Sims Bishop [the author and educator] says that books are either mirrors, windows or sliding-glass doors, and that\u2019s important in the act of resistance. You need that mirror to see yourself, to know what you can be and know what you are. And then you need that window to see into someone else\u2019s life so you can understand what\u2019s happening around you in the world that you may not notice at first glance. And you need the sliding-glass door so that you can step into someone else\u2019s life and walk in with some empathy and use that empathy to make yourself heard. So yeah, I think books play a huge role in resistance. They play a huge role in opening people\u2019s eyes and they\u2019re a form of activism in their own right, in the fact that they do empower people and show others the lives of people who may not be like themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1fce2b6aebebf26916902c067fc50dd18e844100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fce2b6aebebf26916902c067fc50dd18e844100/2010_107_1717_2147/800.jpg\" alt=\"Patrice Lawrence.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Patrice Lawrence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Award-winning British YA author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/orangeboy.html\" title=\"\">Orangeboy</a></strong></p> <p><strong>I have always known that there are black Americans, because US popular culture \u2013 from TV comedies and detective series to pop and hip-hop \u2013 have a prominent place in UK culture. Unfortunately, black British people rarely feature in the UK\u2019s cultural exports to the US. How do black Americans perceive their UK counterparts, and how can us UK lot boost our profile in the States?</strong><br>First of all, I love Patrice. And it\u2019s interesting, because when I first came to the UK for my book tour in 2017, I told some of the kids back here in Mississippi that I was going, and they were like, \u201cWait, are there black people over there?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cGosh! Black people are everywhere!\u201d But the thing is, so often we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not told about black people beyond America and Africa. And Americans in general, we tend to be very self-absorbed and don\u2019t hear about other communities beyond our own. So it\u2019s definitely something that we fail to do.</p> <p>And, as for black British people to be more visible here in the States, I wish I had the answer. I would say one big thing I hope would happen though is that black British people would become more visible there in the UK. Cos I was talking to some black kids while I was there and they told me that they studied black history of America more than they\u2019ve studied black history of the UK. And there is black history in the UK. So I think that should be changed, if nothing else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"18aa3f8bbb127228d03849168d483785e9f6163e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18aa3f8bbb127228d03849168d483785e9f6163e/0_480_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Danez Smith.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Danez Smith</strong></h2> <p><strong>Poet whose most recent collection is <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/don-t-call-us-dead.html\">Don\u2019t Call Us Dead: Poems</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Is there such a thing as loving your characters for you?

I love Khalil in <em>The Hate U Give</em> and it was heartbreaking for me to do what I do to him. So when he lost his life the way that he did, it breaks my heart just as much as it breaks my readers\u2019 hearts. But the intention was that, even though it breaks their heart, maybe then they start thinking about the real-life Khalils, with that same love and empathy and sympathy.

Like slang: do I use slang every now and then? Absolutely. Will I overwhelm my reader with it and overwhelm my dialogue with it? No, absolutely not, because slang terms become outdated quickly, and also that\u2019s not how these kids speak. They are not overusing it. So for me, an authentic voice is all about listening to the people around me, listening to the world and listening to language patterns and seeing how people actually talk. And when I write my dialogue I usually say it out loud so I can see if it sounds OK. I find a lot of historic novels that portray the way black people spoke back in the day, they did it over-the-top and they had us sounding very ignorant. And why? Because they had no respect for us as people. So as a writer, my goal is to always have respect for whoever it is that I\u2019m writing about or writing for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00fb7cdb7c559f204d3ed1245c07f022b37a5f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00fb7cdb7c559f204d3ed1245c07f022b37a5f06/1205_865_1437_1796/800.jpg\" alt=\"Juno Dawson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Juno Dawson</strong></h2> <p><strong>Author of YA novel </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/clean-559041.html\">Clean</a></strong></em></p> <p><strong>You spent a lot of time on Twitter fielding questions about the casting of the film adaptation of The Hate U Give.

What is your writing process?</strong><br><strong>Alomohbitters</strong><br>My eureka moment came while I was writing soap-opera fan fiction! There was this soap opera here in the States called <em>Passions</em> and it was one of the most vacuous to ever exist; they had a witch on there and all these things. But the characters on that show were so rich and there was so much to be explored with them that, as a teenager, I decided to write fan fiction for them and put it up online. So my eureka moment came when I had readers say: \u201cWow, you\u2019re really good at this\u201d or: \u201cGirl, I rushed home when I saw that you had put up another chapter, I had to come home and read it.\u201d That really pushed me and I was like: \u201cWow, well, maybe this is something I can do with my own characters. Maybe I can create these worlds myself, that belong to me.\u201d</p> <p>As for my process, I always try at least to write an outline chart. I don\u2019t always stick with the chart 100%, but it\u2019s at least a road map and if I make a couple of detours here and there that\u2019s OK. I took this from JK Rowling, actually. She <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/j-k-rowling-plotted-harry-potter-with-a-hand-drawn-spreadsheet.html\" title=\"\">did one for the fifth Harry Potter book</a> and put it online: at the top of the chart, she had every character or subplot listed and then on the side she would have the different chapter numbers and that\u2019s how she could keep up with what was happening in every single chapter. So that\u2019s what I do for my books now. I do a chart. If it works for her, and she\u2019s sold all those books, maybe it can work for me!</p> <p><strong>NWA or Wu-Tang?</strong><br><strong>Paul Taylor, Dorset</strong><br>Ohhhh, that\u2019s hard for me to answer that. Cos on the one hand, with NWA, they changed hip-hop as you know it \u2013 you\u2019ve got an entire genre of hip-hop and, really, a coast in hip\u2011hop culture because of NWA. They helped bring west coast hip-hop to popularity. They gave us gangsta rap, but then on the other hand\u2026 they gave us gangsta rap. They gave us music that at times demeaned women, they gave us music that at times was destructive for the community when people took it the wrong way or used it a certain way. So it\u2019s hard for me to say NWA. I do appreciate anything that they did, but I have to go with Wu-Tang.</p> <p><strong>Do you see yourself as a political writer or a writer who happens to be political? </strong><strong>How do you think Trump\u2019s presidency is changing America and what mark do you think it will leave, especially on literature, when he goes?</strong><br><strong>Gaverne Bennett, London</strong><br>These days, it\u2019s hard to say because politics is such a huge part of my life anyway. But I would say that I\u2019m a writer who is concerned about politics. I would never just say that I only write about social justice issues, because I won\u2019t. It\u2019s funny, because I tell people: \u201cMississippi is known for two things: writing and racism.\u201d And I happen to be a writer who writes about racism.</p> <p>For the second part, if nothing else right now, Trump has stained America. He has taken us out of a leadership position in the world. Nobody will listen to us now as a leader or as a beacon of hope for anything because of him and because of his actions and because of the decisions he makes. But I will say, I\u2019m more hopeful now than I was before, because I\u2019m seeing more people who are concerned about politics. We\u2019re going to come away from this knowing that we have the ability to change things and that ultimately our government answers to us. So I hope that by the end, when he\u2019s out of office, that the world will know that we Americans, the majority of us, don\u2019t stand for what he stands for. So definitely, please don\u2019t give up on us.</p> <p><strong>Learning to read and write is \u201cfreedom\u201d only if one can find a publisher with contacts for publicity. </strong><strong>Eudora Welty</strong><strong>, whose writings I adore, got hers through the New Deal programmes. How did you find yours?</strong><br><strong>Shrimpandgrits</strong><br>Wow, that\u2019s awesome that he or she loves Eudora. My college that I attended is actually across the street from her house, so I would see that every single day. But, for me, my publishing journey actually started with Twitter, of all things. When I was writing <em>The Hate U Give</em>, I was honestly not sure if it was something that would even be published, because if you said Black Lives Matter to 30 different people you may get 30 different responses. But also because publishing, young-adult publishing was so white, I wasn\u2019t used to seeing books about black girls and I definitely wasn\u2019t seeing books about black girls in situations like this.</p> <p>So a literary agency held a question-and-answer session on Twitter and I went on and I asked a question. I\u2019m paraphrasing but basically I asked: \u201cIs a book that addresses an issue like this even something that can be published?\u201d And a literary agent by the name of Brooks Sherman responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think any topic is off limits for young adult readership. It\u2019s just a matter of how you address it.\u201d And I was like: \u201cWell, I hope I address it well.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019d actually like to read it if that\u2019s OK.\u201d So I sent it to him and a few months later he signed me as a client. A few months after that, he submitted it to publishers and 13 US publishers fought for the rights to the book. So Twitter is good for something; if nothing else, it found me an agent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MM8OkVT0hw?start=5&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=5\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw&amp;t=5s\">Watch a trailer for the film adaptation of The Hate U Give.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Do you think the world should focus so much on the cultural problems of the US</strong><strong>, when really it\u2019s just 3% of the population?</strong><br><strong>GreenlandGyr</strong><strong>falcon</strong><br>No, I don\u2019t think that they should. That\u2019s a great point. We should not be the centre of attention all the time.

It doesn\u2019t make sense that you guys have to be subjected to our news maybe sometimes more than your own. So I am so sorry on behalf of America. I am so sorry that our stuff takes up so much air space. I am so sorry that we take up so many headlines.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give to your younger self?</strong><br><strong>Molly Reed, aged 15, Barnes, London</strong><br>I would tell my younger self to be yourself no matter where you are. In a few years, you\u2019re going to be entering university and you are going to ask questions if you\u2019re being your authentic self because you\u2019re often made to feel you\u2019re either too much or not enough. But I promise you, you are enough. You\u2019re enough for everywhere you go, for whatever you do. Always know that. And then I would tell my younger self, my 15-year-old self specifically, if you want to write, write for yourself. Whatever it is that you want to do, do it for yourself. Don\u2019t do it for the accolades, do it because it\u2019s something you love. And then I would tell my 15-year-old self: it\u2019s going to be OK. There are days where you wonder if that\u2019s true, how you\u2019re going to survive all of this stuff. You wonder, will you make it?

      "bodyText": "In book publishing, it seems, they still do fairytales. Really not very long ago, Angie Thomas was a secretary to a bishop at a megachurch in Jackson, Mississippi. At nights \u2013 and during quiet periods in the day, she furtively admits \u2013 she worked on a young adult novel inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. She had previously written a children\u2019s book, but hadn\u2019t had any interest from agents. \u201cYeah, I had more than 150 rejections for that one,\u201d says Thomas matter-of-factly. Thomas\u2019s break came when she cold-contacted a literary agent who was doing a Twitter Q&amp;A. The story speeds up now: the novel became The Hate U Give (THUG), a YA sensation about a 16-year-old girl called Starr who witnesses her friend Khalil being shot by the police and turns to activism. THUG, published in early 2017, went straight into the bestseller chart in the US and stayed there for a year. It was a hit here too, and named overall winner of the 2018 Waterstones children\u2019s book prize. It has now sold more than 2m copies globally. Last year, a film adaptation was released, which has been a critical and commercial success. \u201cOh, it\u2019s definitely surreal,\u201d says the 31-year-old Thomas, on the phone from Jackson. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. It does feel like a dream I\u2019m going to wake up from.\u201d Her agent now is one of the 150-plus who turned down her first book. \u201cSo I hold that over his head,\u201d she says, and giggles. Now Thomas is back with a follow-up, On the Come Up. Like THUG, it is set in Garden Heights, a fictional inner-city neighbourhood that is deprived and predominantly black. But while her debut was more issue-led, On the Come Up is perhaps more personal to Thomas. The book\u2019s protagonist, 16-year-old Bri, is obsessed with hip-hop \u2013 as Thomas herself is \u2013 and wants to make it as a rapper. When Bri\u2019s mother loses her job (as a secretary at a church, as it happens), and the family is faced with running out of food and then eviction, Bri has to fast-track her ambitions. \u201cWhen I started the book, I thought about what was the most traumatic thing in my life,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cAnd fortunately for me, it wasn\u2019t losing a friend like Starr did, but unfortunately it was that experience of my mom losing her job and my family going into that crisis mode.\u201d Thomas was a teenager at the time, being home-schooled because she was experiencing mental health problems brought on by bullying. Her mother, who had been a teacher, oversaw Angie\u2019s education and looked after her own sick mother. \u201cYeah, it was a challenge,\u201d Thomas goes on. \u201cWe were living off the benefits my grandmother received and, even with that, there were days when we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d have enough food. So this book was definitely from my own experience.\u201d Starr and Bri are both strong, independent characters, but they are also very different. \u201cI compare Bri and Starr to Biggie and Tupac,\u201d laughs Thomas. \u201cWithout the beef! Tupac was very community-orientated, and that\u2019s how Starr is. But Bri, similar to Biggie, she\u2019s about making it, she\u2019s about seeing her dreams come to life. She\u2019s about trying to save her family, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. So that\u2019s where they\u2019re different, but they\u2019re similar in the fact that they are both powerful young women who know they have voices, and they both understand how they can use those voices to affect an entire generation.\u201d Thomas, meanwhile, has become a role model in her own right. The campaign We Need Diverse Books was started after a US study showed that, of the 3,200 children\u2019s books published in 2013, only 93 featured black people as the main character. The problem was further highlighted when American schoolgirl Marley Dias attempted to find 1,000 books where the protagonist was a black girl and failed. \u201cWhen a 12-year-old kid calls you out, you need to change,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cAnd I can see it slowly changing. There\u2019s been a shift within the past few months where more than half of the books on the New York Times bestseller list for young adults were by authors of colour featuring main characters of colour, and that\u2019s huge.\u201d Thomas certainly knows what it\u2019s like to look at the publishing industry and find its walls impenetrable. \u201cRejection is always hard, and a lot of rejection is really hard,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what helped me was the community of unpublished authors out there on the internet, so you can connect and you can weep and mourn together. And I always had to remind myself that it only takes one yes to change everything. That\u2019s what I tell aspiring writers now. I know writers who had 500 rejections, and more than that \u2013 but you just have to keep going and hope that you do get that one yes.\u201d Questions from famous fans Frank Cottrell-Boyce Screenwriter and novelist A story for you \u2013 I took THUG with me on a long journey. Was saving the last chapter as a treat. The woman opposite me \u2013 as old as me, no way a young adult! \u2013 kept eyeing my copy, so I offered it to her while I got on with my work. When we arrived, she looked pleadingly at me. I said: \u201cOK, you can keep it. I\u2019ll get another copy.\u201d She looked so relieved. She literally could not bring herself to put it down. I think one reason it has appealed to so many people is that despite its darkness, it\u2019s a very positive book, full of understanding. We don\u2019t do religion in the UK, but I wondered if your faith had played a part in that? Angie Thomas First of all, that is a beautiful story. It always amazes me when I hear not just of people who connected with the book but people who are willing to share their own copy, because as a reader, I think I\u2019d be too selfish. So thank you for being better than me! But yes, my faith is a huge part of who I am in every single thing that I do. It literally defines me. I tell people: \u201cI love Jesus, but I cuss; thankfully he still loves me.\u201d And often, as a Christian, I find myself around people who are like, \u201cWell, why would you want to address something like racism?\u201d But the fact is, especially here in America, Sunday is the most segregated day of the week. And I think it\u2019s important for someone like me to speak up on this and to take a stand and hopefully to shed some light on the darkness. Yomi Adegoke Co-author of Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible On the Come Up and THUG take place in the same fictional neighbourhood of Garden Heights. Did you always intend on telling new stories from the same universe, and is it something you will do again? I knew going in that I wanted to do another story in Garden Heights, at least one more, because it was important for me to show that even in a neighbourhood like that, you could have two young ladies whose lives are completely different, whose personalities are completely different. Black girls are already stereotyped so much and put into boxes so much, I never wanted anyone to assume that every single young lady in Garden Heights is like Starr or even like [her half-sister] Kenya. So now we have someone like Bri who is different from both of them. She\u2019s her own person. She has her own personality. She has her own struggle. Someone recently asked me, did I think that Starr and Bri would get along? I think they would have their little clashes every now and then, but they would get along because both of them care deeply about others, and about their families and their community, and they can find common ground on that. It\u2019s just they have different approaches to address the things that affect them. Nikesh Shukla Author of most recently, The One Who Wrote Destiny, and co-editor of forthcoming The Good Immigrant USA Give us your top five rappers and why (I think we can assume Tupac is No 1)\u2026 I should have known he\u2019d ask that question! But Lauryn Hill is one for sure. We don\u2019t give Lauryn Hill enough props or respect, not just as a woman in hip-hop but just as a talented individual in hip-hop. She\u2019s one of the best rappers of all time, and not enough people say that. Biggie for sure. As a Tupac fan, I\u2019m sure people will be like, \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d But you have to give respect where it\u2019s due: Biggie had the most amazing use of wordplay and his flow was iconic. Then I have to say Kendrick Lamar. He\u2019s new and everything, but I have to throw him in because he continues to be himself in an industry that often promotes being someone you\u2019re not. And my fifth one, it\u2019s either Jay-Z or Andr\u00e9 3000, but I\u2019m going to go with Andr\u00e9 3000. As a southerner, Outkast was the group for me, and it was always amazing to see some rappers from the south who not only rapped well but they brought a lot of respect to us as a region when it comes to hip-hop. Usually with hip-hop it was always east coast versus west coast and the south was forgotten, but Outkast, they gave us a voice. Kit de Waal Author of My Name Is Leon and the editor of forthcoming Common People: An Anthology of Working Class Writers Where do you see literature, particularly fiction, fitting in to acts of resistance? If nothing else, fiction has empowered a lot of people in the act of resistance. The Hate U Give, I know, has birthed several young activists and I\u2019m so happy with that, I\u2019m so proud these young people have decided to speak up and speak out on things that concern them. There was one young lady in Texas, it started out with her deciding she was going to speak up for the book when it was challenged by the school district. And that led to her becoming an activist in her own right in other areas. So I think books can empower. Rudine Sims Bishop [the author and educator] says that books are either mirrors, windows or sliding-glass doors, and that\u2019s important in the act of resistance. You need that mirror to see yourself, to know what you can be and know what you are. And then you need that window to see into someone else\u2019s life so you can understand what\u2019s happening around you in the world that you may not notice at first glance. And you need the sliding-glass door so that you can step into someone else\u2019s life and walk in with some empathy and use that empathy to make yourself heard. So yeah, I think books play a huge role in resistance. They play a huge role in opening people\u2019s eyes and they\u2019re a form of activism in their own right, in the fact that they do empower people and show others the lives of people who may not be like themselves. Patrice Lawrence Award-winning British YA author of Orangeboy I have always known that there are black Americans, because US popular culture \u2013 from TV comedies and detective series to pop and hip-hop \u2013 have a prominent place in UK culture. Unfortunately, black British people rarely feature in the UK\u2019s cultural exports to the US. How do black Americans perceive their UK counterparts, and how can us UK lot boost our profile in the States? First of all, I love Patrice. And it\u2019s interesting, because when I first came to the UK for my book tour in 2017, I told some of the kids back here in Mississippi that I was going, and they were like, \u201cWait, are there black people over there?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cGosh! Black people are everywhere!\u201d But the thing is, so often we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not told about black people beyond America and Africa. And Americans in general, we tend to be very self-absorbed and don\u2019t hear about other communities beyond our own. So it\u2019s definitely something that we fail to do. And, as for black British people to be more visible here in the States, I wish I had the answer. I would say one big thing I hope would happen though is that black British people would become more visible there in the UK. Cos I was talking to some black kids while I was there and they told me that they studied black history of America more than they\u2019ve studied black history of the UK. And there is black history in the UK. So I think that should be changed, if nothing else. Danez Smith Poet whose most recent collection is Don\u2019t Call Us Dead: Poems Is there such a thing as loving your characters for you? If so, how does a love for your characters, or the people they represent, inform how you put them through difficult situations? I feel like the way I answer that is probably either going to make me seem cruel or heartless. I love Khalil in The Hate U Give and it was heartbreaking for me to do what I do to him. So when he lost his life the way that he did, it breaks my heart just as much as it breaks my readers\u2019 hearts. But the intention was that, even though it breaks their heart, maybe then they start thinking about the real-life Khalils, with that same love and empathy and sympathy. So it\u2019s definitely intentional for me to love my characters, even when I put them through stuff. Jason Reynolds YA author whose new book, Ghost, is published 7 February Angie, one of the things writers, specifically writers of colour, often grapple with is the vaporous idea of authenticity, especially when it comes to voice. So, how do you balance writing a voice that feels culturally true without slipping into the clownishly trite? For me, it\u2019s always about balance: being authentic without being over the top. Like slang: do I use slang every now and then? Absolutely. Will I overwhelm my reader with it and overwhelm my dialogue with it? No, absolutely not, because slang terms become outdated quickly, and also that\u2019s not how these kids speak. They are not overusing it. So for me, an authentic voice is all about listening to the people around me, listening to the world and listening to language patterns and seeing how people actually talk. And when I write my dialogue I usually say it out loud so I can see if it sounds OK. I find a lot of historic novels that portray the way black people spoke back in the day, they did it over-the-top and they had us sounding very ignorant. And why? Because they had no respect for us as people. So as a writer, my goal is to always have respect for whoever it is that I\u2019m writing about or writing for. Juno Dawson Author of YA novel Clean You spent a lot of time on Twitter fielding questions about the casting of the film adaptation of The Hate U Give. Is social media, on balance, a blessing or a curse? Ha! A little of both. It\u2019s a blessing because I get to connect with readers and I get to hear stories that I probably didn\u2019t hear before. I get to see pictures of kids in the hallways taken by their teachers and they\u2019re reading my book on their way to class, or I get to hear from parents who say, \u201cThis is the first book my kid has read in forever \u2013 thank you.\u201d Or I get to hear from the kids themselves who say, \u201cOh my God, I love this book.\u201d But then on the flipside you get the demands that sometimes readers make: \u201cWhy did you let them do this?\u201d Or \u201cDon\u2019t let them do this.\u201d I had to get to the point of recognising that I can\u2019t please everyone and I\u2019m OK with that. My job is to simply write the book, tell the stories. The rest is beyond my control. Questions from readers Did you have a eureka moment where you knew definitively that writing was what you wanted to do? What is your writing process? Alomohbitters My eureka moment came while I was writing soap-opera fan fiction! There was this soap opera here in the States called Passions and it was one of the most vacuous to ever exist; they had a witch on there and all these things. But the characters on that show were so rich and there was so much to be explored with them that, as a teenager, I decided to write fan fiction for them and put it up online. So my eureka moment came when I had readers say: \u201cWow, you\u2019re really good at this\u201d or: \u201cGirl, I rushed home when I saw that you had put up another chapter, I had to come home and read it.\u201d That really pushed me and I was like: \u201cWow, well, maybe this is something I can do with my own characters. Maybe I can create these worlds myself, that belong to me.\u201d As for my process, I always try at least to write an outline chart. I don\u2019t always stick with the chart 100%, but it\u2019s at least a road map and if I make a couple of detours here and there that\u2019s OK. I took this from JK Rowling, actually. She did one for the fifth Harry Potter book and put it online: at the top of the chart, she had every character or subplot listed and then on the side she would have the different chapter numbers and that\u2019s how she could keep up with what was happening in every single chapter. So that\u2019s what I do for my books now. I do a chart. If it works for her, and she\u2019s sold all those books, maybe it can work for me! NWA or Wu-Tang? Paul Taylor, Dorset Ohhhh, that\u2019s hard for me to answer that. Cos on the one hand, with NWA, they changed hip-hop as you know it \u2013 you\u2019ve got an entire genre of hip-hop and, really, a coast in hip\u2011hop culture because of NWA. They helped bring west coast hip-hop to popularity. They gave us gangsta rap, but then on the other hand\u2026 they gave us gangsta rap. They gave us music that at times demeaned women, they gave us music that at times was destructive for the community when people took it the wrong way or used it a certain way. So it\u2019s hard for me to say NWA. I do appreciate anything that they did, but I have to go with Wu-Tang. Do you see yourself as a political writer or a writer who happens to be political? How do you think Trump\u2019s presidency is changing America and what mark do you think it will leave, especially on literature, when he goes? Gaverne Bennett, London These days, it\u2019s hard to say because politics is such a huge part of my life anyway. But I would say that I\u2019m a writer who is concerned about politics. I would never just say that I only write about social justice issues, because I won\u2019t. It\u2019s funny, because I tell people: \u201cMississippi is known for two things: writing and racism.\u201d And I happen to be a writer who writes about racism. For the second part, if nothing else right now, Trump has stained America. He has taken us out of a leadership position in the world. Nobody will listen to us now as a leader or as a beacon of hope for anything because of him and because of his actions and because of the decisions he makes. But I will say, I\u2019m more hopeful now than I was before, because I\u2019m seeing more people who are concerned about politics. We\u2019re going to come away from this knowing that we have the ability to change things and that ultimately our government answers to us. So I hope that by the end, when he\u2019s out of office, that the world will know that we Americans, the majority of us, don\u2019t stand for what he stands for. So definitely, please don\u2019t give up on us. Learning to read and write is \u201cfreedom\u201d only if one can find a publisher with contacts for publicity. Eudora Welty, whose writings I adore, got hers through the New Deal programmes. How did you find yours? Shrimpandgrits Wow, that\u2019s awesome that he or she loves Eudora. My college that I attended is actually across the street from her house, so I would see that every single day. But, for me, my publishing journey actually started with Twitter, of all things. When I was writing The Hate U Give, I was honestly not sure if it was something that would even be published, because if you said Black Lives Matter to 30 different people you may get 30 different responses. But also because publishing, young-adult publishing was so white, I wasn\u2019t used to seeing books about black girls and I definitely wasn\u2019t seeing books about black girls in situations like this. So a literary agency held a question-and-answer session on Twitter and I went on and I asked a question. I\u2019m paraphrasing but basically I asked: \u201cIs a book that addresses an issue like this even something that can be published?\u201d And a literary agent by the name of Brooks Sherman responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think any topic is off limits for young adult readership. It\u2019s just a matter of how you address it.\u201d And I was like: \u201cWell, I hope I address it well.\u201d And he said: \u201cI\u2019d actually like to read it if that\u2019s OK.\u201d So I sent it to him and a few months later he signed me as a client. A few months after that, he submitted it to publishers and 13 US publishers fought for the rights to the book. So Twitter is good for something; if nothing else, it found me an agent. Do you think the world should focus so much on the cultural problems of the US, when really it\u2019s just 3% of the population? GreenlandGyrfalcon No, I don\u2019t think that they should. That\u2019s a great point. We should not be the centre of attention all the time. I see why [we are], because we are such a powerhouse, but we need to be aware of other countries and what\u2019s happening there. It doesn\u2019t make sense that you guys have to be subjected to our news maybe sometimes more than your own. So I am so sorry on behalf of America. I am so sorry that our stuff takes up so much air space. I am so sorry that we take up so many headlines. What advice would you give to your younger self? Molly Reed, aged 15, Barnes, London I would tell my younger self to be yourself no matter where you are. In a few years, you\u2019re going to be entering university and you are going to ask questions if you\u2019re being your authentic self because you\u2019re often made to feel you\u2019re either too much or not enough. But I promise you, you are enough. You\u2019re enough for everywhere you go, for whatever you do. Always know that. And then I would tell my younger self, my 15-year-old self specifically, if you want to write, write for yourself. Whatever it is that you want to do, do it for yourself. Don\u2019t do it for the accolades, do it because it\u2019s something you love. And then I would tell my 15-year-old self: it\u2019s going to be OK. There are days where you wonder if that\u2019s true, how you\u2019re going to survive all of this stuff. You wonder, will you make it? You just have to hang in there, you have to keep going and if you keep going, I promise you there will be light in the darkness. You can do it!

Returning on and inside the baseline, he did not allow Nadal\u2019s revamped serve to get out of second gear, and there were only a handful of rallies worthy of the occasion.</p> \n<p>Responding to the accolades of former champions such as Mats Wilander and Pat Cash who described his performance as \u201cabsolute perfection\u201d and \u201cabsolutely mind-blowing tennis\u201d, Djokovic said: \u201cIt ranks right at the top. Playing against Nadal, such an important match, yeah, it\u2019s amazing. Back-to-back semi-finals and finals, I think I made 15 unforced errors in two matches.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if he thought he could pass Federer\u2019s 20 majors, he said: \u201cOf course, it motivates me. How many seasons are to come? I don\u2019t know. I do want to focus on continuing to improve my game and maintaining the overall well-being that I have \u2013 mental, physical, emotional \u2013 so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come, and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger\u2019s record.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e815d88e-35fe-440d-a3cc-2c51be805cd5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Djokovic has now moved clear of Pete Sampras in the list of all-time male grand slam winners:</p>\n    <p><b>20 </b>Roger Federer<br><b>17 </b>Rafael Nadal<br><b>15 </b>Novak Djokovic<br><b>14 </b>Pete Sampras<br><b>12 </b>Roy Emerson<br><b>11 </b>Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg<br><b>1</b><b>0 </b>Bill Tilden</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He reflected on the fact that a year ago his career was in disarray.

      "bodyText": "What should have been the match of the tournament \u2013 of the young year, in fact \u2013 between the best players in the world, each of them fit, fresh and in form after barely hindered routes to the final of the Australian Open, disintegrated into an embarrassing one\u2013man celebration for Novak Djokovic over Rafael Nadal. His 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 6\u20133 win on Rod Laver Arena brought his career count against the Spaniard to 28\u201325, but it was one of the poorest of their contests, which stretch back to 2006. It earned Djokovic a record seventh Australian Open title \u2013 and his third major in a row. That is some roll. He owns three of the four and has the chance to do another Novak slam in Paris, Nadal\u2019s only safe harbour left. The world No 1 has 15 grand slam titles in total, moving ahead of Pete Sampras, two behind Nadal and five behind Roger Federer. It is becoming increasingly likely that the dynamic of the three\u2013cornered hegemony of the modern era is about to change over the course of the remaining three majors this season. Djokovic was as magnificent as he has been in any of his many triumphs. He won 40 of 50 first serves, 16 of 19 on second attempt, hit eight aces and a mere nine unforced errors. Returning on and inside the baseline, he did not allow Nadal\u2019s revamped serve to get out of second gear, and there were only a handful of rallies worthy of the occasion. Responding to the accolades of former champions such as Mats Wilander and Pat Cash who described his performance as \u201cabsolute perfection\u201d and \u201cabsolutely mind-blowing tennis\u201d, Djokovic said: \u201cIt ranks right at the top. Playing against Nadal, such an important match, yeah, it\u2019s amazing. Back-to-back semi-finals and finals, I think I made 15 unforced errors in two matches.\u201d Asked if he thought he could pass Federer\u2019s 20 majors, he said: \u201cOf course, it motivates me. How many seasons are to come? I don\u2019t know. I do want to focus on continuing to improve my game and maintaining the overall well-being that I have \u2013 mental, physical, emotional \u2013 so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come, and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger\u2019s record.\u201d He reflected on the fact that a year ago his career was in disarray. He needed elbow surgery and could hardly contemplate having the comeback he has had. \u201cYes, 12 months ago it was highly unlikely I would be holding three slams. I just have to be conscious of that and understand that I\u2019m blessed.\u201d As for his rivalry with Nadal, he said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re still going to have a lot of matches against each other on different surfaces.\u201d When Djokovic cracked the Nadal serve after seven minutes, it was the first time the Spaniard had given an opponent a look in a set since James Duckworth broke him in the first round but he had regrouped so well he arrived at the final without dropping a set, keeping his court time down to a little over 12 hours in six matches. It began to look as if Djokovic was going to do to Nadal what he had done to Lucas Pouille in the semi\u2013finals, and what Nadal had done to Tomas Berdych in the fourth round.

A hat\u2013trick of Djokovic aces \u2013 each 119mph \u2013 to hold to love for a two\u2013set lead was a dagger that went deep to the heart of Nadal\u2019s resolve.

Probably not as long as in 2012, when these two gladiators decided the final should last five hours and 53 minutes, given they\u2019ve introduced fifth-set tie-breaks this year. But you\u2019re still likely to need a lot of endurance for this one. It\u2019s Novak Djokovic versus Rafael Nadal, after all; they\u2019re so competitive they\u2019d throw their heart and soul into a thumb war, so consider yourself warned about how intense they\u2019ll be when there\u2019s this much sporting history on the line.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s huge game for both men for so many reasons. Let\u2019s start with Djokovic, who is bidding to move above Roger Federer and Roy Emerson by winning a record seventh Australian Open title, and who is also looking to become the first man in history to record three streaks of three or more consecutive grand slam titles. That didn\u2019t seem likely a year ago, when he was locked in a physical and spiritual slump, and he limped out of a quarter-final with Hyeon Chung, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s the man to beat again. The reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion has rediscovered the form that made him so terrifyingly untouchable before he suffered <em>that</em> dip, as Lucas Pouille discovered in a brutal semi-final on Friday, and he begins as the favourite.</p> \n  <p>That might sound surprising bearing in mind Nadal is yet to lose a set during this tournament, but Djokovic owns this court and is unbeaten in his last seven hard court matches with the Spaniard. He leads their overall head-to-head record 27-25, won their Wimbledon semi-final last year and has only lost two of their last 10 matches. Those are some convincing numbers and they\u2019ll give Djokovic immense confidence as he looks to move to within two grand slam titles of Nadal \u2013 and within five of Federer.</p> \n  <p>And there\u2019s the rub. Because if Djokovic is close to the Swiss master, Nadal is even closer. That, more than anything, is what makes this final so huge. Federer, beaten in the fourth round by Stefanos Tsitsipas, who went on to be crushed by Nadal in the semis, knows his record tally of 20 titles is under threat. Nadal, on 17 titles, could even storm out in front this year. Djokovic, slightly further back on 14, will feel he can get this done by the end of 2020. No wonder Federer has decided he\u2019s going to make his first appearance at the French Open since 2015 this year; there are legacies to protect and legacies still to leave.</p> \n  <p>Nadal being Nadal, he claims not to care about all this history chat. But are you buying it? Fat chance. This final is of great significance for him, especially as there are no guarantees he can rely on his muscular but fragile body. He missed a lot of tennis through injury last year and even started this campaign by withdrawing from Brisbane with a thigh injury. Time isn\u2019t on the 32-year-old\u2019s side. His knees could yet conspire against him. But if he wins this title for second time, 10 years on from beating Federer in a thrilling five-set final, he\u2019ll head to Roland Garros on 18 titles, with history very much within touching distance.</p> \n  <p>The only problem is trying to prise Djokovic\u2019s fingers off the trophy. Easier said than done. </p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 8.30am GMT, 7.30pm in Melbourne.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/26/novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-australian-open-final-melbourne\">Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic resume old rivalry for slam supremacy | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-27T07:27:09.600Z\">at 7.27am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "The 2019 Australian Open is over. Naomi Osaka won the women\u2019s title for the first time yesterday and Novak Djokovic is the men\u2019s champion for the seventh time. Djokovic has his eyes on Roger Federer\u2019s haul of 20 majors now. I\u2019ll leave you with a report of his win over Rafael Nadal today. Thanks for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. See you at the French Open! Bye. Novak Djokovic, the seven-time champion, collects his trophy from Ivan Lendl! \u201cI would like to return the favour and give compliments to Rafa\u2019s couple of weeks. Obviously a tough match tonight but you came back from an injury that kept you out of the tour. You are showing your colleagues and young tennis players around the world the definition of what is a fighting spirit. I\u2019m just trying to contemplate the journey from the last 12 months. I had surgery exactly 12 months ago. To stand in front of you today with the title is amazing. I am speechless.\u201d Nadal continues. \u201cIt has been a v emotional two weeks. Even if tonight wasn\u2019t my best day, it has been a very important two weeks for me. I have been going through tough moments in the last year. Since the US Open I was not able to play a professional match until the first round of the Australian Open. I really believe I played a great two weeks of tennis. It is going to be a good inspiration for what\u2019s coming. I\u2019m going to keep working hard. I\u2019m going to keep fighting.\u201d Rafa Nadal congratulates Novak Djokovic on a magnificent fortnight. \u201cWell done for everything,\u201d he says. Then he runs through the sponsors. Bold prediction: Novak Djokovic will finish with more grand slam titles than Federer and Nadal. Who\u2019s going to beat him away from Paris? Time for the presentations. We\u2019ll have to sit through some boring speeches for a bit. Novak Djokovic hit 34 winners to 21 for Rafael Nadal. He only made nine unforced errors. Nadal made 28! Djokovic converted five of eight break points and only had to save one break point. He was astonishing. Strange to think many were tipping Nadal to win this one. It was a drubbing. The final lasted two hours and four minutes. Not quite as long as their 2012 epic, then. Just the four hours or so short. Novak Djokovic embraces Rafa Nadal at the net and then he sinks to his knees and bellows to the heavens. What a performance from the world No1! He\u2019s won a record seventh Australian Open title and his 15th grand slam title. He\u2019s gone above Pete Sampras in the all-time list. He\u2019s two behind Nadal. He\u2019s five behind Roger Federer. The chase is on. Hoping to finish the job here, Djokovic rattles a forehand into the left corner for 15-all. It\u2019s relentless from the world No1, who makes it 15-30 with more brutal baseline hitting. He earns two championship points with a stunner of a forehand. Nadal was nowhere near it. A tense rally ensues, ending with Djokovic hitting long for 30-40. He still has another chance. Nadal misses a first serve. They rally off a second serve. But not for long. Nadal sends a backhand long and the title belongs to the marvellous Novak Djokovic! Third set: Djokovic* 6-3, 6-2, 5-3 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic whistles a forehand wide for 0-15. His challenge is in vain. He makes up with it by smashing for 15-all, though the game goes to 30-all. Another glimmer for Nadal, who manages to take it to deuce. But Djokovic shuts out the light, holding with a granite volley. He\u2019s a game from the title. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 4-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal hangs in there, holding to 15. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3, 6-2, 4-2 Nadal (*denotes server): A flicker of life, the game going to 30-all, at which point Djokovic hands Nadal his first break point with a sketchy forehand. This could be interes... oh, Nadal nets a backhand. Deuce. Having survived that minor scare, Djokovic holds with a couple of rapier forehands. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 3-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal holds to 15. You have to admire his stubbornness. He\u2019s not giving in yet. Probably should, though. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3, 6-2, 3-1 Nadal (*denotes server): So serene, so accurate, so devastatingly precise, Djokovic lashes a forehand past a flatfooted Nadal for 40-15. He holds with a cracking backhand. The people who booed Djokovic when he walked on court are probably regretting it now. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): At 15-0, Nadal tries a hard body serve. Djokovic adjusts, moves out the way and spanks a forehand return past Nadal for 15-all. It\u2019s enough to unsettle Nadal, who finds himself trailing 15-30 after a double-fault. Nothing\u2019s working for Nadal. He misses a forehand down the line to make it 15-40. Nadal saves the first break point with some brutal hitting. But Djokovic converts the second when a drop shot forces Nadal to net a forehand on the run. His seventh Australian Open title is within touching distance. Third set: Djokovic* 6-3, 6-2, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic cruises into a 40-0 lead. Nothing to see here, just his seventh love hold. Third set: Djokovic 6-3, 6-2, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): As a general rule Djokovic doesn\u2019t squander two-set leads. If Nadal is to make a contest of this, he needs to hold here. He manages to move to 40-30 despite some more magnificent tennis from Djokovic - and holds with a big serve. Djokovic flings an ace down the middle to earn three set points. Another one finishes it off. Nadal will need something extraordinary to pull off a comeback from here. He doesn\u2019t look capable of it. He\u2019s been thoroughly outplayed by the best player in the world. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 5-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): The game goes to 15-all when Nadal double-faults. Djokovic is on the hunt, nailing a forehand for 15-30. Then he batters a forehand down the line to earn two break points. He\u2019s totally in the zone; good luck booting him out of it. Nadal seems out of ideas. He nets a backhand to drop his serve again. Djokovic will serve for a two-set lead. This is exquisite tennis from the world No1. He\u2019s putting on a clinic. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3, 4-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic pulls a backhand wide after the first two points are shared. It\u2019s the first time Nadal\u2019s had 15-30. He desperately needs to capitalise here. Yet Djokovic wins the next two points, sending a forehand down the line for 30-all, before waiting for Nadal to stick a backhand wide for 40-30. The game goes to deuce, though. Djokovic is finally being asked a few questions. He wastes a challenge on an errant serve. But he still has the answers. He clenches his fist after consolidating the break. He has that fearsome look in his eye. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 3-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): Two errors from Nadal hand Djokovic a 0-30 lead. These are dangerous times. Nadal will be in huge trouble if this continues. It\u2019s just as well he makes it 15-30 with an ace that leaves Djokovic rooted to the spot. But then Djokovic sends a deep backhand return down the line and Nadal nets a backhand, handing over two break points. It\u2019s a long baseline rally, both men hitting it with plenty of looping spin. Tense stuff. Then Djokovic comes up with a change of pace, a drop shot drawing Nadal forward. He\u2019s there. His riposte clips the top of the net. Djokovic tries a lob - and Nadal\u2019s overhead backhand drops long! Djokovic breaks! That could be the decisive moment. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3, 2-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Every time Nadal looks like he might get into a Djokovic service game, he makes an error. At 30-15, in control of the rally, he rams a forehand wide. That\u2019s all Djokovic needs to hold to 15, a serve down the volley doing the job. Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): After the first two points are shared, it goes to 15-30 when Nadal foolishly decides to play a Djokovic backhand that was going wide and dumps his volley into the net. Nadal is in a bit of bother - until he lands a forehand on the line for 30-all. Then he wrongfoots Djokovic with a forehand for 40-30. He holds with a solid serve. A big hold. Second set: Djokovic* 6-3, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic skips into a 40-0 lead, acing away to his heart\u2019s content. He holds to love when Nadal nets a backhand. He\u2019s only dropped one point on serve! Second set: Djokovic 6-3, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): The second set begins with Djokovic picking Nadal off with a stunning backhand pass for 0-15. Nadal gets to 30-15, only for another Djokovic backhand from left to right to make it 30-all. Nadal serves big to make it 40-30.He holds with a lovely forehand down the line. Maybe there\u2019s an epic in this yet. Yet to lose a point on serve, Djokovic steps up to close out the first set. Now would be a good time for Nadal to find his return. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, after so much excellence Djokovic begins by slapping a forehand into the net for 0-15. Is it to be a wobble? Nadal looks to be on the charge. He\u2019s unfortunate to see a forehand whistle just wide for 15-all. Moments later Djokovic sends a measured backhand down the line for 30-15. He clenches his fist. Then he gets down to the task of outlasting Nadal, who nets a backhand at the end of one of those draining rallies. Two set points for Djokovic, who takes the first when Nadal nets a limp forehand. First set: Djokovic 5-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal is serving new balls as he looks to keep the first set alive. And he starts with a couple of piercing crosscourt backhand for 30-0. He holds to love with a huge forehand. Djokovic will serve for the set. First set: Djokovic* 5-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic tries a risky drop shot. He\u2019s lucky Nadal ends up netting a backhand overhead when it seemed harder to miss. 15-0. There\u2019s a sense the Spaniard\u2019s warming up after that tight start, though that impression disappears after a bizarre moment at 30-0, Nadal swiping at a forehand and completely missing his shot after hitting his knee with his racket! Oh dear. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that from Nadal before. His timing\u2019s all off. The same can\u2019t be said for Djokovic, who holds to love again with a backhand down the line/ First set: Djokovic 4-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal is starting to serve better, allowing him to finish off a couple of quick points for 30-15. His first ace makes it 40-15. Or does it? A Djokovic challenge shows it was long. The point\u2019s replayed and Nadal finds a Djokovic backhand too hot to handle. 30-all. Djokovic looks certain to earn a break point after lobbing Nadal at the net - but the Spaniard hurtles back and wins the point with a rollocking backhand for 40-30! Nadal holds when Djokovic sends a backhand long, much to the delight of a partisan crowd. First set: Djokovic* 4-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic pings an ace past Nadal for 15-0. Another one makes it 40-0. He holds to love with a killer backhand. Nadal is yet to win a point on Djokovic\u2019s serve. First set: Djokovic 3-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal comes to the net, but his drop volley\u2019s poor, teeing it up for Djokovic to race forward and dab a backhand down the line for 0-15. The game goes to 30-all, the pair trading a few blows. Nadal\u2019s trying to gee himself up - but Djokovic\u2019s racing back and forth across the baseline and he earns another break point when his defence forces Nadal to try to do too much with a backhand. This, you feel, could be the set done. Yet Nadal stays composed and forces deuce with a good second serve. He makes sure not to give Djokovic anything else and holds after that scare. First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Nadal (*denotes server): Still out of sorts, Nadal is making some very strange errors, which isn\u2019t particularly helpful when you\u2019re playing Djokovic on this court. Djokovic races into a 40-0 lead, pinging a backhand down the line with controlled power. He can\u2019t quite believe how well this is going. He consolidates the break with more louche serving. It\u2019s been stunning so far from Djokovic, though he\u2019s bound to prepared for Nadal to stir. First set: Djokovic 2-0 Nadal* (*denotes server): Much has been said about Nadal\u2019s improved serve at this tournament - but it faces the ultimate test against the best returner in the game. He\u2019s under pressure early on, spilling a forehand wide for 0-15. Djokovic is making all the running and he moves to 0-30 after taking control of a rally with a vicious forehand and winning it with a ruthless backhand. Nadal eventually wins a point, though. \u201cVamos!\u201d he cries after making it 15-30. But Djokovic keeps probing and earns two break points when Nadal nets a backhand. Nadal serves wide. Djokovic stretches and manages to hook it back \u2013 and, incredibly, Nadal smacks a gimme of a forehand wide! Djokovic breaks straight away. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Nadal (*denotes server): Djokovic won the toss and chose to serve. Wearing a blue shirt, he wins the first point of the final with an unfussy forehand down the line. He\u2019s looking relaxed, swinging an ace out wide to lead 40-0. Then comes the first long rally, which ends when Djokovic sprays a backhand down the line, Nadal unable to come up with a response. A fine start from the world No1. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. There were a few boos from Novak Djokovic when he walked on court. Absurd. A huge roar greets Rafael Nadal as he walks out on Rod Laver Arena. Novak Djokovic, the world No1, is out next. He beats his chest and looks to the sky as he appears. The good news for Rafael Nadal is that the roof\u2019s on. He wasn\u2019t happy when it was on Centre Court for his Wimbledon semi-final with Novak Djokovic last year. \u201cWanted to point out, I don\u2019t think the championship tie break will have an impact on the length of this final,\u201d Divya Suresh. \u201cIf you look back to 2012, the score in the final set was 7-5. And only one set went to tie break - the 4th. It was just the brutal, bruising nature of their long rallies that caused the final to go on for that long. So we could still be here a while! Really looking forward to it.\u201d Good point. I\u2019m off to stretch my fingers. Overall it\u2019s 9-5 to Nadal in the grand slams, though five of those wins came before Djokovic entered cyborg mode at the start of 2011. It\u2019s 5-4 to Djokovic since 2011. This is the eighth time Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have met in a grand slam final. Nadal won the 2010 and 2013 US Opens and the 2012 and 2014 French Opens; Djokovic won the 2011 Wimbledon final, the 2011 US Open and the 2012 Australian Open. Hello. I hope you\u2019ve sitting somewhere comfortable because we could be here a while. Probably not as long as in 2012, when these two gladiators decided the final should last five hours and 53 minutes, given they\u2019ve introduced fifth-set tie-breaks this year. But you\u2019re still likely to need a lot of endurance for this one. It\u2019s Novak Djokovic versus Rafael Nadal, after all; they\u2019re so competitive they\u2019d throw their heart and soul into a thumb war, so consider yourself warned about how intense they\u2019ll be when there\u2019s this much sporting history on the line. It\u2019s huge game for both men for so many reasons. Let\u2019s start with Djokovic, who is bidding to move above Roger Federer and Roy Emerson by winning a record seventh Australian Open title, and who is also looking to become the first man in history to record three streaks of three or more consecutive grand slam titles. That didn\u2019t seem likely a year ago, when he was locked in a physical and spiritual slump, and he limped out of a quarter-final with Hyeon Chung, but there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s the man to beat again. The reigning Wimbledon and US Open champion has rediscovered the form that made him so terrifyingly untouchable before he suffered that dip, as Lucas Pouille discovered in a brutal semi-final on Friday, and he begins as the favourite. That might sound surprising bearing in mind Nadal is yet to lose a set during this tournament, but Djokovic owns this court and is unbeaten in his last seven hard court matches with the Spaniard. He leads their overall head-to-head record 27-25, won their Wimbledon semi-final last year and has only lost two of their last 10 matches. Those are some convincing numbers and they\u2019ll give Djokovic immense confidence as he looks to move to within two grand slam titles of Nadal \u2013 and within five of Federer. And there\u2019s the rub. Because if Djokovic is close to the Swiss master, Nadal is even closer. That, more than anything, is what makes this final so huge. Federer, beaten in the fourth round by Stefanos Tsitsipas, who went on to be crushed by Nadal in the semis, knows his record tally of 20 titles is under threat. Nadal, on 17 titles, could even storm out in front this year. Djokovic, slightly further back on 14, will feel he can get this done by the end of 2020. No wonder Federer has decided he\u2019s going to make his first appearance at the French Open since 2015 this year; there are legacies to protect and legacies still to leave. Nadal being Nadal, he claims not to care about all this history chat. But are you buying it? Fat chance. This final is of great significance for him, especially as there are no guarantees he can rely on his muscular but fragile body. He missed a lot of tennis through injury last year and even started this campaign by withdrawing from Brisbane with a thigh injury. Time isn\u2019t on the 32-year-old\u2019s side. His knees could yet conspire against him. But if he wins this title for second time, 10 years on from beating Federer in a thrilling five-set final, he\u2019ll head to Roland Garros on 18 titles, with history very much within touching distance. The only problem is trying to prise Djokovic\u2019s fingers off the trophy. Easier said than done. Play begins at: 8.30am GMT, 7.30pm in Melbourne.",

Usually introduced simply as a \u201cGerman journalist\u201d, he would often agree with Kremlin talking points on the war in Ukraine or give a far-right viewpoint on tensions in Germany over migration. He has also travelled to the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic in east Ukraine, where he was an \u201cobserver\u201d for elections the international community regarded as illegitimate.</p> <p>He had a regular <a href=\"http://katehon.com/person/manuel-ochsenreiter\">column</a> on the website of Katehon, a thinktank run by Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian financier who has been accused of supporting the pro-Russia insurgency. Malofeev has denied accusations of funding the far right in Europe. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Malofeev said Ochsenreiter was never paid for his columns or for any other work by the Russian financier or structures controlled by him.</p> <p>The Berlin prosecutors\u2019 office said a preliminary investigation was under way against \u201can employee of a Bundestag parliamentarian\u201d, but would not say whether this was Ochsenreiter.

      "bodyText": "The plot allegedly involved three Polish extremists and a German journalist with ties to the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party, as well as to a number of Kremlin-friendly Russian news outlets. Their alleged task was to carry out a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation in western Ukraine: burn down a Hungarian cultural centre, and make it look as though Ukrainian nationalists were responsible. The main beneficiary of the ensuing recriminations would be Russia. If this was the idea, the fire last February in the town of Uzhhorod had the desired effect. There were no casualties, but tensions were inflamed in the Ukrainian region, which has a sizeable ethnic Hungarian minority. Hungarian authorities were quick to blame Ukrainian nationalists and the anger contributed to the increasingly fraught relationship between Budapest and Kiev over the past year, which has caused cracks in EU and Nato solidarity in support of Ukraine. Now, a year later in a Krak\u00f3w courtroom, new details of what happened in Uzhhorod last year have been emerging. Micha\u0142 Prokopowicz, a Polish far-right activist, told the court last week that he was paid \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,300) to organise the attack by Manuel Ochsenreiter, a German journalist with multiple links to Russia, who works as an adviser to AfD MP Markus Frohnmaier. Prokopowicz told the court he hired two associates, who are standing trial with him, to carry out the attack: Tomasz Szymkowiak and Adrian Marglewski, who are charged with promoting fascism and endangering lives or property with fire. They are yet to give testimony and have not yet entered pleas. The men allegedly returned to Poland via Slovakia shortly after the fire at the cultural centre and were identified by Ukrainian authorities through images from security cameras. Prokopowicz reported the success of the mission to Ochsenreiter, he told the court. Prokopowicz faces up to 12 years in prison for inciting terrorism when the case continues in March, but the Polish court has so far declined to charge Ochsenreiter, who denies involvement. If Prokopowicz\u2019s testimony is true, however, it raises the question: what or who prompted Ochsenreiter to set up the attack? Ochsenreiter edits the far-right Zuerst! magazine, and become an adviser last September to Frohnmaier, who was elected to the Bundestag from the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 2017. Attention, however, is likely to focus on the journalist\u2019s numerous ties to Russia. He has been a regular guest on the Kremlin-backed news channel RT. Usually introduced simply as a \u201cGerman journalist\u201d, he would often agree with Kremlin talking points on the war in Ukraine or give a far-right viewpoint on tensions in Germany over migration. He has also travelled to the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic in east Ukraine, where he was an \u201cobserver\u201d for elections the international community regarded as illegitimate. He had a regular column on the website of Katehon, a thinktank run by Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian financier who has been accused of supporting the pro-Russia insurgency. Malofeev has denied accusations of funding the far right in Europe. A spokeswoman for Malofeev said Ochsenreiter was never paid for his columns or for any other work by the Russian financier or structures controlled by him. The Berlin prosecutors\u2019 office said a preliminary investigation was under way against \u201can employee of a Bundestag parliamentarian\u201d, but would not say whether this was Ochsenreiter. Earlier, German media reported that prosecutors had opened an investigation into the case. The AfD declined to comment on the allegations or news of the preliminary investigation. Neither Ochsenreiter nor Frohnmaier\u2019s office responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. Frohnmaier wrote on Facebook last week that Ochsenreiter had denied the allegations. He later told German media that Ochsenreiter had resigned from his position after the allegations emerged. The journalist also had longstanding links to the Polish far right. An undated photograph unearthed by Anton Shekhovtsov, who researches European far-right movements, shows Ochsenreiter together with Prokopowicz and Mateusz Piskorski, the leader of the pro-Russia Zmiana party. Ochsenreiter and Piskorski were directors of the European Centre for Geopolitical Analysis, which specialises in organising Russia-backed election missions with the participation of far-right and far-left actors from across Europe, as well as publishing literature pushing the Kremlin line on a wide range of issues. In May 2016, Piskorski was detained by Polish authorities on suspicion of espionage for foreign powers, including Russia and China. He was not charged for another two years, making him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the European far right, which claims his arrest is politically motivated. He has been in detention for two years, but the case has not yet been brought to trial. In east Ukraine, Russia has funnelled cash, weapons and occasionally troops across the border to support and control the separatist territories that split away from Ukrainian government control in 2014. The fire in western Ukraine was much lower key. It would appear to fit a pattern of low-grade, low-cost and deniable cultivation of a number of European far-right activists by Russian intelligence or Kremlin-friendly figures. It also represents an escalation from mere cultivation. Shekhovtsov compared the fire to historical \u201cfalse flag\u201d cases, such as when the KGB and the Stasi used agents to paint swastikas in West Germany in the 1950s in an attempt to emphasise the country\u2019s failure to break fully from Nazism. He cautioned against drawing a direct link to the Kremlin, claiming that Ochsenreiter could be freelancing in the hope of impressing his contacts in Moscow. \u201cHe knew what kind of things can be rewarded by the Russians, and for this he would have been rewarded,\u201d Shekhovtsov claimed. As in many other cases across Europe, the claims would suggest that pro-Russia actors have seized on genuine grievances and attempted to exploit them. The incident worsened already delicate relations between Ukraine and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist government in Hungary. Hungary has complained about a restrictive language law meant primarily to tackle the dominance of Russian in Ukraine, but which has also worried the Hungarian minority in the west of the country. For months, Hungary has blocked Ukraine\u2019s efforts to move closer to Nato owing to disagreements over the language issue. This is despite strong warnings from the US that the Hungarian policy was playing into the Kremlin\u2019s hands. In a post on Facebook, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, said the evidence emerging in court in Krak\u00f3w showed \u201cthe complexity and scale of Russian hybrid methods\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for Europe to think systemically of how they could counter Moscow, which is doing everything it wants in the territory of the free world.\u201d",

Because of her status and education, the price required to marry her is bound to be high. Although dowries are often now paid in cash, she expects hers will be paid in the traditional method of cows and goats, and that the wedding will take place in the village she came from. \u201cI\u2019m a traditional girl,\u201d she explains. It could take a long time for any suitor to accumulate the capital needed to pay \u2013 or at least down-pay \u2013 her dowry.

      "body": "<p>For all the millions of words that have been written about the second world war, there is an extraordinary level of agreement about much of the story. The rise of nazism in Germany in the 1930s, for example, is nearly always seen as inexorable and unstoppable. This account is, however, challenged in this book, which was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/books/prix-goncourt-eric-vuillard.html\" title=\"\">the surprise winner of the 2017 Prix Goncourt </a> \u2013 the most prestigious French literary prize \u2013 but which was already a bestseller by the time that jury came to make up its mind. It sold so well partly because it is a tightly paced and gripping read, but also because \u2013 as Vuillard has made clear in interviews \u2013 it is supposed be a book about the present as well as the past.</p> <p>More precisely, Vuillard demonstrates that the history of Germany during the 1930s is not quite as clear-cut as we often believe it to be and that there was indeed nothing truly inevitable about the Nazis\u2019 march on political power; a series of accidents, coincidences and blunders rather than the implementation of a masterplan.</p> <p>Vuillard tells his version of the story with the delicate craftmanship of a miniaturist (the book can easily be read in an afternoon). He chooses to look at the Nazis with two telling vignettes. The first of these is set on 20 February 1933, three weeks after Hitler had been installed as chancellor. Although most people did not then know it, this grey and cold Monday morning, was \u201cnot just any other day\u201d in Berlin. At a private meeting in Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s official residence, 24 of Germany\u2019s leading industrialists and bankers gathered for a meeting with the Nazi high command to hear about the future of their country. The meeting began with G\u00f6ring making the case that the Nazi party, which was penniless, needed funds to fight the coming elections, which, all being well, could be the last for a century.</p> <p>Hitler then entered the scene, \u201csmiling, relaxed\u2026 affable, even friendly\u201d. He gave a lengthy speech, explaining his political philosophy. The men were then asked to make donations to the party and its cause, which they did, \u201clike 24 calculating machines at the gates of Hell\u201d.</p> <p>The second part of the book, longer and more intricate, describes the Nazi occupation of Austria, the so-called Anschluss, beginning with Hitler\u2019s violent intimidation of the Austrian chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg at the F\u00fchrer\u2019s alpine lodge in February 1938 and concluding with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1938/mar/14/leadersandreply.mainsection\" title=\"\">the German advance towards Vienna</a> on 12 March. The focus here is accidents of fate.

      "bodyText": "For all the millions of words that have been written about the second world war, there is an extraordinary level of agreement about much of the story. The rise of nazism in Germany in the 1930s, for example, is nearly always seen as inexorable and unstoppable. This account is, however, challenged in this book, which was the surprise winner of the 2017 Prix Goncourt \u2013 the most prestigious French literary prize \u2013 but which was already a bestseller by the time that jury came to make up its mind. It sold so well partly because it is a tightly paced and gripping read, but also because \u2013 as Vuillard has made clear in interviews \u2013 it is supposed be a book about the present as well as the past. More precisely, Vuillard demonstrates that the history of Germany during the 1930s is not quite as clear-cut as we often believe it to be and that there was indeed nothing truly inevitable about the Nazis\u2019 march on political power; a series of accidents, coincidences and blunders rather than the implementation of a masterplan. Vuillard tells his version of the story with the delicate craftmanship of a miniaturist (the book can easily be read in an afternoon). He chooses to look at the Nazis with two telling vignettes. The first of these is set on 20 February 1933, three weeks after Hitler had been installed as chancellor. Although most people did not then know it, this grey and cold Monday morning, was \u201cnot just any other day\u201d in Berlin. At a private meeting in Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s official residence, 24 of Germany\u2019s leading industrialists and bankers gathered for a meeting with the Nazi high command to hear about the future of their country. The meeting began with G\u00f6ring making the case that the Nazi party, which was penniless, needed funds to fight the coming elections, which, all being well, could be the last for a century. Hitler then entered the scene, \u201csmiling, relaxed\u2026 affable, even friendly\u201d. He gave a lengthy speech, explaining his political philosophy. The men were then asked to make donations to the party and its cause, which they did, \u201clike 24 calculating machines at the gates of Hell\u201d. The second part of the book, longer and more intricate, describes the Nazi occupation of Austria, the so-called Anschluss, beginning with Hitler\u2019s violent intimidation of the Austrian chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg at the F\u00fchrer\u2019s alpine lodge in February 1938 and concluding with the German advance towards Vienna on 12 March. The focus here is accidents of fate. Far from being a demonstration of German military strength, the advance was slow and lumbering; only half-joking, Vuillard offers astrology as a possible explanation for the chaos. This wry aside is characteristic of Vuillard\u2019s dry and ironic style. Although the book has been described as nonfiction it is not straightforward (which is why it won the Goncourt, which is a prize for fiction). Instead it takes the form of a r\u00e9cit \u2013 a type of essay where the author is always present, zooming in and out on facts, details and marshalling arguments. For this reason, conventional historians who are suspicious of historical fictions have not been especially friendly towards this book. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. Vuillard has written a magnificently entertaining account that manages to capture the wild and uneven emotional climate of the 1930s and speaks too to our own era of liars, demagogues and politics as farce, which, as Vuillard deftly shows us, can slide all too quickly into tragedy.

They have around 24 players on part-time contracts and the coach, Annick Heyraud, does not believe England\u2019s preferred route is the best. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly it will mean that England have any advantage over France,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a contract which covers 50% of time and that makes it easier for our players to train and in particular it allows them better time to prepare. \u201cOur view is that a 100% contract is not necessarily ideal because what we want is to strike a balance. For our players to have a balance between their rugby but also their studies or jobs so they can flourish within their lives as a whole.\u201d WOMEN\u2019S SIX NATIONS FIXTURES 2019 Week 1: Friday Ireland v England (5pm, Donnybrook); Scotland v Italy (7.35pm, Scotstoun Stadium); Saturday France v Wales (9pm, Stadium GGL).

Confidence is the lead single from Chiaroscuro, the second album from the northern beaches six-piece. Nick Findlay, the music director of Australia\u2019s national youth broadcaster Triple J, described the song as \u201cdripping with a level of sun-drenched soul that\u2019s straight out of a 70s surf flick\u201d, and praised it as \u201ca well-deserved jam to take out the No 1 spot\u201d. Ocean Alley also came in at No 100 with Happy Sad; at No 16 with their cover of Player\u2019s Baby Come Back; and at No 10 with Knees. The countdown drew more than 2.75m votes in total. Australian producer Fisher was voted in at No 2 for his electro-house club favourite Losing It, which saw him nominated for a Grammy and an Aria; and two US hip-hop artists came in at No 3 and No 4: Travis Scott for Sicko Mode (featuring Drake), and Childish Gambino for This is America, respectively. Widely hailed as one of the most important tracks and clips of the year, the racially charged This is America was hotly tipped as a favourite in this year\u2019s countdown \u2013 as was I Said Hi by Australia\u2019s Amy Shark, which made it to No 5. It was the second year in a row the Hottest 100 hasn\u2019t been held on Australia Day, a date it moved to in 2004. Considered a day of mourning by many Australians, tens of thousands of people joined Invasion Day marches around the country on Saturday 26 January, calling for the public holiday \u2013 which marks the anniversary of the first fleet\u2019s landing in 1788 \u2013 to be abolished, or for its date to be changed. Triple J decided to move the broadcast to a less divisive date in 2017, following an internal review and a national survey in which 60% of the 65,000 respondents voted in favour of the shift. Votes for the 2018 countdown were up almost 15% on last year, according to figures from the broadcaster. Five per cent of the votes came from overseas; most voters (29%) came from New South Wales; and 80% of voters were under 30. Eighteen was the most common age among those who voted, and 65 songs in the countdown came from Australian artists. Gender imbalance is a common criticism levelled at the Hottest 100 and the Triple J playlist, and at the Australian music industry more broadly. The broadcaster crunched the numbers last year and found that women were more likely to vote for women artists in the poll. This year, as with last year, more women (53%) voted than men \u2013 and it was a strong showing for female solo artists in the top 20 for 2018. Seventeen-year-old US singer-songwriter Billie Eilish was voted in at No 8 for When the Party\u2019s Over, becoming the youngest solo artist ever to make it to the top 10 (Eilish also had songs at No 46 and No 17). Ruby Fields came in at No 9 with Dinosaurs; Mallrat made it to No 7 with Groceries; and Wafia, an Australian of Iraqi-Syrian origin, was at No 14 with I\u2019m Good. \u201cThank you for making this brown girl\u2019s dreams come true,\u201d she said, during the broadcast. According to Triple J\u2019s statistics, 67 songs in the 2018 Hottest 100 came from male artists and 22 from female; eight songs were by acts including both male and female artists; and three came from artists who identify as non-binary or genderqueer. Baker Boy\u2019s Mr La Di Da Di was the only non-English track to make it into this year\u2019s countdown. The Indigenous artist, a young Australian of the Year recipient, raps in both English and his native Yolngu Matha. During the broadcast, Triple J raised more than $600,000 for crisis support hotline Lifeline \u2013 the first year they partnered with the charity, after three years\u2019 fundraising for the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience. \u2022 This article was corrected on 29 January.

      "body": "<p>The first time I went to Patisserie Valerie, in December 1993, it felt really special. I was having a day out in London during the Christmas vacation after my first term at university and a college friend, who lived in London, took me to what I for many years wrongly thought of as the original Knightsbridge branch. It seemed extremely refined and continental \u2013 the cakes were like the ones that, in those days, you only really got in France. Lots of millefeuilles, no iced buns. To an undergraduate rube, it was a glimpse into the hidden London where only very posh people go.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how many branches of Patisserie Valerie there were in 1993. But it was obviously more than the one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/23/patisserie-valerie-cafes-shut-old-compton-street-london\" title=\"\">Old Compton Street outlet</a> that Enzo, Robert and Victor Scalzo bought in 1987 from descendants of the original Madame Valerie, and fewer than the nine that existed when they sold the firm to venture capitalists in 2006. When it went into administration last week, there were about 200.</p> <p>Early last year, I went to one of them. It was in the Brunswick Centre near Russell Square, in London, next to an arthouse cinema. This time, it didn\u2019t feel very special. It was fine, but it was pretty empty. I had a sandwich and a tea while someone swept the floor. But, unlike in 1993, it obviously wasn\u2019t a genuine Belgian patisserie that had been running for the best part of a century. It was just a chain restaurant that had randomly taken \u201cBelgian patisserie\u201d as its vague theme. It could turn into a GBK or a Harry Ramsden\u2019s or a Caf\u00e9 Rouge or a Pret or an Eat or a Giraffe at the click of a financier\u2019s mouse.</p> <p>It feels so weird and arbitrary. I get no sense that the reason Patisserie Valerie leapt from a handful of branches to hundreds was because of public demand. I suppose there\u2019s a demand for cafes in general, but I don\u2019t think many people were saying: \u201cYou know the distinctive feel of that cake shop in Old Compton Street? If only that was available literally everywhere!\u201d I don\u2019t think people outside London had particularly heard of it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like Hamley\u2019s or Fortnum &amp; Mason. They were just suddenly presented with it. \u201cThat Zizzi\u2019s turned into something called Patisserie Valerie.\u201d \u201cOh. Do they still do cappuccinos?\u201d \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p> <p>And it doesn\u2019t make sense even if there did turn out to be a vast unexploited market for the very specific Belgian-metropolitan ambience I enjoyed in 1993, because a chain of Patisserie Valerie\u2019s scale and nature is incapable of replicating that sort of atmosphere \u2013 as I discovered at the Brunswick Centre. It\u2019s not like McDonald\u2019s, which, whether or not you like it, you have to admit is pretty much the same everywhere. In this case, the original successful thing is too ephemeral to be recaptured by a team of local staff taken on when the TGI Friday\u2019s closed.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying this is why the chain failed. The current crisis was precipitated by the discovery last October of \u201csignificant, potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities\u201d, which meant there was a \u00a340m gap in its accounts. Until then, everything looked rosy, with Patisserie Holdings, the parent company, valued at over half a billion pounds in June. But it\u2019s hard to believe that wasn\u2019t a huge overestimation of its worth, and that there isn\u2019t a fundamental weakness in the business motivating all the alleged books-cooking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9753cda677cfc799ab77ecec59887aa7300c60b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9753cda677cfc799ab77ecec59887aa7300c60b8/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patisserie Valerie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patisserie Valerie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first properly noticed the weird way the restaurant business currently operates when the Ask Pizza near me changed overnight into something called Franco Manca. It still seemed to be a restaurant but I had no idea what sort. I initially assumed it was something vaguely Spanish, which was stupid of me as that would be like a Viennese restaurant calling itself Hitler Mitlo.</p> <p>My confusion wasn\u2019t eased when I discovered that Franco Manca, like Ask Pizza before it, is a pizza restaurant \u2013 the main difference being that Franco Manca serves sourdough pizza while Ask served what I think a gastronome would describe as normal pizza. So why the change? Was Ask doing badly? If so, what made someone think its problems would be solved by making the dough more sour?</p> <p>Just like when going mad, having seen one inexplicable thing, I started seeing them everywhere. That\u2019s how it was with Franco Mancas. So, out of curiosity, on one of the occasions when I would otherwise have gone to Pizza Express, I went to a Franco Manca. I thought it was fine, but no better than Pizza Express.</p> <p>Is that sort of one-off curiosity visit enough to sustain such a chain? It\u2019s almost like going to see a film because you\u2019ve noticed so many posters for it \u2013 but, instead of posters, you\u2019ve seen actual branches of the restaurant on every high street. So, if you\u2019ve got time on your hands, maybe you pop in. If you don\u2019t, you miss the release \u2013 personally, I never got round to Prezzo or Chimichanga and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prezzo_Holdings\" title=\"\">lots of them have closed now</a>. Maybe they\u2019ll bring out a DVD.</p> <p>Obviously if, having popped in, you find this new chain restaurant to be really terrific, and better than the chain restaurants you\u2019ve previously frequented, then this all makes sense. But how often does that happen? Not very often, judging by the parlous financial state of the sector. Poor old Jamie Oliver seems to be constantly cranking out books and TV shows purely to pay the staff wages in all the deserted branches of Jamie\u2019s Italian. And every other chain, from Carluccio\u2019s to Byron, seems to be feverishly closing branches or renegotiating rents.</p> <p>I\u2019m no businessman, which will become obvious when I say that, to me, all this feels like a huge waste of time and energy: this desperation to take any half-decent food service concept and then strain every financial sinew to immediately open versions of it in every town, city and shopping centre, only for the resultant frail, over-stretched company to collapse in the face of the lightest breeze of consumer parsimony. What\u2019s the point? Patisserie Valerie was a small good thing and now it\u2019s bloated and broken, a dispiriting echo of the effect of too much cake.</p>",

I suppose there\u2019s a demand for cafes in general, but I don\u2019t think many people were saying: \u201cYou know the distinctive feel of that cake shop in Old Compton Street? If only that was available literally everywhere!\u201d I don\u2019t think people outside London had particularly heard of it \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like Hamley\u2019s or Fortnum &amp; Mason. They were just suddenly presented with it. \u201cThat Zizzi\u2019s turned into something called Patisserie Valerie.\u201d \u201cOh. Do they still do cappuccinos?\u201d \u201cI suppose so.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t make sense even if there did turn out to be a vast unexploited market for the very specific Belgian-metropolitan ambience I enjoyed in 1993, because a chain of Patisserie Valerie\u2019s scale and nature is incapable of replicating that sort of atmosphere \u2013 as I discovered at the Brunswick Centre. It\u2019s not like McDonald\u2019s, which, whether or not you like it, you have to admit is pretty much the same everywhere. In this case, the original successful thing is too ephemeral to be recaptured by a team of local staff taken on when the TGI Friday\u2019s closed. I\u2019m not saying this is why the chain failed. The current crisis was precipitated by the discovery last October of \u201csignificant, potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities\u201d, which meant there was a \u00a340m gap in its accounts. Until then, everything looked rosy, with Patisserie Holdings, the parent company, valued at over half a billion pounds in June. But it\u2019s hard to believe that wasn\u2019t a huge overestimation of its worth, and that there isn\u2019t a fundamental weakness in the business motivating all the alleged books-cooking. I first properly noticed the weird way the restaurant business currently operates when the Ask Pizza near me changed overnight into something called Franco Manca. It still seemed to be a restaurant but I had no idea what sort. I initially assumed it was something vaguely Spanish, which was stupid of me as that would be like a Viennese restaurant calling itself Hitler Mitlo. My confusion wasn\u2019t eased when I discovered that Franco Manca, like Ask Pizza before it, is a pizza restaurant \u2013 the main difference being that Franco Manca serves sourdough pizza while Ask served what I think a gastronome would describe as normal pizza. So why the change? Was Ask doing badly? If so, what made someone think its problems would be solved by making the dough more sour? Just like when going mad, having seen one inexplicable thing, I started seeing them everywhere. That\u2019s how it was with Franco Mancas. So, out of curiosity, on one of the occasions when I would otherwise have gone to Pizza Express, I went to a Franco Manca. I thought it was fine, but no better than Pizza Express. Is that sort of one-off curiosity visit enough to sustain such a chain? It\u2019s almost like going to see a film because you\u2019ve noticed so many posters for it \u2013 but, instead of posters, you\u2019ve seen actual branches of the restaurant on every high street. So, if you\u2019ve got time on your hands, maybe you pop in. If you don\u2019t, you miss the release \u2013 personally, I never got round to Prezzo or Chimichanga and lots of them have closed now. Maybe they\u2019ll bring out a DVD. Obviously if, having popped in, you find this new chain restaurant to be really terrific, and better than the chain restaurants you\u2019ve previously frequented, then this all makes sense. But how often does that happen? Not very often, judging by the parlous financial state of the sector. Poor old Jamie Oliver seems to be constantly cranking out books and TV shows purely to pay the staff wages in all the deserted branches of Jamie\u2019s Italian. And every other chain, from Carluccio\u2019s to Byron, seems to be feverishly closing branches or renegotiating rents. I\u2019m no businessman, which will become obvious when I say that, to me, all this feels like a huge waste of time and energy: this desperation to take any half-decent food service concept and then strain every financial sinew to immediately open versions of it in every town, city and shopping centre, only for the resultant frail, over-stretched company to collapse in the face of the lightest breeze of consumer parsimony. What\u2019s the point? Patisserie Valerie was a small good thing and now it\u2019s bloated and broken, a dispiriting echo of the effect of too much cake.",

      "body": "<p>One rainy Saturday morning in October, several hundred people gathered at a Manchester hotel for QED, the UK\u2019s largest convention of science and skepticism (they prefer the American spelling). Pitched towards rationalists, the event is an opportunity to hear popular science communicators discuss the issues that concern skeptics the most: the rising tide of misinformation, the peril of credulity and the urgency of evidence-based facts. The event had sold out in July and those lucky enough to nab a ticket swarmed the hotel, roving the three floors across which it was held. In the convention\u2019s main hall there were glitzy chandeliers and mirrors, and a stage backed by large screens, in the TED talks mould. Over coffee, some guests traded tales of pseudoscience. Others denounced quackery. In her opening address the convention\u2019s MC, <a href=\"http://helenarney.com/\" title=\"\">Helen Arney</a>, a ukulele player and former physicist, expressed sympathy for hotel guests unconnected to the convention, as if they had unwittingly stumbled into a lion\u2019s den of critical thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve already heard some amazing conversations in lifts,\u201d she said, \u201cbetween people who have no idea what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>On the event\u2019s website, <a href=\"https://qedcon.org/\" title=\"\">QED</a>, which stands for \u201cQuestion, Explore, Discover\u201d, is described as \u201ca weekend of science, reason and critical thinking\u201d, though it might justifiably be advertised as a get-together for the skeptical community. Lately their ranks have grown. In October, QED bagged its biggest crowd yet \u2013 in recent years, delegates have begun flying in from around the world, and turnouts have been steadily increasing at smaller events: panel discussions, pub meets, village hall gatherings.</p> <p>At QED, speakers gave presentations on topics with which most skeptics are familiar:the fallacies of the wellness industry, the history of poltergeists. But the underlining message related more to the skeptical process: how to become a more effective critical thinker, how to use that skill to better discern whether information is true or false, and how to share that information with a wider audience. \u201cSkepticism isn\u2019t just about saying Bigfoot isn\u2019t real,\u201d one skeptic told me during a break between talks. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool set!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In anxious times,</strong></em> that tool set is important. In the wake of the 2016 US presidential election, a Pew Research Center study found that 23% of American adults had shared a false news story, sometimes knowingly. Shortly afterward, Oxford dictionaries selected \u201cpost-truth\u201d as its word of the year because, following significant disinformation campaigns \u2013 Trump\u2019s election, Brexit \u2013 the expression had evolved from \u201cbeing a peripheral term to being a mainstay in political commentary\u201d. (The <em>Collins English Dictionary</em> selected \u201cfake news\u201d for its list 12 months later.) Last year <em>Wired</em> magazine co-founder Kevin Kelly told the BBC: \u201cTruth is no longer dictated by authorities, but is networked by peers. For every fact there is a counter-fact.\u201d What is demonstrably correct, these days, seems negligible.</p> <p>This should be a scary thought for all of us, though the worry can sometimes slip from the forefront of our minds. The past few years have been rough \u2013 it is tiresome to evaluate information constantly, even when there are clues to suggest it might be inaccurate or, worse, deliberately distorted. It is easier, sometimes, to believe what you prefer to believe. But for skeptics, approaching information in any way other than with rational curiosity is counter- intuitive, particularly now, when dangerous untruths seep into the culture like water into earth. \u201cMost people are not by nature critical thinkers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/french/\" title=\"\">Chris French</a>, a British psychologist, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a particularly natural way of thinking. So, skeptics, we\u2019re kind of a weird bunch. We say, \u2018<em>Really?</em>\u2019 We say, \u2018Show us the evidence!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For a decade, French was the editor of <em><a href=\"https://www.skeptic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Skeptic</a></em>, the UK\u2019s go-to journal. To the question, \u201cWhat should we believe?\u201d, he responds: \u201cFind out for yourself!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a situation where fake news and claims of conspiracy have been so much a part of our political and wider culture,\u201d he told me. \u201cFake news has always been there. But it\u2019s not had the prominence it has now, thanks partly to the internet, and partly to Donald Trump. And there\u2019s never been a greater need for people to try to make a distinction between claims that are true and claims that are false \u2013 no greater need for critical thinking!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like it that there are people out there selling ideas that aren\u2019t true</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The American skeptical movement, which emerged in the 1970s and later spawned a UK counterpart, involves several large organisations, including the <a href=\"https://www.csicop.org/\" title=\"\">Committee for Skeptical Inquiry</a>, which promotes \u201cthe use of reason in examining important issues\u201d (Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov were founding members). In contrast, British skepticism has a grassroots verve. There is no UK-wide organising body, and the community is eager and committed but haphazard. Some groups organise lectures or record podcasts. Others venture into activism, and co-ordinate stunt-like investigations to expose local charlatans: psychics, chiropractors, naturopaths (the charismatic health guru with a winning smile but no academic qualifications is the skeptic\u2019s mortal enemy). In all cases, the aim is to debunk suspicious fringe claims: that the Earth is flat (it is not); that homeopathy is a viable treatment for cancer (untrue); that the MMR vaccine causes autism (nope); that, for a fee, a medium is able to retrieve loving messages from your childhood pet (nice idea, never proven).</p> <p>Skeptics often consider themselves a last line of defence against irrational beliefs. When inaccurate information has been accepted in the culture as truth and scientific agencies have brushed aside their responsibility to correct the incorrect, the skeptical community mobilises, though sometimes it can appear as if it\u2019s using a ladle to bale out a sinking ship. In his book <em><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Skeptics-Guide-to-the-Universe-Audiobook/1473696437?source_code=M2M14DFT1BkSH082015011R&amp;ds_rl=1235779\" title=\"\">The Skeptics\u2019 Guide to the Universe</a></em> (sold out at the QED bookstall), the American skeptic and neurologist Steven Novella describes contemporary skepticism as \u201ca generational struggle, one that will likely never end\u201d.</p> <p><em><strong>QED is reflective</strong></em> of skepticism\u2019s rising urgency: among long-serving rationalists, the audience was peppered with people new to the movement. The convention is run by a five-person committee that includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-marshall\" title=\"\">Michael Marshall</a>, a 35-year-old from Liverpool. I spoke to Marshall in the lead-up to the weekend, during a brief reprieve from what he called \u201cthe maelstrom of event management\u201d. QED has been organised annually since 2011, around the time Marshall began to pursue a career in skepticism full-time (an English graduate, he had been working in marketing). He now describes himself as a \u201cfull-time skeptical investigator\u201d, a position that involves \u201ctravelling around the country, encouraging groups of strangers to doubt stuff\u201d.</p> <p>When he is not organising QED, Marshall works for the <a href=\"https://goodthinkingsociety.org/\" title=\"\">Good Thinking Society</a>, a non-profit organisation established by the science writer <a href=\"https://simonsingh.net/\" title=\"\">Simon Singh</a> that promotes rational inquiry. Much of Marshall\u2019s skeptical work is campaign-based: he and Singh mull over curious claims, and Marshall investigates, sometimes undercover, until he has enough information to raise public awareness and bring about social change. Targets can be small or large \u2013 local healers or the NHS. A few years ago, Marshall exposed a Liverpool palm reader by revealing that her predictions tended to stick to a script. In 2015, he orchestrated a campaign that challenged NHS spending on homeopathic treatments \u2013 alternative therapies without medical validation \u2013 a situation Marshall described as \u201cunlawful, and contrary to the best interest of local patients\u201d. One by one, clinical commissioners nationwide terminated homeopathic funding until, in August, it ceased almost entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879b1d1ae5a163151647b37af796656fde26a6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879b1d1ae5a163151647b37af796656fde26a6c2/0_0_888_1063/835.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of the middle part of a head with eyes, and a series of shapes, lines and colours above\" width=\"835\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weighing the facts: how do you know whether something is true or false?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nate Kitch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Skeptics don\u2019t always achieve such success. \u201cThe barrier to entry is your willingness to participate,\u201d Marshall told me, as though he knew not all campaigns had similar consequences. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the idea that there\u2019s someone out there selling ideas to people that aren\u2019t true.\u201d This is true of most skeptics, who are often as much disciples of empiricism as ethical warriors. Marshall regularly works on projects he considers morally just. \u201cI do a lot of investigations into alternative medicine,\u201d he told me, because \u201cin the worst cases, you actually see people turning down lifesaving medicine, convinced the natural treatment they\u2019re given by an alternative practitioner is going to save them.\u201d People have died, he said, but \u201cif we watch each other\u2019s backs, we\u2019ll stop each other falling into these kinds of pitfalls. That, for me, is why skepticism is hugely important.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall was due to give a talk at QED. He\u2019d been assigned the after-lunch spot, typically an attention graveyard, though he seemed confident he could energise the audience. Earlier in the year, Marshall had visited the UK\u2019s first Flat Earth conference, in Birmingham, and he was excited to share his findings. Before the talk he said his intention was not to pillory Flat Earth beliefs, but to explain what might turn a person against conventional science, and how their beliefs can become contagious.</p> <p>For much of the talk, Marshall was true to his word. An accomplished speaker, he prowled from one side of the stage to the other, tall and thin, dressed all in black and wearing a wireless microphone. But every now and then a comment would slip into derision, and the room would fill with a kind of patronising bellow. In those moments, the audience appeared less like a collection of truth-seekers and more like a group of smug know-it-alls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People believe in these things because they\u2019re comforting. Do I really want to take that away?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ask a skeptic if they enjoy their informed position and, more often than you\u2019d imagine, they\u2019ll demur. These days, the truth can be a burden. French told me, \u201cIf someone\u2019s into astrology, you can say, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no science to support that.\u2019 If they\u2019re into alternative medicine, you can say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s rubbish.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cPeople stop inviting you to parties.\u201d I heard similar stories at QED. The convention had opened with a dramatic video in which a convincing David Attenborough impersonator voiced over a wildlife documentary pastiche, which mined the struggle of skepticism for laughs. \u201cThis rare creature swims against a seemingly overwhelming tide of irrationality,\u201d fake Attenborough said, \u201cin a quiet and almost entirely ineffectual way.\u201d The audience chuckled, knowingly. He went on, \u201cThese skeptics can be identified by their almost pungent air of superiority.\u201d</p> <p>This is the skeptic\u2019s struggle. How do you tell a man whose wife recently died that there\u2019s no proof his medium can offer contact? How do you convince a woman terminally ill with cancer not to spend the last months of her life ingesting a provably ineffective miracle cure? \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to attack alternative medicine in the abstract,\u201d French told me. \u201cBut people believe in these things because they\u2019re comforting. Do I really want to take that away from them?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>A week before QED,</strong></em> I went to a talk by <a href=\"https://reporter.mcgill.ca/jonathan-jarry-pseudoscience-buster-with-the-mcgill-office-for-science-and-society/\" title=\"\">Jonathan Jarry</a>, a Canadian skeptic, who at the convention took part in a panel titled \u201c#NoFilter: Scrutinising Social Media Skepticism\u201d. At the talk, which had been organised by French, an audience member asked how to approach sensitive subjects with family members, and a discussion broke out. Jarry advised a friendly, open approach: be cautious, present the facts, but don\u2019t push too hard. It was a position French agreed with, and the other skeptics in the room all nodded along. When I spoke to Deborah Hyde, <em>The Skeptic</em>\u2019s current editor, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you attract anybody to your way of thinking when you\u2019re a knob about it.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Jarry told me, \u201cPerhaps the hardest job of a skeptic is to persuade people.\u201d Some find it so difficult they give up. \u201cBut there are a lot of people out there who just don\u2019t know where the facts lie \u2013 what is real, what isn\u2019t. And there are interest groups that are pushing disinformation on purpose, to confuse people, to sow doubt.\u201d Jarry considers his work a kind of \u201cSisyphean struggle\u201d. Every day he encounters new forms of misinformation: inaccurate newspaper stories, fabricated videos. \u201cBut for me,\u201d he said, \u201cit always boils down to: if no skeptics do this, then the other side wins.\u201d And then what are we left with? \u201cFalsehoods and lies,\u201d he said.</p>",

In all cases, the aim is to debunk suspicious fringe claims: that the Earth is flat (it is not); that homeopathy is a viable treatment for cancer (untrue); that the MMR vaccine causes autism (nope); that, for a fee, a medium is able to retrieve loving messages from your childhood pet (nice idea, never proven). Skeptics often consider themselves a last line of defence against irrational beliefs. When inaccurate information has been accepted in the culture as truth and scientific agencies have brushed aside their responsibility to correct the incorrect, the skeptical community mobilises, though sometimes it can appear as if it\u2019s using a ladle to bale out a sinking ship. In his book The Skeptics\u2019 Guide to the Universe (sold out at the QED bookstall), the American skeptic and neurologist Steven Novella describes contemporary skepticism as \u201ca generational struggle, one that will likely never end\u201d. QED is reflective of skepticism\u2019s rising urgency: among long-serving rationalists, the audience was peppered with people new to the movement. The convention is run by a five-person committee that includes Michael Marshall, a 35-year-old from Liverpool. I spoke to Marshall in the lead-up to the weekend, during a brief reprieve from what he called \u201cthe maelstrom of event management\u201d. QED has been organised annually since 2011, around the time Marshall began to pursue a career in skepticism full-time (an English graduate, he had been working in marketing). He now describes himself as a \u201cfull-time skeptical investigator\u201d, a position that involves \u201ctravelling around the country, encouraging groups of strangers to doubt stuff\u201d. When he is not organising QED, Marshall works for the Good Thinking Society, a non-profit organisation established by the science writer Simon Singh that promotes rational inquiry. Much of Marshall\u2019s skeptical work is campaign-based: he and Singh mull over curious claims, and Marshall investigates, sometimes undercover, until he has enough information to raise public awareness and bring about social change. Targets can be small or large \u2013 local healers or the NHS. A few years ago, Marshall exposed a Liverpool palm reader by revealing that her predictions tended to stick to a script. In 2015, he orchestrated a campaign that challenged NHS spending on homeopathic treatments \u2013 alternative therapies without medical validation \u2013 a situation Marshall described as \u201cunlawful, and contrary to the best interest of local patients\u201d. One by one, clinical commissioners nationwide terminated homeopathic funding until, in August, it ceased almost entirely. Skeptics don\u2019t always achieve such success. \u201cThe barrier to entry is your willingness to participate,\u201d Marshall told me, as though he knew not all campaigns had similar consequences. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the idea that there\u2019s someone out there selling ideas to people that aren\u2019t true.\u201d This is true of most skeptics, who are often as much disciples of empiricism as ethical warriors. Marshall regularly works on projects he considers morally just. \u201cI do a lot of investigations into alternative medicine,\u201d he told me, because \u201cin the worst cases, you actually see people turning down lifesaving medicine, convinced the natural treatment they\u2019re given by an alternative practitioner is going to save them.\u201d People have died, he said, but \u201cif we watch each other\u2019s backs, we\u2019ll stop each other falling into these kinds of pitfalls. That, for me, is why skepticism is hugely important.\u201d Marshall was due to give a talk at QED. He\u2019d been assigned the after-lunch spot, typically an attention graveyard, though he seemed confident he could energise the audience. Earlier in the year, Marshall had visited the UK\u2019s first Flat Earth conference, in Birmingham, and he was excited to share his findings. Before the talk he said his intention was not to pillory Flat Earth beliefs, but to explain what might turn a person against conventional science, and how their beliefs can become contagious. For much of the talk, Marshall was true to his word. An accomplished speaker, he prowled from one side of the stage to the other, tall and thin, dressed all in black and wearing a wireless microphone. But every now and then a comment would slip into derision, and the room would fill with a kind of patronising bellow. In those moments, the audience appeared less like a collection of truth-seekers and more like a group of smug know-it-alls. Ask a skeptic if they enjoy their informed position and, more often than you\u2019d imagine, they\u2019ll demur. These days, the truth can be a burden. French told me, \u201cIf someone\u2019s into astrology, you can say, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no science to support that.\u2019 If they\u2019re into alternative medicine, you can say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s rubbish.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cPeople stop inviting you to parties.\u201d I heard similar stories at QED. The convention had opened with a dramatic video in which a convincing David Attenborough impersonator voiced over a wildlife documentary pastiche, which mined the struggle of skepticism for laughs. \u201cThis rare creature swims against a seemingly overwhelming tide of irrationality,\u201d fake Attenborough said, \u201cin a quiet and almost entirely ineffectual way.\u201d The audience chuckled, knowingly. He went on, \u201cThese skeptics can be identified by their almost pungent air of superiority.\u201d This is the skeptic\u2019s struggle. How do you tell a man whose wife recently died that there\u2019s no proof his medium can offer contact? How do you convince a woman terminally ill with cancer not to spend the last months of her life ingesting a provably ineffective miracle cure? \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to attack alternative medicine in the abstract,\u201d French told me. \u201cBut people believe in these things because they\u2019re comforting. Do I really want to take that away from them?\u201d A week before QED, I went to a talk by Jonathan Jarry, a Canadian skeptic, who at the convention took part in a panel titled \u201c#NoFilter: Scrutinising Social Media Skepticism\u201d. At the talk, which had been organised by French, an audience member asked how to approach sensitive subjects with family members, and a discussion broke out. Jarry advised a friendly, open approach: be cautious, present the facts, but don\u2019t push too hard. It was a position French agreed with, and the other skeptics in the room all nodded along. When I spoke to Deborah Hyde, The Skeptic\u2019s current editor, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you attract anybody to your way of thinking when you\u2019re a knob about it.\u201d Later, Jarry told me, \u201cPerhaps the hardest job of a skeptic is to persuade people.\u201d Some find it so difficult they give up. \u201cBut there are a lot of people out there who just don\u2019t know where the facts lie \u2013 what is real, what isn\u2019t. And there are interest groups that are pushing disinformation on purpose, to confuse people, to sow doubt.\u201d Jarry considers his work a kind of \u201cSisyphean struggle\u201d. Every day he encounters new forms of misinformation: inaccurate newspaper stories, fabricated videos. \u201cBut for me,\u201d he said, \u201cit always boils down to: if no skeptics do this, then the other side wins.\u201d And then what are we left with? \u201cFalsehoods and lies,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A \u201cvery contrite\u201d Duke of Edinburgh has personally apologised for his part in a car crash to a woman who was left with a broken wrist. In a letter to Emma Fairweather, Prince Philip, 97, suggested glare from the winter sun may have been to blame for the incident as he pulled out from a side road on to the A149 near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on 17 January. His apology emerged following widespread criticism of him and Buckingham Palace over the handling of the incident. Fairweather called the duke \u201chighly insensitive and inconsiderate\u201d after he was photographed less than 48 hours later at the wheel of a replacement car without a seatbelt on. She joined calls for him to be prosecuted if found to be at fault over the collision. In a typed letter to Fairweather, seen by the Sunday Mirror, Philip wrote: \u201cI would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley crossroads. I have been across that crossing any number of times and I know very well the amount of traffic that uses that main road. \u201cIt was a bright sunny day and at about three in the afternoon, the sun was low over the Wash. In other words, the sun was shining over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming from the Dersingham direction, but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences.\u201d He added: \u201cI was somewhat shaken after the incident, but I was greatly relieved that none of you were seriously injured. As a crowd was beginning to gather, I was advised to return to Sandringham House by a local police officer. I have since learned that you suffered a broken arm. I am deeply sorry about this injury. \u201cI wish you a speedy recovery from a very distressing experience.\u201d The letter, dated 21 January, is signed: \u201cYours sincerely Philip.\u201d Norfolk police are continuing an investigation into the crash in which the duke\u2019s Land Rover Freelander overturned after the collision with a Kia in which Fairweather, 46, was a passenger. The 28-year-old female driver of the Kia received cuts to her knees. A nine-month-old baby boy who was a passenger in the Kia was uninjured.

It was not an isolated incident: in the two months from mid-November, 40 hospitals in Venezuela monitored by a local doctors group suffered power cuts lasting an average of three hours a day.

But the battle for power in Venezuela is not over. Maduro has broken off relations with the US. He can count on support from Cuba and Russia and the quiescence of China.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a greenhouse at the back of my local garden centre where they keep the big houseplants and each one is carefully labelled: \u201cPlant\u201d. I buy one at a time to avoid ongoing domestic dispute and they collect greenly in my house under varying levels of care. Varying levels of care, but infinite love, love I learned from my parents\u2019 relationship with a plant that lives at the top of their stairs which they call the \u201cmoon flower\u201d. I\u2019ve identified it online as a night-blooming cereus \u2013 further, an <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/05/flatworms-epiphyllum-oxypetalum\" title=\"\">Epiphyllum oxypetalum</a></em>, and my sister and I receive texts alerting us to news of an opening bud. My parents will have woken to a smell, sickly but good, like someone\u2019s caramelising a memory, and they will tell us to be round at dusk. Because then we can stand on the stairs and watch it open, actually watch the petals creak open, until it is there basking in the moonlight, that smell now quite raw and conquering. By morning the flower will have died, and hang from a leaf like a washed up squid.</p> <p>When I moved house, my dad gave me a cutting, which now stands dwarfed by a giant version I found in the garden centre bin. But much as I love the garden centre with its jolly disregard for potted things, my preferred way to acquire new plants is via adoption. It\u2019s a similar feeling I get on my weekly tour of the local charity shops \u2013 the cancer one is good for books, the hospice one is better for furniture, and the one raising funds for sick children is excellent for pottery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the neighbourhood charity shops are bursting in the wake of Kondo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All are bursting in the wake of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/dec/30/dont-mess-with-marie-tidying-up-with-author-netflix-star-marie-kondo\" title=\"\">Kondo</a></em>, our neighbourhood having watched the entire series in a single weekend, talked about it endlessly at supermarket checkouts, on phones to daughters, in newspaper columns, etc, found joy lacking in 99% of their possessions, shovelled them into a binbag and dumped it on the pavement outside Barnardos at midnight. Which is great for me, a person that read Marie Kondo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/14/decluttering-a-load-of-junk-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying\" title=\"\">book in 2015</a> and concluded that, actually, I love stuff, that stuff is brilliant, often reminding me who I am; and that clutter is just matter out of place.</p> <p>So I buy a lot of homemade pots, a lot of vase-like structures made during a difficult period in someone\u2019s life, glazed and signed hopefully, that have sat on a shelf filled with pencils and old screws until one day their owner realises their life has improved, or at least moved beyond the short-lived pottery class crisis of 1991, and that their misshaped vessels are holding mainly resentment. The pots, often brown, with occasional patterns made with thumbs, call to me from among the Sports Direct mugs, and part of me buys them because I\u2019m fond of things handmade, but a more complicated part buys them because I pity them.</p> <p>One particular vase springs to mind, in the shop for awful mental health, which the shop assistant was openly laughing at. He was holding it, and he was laughing at it, and he was saying: \u201cDunno man, what even is it?\u201d It was a vase, well. A vase in the shape of a very robust toilet roll, painted green with brown details, and extremely heavy. I offered \u00a32 for it, he talked me down to 50p.</p> <p>When my boyfriend works nights I go to bed early and scroll gleefully through local websites searching for unwanted plants that I can resurrect. \u201cHealthy and big\u201d ads will typically start, or \u201cCan anyone care for my baby?\u201d As with the pots, I like to feel that I\u2019m rescuing them. We once drove to an estate in Stanmore where a woman showed us the cactus she\u2019d bought from Ikea when it first opened. Having arrived the size of a lightbulb, today it stood, slightly bowed in the corner of a smoky living room, 6ft something in a plastic pot. She called her lodger out of bed with his girlfriend to try and help us move it, but even as he helped shuffle it across the carpet we knew it wouldn\u2019t fit in the car.</p> <p>The next day, her neighbours brought it round, having laid a hundred blankets over their laps and squeezed it into the boot. Now sharp new growths make its silhouette slightly fuzzy against the window, and it stands delighted and massive, bringing me daily joy. It joined a large and as yet unidentified plant with fingerlike leaves whose previous owner, a stranger from Gumtree, needed to get rid of it because it \u201cscared her boyfriend\u201d.</p> <p>I love them all, my large prickly sons, perhaps too much \u2013 they need far less water than I want to give them. I fuss. I move them too much. I repot with abandon. Delighting in a new shoot on a small plant this morning, I pulled it off. Often I must smother the thought that actually all these plants (a room full, with more scattered wildly around the house, reaching, reaching for the light) would live better lives without my clumsy interventions. That they would thrive untouched by my cold meat hands. That I\u2019m not rescuing them, but instead, they\u2019re rescuing me.</p> <h2>And another thing\u2026</h2> <p>I\u2019ve just read Pulitzer prize-winning feminist Susan Faludi\u2019s <em><strong>In the Darkroom</strong></em>, a book about reconnecting with her macho father after they transitioned to female. One extraordinary element is Stefanie\u2019s past as an airbrusher of fashion photographs. When they meet she\u2019s using her skills to transform her own image through similar means.</p> <p>This morning I tried a <strong>\u00a315 coffee</strong> from a farmer in Yemen, via Le Caf\u00e9 Alain Ducasse. It was delicate, almost tea-like, and they served it with tiny doll-sized slabs of dark chocolate, and a side shot of something like ice tea. I still feel quite high.</p> <p>The<strong> </strong><em>Observer Magazine\u2019s </em>own agony aunt, the wise and brilliant <strong>Mariella Frostrup,</strong> has published a collection of the greatest escapades ever experienced by women, including Junko Tabei, the first woman to climb Everest, and Nellie Bly, who circumnavigated the globe in under 80 days. <em>Wild Women</em> is out now.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter<a href=\"http:\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a greenhouse at the back of my local garden centre where they keep the big houseplants and each one is carefully labelled: \u201cPlant\u201d. I buy one at a time to avoid ongoing domestic dispute and they collect greenly in my house under varying levels of care. Varying levels of care, but infinite love, love I learned from my parents\u2019 relationship with a plant that lives at the top of their stairs which they call the \u201cmoon flower\u201d. I\u2019ve identified it online as a night-blooming cereus \u2013 further, an Epiphyllum oxypetalum, and my sister and I receive texts alerting us to news of an opening bud. My parents will have woken to a smell, sickly but good, like someone\u2019s caramelising a memory, and they will tell us to be round at dusk. Because then we can stand on the stairs and watch it open, actually watch the petals creak open, until it is there basking in the moonlight, that smell now quite raw and conquering. By morning the flower will have died, and hang from a leaf like a washed up squid. When I moved house, my dad gave me a cutting, which now stands dwarfed by a giant version I found in the garden centre bin. But much as I love the garden centre with its jolly disregard for potted things, my preferred way to acquire new plants is via adoption. It\u2019s a similar feeling I get on my weekly tour of the local charity shops \u2013 the cancer one is good for books, the hospice one is better for furniture, and the one raising funds for sick children is excellent for pottery. All are bursting in the wake of Kondo, our neighbourhood having watched the entire series in a single weekend, talked about it endlessly at supermarket checkouts, on phones to daughters, in newspaper columns, etc, found joy lacking in 99% of their possessions, shovelled them into a binbag and dumped it on the pavement outside Barnardos at midnight. Which is great for me, a person that read Marie Kondo\u2019s book in 2015 and concluded that, actually, I love stuff, that stuff is brilliant, often reminding me who I am; and that clutter is just matter out of place. So I buy a lot of homemade pots, a lot of vase-like structures made during a difficult period in someone\u2019s life, glazed and signed hopefully, that have sat on a shelf filled with pencils and old screws until one day their owner realises their life has improved, or at least moved beyond the short-lived pottery class crisis of 1991, and that their misshaped vessels are holding mainly resentment. The pots, often brown, with occasional patterns made with thumbs, call to me from among the Sports Direct mugs, and part of me buys them because I\u2019m fond of things handmade, but a more complicated part buys them because I pity them. One particular vase springs to mind, in the shop for awful mental health, which the shop assistant was openly laughing at. He was holding it, and he was laughing at it, and he was saying: \u201cDunno man, what even is it?\u201d It was a vase, well. A vase in the shape of a very robust toilet roll, painted green with brown details, and extremely heavy. I offered \u00a32 for it, he talked me down to 50p. When my boyfriend works nights I go to bed early and scroll gleefully through local websites searching for unwanted plants that I can resurrect. \u201cHealthy and big\u201d ads will typically start, or \u201cCan anyone care for my baby?\u201d As with the pots, I like to feel that I\u2019m rescuing them. We once drove to an estate in Stanmore where a woman showed us the cactus she\u2019d bought from Ikea when it first opened. Having arrived the size of a lightbulb, today it stood, slightly bowed in the corner of a smoky living room, 6ft something in a plastic pot. She called her lodger out of bed with his girlfriend to try and help us move it, but even as he helped shuffle it across the carpet we knew it wouldn\u2019t fit in the car. The next day, her neighbours brought it round, having laid a hundred blankets over their laps and squeezed it into the boot. Now sharp new growths make its silhouette slightly fuzzy against the window, and it stands delighted and massive, bringing me daily joy. It joined a large and as yet unidentified plant with fingerlike leaves whose previous owner, a stranger from Gumtree, needed to get rid of it because it \u201cscared her boyfriend\u201d. I love them all, my large prickly sons, perhaps too much \u2013 they need far less water than I want to give them. I fuss. I move them too much. I repot with abandon. Delighting in a new shoot on a small plant this morning, I pulled it off. Often I must smother the thought that actually all these plants (a room full, with more scattered wildly around the house, reaching, reaching for the light) would live better lives without my clumsy interventions. That they would thrive untouched by my cold meat hands. That I\u2019m not rescuing them, but instead, they\u2019re rescuing me. And another thing\u2026 I\u2019ve just read Pulitzer prize-winning feminist Susan Faludi\u2019s In the Darkroom, a book about reconnecting with her macho father after they transitioned to female. One extraordinary element is Stefanie\u2019s past as an airbrusher of fashion photographs. When they meet she\u2019s using her skills to transform her own image through similar means. This morning I tried a \u00a315 coffee from a farmer in Yemen, via Le Caf\u00e9 Alain Ducasse. It was delicate, almost tea-like, and they served it with tiny doll-sized slabs of dark chocolate, and a side shot of something like ice tea. I still feel quite high.

      "body": "<p>Doggerland is the vast, fertile area that once connected the east coast of England to mainland Europe \u2013 until, in around 5000BC, it disappeared beneath a rising sea. How do we know of its existence? Was it really there, or did someone just dream it up? The strange and interesting thing is that, in a sense, it is a new place as well as an old one. Only at the beginning of the 20th century did people start to be aware of it, when new deep sea trawling nets began to drag up not only the bones of mammoths, but also those of animals from the Holocene period, which started 11,500 years ago; and not until the 1990s did it finally receive its name, when the archaeologist Professor Bryony Cole decided to call it Doggerland.</p> <p>Cole chose Doggerland because it placed it alongside England, Jutland, Friesland and all the other lands around the North Sea. But she also liked the etymology of dogger, which may derive from the Danish word, <em>dag</em>, meaning dagger. The pliable stems of dogwood were used by Mesolithic peoples for making fish-traps, while the hard heartwood was used for spears and, yes, a kind of dagger. Dogwood, moreover, used to grow on Dogger Bank, the sandbank that was once part of Doggerland. Having received a grant to study the relationship between British wetland archaeology and this submerged landscape, Cole slowly mapped it out \u2013 a primula, which grows only in Yorkshire, must have migrated from eastern Europe before the land was lost; the distribution of certain voles close to Hadrian\u2019s Wall indicated a connection with western Europe - and as she did, it grew ever larger, spreading like a stain. To what might we compare Doggerland? Its nearest equivalent, in terms of somewhere we can still see today, are the marshy coastal landscapes of Denmark, like the place where <a href=\"http://www.tollundman.dk/\" title=\"\">Tollund Man</a> was found in 1950.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Evidence of some of the oldest human occupation in England can be found on the beach by Pontins, near Lowestoft</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In her new book, Julia Blackburn, that most individual of writers, sets out to get as close as possible to Doggerland, her imagination having been caught by the strange, fossilised treasures she has collected down the years from the beaches and cliffs near her home in Suffolk. She conjures it up courtesy of various objects, and through conversations with other people: fossil hunters, academics, curators. In the Silkeborg Museum in Jutland she communes, too, with Tollund Man. Bat-like and gleaming, Tollund Man died in 375-210BC, yet he seems to her as if he is \u201cabout to laugh at a joke that appeared in his dream\u201d. She looks at him, and remembers how her husband, as he lay dying, reminded her of him \u2013 and so time concertinas, the distant and the near crashing into one another like waves. It is disorienting. But there is comfort in it, too. We are but specks in the universe. Death comes to us all. The seas are now rising again, but even this, though terrifying, is nothing new.</p> <p>Look, and just below the surface of things you can quite easily find traces of the catastrophe that befell Doggerland, \u201cdeep time\u201d beneath the soles of your feet. Among other things, Blackburn offers for our inspection the hair of a Siberian mammoth, very red, given to her by a generous Dutchman; the bones of a hawthorn-eating rhinoceros, found two minutes from a car park in West Runton, Norfolk; the skeleton of a Mesolithic baby that was laid, in death, on a swan\u2019s wing, and discovered in Denmark. Evidence of some of the oldest human occupation in England, she tells us, about to head outside again, can be found on the beach by Pontins, near Lowestoft. A poster advertising an Elvis-alike, a car park for cabaret artists only, a restaurant disguised as an ocean liner, and then\u2026 Blackburn bends down, and in her hand is a stone that might just be a worked flint. This \u2013 hello, campers! \u2013 is time travel of the saltiest, cheeriest kind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72e3a59fdabae477eebff351c1151411cc4e0b3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72e3a59fdabae477eebff351c1151411cc4e0b3e/0_0_540_698/387.jpg\" alt=\"One of Enrique Brinkmann\u2019s \u2018scratchy, ghostly\u2019 illustrations for Time Song\" width=\"387\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Enrique Brinkmann\u2019s \u2018scratchy, ghostly\u2019 illustrations for Time Song.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enrique Brinkmann, courtesy of Rosenfeld Porcini Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all these marvels, though, I struggled with <em>Time Song</em>.

      "body": "<p>A few months after my son was born, I quit my job to write full-time. This was great news for me, my family and my old job, as they had no idea how much stationery I\u2019d been stealing. The result has been mostly lovely, allowing me to do freelance commissions, start my book and write the gently humorous column you now hold in your riveted gaze. It\u2019s main benefit is that I get to spend more time with my son than most dads. With their own sons I mean\u2026 most dads don\u2019t get to spend any time with my son at all, but I digress.</p> <p>From 10am until 5pm, I work in the box room and my wife looks after the baby downstairs. Back in my office days, I\u2019d entertain dreams of freelance life unencumbered by a set location; an intrepid reporter, wearing a trilby with PRESS stuck to the brim, calling in scalding hot scoops from a battered payphone in some dusty warzone. Failing that, I could at least see myself typing rapidly in a corner seat at my local Costa. In actual fact, neither has come to pass.</p> <p>Despite all this time and space at my disposal, I find my reasons to leave the house are, like the rollerball pens, staplers and envelopes in my old office, growing mysteriously less numerous. When I\u2019m not writing, I steal some time with the boy and, since I don\u2019t have a day job, I quickly panic about the next deadline, put him down, and scurry back upstairs.</p> <p>I tweet and text, but I don\u2019t meet friends, or even call them. As a result, I\u2019ve become overly fond of those social interactions I can do from the comfort of my own home.

      "bodyText": "A few months after my son was born, I quit my job to write full-time. This was great news for me, my family and my old job, as they had no idea how much stationery I\u2019d been stealing. The result has been mostly lovely, allowing me to do freelance commissions, start my book and write the gently humorous column you now hold in your riveted gaze. It\u2019s main benefit is that I get to spend more time with my son than most dads. With their own sons I mean\u2026 most dads don\u2019t get to spend any time with my son at all, but I digress. From 10am until 5pm, I work in the box room and my wife looks after the baby downstairs. Back in my office days, I\u2019d entertain dreams of freelance life unencumbered by a set location; an intrepid reporter, wearing a trilby with PRESS stuck to the brim, calling in scalding hot scoops from a battered payphone in some dusty warzone. Failing that, I could at least see myself typing rapidly in a corner seat at my local Costa. In actual fact, neither has come to pass. Despite all this time and space at my disposal, I find my reasons to leave the house are, like the rollerball pens, staplers and envelopes in my old office, growing mysteriously less numerous. When I\u2019m not writing, I steal some time with the boy and, since I don\u2019t have a day job, I quickly panic about the next deadline, put him down, and scurry back upstairs. I tweet and text, but I don\u2019t meet friends, or even call them. As a result, I\u2019ve become overly fond of those social interactions I can do from the comfort of my own home. Charity knockers have stopped calling. After an interruption in my mobile service, I talked to my phone provider for nearly two hours. His name is Jayden and he has a baby, too, and he was definitely interested in hearing about mine, so long as I let him know how he could help with my query, eventually.

When I got myself to university \u2013 and was the first one in my family to do so \u2013 my parents were proud of me but on the other hand they just thought: \u201cWell, it\u2019s useful that you\u2019ve learned to type as well.

Do you regret that you grew apart?</strong><br>Yeah, there is regret there, especially about my relationship with my mum. We\u2019d been very, very close when I was young and then became so distant when I was a teenager. And it never completely healed and we ended up being on different sides of every argument and every conversation. But I\u2019d written in a song: \u201cWe\u2019re as unalike as frost and fire\u201d \u2013 implying that we were complete opposites.

Do you feel differently about those?</strong><br>Yeah, I don\u2019t think of them as performances really. When I first starting doing events for a book I thought: \u201cAm I going to clam up on stage and not be able to say anything?\u201d And actually I find it really easy. It\u2019s because you are just chatting and I find that books come to life, especially funny passages.</p> <p><strong>Your solo album, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/04/tracey-thorn-record-review-grown-up-feminist-bangers\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Record</em></strong></a><strong>, was very well received last year, and the books are very popular, too. Do you feel creatively satisfied?</strong><br>I do, and I feel very lucky to still feel like I\u2019m full of ideas. I think sometimes being in the beginning or the middle of things is almost the best bit. This sounds terrible, because it sounds so ungrateful, but I\u2019m never as excited by the aftermath of things: whether or not they are successful. It\u2019s lovely if they are, obviously, but actually the really exciting bit is when it\u2019s an idea in your head and you\u2019re getting working on it.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve called writing songs a \u201cminimalist art form\u201d. Is it liberating to write books as well then?</strong><br>It is. I like that you can start a conversation and then present the other side, walk around it and look at it from different angles. There are more opportunities maybe to express mixed feelings, which I\u2019m always keen on doing because I think it\u2019s true to the way we are as human beings. Having mixed feelings is something that should be stressed more and more.<br></p>",

It\u2019s because you are just chatting and I find that books come to life, especially funny passages. Your solo album, Record, was very well received last year, and the books are very popular, too. Do you feel creatively satisfied? I do, and I feel very lucky to still feel like I\u2019m full of ideas. I think sometimes being in the beginning or the middle of things is almost the best bit. This sounds terrible, because it sounds so ungrateful, but I\u2019m never as excited by the aftermath of things: whether or not they are successful. It\u2019s lovely if they are, obviously, but actually the really exciting bit is when it\u2019s an idea in your head and you\u2019re getting working on it. You\u2019ve called writing songs a \u201cminimalist art form\u201d. Is it liberating to write books as well then? It is. I like that you can start a conversation and then present the other side, walk around it and look at it from different angles. There are more opportunities maybe to express mixed feelings, which I\u2019m always keen on doing because I think it\u2019s true to the way we are as human beings. Having mixed feelings is something that should be stressed more and more.",

It\u2019s a bold move, but one that could be destructive. There\u2019s a big difference between a protest movement and a political party. A protest movement can be relatively inchoate, harnessing anger while embodying divergent viewpoints. A political party has to have a platform and a relatively coherent set of ideas. Where will the <em>gilets jaunes</em> candidates stand on immigration? Or taxation? Or equality?</p> <p>The movement has an anarchic set-up, in the main eschewing leaders. The protesters range from the far right to the far left, espousing both reactionary and progressive ideas. What unites them is a sense of anger and disillusionment, fury at their marginalisation and a hatred of the mainstream. In an age in which progressive social movements have largely crumbled, and in which there is widespread disenchantment with the very idea of collective social transformation, people\u2019s political anger often finds expression not through opposition to a particular policy or government but through a generalised hatred of the system.</p> <p>Such anger can be the foundation for enabling progressive change. It can also be the battering ram for reaction. Kicking out against the system can all too easily mutate into indiscriminately striking out against the \u201cother\u201d. Hence the rise of reactionary groups throughout Europe, groups that direct popular anger not just towards economic policy or social inequality but also towards migrants or Muslims, the homeless or the poor.</p> <p>The key question is: who will give shape to disaffection? It\u2019s a question that will now be posed in a sharper form to the <em>gilets jaunes</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

The significance of the \u201ccrossover day\u201d argument was the claim that Britain had become Remain not because opinions had changed but because the electorate had. From one perspective, this was simply a statistical insight about a political swing arising out of demographic shifts. From another perspective, it entrenches the view that the motor of change is demography rather than politics. That\u2019s a road we should all be wary of taking. Gilets jaunes\u2019 hate and anger is not a political manifesto The gilets jaunes protesters in France announced last week that they would be putting forward candidates in the forthcoming European elections. It\u2019s a bold move, but one that could be destructive. There\u2019s a big difference between a protest movement and a political party. A protest movement can be relatively inchoate, harnessing anger while embodying divergent viewpoints. A political party has to have a platform and a relatively coherent set of ideas. Where will the gilets jaunes candidates stand on immigration? Or taxation? Or equality? The movement has an anarchic set-up, in the main eschewing leaders. The protesters range from the far right to the far left, espousing both reactionary and progressive ideas. What unites them is a sense of anger and disillusionment, fury at their marginalisation and a hatred of the mainstream. In an age in which progressive social movements have largely crumbled, and in which there is widespread disenchantment with the very idea of collective social transformation, people\u2019s political anger often finds expression not through opposition to a particular policy or government but through a generalised hatred of the system. Such anger can be the foundation for enabling progressive change. It can also be the battering ram for reaction. Kicking out against the system can all too easily mutate into indiscriminately striking out against the \u201cother\u201d. Hence the rise of reactionary groups throughout Europe, groups that direct popular anger not just towards economic policy or social inequality but also towards migrants or Muslims, the homeless or the poor. The key question is: who will give shape to disaffection? It\u2019s a question that will now be posed in a sharper form to the gilets jaunes. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

The tournament starts with the first snowdrops and finishes with the first swallows. When this year\u2019s edition is over, the World Cup will be only six months and six days away, and the six teams, their players and coaches, will have a handful of August warm-ups left to finish getting ready for the tournament they have been working towards these last four years and which, if they win it, will define their playing lives. It is a thought that sharpens the mind.</p> <p>Right now the World Cup is not a topic either Joe Schmidt or Eddie Jones wants to dwell on. During the Six Nations launch last Wednesday both men said they were too busy planning for their opening game of the tournament, when their teams play each other in Dublin, to spare talk or thought on anything after. \u201cI\u2019m not looking as far as the World Cup.

They are at an all-time high in the world rankings after their famous first home win against New Zealand. Officially they are still a point-and-some behind the All Blacks but Steve Hansen, New Zealand\u2019s head coach, says the 16-9 win made them the lineal champions. \u201cAs of now, Ireland are the No 1 team in the world, so that the result makes them favourites for the World Cup.\u201d Hansen, like Jones and everyone else, knows that the Irish have never been so far as the semi-finals before and was happy to heap a little extra pressure on.</p> <p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ve got to carry it, mate, haven\u2019t they?\u201d Jones said, with a wicked little grin, when he was asked whether the stress would get to the Irish. Judging by the way their captain, Rory Best, was talking, they will handle it just fine.</p> <p>Best said that in their own minds Ireland were favourites for last year\u2019s championship too and, while all this hype is \u201csomething we can\u2019t get away from because we hear so much about it,\u201d he does not see why this year\u2019s championship will be any different \u201cjust because it\u2019s being shouted a little bit louder from external sources\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58323946669cd8e31e6bea1ba8d92fb118dd5d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58323946669cd8e31e6bea1ba8d92fb118dd5d8d/0_118_5472_3282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ireland and England captains, Rory Best and Owen Farrell, share a joke at the Six Nations launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ireland and England captains, Rory Best and Owen Farrell, share a joke at the Six Nations launch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a certain steady confidence about Schmidt, too, and his matter-of-fact evaluation of England\u2019s strengths. Unlike Jones, Schmidt does not like, or need, to play mind games. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard with Eddie, because you don\u2019t know if what he\u2019s saying is what he\u2019s really thinking so there\u2019s a bit of double jeopardy,\u201d Schmidt said. He is betting Jones is not bluffing when he talks about how brutal the match is going to be. \u201cI do think that power game is something they may well bring to Dublin.\u201d He winced as he listed off a few of the threats: Billy, Mako, Maro, Manu. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of bruises, really.\u201d</p> <p>As for England, Jones said the match \u201cisn\u2019t about making statements\u201d. But after a year in which they seemed to take three steps back, England could surely use the sort of resounding performance that would show they are right back on track, whatever he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in four World Cups,\u201d Jones continued, \u201cand the only thing that matters at the World Cup is how you are at the World Cup. How you are now doesn\u2019t affect how you are at the World Cup. So the only thing we\u2019re worried about now is being at our best for Ireland.

Wales have won nine Tests in a row now and risen to third in the rankings. All the while Gatland has been busy thinking about what went wrong in 2015. He says he has fixed it this time around. \u201cWe were decimated by injury in 2015,\u201d he said, \u201cand we spoke then about the plan for 2019. Twelve months ago I made a lot of changes when we played Italy and I was accused of being disrespectful but I was thinking about the bigger picture and the World Cup 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Gatland says his squad have the strength in depth to cope. We will soon find out if he is right, because Wales have got the longest injury list of anyone.

For the Scots, though, the real problem is not what happens at Murrayfield, where they have lost only one Six Nations game in three years, but away from it, where they have won only two in the same time, and both in Rome.</p> <p>Leave the last word for Brunel. \u201cWho\u2019s going to win?

      "bodyText": "In January spring still feels far away, never mind the summer beyond it. But the start of the Six Nations, like the first green shoots, is a sign they are on their way. The tournament starts with the first snowdrops and finishes with the first swallows. When this year\u2019s edition is over, the World Cup will be only six months and six days away, and the six teams, their players and coaches, will have a handful of August warm-ups left to finish getting ready for the tournament they have been working towards these last four years and which, if they win it, will define their playing lives. It is a thought that sharpens the mind. Right now the World Cup is not a topic either Joe Schmidt or Eddie Jones wants to dwell on. During the Six Nations launch last Wednesday both men said they were too busy planning for their opening game of the tournament, when their teams play each other in Dublin, to spare talk or thought on anything after. \u201cI\u2019m not looking as far as the World Cup. I\u2019m not really even looking as far as Scotland,\u201d said Schmidt. Ireland travel up to Murrayfield in the second week. It felt as if he and Jones were both protesting just a touch too much. Ireland start as favourites, for the first match and the championship. They are at an all-time high in the world rankings after their famous first home win against New Zealand. Officially they are still a point-and-some behind the All Blacks but Steve Hansen, New Zealand\u2019s head coach, says the 16-9 win made them the lineal champions. \u201cAs of now, Ireland are the No 1 team in the world, so that the result makes them favourites for the World Cup.\u201d Hansen, like Jones and everyone else, knows that the Irish have never been so far as the semi-finals before and was happy to heap a little extra pressure on. \u201cWell, they\u2019ve got to carry it, mate, haven\u2019t they?\u201d Jones said, with a wicked little grin, when he was asked whether the stress would get to the Irish. Judging by the way their captain, Rory Best, was talking, they will handle it just fine. Best said that in their own minds Ireland were favourites for last year\u2019s championship too and, while all this hype is \u201csomething we can\u2019t get away from because we hear so much about it,\u201d he does not see why this year\u2019s championship will be any different \u201cjust because it\u2019s being shouted a little bit louder from external sources\u201d. There was a certain steady confidence about Schmidt, too, and his matter-of-fact evaluation of England\u2019s strengths. Unlike Jones, Schmidt does not like, or need, to play mind games. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard with Eddie, because you don\u2019t know if what he\u2019s saying is what he\u2019s really thinking so there\u2019s a bit of double jeopardy,\u201d Schmidt said. He is betting Jones is not bluffing when he talks about how brutal the match is going to be. \u201cI do think that power game is something they may well bring to Dublin.\u201d He winced as he listed off a few of the threats: Billy, Mako, Maro, Manu. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of bruises, really.\u201d As for England, Jones said the match \u201cisn\u2019t about making statements\u201d. But after a year in which they seemed to take three steps back, England could surely use the sort of resounding performance that would show they are right back on track, whatever he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in four World Cups,\u201d Jones continued, \u201cand the only thing that matters at the World Cup is how you are at the World Cup. How you are now doesn\u2019t affect how you are at the World Cup. So the only thing we\u2019re worried about now is being at our best for Ireland. That\u2019s the only thing that concerns us.\u201d Warren Gatland, who seems so at ease at the start of his last year in charge of Wales, was the one coach who was willing to admit he was thinking about the bigger picture. \u201cWhile the focus is on having a good Six Nations, it\u2019s also on thinking about the end of the year.\u201d Wales start away in France and Gatland has said over and over again that, if they win in Paris, he thinks Wales will take the title too because \u201ctraditionally we\u2019re a team that, the more momentum and confidence we get early in this tournament, the stronger we get towards the end of it.\u201d After they play France Wales are taking 31 players to a six-day camp in Nice before their second game, against Italy in Rome, \u201cto replicate what\u2019s going to happen in the World Cup\u201d. Wales have won nine Tests in a row now and risen to third in the rankings. All the while Gatland has been busy thinking about what went wrong in 2015. He says he has fixed it this time around. \u201cWe were decimated by injury in 2015,\u201d he said, \u201cand we spoke then about the plan for 2019. Twelve months ago I made a lot of changes when we played Italy and I was accused of being disrespectful but I was thinking about the bigger picture and the World Cup 2019.\u201d Gatland says his squad have the strength in depth to cope. We will soon find out if he is right, because Wales have got the longest injury list of anyone. If he is, Wales look well placed. First, though, France. \u201cWarren\u2019s created continuity, stability, coherence,\u201d says Jacques Brunel, sounding envious. It is not so much that no one knows what to expect of the French, more that French do not know what to expect of themselves. When asked if he knew who was likely to be in his World Cup squad, Brunel shrugged, sighed and said no. \u201cWe don\u2019t have really an idea. I could tell you a skeleton of what the team will be, then we\u2019ll have to flesh the rest out.\u201d With five uncapped players in his Six Nations squad, it feels as if he is hoping it will all fall together at the last minute. In Edinburgh the Italians are desperate to prove they are on the same level as the Scots, while the Scots are desperate to prove they are not. \u201cItaly always believe they can beat us, and the players understand that,\u201d says Greig Laidlaw, \u201cbut we\u2019ll reiterate it.\u201d His opposing captain, Sergio Parisse, promised his team are not \u201ccoming to Murrayfield just to watch Scotland play rugby\u201d. For the Scots, though, the real problem is not what happens at Murrayfield, where they have lost only one Six Nations game in three years, but away from it, where they have won only two in the same time, and both in Rome. Leave the last word for Brunel. \u201cWho\u2019s going to win? Every year, you ask me this question, every year I say the same thing. This is January, the tournament is about to begin, nobody knows who is going to win.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When will we have sufficiently tortured each other with Martin Crimp\u2019s new play? The answer is: we already have. In Katie Mitchell\u2019s production it is both bludgeoning and baffling. Heavy with intent but underpropelled. Excitement has been generated by reports that <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/when-we-have-sufficiently-tortured-each-other\" title=\"\">When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other</a></strong>\u2019s violence made a woman faint. I doubt it: people frequently pass out at the theatre; the swooner may have wanted to absent herself.</p> <p>There is a real sadness in the waste of talent. This is the first time Cate Blanchett has appeared at the National. What\u2019s more, she has as her co-star the beautifully fluent Stephen Dillane (<em>Game of Thrones</em>). The demand for tickets was so clamorous that the National ran a ballot. Together, they do everything they can to make a clod-hopping examination of sexual politics look lively. Blanchett is both vulnerable and far-seeing: she flinches and flares, moving like a dancer; her face is pool-like, reflecting the action around her. Dillane switches dexterously from condescension to uncertainty. The heavily underlined idea is that a couple playing S&amp;M sex games in a garage (Vicki Mortimer\u2019s design is all-over concrete discomfort) are remaking traditional gender roles and looking at power in a patriarchal society. But though there is plenty of clothes-swapping, the images of servitude and release are not revelatory, or even provocative, but predictable. Blanchett gets to strap on a dildo, have her face bloodily carved, slip in turn into a man\u2019s suit and a bridal gown. Dillane sometimes wears a corset and a maid\u2019s hat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0864c06a1ac6d2bc3ecc07e59aa5a676df9da79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0864c06a1ac6d2bc3ecc07e59aa5a676df9da79/0_0_5741_3649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Gunning, Cate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane in When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Gunning, Cate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane in When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The denunciations of, among other things, poverty and fat-ism, are right-minded but laborious. One of these, questioning the right of a man to write in a woman\u2019s voice, goes to the source of Crimp\u2019s play: <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/pamela-by-samuel-richardson\" title=\"\">Samuel Richardson\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/pamela-by-samuel-richardson\" title=\"\">Pamela</a></em>, the 18th-century epistolary novel in which an apparently ultra-pure country girl (surely more complicated than she lets on) is continually propositioned by the \u201cmaster\u201d she eventually marries. The much-parodied Richardson is ridiculously verbose, but he knocks spots off this drama in projecting a sense of a personality at stake and of life on the wing.</p> <p>Letters can seem to catch a character mid-breath on stage, as is shown in <strong><a href=\"https://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/events/all-productions/dear_elizabeth\" title=\"\">Dear Elizabeth</a></strong>. Sarah Ruhl\u2019s play is based on the correspondence between two mighty poets: <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elizabeth-bishop\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Bishop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-lowell\" title=\"\">Robert Lowell</a>. Ellen McDougall\u2019s production puts a spin on this, presenting an unrehearsed reading, by two different actors each night. Seated at far ends of a traverse stage (Lowell was mostly in New York, Bishop in Brazil) they are handed stage directions to interpret on the hoof. These include scattering white confetti at a wedding and black flakes at a death \u2013 and Lowell emptying a bottle of water over his head (the actor blenches as he reads the instruction). McDougall\u2019s staging is as playful as it is intense.

      "body": "<p>Amid the hoopla of Tuesday\u2019s Oscar nominations (which saw numerous nods for this week\u2019s other big release, <em>Vice</em>), it was depressing to be faced with yet another all-male list in the best director category. The Oscars have always been skewed towards men (to date, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director\" title=\"\">Kathryn Bigelow</a> remains the only woman to have won), although it\u2019s been argued in the past that the awards merely reflected the gender bias of the film industry itself. Yet this year, potential contenders included such diverse film-makers as Chlo\u00e9 Zhao for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/16/the-rider-review\" title=\"\">The Rider</a></em>, Marielle Heller for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/can-you-ever-forgive-me-\" title=\"\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/25/lynne-ramsay-director-you-were-never-really-here-observer-interview\" title=\"\">Lynne Ramsay</a> for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/11/you-were-never-really-here-review-lynne-ramsay-joaquin-phoenix\" title=\"\">You Were Never Really Here</a></em>, Josie Rourke for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/20/mary-queen-of-scots-review-saoirse-ronan-margot-robbie-josie-rourke\" title=\"\">Mary Queen of Scots</a></em>, and Debra Granik for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/01/leave-no-trace-review-debra-granik-winters-bone\" title=\"\">Leave No Trace</a></em> \u2013 the last of which, my favourite film of 2018, received no Academy recognition whatsoever.</p> <p>To that impressive list I\u2019d add Karyn Kusama for <em>Destroyer</em>, another female-led feature which has flown entirely under the Oscars\u2019 radar. Boasting a powerhouse performance by Nicole Kidman in her best role since <em>To Die For</em>, this angst-ridden thriller is described by Kusama as a \u201cwoman-against-herself\u201d story in which a tortured cop is forced to confront the guilty ghosts of the past while becoming accountable for the actions of the present. There\u2019s a clear thematic debt to such character-driven 1970s classics as <em>Serpico</em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/jul/14/french-connection\" title=\"\">The French Connection</a></em>, but <em>Destroyer </em>also feels profoundly contemporary in its flipping of traditional gender roles. As the spectacularly addled Erin Bell, Kidman gives Harvey Keitel\u2019s <em>Bad Lieutenant</em> a run for his money in the decrepit antihero stakes, her awful admission that \u201cI\u2019m not good\u201d echoing Keitel\u2019s infamous howl: \u201cI did so many bad things\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Destroyer </em>opens like a sand-blasted remake of Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/04/blue-ruin-review-lean-mean-revenge-thriller\" title=\"\">Blue Ruin</a></em>, as a bedraggled Erin wakes up in her car. Her face is ravaged, as if it has been drowned in an ocean of pain, then left to dry in the scorching sun of self-loathing. Her eyes are vacant and translucent, her lips are parched, her countenance almost catatonic.

      "bodyText": "Amid the hoopla of Tuesday\u2019s Oscar nominations (which saw numerous nods for this week\u2019s other big release, Vice), it was depressing to be faced with yet another all-male list in the best director category. The Oscars have always been skewed towards men (to date, Kathryn Bigelow remains the only woman to have won), although it\u2019s been argued in the past that the awards merely reflected the gender bias of the film industry itself. Yet this year, potential contenders included such diverse film-makers as Chlo\u00e9 Zhao for The Rider, Marielle Heller for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Lynne Ramsay for You Were Never Really Here, Josie Rourke for Mary Queen of Scots, and Debra Granik for Leave No Trace \u2013 the last of which, my favourite film of 2018, received no Academy recognition whatsoever. To that impressive list I\u2019d add Karyn Kusama for Destroyer, another female-led feature which has flown entirely under the Oscars\u2019 radar. Boasting a powerhouse performance by Nicole Kidman in her best role since To Die For, this angst-ridden thriller is described by Kusama as a \u201cwoman-against-herself\u201d story in which a tortured cop is forced to confront the guilty ghosts of the past while becoming accountable for the actions of the present. There\u2019s a clear thematic debt to such character-driven 1970s classics as Serpico or The French Connection, but Destroyer also feels profoundly contemporary in its flipping of traditional gender roles. As the spectacularly addled Erin Bell, Kidman gives Harvey Keitel\u2019s Bad Lieutenant a run for his money in the decrepit antihero stakes, her awful admission that \u201cI\u2019m not good\u201d echoing Keitel\u2019s infamous howl: \u201cI did so many bad things\u2026\u201d Destroyer opens like a sand-blasted remake of Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s Blue Ruin, as a bedraggled Erin wakes up in her car. Her face is ravaged, as if it has been drowned in an ocean of pain, then left to dry in the scorching sun of self-loathing. Her eyes are vacant and translucent, her lips are parched, her countenance almost catatonic. When Erin rolls up at a crime scene, her colleagues treat her with disdain, advising her to \u201ctake care of your own personal shit\u201d, even when she slurringly tells them that she knows who killed the man now lying in a pool of blood. From here, the narrative (by regular writing collaborators Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi) flips back and forth between past and present, with ink-stained dollars found on the dead body apparently tying this case back to an FBI sting in which Erin worked undercover, many years ago. Now she sees the chance to settle a score with her criminal nemesis Silas, played with a snake-like sneer by the ever-versatile Toby Kebbell. But Erin also needs to address problems closer to home, with teenage daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn) showing signs of repeating the mistakes that apparently derailed her mother. Since making a splash in 2000 with her Sundance hit Girlfight, Kusama has earned plaudits among genre fans for directing the satirical 2009 high-school nightmare Jennifer\u2019s Body (from a script by Oscar winner Diablo Cody) and the 2015 psychological chiller The Invitation, alongside a segment of the female-directed frightfest anthology XX.

      "body": "<h2>The polar oceanographer</h2> <p><em>Madi Rosevear, 27, </em><em>PhD student, works in Antarctica and lives in Hobart, Tasmania</em></p> <p>I\u2019m about to go on my third research trip to Antarctica. For my first, we flew in from New Zealand to our base. From the air it\u2019s just blue and white: icebergs and sea ice, and valleys full of high-glaciated mountains. You don\u2019t see any wildlife and even seeing exposed rock is a rarity. It\u2019s stunning. The runway at the research base is ice, no tarmac. Stepping off the plane, the air is so cold and dry (it\u2019s often around -25C) that it instantly sucks the moisture out of everything. It can be hard to breathe.</p> <p>I\u2019m doing a PhD looking at how the oceans are melting Antarctic ice shelves. An ice shelf is like a cork in a bottle \u2013 if you pull out the cork, grounded ice starts to flow more rapidly into the ocean. The work I\u2019m doing is measuring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/east-antarctica-glacial-stronghold-melting-amid-climate-change\" title=\"\">Totten Glacier</a>, which is in quite a vulnerable region.</p> <p>We go in the summer months \u2013 December and January. There\u2019s daylight 24 hours a day. For maybe an hour the sun dips below the horizon and it gets a little dusky. The research base is a small, closed community of scientists and base staff. I struggle with the danger of the cold and that it keeps you confined to the base a lot of the time. If you want to get out and have time on your own, you have to jump through a lot of hoops. With the remote location, I find the loss of personal freedom hard. I miss feeling in control of my own life.</p> <p>I work in a team of four and our trips are 10 weeks long. We are flown to the glacier. The first time we got dropped off, and the helicopter flew away, I was overwhelmed to be in such an isolated place. I felt like a tiny person in a huge expanse and it was quiet, quiet, quiet like you couldn\u2019t believe. It was emotionally intense.</p> <p>Our priority is to find six equipment towers in the snow that were placed on the glacier the previous year. They\u2019re light aluminium frames that house our monitoring equipment. Year to year the towers move up to 1km due to the flow of the glacier. We only have the last known GPS positions to try to locate them.</p> <p>The biggest challenge is keeping my hands warm, because I need good dexterity. I work with them bare and then ball them up quickly in big mittens. I don\u2019t use gloves, because as soon as my fingers are separate they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m also never without my Thermos. </p> <p>I quite happily immerse myself in my new little community and don\u2019t miss my friends and family too much. But when I return to Hobart I\u2019m happy to no longer have to always tell someone where I\u2019m going, or have to take someone else along with me.</p> <h2>The cold storage manager</h2> <p><em>Matt Bennett, 26, industrial freezer team leader, Chiltern Cold Storage, </em><em>Peterborough</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"579c55f4a8e64d0f0c5c8132b6637a56751e2d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/579c55f4a8e64d0f0c5c8132b6637a56751e2d63/445_1476_4058_5072/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen assets: Matt Bennett, Peterborough.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes you find snowflakes hanging about\u2019: Matt Bennett, Peterborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are three doors to get into the freezer. They\u2019re sealed and air-locked to keep the cold in. When you enter, you get a big waft of cold air in your face. The temperature\u2019s between -18C and -25C. But if you\u2019re working at the back when the fans kick in, it feels like -30C. Sometimes you find snowflakes hanging about.</p> <p>If I\u2019m doing a morning shift I get up at 4am, but I have to be quiet as I have a missus and three children. I\u2019ll put on my thermal socks, thermal vest, T-shirt, sweatshirt and jacket. And then a woolly jacket. When I get to work I put on a pair of overalls, a freezer jacket, freezer boots and woolly hat. Over that I wear a hard hat that has a neck wrap and ear muffs. The warehouse is quite dark, like a cave. It\u2019s filled with long aisles and pallets stacked high. We mainly store meat: there\u2019s beef, lamb, chicken and turkeys for Christmas. It comes from all over: Spain, Italy, Brazil. Tesco stores salmon here, also Greggs, Wetherspoon\u2019s. We have other bits and bobs, too. Last year we had big ice sculptures and ice glasses for an ice bar in London, and we\u2019ve had ice samples from the Antarctic for scientists.</p> <p>After about half an hour my goatee starts to frost up. After two hours I look like Santa Claus. My beard goes hard and when I breathe I feel it melt and run, and then it\u2019ll refreeze. Sometimes my lips get stuck together.</p> <p>The summer months are the weirdest, because first you come out of the warehouse and get blinded by the sun and then after a few minutes of warming up you start sweating, so you take all your gear off. When I leave, I stay away from heat to let my fingers defrost by themselves, otherwise you get a horrible burning feeling.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done this job for five years and I enjoy it. The day goes fast, as there\u2019s so much to do. I started as a warehouse operative and worked my way up. I now introduce new staff to the freezer. After 20 minutes some will say: \u201cNah, not for me, far too cold.\u201d The more you think about it, the more you get cold. If you just focus on the job, you crack on and get it done.</p> <h2>The avalanche forecaster</h2> <p><em>Jimmy Tart, 41, ski patroller and avalanche educator, Utah</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b5403135f7128d4c20efbbc1299baddf8d187f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b5403135f7128d4c20efbbc1299baddf8d187f6/46_654_2610_3262/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Below a certain point you even stop shivering\u2019: Jimmy Tart assessing snow stability in the Uinta Mountains, Utah.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Below a certain point you even stop shivering\u2019: Jimmy Tart assessing snow stability in the Uinta Mountains, Utah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebekah Stevens/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I experienced hypothermia while working once. In 2005 I was in Vail, Colorado, and was standing on a ridgeline for more than an hour in 60mph winds that created a -40C wind-chill zone. It was the day after a big storm and the visibility was low. It\u2019s an understatement to say I felt cold. It was awful. It became difficult to move. When your body temperature drops below a certain point, blood stops being sent to your appendages in an effort to keep your brain warm. I stopped shivering. My hands and feet felt like ice blocks.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working in snow safety for 16 years. I\u2019m trained to forecast, avoid and mitigate avalanches and to educate the public on them. On a morning with new snow, I go with a team up to ski areas and we plan out and cause controlled avalanches while the area is closed. We use our knowledge of the terrain and watch weather patterns, because that drives everything. For example, winds can transport snow to a sheltered slope and force the top layer of snow grains together, creating a hard slab to form over soft, older snow. The effect is like putting a textbook on top of potato chips; it becomes vulnerable to collapse. To make areas like that safe, we throw 2lb hand explosives into the snow to create pressure that can trigger an avalanche. Our work makes the danger of avalanches to the public minimal. But to us it can still be very real.</p> <p>On that morning in 2005 it was all well planned, as it always is \u2013 multiple teams working their way down the ridgeline, coordinating on radio so we don\u2019t get underneath somebody who\u2019s about to create an avalanche. But small delays here and there, and the next thing we knew, my route partner and I were standing out for longer than we should have been. Our supervisor, Colin, had skied down to a safe spot about 500ft below us to assess the conditions in the bowl. We told him we had one explosive left, and, to avoid the hazard of taking it back to our cache, he told us to throw it. We threw it into the bowl where we\u2019d already put multiple charges, but it created an unexpected mid-size avalanche above where Colin was standing. The avalanche was large enough to bury people and trees.</p> <p>It must have taken between 10 to 15 seconds for the avalanche to run its path and the powder cloud to settle. I was looking down and knew something wasn\u2019t right, but my brain was working so slowly I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. We tried to call Colin, but he didn\u2019t respond. I wasn\u2019t panicking, because I couldn\u2019t think properly. The powder cloud following the avalanche had knocked Colin off his feet and he had nearly been buried. Luckily the debris flow missed him and he was OK. Not being able to think during something so dangerous was a strange sensation.</p> <p>The job involves a lot of standing around in snow. We also forecast for avalanches by digging deep pits that we climb into and analyse the stratigraphy, which are the layers of snow caused by different weather. The avalanche danger can be determined by studying the layers and how they relate to each other.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found it\u2019s always better to carry more layers than you think you\u2019re going to need \u2013 the extra weight is worth it. And I always tell people to wear warmer gloves than they think they need, too. When I really feel it, push-ups are my go-to to get the blood flowing.</p> <p>I grew up in Texas, where everything is unbearably hot. I remember being eight and riding to a friend\u2019s house on summer break and thinking my brain was melting. Maybe, subconsciously, that\u2019s why I ended up doing this work.</p> <h2>The horse breeder</h2> <p><em>Mikhail Etigelow, 56, Oymyakon, Russia</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bcfd9d513fb73d720f34cecb047ce3b06cb0bb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcfd9d513fb73d720f34cecb047ce3b06cb0bb31/0_101_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The school only closes when it goes below -52C outside\u2019: horse breeder Mikhail Etigelow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The school only closes when it goes below -52C outside\u2019: horse breeder Mikhail Etigelow</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the fall of the Soviet Union there was no work for me. I had to think of a way to provide for my family, so I decided to create my own smallholding. I have 100 horses and work with my son and brother-in-law.</p> <p>Our horses are bred to grow extra fur in time for winter and to get a layer of fat for warmth. It enables them to live outside when it\u2019s incredibly cold. Here it ranges from -20C to -50C in the winter. It\u2019s important for us to dress warmly because you don\u2019t want to lose an ear or a finger. It\u2019s not uncommon for that to happen to people; the trauma centre in Yakutsk, the nearest city, conducts dozens of amputations every year of fingers and toes due to frostbite. I\u2019ve experienced -67C, but I have to work outside every day. I don\u2019t mind. We\u2019re in the mountains and being in nature is the best way to spend time.</p> <p>Oymyakon is 1,000km from Yakutsk. It takes 30 hours to get here by car when the roads are frozen. About 1,000 people live here. Homes are wooden and heated with wood or coal fire. Our toilets have to be outside because it\u2019s too cold for plumbing. We don\u2019t use our fridges in winter \u2013 we just keep things outside. There are only four hours of daylight then, so in the evenings the streets are empty. Most people stay inside and watch TV. I like the news and talk shows, and I also like to read, especially historical fiction.</p> <p>This weather is normal to us. Nothing really stops here, we drive (if our cars don\u2019t freeze) or walk to work. The school only closes when it goes below -52C outside. When it\u2019s very cold the little children are often taken on a sleigh. No one really complains about the cold; for us, this is natural. We live 3,000m above sea level and it\u2019s beautiful and wild. We\u2019re so used to it that it\u2019s actually difficult for us to travel anywhere south and acclimatise. It\u2019s so cold here that there are few diseases and we can easily get sick when we go somewhere warmer.</p> <h2>Subsistence gatherer and trapper</h2> <p><em>Renae Zackar, 40, Iguigig, Alaska</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f03aed54578fe5beb7a607936a8152de0fcd5953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03aed54578fe5beb7a607936a8152de0fcd5953/0_154_2573_1544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019ve always liked the cold\u2019: Renae Zackar in Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always liked the cold\u2019: Renae Zackar in Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Zackar Sr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve always liked the cold. It means we can travel and hunt \u2013 and the things that I make sell better. We live at the mouth of a river on Lake Iliamna in Alaska. There are about 60 people in our village. When the lake freezes from December to around May, we use the ice as a highway to get from village to village. A week at -35C is enough to freeze it solid. This year it was late to freeze.</p> <p>Subsistence has been part of my life since I was young. At least half of our family\u2019s diet comes from indigenous fish, plants and animals that we hunt, gather and preserve ourselves. I work really hard. The older of my five children help whenever they can, and my husband works, too.</p> <p>We hunt caribou and moose in the winter, and also trap fur animals such as wolverines, wolves, beavers, otters and lynxes. We use the fur for our warm winter gear. We travel out and bury the traps in the snow. Most of the time the men skin the animals, but my husband cut himself deeply once while skinning a wolverine and, as I didn\u2019t want the coat to go bad, I took over and finished it off. Now I always do it because I\u2019m better and more careful.</p> <p>It\u2019s coldest in March. The lowest temperature I\u2019ve known is -45C. As long as you have the right gear to deal with it, the cold is good. I wear fur hats made from seal and sea otter and gauntlet-style mittens over gloves \u2013 my daughter and I make them for the whole family. We also make <em>gumukluks</em>, which is the local dialect for shoes made out of skins. But most of us wear bunny boots now: they\u2019re military shoes made from rubber with air pockets in them that trap heat. They\u2019re awesome and last forever.</p> <p>We also ice-fish in the winter. We make a hole with an ice pick and use a pole made from a skinny tree branch with a small amount of fishing line, and salmon eggs as bait. We mainly catch trout. Ice fishing only gives us enough for one night\u2019s meal though. The summer months are when we catch most fish. For my size of family, I have to catch and smoke about 700 salmon to last a year. We used to store them outdoors in caches, which are tiny houses on high stilts, but now that we have freezers. I put them in there.</p> <p>In winter, we have about five hours of daylight. Things slow down, it\u2019s not quite hibernating, but almost. Electricity changed how we live. With TV and artificial light we stay up longer and I sew. But we don\u2019t use too much electricity, because it\u2019s expensive. They have to fly diesel into our village for the generator. It used to come by barge, but the water level dropped and they can\u2019t get up the river now.</p> <p>In the past 16 years the lake hasn\u2019t frozen for two or three winters, which scares me. We can\u2019t hunt, trap, ice-fish or travel to see people. It\u2019s harder to live. We don\u2019t get berries in the spring. It makes me worry the permafrost will melt under our house and it will slide into the river; some of the banks are already eroding around us. I put a lot of my life savings into building this house. I think it will be OK here for about 20 years, but over time it will turn into a desert, as we don\u2019t get much rain and now we\u2019re getting less snow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The polar oceanographer Madi Rosevear, 27, PhD student, works in Antarctica and lives in Hobart, Tasmania I\u2019m about to go on my third research trip to Antarctica. For my first, we flew in from New Zealand to our base. From the air it\u2019s just blue and white: icebergs and sea ice, and valleys full of high-glaciated mountains. You don\u2019t see any wildlife and even seeing exposed rock is a rarity. It\u2019s stunning. The runway at the research base is ice, no tarmac. Stepping off the plane, the air is so cold and dry (it\u2019s often around -25C) that it instantly sucks the moisture out of everything. It can be hard to breathe. I\u2019m doing a PhD looking at how the oceans are melting Antarctic ice shelves. An ice shelf is like a cork in a bottle \u2013 if you pull out the cork, grounded ice starts to flow more rapidly into the ocean. The work I\u2019m doing is measuring the Totten Glacier, which is in quite a vulnerable region. We go in the summer months \u2013 December and January. There\u2019s daylight 24 hours a day. For maybe an hour the sun dips below the horizon and it gets a little dusky. The research base is a small, closed community of scientists and base staff. I struggle with the danger of the cold and that it keeps you confined to the base a lot of the time. If you want to get out and have time on your own, you have to jump through a lot of hoops. With the remote location, I find the loss of personal freedom hard. I miss feeling in control of my own life. I work in a team of four and our trips are 10 weeks long. We are flown to the glacier. The first time we got dropped off, and the helicopter flew away, I was overwhelmed to be in such an isolated place. I felt like a tiny person in a huge expanse and it was quiet, quiet, quiet like you couldn\u2019t believe. It was emotionally intense. Our priority is to find six equipment towers in the snow that were placed on the glacier the previous year. They\u2019re light aluminium frames that house our monitoring equipment. Year to year the towers move up to 1km due to the flow of the glacier. We only have the last known GPS positions to try to locate them. The biggest challenge is keeping my hands warm, because I need good dexterity. I work with them bare and then ball them up quickly in big mittens. I don\u2019t use gloves, because as soon as my fingers are separate they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m also never without my Thermos. I quite happily immerse myself in my new little community and don\u2019t miss my friends and family too much. But when I return to Hobart I\u2019m happy to no longer have to always tell someone where I\u2019m going, or have to take someone else along with me.

It makes me worry the permafrost will melt under our house and it will slide into the river; some of the banks are already eroding around us. I put a lot of my life savings into building this house. I think it will be OK here for about 20 years, but over time it will turn into a desert, as we don\u2019t get much rain and now we\u2019re getting less snow.",

Her periods had stopped, and she lived in New York in a fog of pregnancy scares \u2013 finishing drama school and working as a nanny, she was putting off an expensive medical bill. So it wasn\u2019t until she was home in her parents\u2019 Oxfordshire village for Christmas that she finally decided to investigate \u2013 first with a trip to the optician, to ask about the blind spot in her peripheral vision, and then a blood test with her GP. By the time she was admitted to hospital, aged 23, her brain tumour was the size of a golf ball.</p> <p>Her blind spot was a <a href=\"https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/understanding-brain-tumours/types-of-brain-tumour-adult/pituitary-adenoma/\" title=\"\">pituitary adenoma</a>, and she\u2019d been staring at it for five months. \u201cI\u2019d never been sick,\u201d she says. \u201cI was fine. Except, that whole year I\u2019d felt numb. More sarcastic than usual, quite cynical, rather than my usual irritating optimism. Turns out, because the tumour was on my pituitary gland, I couldn\u2019t regulate emotion. I didn\u2019t crack a single joke in 2015.\u201d</p> <p>We are meeting three years later, and a redirected plane means Charly\u2019s return home from New York this time has already involved a taxi to London from Liverpool and the misplacing of all her luggage. Nevertheless, she\u2019s chirpy and delightful, ordering wine in her only clothes this side of the Atlantic. She talks about waking up on an intensive care ward in the tone of a bawdy anecdote. \u201cI asked the nurse: \u2018Where\u2019s Britney?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Is that your sister?\u2019\u201d She thought Charly was talking about her best friend Ellen Robertson, who\u2019d moved in with Charly\u2019s family upon diagnosis, and was responsible, in hospital, for serving tea and high spirits. \u201cBut I explained: \u2018No, that\u2019s the name of my tumour.\u2019\u201d At which the nurse, \u201cthe very sweet nurse\u201d, smiled kindly and moved on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8e4c3f933c1edcbd2fbf299f61a6b4da20b1b76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8e4c3f933c1edcbd2fbf299f61a6b4da20b1b76/0_110_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charly Clive photographed by Sarah Cresswell in studio for the Observer Magazine on the 21.12.18\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018That whole year I felt l numb, more sarcastic usual, quite cynical\u2019: Charly Clive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Creswell/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she recovered from her operation (and, after Britney\u2019s return, the subsequent radiotherapy), she and Ellen contemplated alternative diagnoses.

      "body": "<p>Outwitting narrative convention, Mozart\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/the-magic-flute/\" title=\"\">The Magic Flute</a></strong> retains its mysteries even for those of us who have seen it, for work and pleasure, tens of times and assume we know every extraordinary note. The plot loops, skips, tangles. A simple fairytale grows more sinister on each encounter. What type of compassion permits the \u201call-wise\u201d Sarastro to wrench a daughter from her mother, even if she is Queen of the Night? Rescue, revenge and righteousness snarl into one. Add to that a pantomimic subplot and the underlying tensions between Freemasonry and Catholicism \u2013 Mozart, typically nifty, had a foot in both \u2013 and complexity reigns.</p> <p>Opera North\u2019s new <em>Flute</em>, staged by James Brining, artistic director of Leeds Playhouse, follows the trend of recent productions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/10/die-zauberflote-capriccio-garsington-review\" title=\"\">Netia Jones\u2019s for Garsington</a> last summer, Simon McBurney\u2019s for English National Opera\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-magic-flute/\" title=\"\">returning in March</a>) in confronting, instead of minimising, the enigmas. The habitual light-dark, good-evil dichotomy is no longer adequate. Brining\u2019s take, attractively designed by Colin Richmond (with lighting by Chris Davey), has problems, but there\u2019s plenty to enjoy, not least the warm, Irish Papageno of <a href=\"https://www.gavanring.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gavan Ring</a>. His humour threads its charm throughout, providing a framework for the entire opera, as Mozart\u2019s collaborator and librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder, who created the role of Papageno in Vienna in 1791, must have intended.</p> <p>Musical standards are rigorous, with period instrument style to the fore under the baton of Robert Howarth. Woodwind playing, notably from bassoons and basset horns, was fruity and prominent on first night. Every word of Jeremy Sams\u2019s evergreen, witty English translation was audible, sung without surtitles. Some of the spoken text, conversely, sounded stiff and needs more projection. It\u2019s never easy. Papageno aside, these characters\u2019 identities depend on the richness of the music they sing. In speech they are little more than archetypes.</p> <p>In a dumbshow during the overture, a child (Madeleine Barker) puts on a crackly recording of <em>The Magic Flute </em>before bed. I guess such miracles do happen. The grownups are having a distinctly fractious dinner party. Parental dysfunction looms. It all suggests a troubled dream, and it\u2019s some relief that Brining doesn\u2019t hammer that idea too heavily. Sarastro (John Savournin), impeccable in white and gold, with militaristic regalia, and dark glasses reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-dead-remembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on#img-3\" title=\"\">Rev Jim Jones</a>, leads a surreal sect of obedient men and meek, habit-clad handmaidens. The Three Boys (whether for gender equality or global shortage, here sung by two girls and a boy) are cadets in shorts and side caps. One omission fell flat: Papagena (a delightful Amy Freston) is robbed of her chance to transform from old crone (too ageist? Come off it) to sexy babe.

      "bodyText": "Outwitting narrative convention, Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute retains its mysteries even for those of us who have seen it, for work and pleasure, tens of times and assume we know every extraordinary note. The plot loops, skips, tangles. A simple fairytale grows more sinister on each encounter. What type of compassion permits the \u201call-wise\u201d Sarastro to wrench a daughter from her mother, even if she is Queen of the Night? Rescue, revenge and righteousness snarl into one. Add to that a pantomimic subplot and the underlying tensions between Freemasonry and Catholicism \u2013 Mozart, typically nifty, had a foot in both \u2013 and complexity reigns. Opera North\u2019s new Flute, staged by James Brining, artistic director of Leeds Playhouse, follows the trend of recent productions (Netia Jones\u2019s for Garsington last summer, Simon McBurney\u2019s for English National Opera\u2019s, returning in March) in confronting, instead of minimising, the enigmas. The habitual light-dark, good-evil dichotomy is no longer adequate. Brining\u2019s take, attractively designed by Colin Richmond (with lighting by Chris Davey), has problems, but there\u2019s plenty to enjoy, not least the warm, Irish Papageno of Gavan Ring. His humour threads its charm throughout, providing a framework for the entire opera, as Mozart\u2019s collaborator and librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder, who created the role of Papageno in Vienna in 1791, must have intended. Musical standards are rigorous, with period instrument style to the fore under the baton of Robert Howarth. Woodwind playing, notably from bassoons and basset horns, was fruity and prominent on first night. Every word of Jeremy Sams\u2019s evergreen, witty English translation was audible, sung without surtitles. Some of the spoken text, conversely, sounded stiff and needs more projection. It\u2019s never easy. Papageno aside, these characters\u2019 identities depend on the richness of the music they sing. In speech they are little more than archetypes. In a dumbshow during the overture, a child (Madeleine Barker) puts on a crackly recording of The Magic Flute before bed. I guess such miracles do happen. The grownups are having a distinctly fractious dinner party. Parental dysfunction looms. It all suggests a troubled dream, and it\u2019s some relief that Brining doesn\u2019t hammer that idea too heavily. Sarastro (John Savournin), impeccable in white and gold, with militaristic regalia, and dark glasses reminiscent of the Rev Jim Jones, leads a surreal sect of obedient men and meek, habit-clad handmaidens. The Three Boys (whether for gender equality or global shortage, here sung by two girls and a boy) are cadets in shorts and side caps. One omission fell flat: Papagena (a delightful Amy Freston) is robbed of her chance to transform from old crone (too ageist? Come off it) to sexy babe. Instead, she merely pulls off her veil and reveals, beneath her red robes, a pair of fabulous dancer\u2019s legs. The Australian-Chinese tenor Kang Wang, a gleaming-voiced Tamino, and his Pamina, South African soprano Vuvu Mpofu, lyrical and sweet-toned, made memorable Opera North debuts. Samantha Hay was a precise, fiery Queen of the Night, John Findon convincingly oafish and malicious as Monostatos. For the challenging trial scene, Douglas O\u2019Connell\u2019s video designs gave a lively impression of fire and water, the torrents gushing from brick tunnels surely filmed in Leeds\u2019s own post-industrial waterways.

      "bodyText": "When Mark Walker\u2019s stepfather had a heart attack, it was clear he could no longer live alone. Walker therefore got planning permission to extend his home in Rickmansworth, south-west Hertfordshire, so that the 81-year-old cancer patient could be cared for by his family. However, he did not formally notify Three Rivers district council when construction started at the end of 2017. The omission may cost him his home. Because he failed to submit a one-page form, he incurred a penalty of \u00a324,274 and was ordered to stop the work. \u201cWe stretched ourself to the limit with this project and, over a year on, we have been unable to finish it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe face having to sell our house in which we\u2019ve invested so much because we can\u2019t afford to take on more debt. How can \u00a324,000 be a reasonable punishment for failing to fill in a single piece of paper?\u201d He has fallen foul of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), a charge introduced in the 2008 Planning Act to enable councils to raise funds from new developments. It was designed to force commercial developers to contribute to the local infrastructure, but poorly drafted legislation has meant homeowners are being charged five-figure sums for home improvements that are supposed to be exempt. On the face of it, the regulations are clear: residential extensions are exempt from the charge so long as the property is the owner\u2019s main residence. The problem is an obscure technicality. Deep amid the small print is regulation 42B (6) which states that the exemption will be revoked if the homeowner fails to return a \u201ccommencement notice\u201d which notifies the council that the works are due to start. Even deeper is an apparently contradictory regulation 67 (1A), added in 2014, stating that exempted residential extensions don\u2019t require to file this notice. The anomaly is catching out unknown numbers of residents and their architects who either forget to return the form, or do not realise that it is required. NHS consultant Ben Naylor* was forced to pay \u00a327,000 to Three Rivers council for an extension that had been declared exempt from the CIL in 2017. Like Walker, he had omitted to submit the commencement notice before building work started and his exemption was revoked. \u201cThe council continues to ignore all the evidence from the government which clearly indicates that residential extensions are exempted from giving a notice under regulation 67,\u201d he says. In Northhampton, Kate Southgate* was threatened with bailiffs and jail if she did not hand over \u00a327,000 plus a \u00a31,000 surcharge to Daventry district council. It had exempted her single-storey extension from CIL early in 2016, but demanded the full sum 18 months later because it had not received a commencement notice. \u201cWe were shocked and frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are retired and always pay our bills \u2026 we had no idea what this was all about. It seems our architect, who was dealing with all the paperwork, didn\u2019t know about CIL as the council had only adopted it a few months before we applied for planning permission. \u201cThe stress made me ill, so we paid up, although our legal adviser and housing minister Jake Berry confirmed that we were not liable.

However, last March, three weeks after the Observer alerted the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to the confusion, Three Rivers told Mark Walker that it was suspending its demand.

Today the EU is most effective when it shields its citizens from over-mighty technology firms, negotiates trade deals in a world where its population is proportionately smaller every year, and ventures tentative steps towards common defence forces independent from those of Donald Trump\u2019s America.

Yet the great American writer remained unsatisfied with its legacy and always hoped to see a faithful stage or screen version made.</p> <p>Now, six and a half decades on, a close friend whom Hemingway once asked to adapt the story for him has made good on his promise. The journalist and playwright AE Hotchner, the writer\u2019s confidant and fishing companion in Cuba during the period in which the novella was written, has created a stage version with his son.</p> <p>Hotchner, now 101, believes his play, which opens this week at Point Park University\u2019s Pittsburgh Playhouse, will bring the work of Hemingway to a younger audience. \u201cI got to know Hemingway well when I was a guest at his home near Havana,\u201d Hotchner told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cOne night after dinner and a few drinks he came over to my guesthouse clutching a collection of typewritten pages. He told me his wife, Mary Welsh, had just typed the last pages. It was <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> and it was the first time anyone had seen it.\u201d</p> <p>Hotchner is the author of several books about Hemingway, including <em>Papa Hemingway</em>, published five years after the novelist killed himself at his home in Ketchum, Idaho. He recalled his state of rapture as he read Hemingway\u2019s manuscript, a timeless story about a Cuban fisherman who struggles to break a run of bad luck. \u201cI thought it was done marvellously well,\u201d he said. Two or three weeks later Hemingway told him he had an offer from <em>Life</em> magazine to publish the story as it was, without waiting for two further instalments of a planned trilogy about the sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b397b77f596dfcacc1e241b05e6aac2c92ee3e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b397b77f596dfcacc1e241b05e6aac2c92ee3e8/0_92_2530_1518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spencer Tracy and Felipe Pazos in the 1958 film version of The Old Man and the Sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spencer Tracy and Felipe Pazos in the 1958 film version of The Old Man and the Sea, which Hemingway disliked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI told him a writer in his position should take money any time it was offered and that I thought the story stood on its own and that more would lessen its impact,\u201d said Hotchner.</p> <p>Seven years later the friends met in New York following the release of the 1958 John Sturges film version, starring Spencer Tracy as the weather-beaten fisherman Santiago, who tries to net a big fish, a marlin, after 85 desperate days with no catch.</p> <p>\u201cWe went into the movie theatre and saw just 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Hotchner. \u201cThen Hemingway said, \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 And we got up and left. He was pretty upset. He said, \u2018You know, you write something you think is pretty good, and then they do that to it. Tracy looks more like Gertrude Stein [the novelist and poet] than Santiago.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hotchner agreed it did not work: \u201cIt had none of the poetry of the book. None of the drama. And it had no heart. Hemingway said to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take a crack at it one of these days?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59df163a0c722d83f139458c786788b2c63d5364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59df163a0c722d83f139458c786788b2c63d5364/113_393_2144_2680/800.jpg\" alt=\"AE Hotchner attending an awards dinner in New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AE Hotchner attending an awards dinner in New York.

The Tony award-winning Broadway veteran Anthony Crivello will play the lead role.</p> <p>For \u201cHotch\u201d, Hemingway\u2019s old pal, the important thing is that the play communicates clearly that the fisherman\u2019s story is the story of everyone\u2019s career.</p> <p>\u201cWe all have disappointments and dreams, and this version shows that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have fulfilled my promise to my old friend.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ernest Hemingway won a Pulitzer and a Nobel prize for The Old Man and the Sea, and his 1952 novella is still regarded as a classic of world literature. Yet the great American writer remained unsatisfied with its legacy and always hoped to see a faithful stage or screen version made. Now, six and a half decades on, a close friend whom Hemingway once asked to adapt the story for him has made good on his promise. The journalist and playwright AE Hotchner, the writer\u2019s confidant and fishing companion in Cuba during the period in which the novella was written, has created a stage version with his son. Hotchner, now 101, believes his play, which opens this week at Point Park University\u2019s Pittsburgh Playhouse, will bring the work of Hemingway to a younger audience. \u201cI got to know Hemingway well when I was a guest at his home near Havana,\u201d Hotchner told the Observer. \u201cOne night after dinner and a few drinks he came over to my guesthouse clutching a collection of typewritten pages. He told me his wife, Mary Welsh, had just typed the last pages. It was The Old Man and the Sea and it was the first time anyone had seen it.\u201d Hotchner is the author of several books about Hemingway, including Papa Hemingway, published five years after the novelist killed himself at his home in Ketchum, Idaho. He recalled his state of rapture as he read Hemingway\u2019s manuscript, a timeless story about a Cuban fisherman who struggles to break a run of bad luck. \u201cI thought it was done marvellously well,\u201d he said. Two or three weeks later Hemingway told him he had an offer from Life magazine to publish the story as it was, without waiting for two further instalments of a planned trilogy about the sea. \u201cI told him a writer in his position should take money any time it was offered and that I thought the story stood on its own and that more would lessen its impact,\u201d said Hotchner. Seven years later the friends met in New York following the release of the 1958 John Sturges film version, starring Spencer Tracy as the weather-beaten fisherman Santiago, who tries to net a big fish, a marlin, after 85 desperate days with no catch. \u201cWe went into the movie theatre and saw just 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d said Hotchner. \u201cThen Hemingway said, \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 And we got up and left. He was pretty upset. He said, \u2018You know, you write something you think is pretty good, and then they do that to it. Tracy looks more like Gertrude Stein [the novelist and poet] than Santiago.\u2019\u201d Hotchner agreed it did not work: \u201cIt had none of the poetry of the book. None of the drama. And it had no heart. Hemingway said to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take a crack at it one of these days?\u2019\u201d The story has been adapted for the screen three times, including in 1990 with Anthony Quinn in the lead role, but never previously for the stage and Hotchner believes he may succeed where others have failed. The result of many drafts, the final script of the new version, to be produced by the New York-based RWS Entertainment Group, introduces Hemingway himself as a character. \u201cAt first we didn\u2019t know how to do it without it feeling like a one-man show, because there is a lot of stuff implied in the writing that you don\u2019t see,\u201d said Hotchner\u2019s son Tim. \u201cBut then we thought for Hemingway this book came 11 years after he had success with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and so in a way he, like Santiago, had to go out and catch his \u2018big marlin\u2019 again too.\u201d Joe Christopher, vice-president of theatre at RWS, said the biggest production challenge was ensuring the play was not too literal a retelling of the novel. \u201cIt was important to me the audience literally goes on the journey with Santiago,\u201d he said. The Tony award-winning Broadway veteran Anthony Crivello will play the lead role. For \u201cHotch\u201d, Hemingway\u2019s old pal, the important thing is that the play communicates clearly that the fisherman\u2019s story is the story of everyone\u2019s career. \u201cWe all have disappointments and dreams, and this version shows that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have fulfilled my promise to my old friend.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In Kilmarnock, the place that gives its name to the most hallowed edition of Robert Burns\u2019s poems, they remember another two of its anointed scribes. In the Goldberry, the handsome old tavern that sits beside the Kilmarnock Water, an article written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/25/hugh-mcilvanney-obituary\" title=\"\">Hugh McIlvanney</a> about the town that bore him hangs on a wall. The opening paragraph bears the unmistakable imprint of the master craftsman. \u201cIt is disturbing to visit your home town and find it disappearing up its own planning permission.\u201d On another wall hangs a passage written by his brother, the celebrated Scottish crime novelist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/william-mcilvanney\" title=\"\">William</a>.</p> <p>Betty Brown, current proprietor of the Goldberry, remembers the two McIlvanneys vividly. \u201cThis place has been in my family since 1958 and Hugh and Willie along with their brother Neil were regulars here. Even after they had found fame and success they still remained attached to their home town. Hugh was a great friend of my dad\u2019s and would pop in here whenever he was up from London visiting family or covering sporting events in Scotland. We\u2019re very proud of our association with the family.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/27/hugh-mcilvanney-friend-towering-presence-greatest-sportswriter\">Hugh McIlvanney: a friend, a towering presence, and the greatest sportswriter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An acute awareness of the social and industrial landscapes that formed his sporting subjects was a recurring theme in much of Hugh\u2019s prose and broadcast work. His introduction to a documentary about Scotland\u2019s greatest football managers conveys a characteristic humanity and compassion for the working-class environments of his heroes.</p> <p>\u201cWhen most people think of Scottish football they think of Glasgow and there\u2019s nothing unnatural about that. However to find the communities that produced Busby, Stein and Shankly, it is necessary to travel out from the great city on the Clyde to other places where jobs are scarce now but the ethos of the people was forged in a time when this was one of the most intensively industrialised regions on the face of the Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Kilmarnock and its social and cultural landscape seemed to have shaped McIlvanney\u2019s values and the genius of his sculpted prose. His achievements, together with those of his brother, have also bequeathed a remarkable literary bounty to this town. The novelists Zoe Strachan and Graeme Macrae Burnet, who was shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/his-bloody-project-sales-booker-shortlist-graeme-macrae-burnet\" title=\"\">Man Booker prize in 2016</a>, sprang from here. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/21/liam-mcilvanney-wins-scottish-fiction-award-father-bible-john\" title=\"\">Liam McIlvanney</a>, nephew of Hugh and son of William, has also become an award-winning novelist with a catalogue of critically acclaimed work behind him.</p> <p>Kilmarnock has also produced more than its fair share of journalists. One of them is Stephen Khan, editor of the news analysis website <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk\" title=\"\">The Conversation</a>. He said: \u201cHugh and Willie inspired every one of us. Basically, if you were from Kilmarnock and you had a vague interest in any kind of writing you wanted to be like them.</p> <p>\u201cPreviously, there had been a feeling that this world was closed and inaccessible but because of them you felt it was possible. And whenever any of us met them they were so encouraging and helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Hugh\u2019s beloved Ayrshire is currently experiencing something of a football renaissance. Kilmarnock FC are running Celtic and Rangers close for a league title they last won in 1965 while neighbours Ayr United are the unlikeliest of front-runners for promotion to the top tier of Scottish football. And in the nearby mining village of Auchinleck the local non-league club, Auchinleck Talbot, have reached the last 16 of the Scottish Cup. It would have been grand to have seen an enterprising sports editor send Hugh in his pomp back to the motherland to observe these deeds and ennoble them with his stately words.</p> <p>In journalistic circles the sports section of a newspaper is often described affectionately as the toy department. Any pages bearing Hugh McIlvanney\u2019s work were instantly elevated to the shop window.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Kilmarnock, the place that gives its name to the most hallowed edition of Robert Burns\u2019s poems, they remember another two of its anointed scribes. In the Goldberry, the handsome old tavern that sits beside the Kilmarnock Water, an article written by Hugh McIlvanney about the town that bore him hangs on a wall. The opening paragraph bears the unmistakable imprint of the master craftsman. \u201cIt is disturbing to visit your home town and find it disappearing up its own planning permission.\u201d On another wall hangs a passage written by his brother, the celebrated Scottish crime novelist, William. Betty Brown, current proprietor of the Goldberry, remembers the two McIlvanneys vividly. \u201cThis place has been in my family since 1958 and Hugh and Willie along with their brother Neil were regulars here. Even after they had found fame and success they still remained attached to their home town. Hugh was a great friend of my dad\u2019s and would pop in here whenever he was up from London visiting family or covering sporting events in Scotland. We\u2019re very proud of our association with the family.\u201d An acute awareness of the social and industrial landscapes that formed his sporting subjects was a recurring theme in much of Hugh\u2019s prose and broadcast work. His introduction to a documentary about Scotland\u2019s greatest football managers conveys a characteristic humanity and compassion for the working-class environments of his heroes. \u201cWhen most people think of Scottish football they think of Glasgow and there\u2019s nothing unnatural about that. However to find the communities that produced Busby, Stein and Shankly, it is necessary to travel out from the great city on the Clyde to other places where jobs are scarce now but the ethos of the people was forged in a time when this was one of the most intensively industrialised regions on the face of the Earth.\u201d Kilmarnock and its social and cultural landscape seemed to have shaped McIlvanney\u2019s values and the genius of his sculpted prose. His achievements, together with those of his brother, have also bequeathed a remarkable literary bounty to this town. The novelists Zoe Strachan and Graeme Macrae Burnet, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, sprang from here. And Liam McIlvanney, nephew of Hugh and son of William, has also become an award-winning novelist with a catalogue of critically acclaimed work behind him. Kilmarnock has also produced more than its fair share of journalists. One of them is Stephen Khan, editor of the news analysis website The Conversation. He said: \u201cHugh and Willie inspired every one of us. Basically, if you were from Kilmarnock and you had a vague interest in any kind of writing you wanted to be like them. \u201cPreviously, there had been a feeling that this world was closed and inaccessible but because of them you felt it was possible. And whenever any of us met them they were so encouraging and helpful.\u201d Hugh\u2019s beloved Ayrshire is currently experiencing something of a football renaissance. Kilmarnock FC are running Celtic and Rangers close for a league title they last won in 1965 while neighbours Ayr United are the unlikeliest of front-runners for promotion to the top tier of Scottish football. And in the nearby mining village of Auchinleck the local non-league club, Auchinleck Talbot, have reached the last 16 of the Scottish Cup. It would have been grand to have seen an enterprising sports editor send Hugh in his pomp back to the motherland to observe these deeds and ennoble them with his stately words. In journalistic circles the sports section of a newspaper is often described affectionately as the toy department. Any pages bearing Hugh McIlvanney\u2019s work were instantly elevated to the shop window.",

      "body": "<p>Just weeks after seeing her Brexit deal suffer a humiliating defeat and surviving attempts to topple both her leadership and her government, Theresa May will face a fresh round of parliamentary ambushes when MPs hold a series of Brexit votes this week.</p> <p>A simple motion setting out the government\u2019s next steps on Brexit will be put to parliament on Tuesday. With just two months to go until Brexit day, however, a series of MPs from different parties are planning to hijack the event and force the prime minister to change course.</p> <p>Brexiters want May to make another attempt to renegotiate her deal with Brussels. Cross-party groups of MPs want to kill off the prospect of no deal. Attempts by cabinet ministers and whips to persuade their colleagues to step back from the breach are failing. Huge power lies with John Bercow, the speaker, who can choose which plans are put to a vote.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said some MPs want to turn the confrontation into <em>High Noon</em> \u2013 a reference to the classic 1950s western, in which Gary Cooper\u2019s sheriff faces a final shootout with a gang of infamous outlaws. Such is the division and bitterness in parliament that another senior MP has a less flattering comparison. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s more like <em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So what are the plots and ambushes that await Theresa May this week?</p> <h2>Delaying Brexit</h2> <p><strong>Key players</strong> Yvette Cooper, Nick Boles.</p> <p>This plan has attracted broad support because it concentrates on one of the few things there is a majority for among MPs \u2013 avoiding a no-deal Brexit. The Cooper-Boles amendment gives parliament the power to order May to ask for Brexit to be delayed for a set amount of time, should no agreement be reached by the end of February. It would delay the Brexit cliff edge, but not deal with how to remove it entirely. A similar cross-party amendment, which does not bind the hands of the government, has also been tabled.</p> <p><strong>Chances of success?</strong> Very good, though the concerns of a minority of Labour MPs who do not wish to be seen to delay Brexit mean that it is not a certainty \u2013 and the plan could get torpedoed in the Lords at a later stage.</p> <h2>Power to parliament</h2> <p><strong>Key player</strong> Dominic Grieve.</p> <p>A radical proposal that would give much more control to parliament \u2013giving MPs control of the parliamentary timetable for several days to find a Brexit solution, with backbenchers handed opportunities to submit ideas and hold votes.</p> <p>While there has been a lot of focus on the Cooper-Boles amendment, this is the plan that has second-referendum supporters excited \u2013 they think it gives them the time and scope to make it happen.</p> <p><strong>Chances of success?</strong> Probably too revolutionary to attract enough support from Tories.</p> <h2>Labour ambush</h2> <p><strong>Key players</strong> Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer.</p> <p>This calls on parliament to look at alternatives to a no-deal Brexit, including Labour\u2019s preferred soft Brexit deal and a second referendum. However, this plan is more about holding together the party\u2019s fragile policy than resolving the impasse.</p> <p>The amendment does not spell out the specifics of an alternative Brexit deal and does not state whether an option to remain in the EU should be included in any second referendum. Labour MPs backing another public vote have already submitted \u201camendments to the amendment\u201d to make a stronger case for it.</p> <p><strong>Chances of success?</strong> No chance.</p> <h2>Brexit options</h2> <p><strong>Key player</strong> Hilary Benn.</p> <p>Under this plan, the House of Commons would be turned into a Brexit shooting gallery, with all the various outcomes put to a vote to see if any can command a majority. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 what if they are all shot down? The idea of so-called indicative votes has been popular among Remain cabinet ministers for a while, though some supporters are now more focused on ruling out a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Chances of success?</strong> Broad support, but such indicative votes would not tie the government\u2019s hands.</p> <h2>Ditching the backstop</h2> <p><strong>Key players</strong> Andrew Murrison, Sir Graham Brady.</p> <p>Senior Tory Brexiters in the cabinet have been calling for May to take a tougher line with Brussels.

      "bodyText": "Just weeks after seeing her Brexit deal suffer a humiliating defeat and surviving attempts to topple both her leadership and her government, Theresa May will face a fresh round of parliamentary ambushes when MPs hold a series of Brexit votes this week. A simple motion setting out the government\u2019s next steps on Brexit will be put to parliament on Tuesday. With just two months to go until Brexit day, however, a series of MPs from different parties are planning to hijack the event and force the prime minister to change course. Brexiters want May to make another attempt to renegotiate her deal with Brussels. Cross-party groups of MPs want to kill off the prospect of no deal. Attempts by cabinet ministers and whips to persuade their colleagues to step back from the breach are failing. Huge power lies with John Bercow, the speaker, who can choose which plans are put to a vote. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said some MPs want to turn the confrontation into High Noon \u2013 a reference to the classic 1950s western, in which Gary Cooper\u2019s sheriff faces a final shootout with a gang of infamous outlaws. Such is the division and bitterness in parliament that another senior MP has a less flattering comparison. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s more like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d he said. So what are the plots and ambushes that await Theresa May this week? Delaying Brexit Key players Yvette Cooper, Nick Boles. This plan has attracted broad support because it concentrates on one of the few things there is a majority for among MPs \u2013 avoiding a no-deal Brexit. The Cooper-Boles amendment gives parliament the power to order May to ask for Brexit to be delayed for a set amount of time, should no agreement be reached by the end of February. It would delay the Brexit cliff edge, but not deal with how to remove it entirely. A similar cross-party amendment, which does not bind the hands of the government, has also been tabled. Chances of success? Very good, though the concerns of a minority of Labour MPs who do not wish to be seen to delay Brexit mean that it is not a certainty \u2013 and the plan could get torpedoed in the Lords at a later stage. Power to parliament Key player Dominic Grieve. A radical proposal that would give much more control to parliament \u2013giving MPs control of the parliamentary timetable for several days to find a Brexit solution, with backbenchers handed opportunities to submit ideas and hold votes. While there has been a lot of focus on the Cooper-Boles amendment, this is the plan that has second-referendum supporters excited \u2013 they think it gives them the time and scope to make it happen. Chances of success? Probably too revolutionary to attract enough support from Tories. Labour ambush Key players Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer. This calls on parliament to look at alternatives to a no-deal Brexit, including Labour\u2019s preferred soft Brexit deal and a second referendum. However, this plan is more about holding together the party\u2019s fragile policy than resolving the impasse. The amendment does not spell out the specifics of an alternative Brexit deal and does not state whether an option to remain in the EU should be included in any second referendum. Labour MPs backing another public vote have already submitted \u201camendments to the amendment\u201d to make a stronger case for it. Chances of success? No chance. Brexit options Key player Hilary Benn. Under this plan, the House of Commons would be turned into a Brexit shooting gallery, with all the various outcomes put to a vote to see if any can command a majority. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 what if they are all shot down? The idea of so-called indicative votes has been popular among Remain cabinet ministers for a while, though some supporters are now more focused on ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Chances of success? Broad support, but such indicative votes would not tie the government\u2019s hands. Ditching the backstop Key players Andrew Murrison, Sir Graham Brady. Senior Tory Brexiters in the cabinet have been calling for May to take a tougher line with Brussels. Various amendments this week \u2013 one from Murrison and another from influential backbencher Brady \u2013 try to do just that. They essentially state that MPs back May\u2019s deal apart from the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d provision, which would stop the UK signing its own trade deals if it were ever to come into effect. The idea is to demonstrate to Brussels that such a renegotiated deal would pass. Chances of success? Should the Democratic Unionist party and Tory Eurosceptics row behind the amendment, it could pass \u2013 but there is little evidence the EU would consider such a renegotiation. No 10 counter-attack Key players Theresa May, Julian Smith. It is possible \u2013 some cabinet ministers think likely \u2013 that the government will submit its own amendment, stating that May\u2019s deal should be backed subject to further reassurances over the backstop. Talks have been going on with the DUP, which opposes the backstop, over what would be acceptable. Chances of success? It\u2019s a tall order to win support from hardline Brexiters for anything that has a realistic chance of being accepted by Brussels. Downing Street denies that any such amendment is planned. Fight another day Key players Philip Hammond, David Lidington. A faction of Remainers in the cabinet believe that this week should not be the point at which those who oppose a no-deal Brexit make a stand. They would like to see MPs wait until May comes back for a second attempt at pushing through her proposed EU withdrawal agreement. That may not be too far away. Chances of success? There are too many MPs who are opposed to a no-deal Brexit and want to take action this week. They will ignore warnings to wait.",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Chris Evans Breakfast Show</strong> (Virgin) | <a href=\"https://virginradio.co.uk/how-to-listen-to-virgin-radio\" title=\"\">virginradio.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>A radio reviewer\u2019s work is never done. So far, 2019 has just been new breakfast show after new breakfast show, and last week it was the turn of multimillionaire maniac grinner Chris Evans and his 6.30-10am <a href=\"https://virginradio.co.uk/the-chris-evans-breakfast-show\" title=\"\">new weekday show</a> on Virgin. The publicity photos have Evans posing as though the past two decades never happened, pointing at his Virgin radio microphone with a multimillion-pound maniac grin.</p> \n<p>Evans is an exceptionally good radio show host. Until he quit Radio 2 last month, he was the most popular radio DJ in the UK \u2013 well, the most listened-to \u2013 and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. Upbeat, cheeky, smart and vastly experienced (he\u2019s been presenting radio since 1984), the man is a relentless broadcasting fiend. We\u2019re around the same age, and it\u2019s hard for me to imagine life without Evans on the telly or on the radio, hooting, guffawing and banging on about posh cars and his kids like he\u2019s up for an Olympic showing-off medal. Chris Evans is back! But he never really left, did he?</p> \n<p>Anyway. This new show is really similar to his old one. He\u2019s brought his Radio 2 production and presenting team with him (other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/17/moira-stuart-leaves-bbc-for-classic-fm-presenting-role\" title=\"\">Moira Stewart</a>, who\u2019s getting a new show on Classic FM), so Rachel Horne is on travel, Vassos Alexander on sport, and the behind-the-scenes producers know how to get the best out of him. The jingles are the same. Cleverly, Virgin (now owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK) has got the whole show sponsored by Sky (which was part of Murdoch\u2019s empire until last autumn). This means there are no annoying advert breaks, though they\u2019ve been replaced by the slightly less annoying constant plugging of Sky telly by Evans.</p> \n<p>Actually, Sky and the show are a good fit: Evans gets the star guests, Sky gets the exposure. And Evans manages the sponsorship connection pretty well. There\u2019s an honesty about him that helps; while interviewing actor Genevieve O\u2019Reilly, in to promote the second series of <em>Tin Star </em>(\u201cOut on Sky\u201d), he confessed to not having watched the whole of the first series, because a child was killed in the first episode and he didn\u2019t want to watch after that.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77144b3d66974da60a851310f8288893c136659a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77144b3d66974da60a851310f8288893c136659a/266_0_3661_2197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ashcroft playing live for Chris Evans\u2019s first Virgin Radio breakfast show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ashcroft playing live for Chris Evans\u2019s first Virgin Radio breakfast show.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Charity/Courtesy of Virgin Radio</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, the music won\u2019t scare the cat. It\u2019s bland modern pop, with a good sprinkling of 90s-outlaws-turned-industry-stalwarts, such as Richard Ashcroft, who played live on the opening show. The live performances are expertly produced. On Thursday, Texas played in the studio and the sound was pin-perfect.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, lead singer Sharleen Spiteri joined the other guests, TV traveller Simon Reeve, comedian Russell Howard and O\u2019Reilly, and they all had a chat. Two of these people I actively lurve, and the other two seem great.</p> \n<p>Still, it was during this all-celebs-together chinwag that I pinpointed what it is about Evans that grates \u2013 it\u2019s how he patronises everyone, just a leetle bit. \u201cOff you trot,\u201d he said to Spiteri, when it was time for her to sing. \u201cOooh, look at you with your American-ness,\u201d to Howard, who has a US tour booked. It\u2019s a hangover from 70s and 80s Smashy-and-Nicey DJs, the ones who literally applaud interviewees for doing their jobs (Evans\u2019s show does this) \u2013 and it\u2019s familiar to anyone who has hung around a certain type of middle-aged man. They tell you they know exactly who you are (\u201cOf course you\u2019d do that!\u201d said Evans to Spiteri); they pressurise you to conform to their good time (\u201cYou can leave if you want, but why not stay until 10?\u201d: to all of his guests).</p> \n<p>Everyone is boxed in with overfamiliarity; people are put on the spot to entertain: \u201cWho has a story about Van Morrison?\u201d All tiny things that mean that jovial, we\u2019re-all-friends-here Evans owns everyone around him. Of course, he\u2019s required to be in control, because he\u2019s the presenter. But other presenters do this without making themselves top dog at all times.</p> \n<p>Well. As the kids say, don\u2019t @ me. I think Evans will do really well at his new job, and I think he deserves to. He\u2019s like all the presenters on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/20/league-of-their-own\" title=\"\">A League of Their Own</a></em> rolled into one. You may well enjoy his show greatly. It\u2019s not for me.</p> \n<h2>Three shows about disability</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0002228\" title=\"\">Annalisa Is Awkward</a><br>This delightful one-off programme explores awkwardness from the point of view of a disabled person. Annalisa Dinnella has a degenerative sight condition: she uses a white stick and regularly experiences other people\u2019s embarrassment. She interviews comedian Jess Thom, who has Tourette syndrome. Thom points out that children aren\u2019t awkward around disability \u2013 \u201ctoddlers think I\u2019m doing it purely for their own amusement\u201d \u2013 but adults teach them that disability is shameful. \u201cWheels are wicked, why are they good on buses and not for people [in wheelchairs]?\u201d she asks.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02r6yqw/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">Ouch: Disability Talk</a><br>Ouch has been broadcasting since 2006, so there are umpteen episodes to choose from, featuring previous presenters Mat Fraser, Liz Carr and newer ones Simon Minty and Kate Monaghan (the programme has plenty of guest presenters).

      "bodyText": "The Chris Evans Breakfast Show (Virgin) | virginradio.co.uk A radio reviewer\u2019s work is never done. So far, 2019 has just been new breakfast show after new breakfast show, and last week it was the turn of multimillionaire maniac grinner Chris Evans and his 6.30-10am new weekday show on Virgin. The publicity photos have Evans posing as though the past two decades never happened, pointing at his Virgin radio microphone with a multimillion-pound maniac grin. Evans is an exceptionally good radio show host. Until he quit Radio 2 last month, he was the most popular radio DJ in the UK \u2013 well, the most listened-to \u2013 and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. Upbeat, cheeky, smart and vastly experienced (he\u2019s been presenting radio since 1984), the man is a relentless broadcasting fiend. We\u2019re around the same age, and it\u2019s hard for me to imagine life without Evans on the telly or on the radio, hooting, guffawing and banging on about posh cars and his kids like he\u2019s up for an Olympic showing-off medal. Chris Evans is back! But he never really left, did he? Anyway. This new show is really similar to his old one. He\u2019s brought his Radio 2 production and presenting team with him (other than Moira Stewart, who\u2019s getting a new show on Classic FM), so Rachel Horne is on travel, Vassos Alexander on sport, and the behind-the-scenes producers know how to get the best out of him. The jingles are the same. Cleverly, Virgin (now owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK) has got the whole show sponsored by Sky (which was part of Murdoch\u2019s empire until last autumn). This means there are no annoying advert breaks, though they\u2019ve been replaced by the slightly less annoying constant plugging of Sky telly by Evans. Actually, Sky and the show are a good fit: Evans gets the star guests, Sky gets the exposure. And Evans manages the sponsorship connection pretty well. There\u2019s an honesty about him that helps; while interviewing actor Genevieve O\u2019Reilly, in to promote the second series of Tin Star (\u201cOut on Sky\u201d), he confessed to not having watched the whole of the first series, because a child was killed in the first episode and he didn\u2019t want to watch after that. Unsurprisingly, the music won\u2019t scare the cat. It\u2019s bland modern pop, with a good sprinkling of 90s-outlaws-turned-industry-stalwarts, such as Richard Ashcroft, who played live on the opening show. The live performances are expertly produced. On Thursday, Texas played in the studio and the sound was pin-perfect. Afterwards, lead singer Sharleen Spiteri joined the other guests, TV traveller Simon Reeve, comedian Russell Howard and O\u2019Reilly, and they all had a chat. Two of these people I actively lurve, and the other two seem great. Still, it was during this all-celebs-together chinwag that I pinpointed what it is about Evans that grates \u2013 it\u2019s how he patronises everyone, just a leetle bit. \u201cOff you trot,\u201d he said to Spiteri, when it was time for her to sing. \u201cOooh, look at you with your American-ness,\u201d to Howard, who has a US tour booked. It\u2019s a hangover from 70s and 80s Smashy-and-Nicey DJs, the ones who literally applaud interviewees for doing their jobs (Evans\u2019s show does this) \u2013 and it\u2019s familiar to anyone who has hung around a certain type of middle-aged man. They tell you they know exactly who you are (\u201cOf course you\u2019d do that!\u201d said Evans to Spiteri); they pressurise you to conform to their good time (\u201cYou can leave if you want, but why not stay until 10?\u201d: to all of his guests). Everyone is boxed in with overfamiliarity; people are put on the spot to entertain: \u201cWho has a story about Van Morrison?\u201d All tiny things that mean that jovial, we\u2019re-all-friends-here Evans owns everyone around him. Of course, he\u2019s required to be in control, because he\u2019s the presenter. But other presenters do this without making themselves top dog at all times. Well. As the kids say, don\u2019t @ me. I think Evans will do really well at his new job, and I think he deserves to. He\u2019s like all the presenters on A League of Their Own rolled into one. You may well enjoy his show greatly. It\u2019s not for me. Three shows about disability Annalisa Is Awkward This delightful one-off programme explores awkwardness from the point of view of a disabled person. Annalisa Dinnella has a degenerative sight condition: she uses a white stick and regularly experiences other people\u2019s embarrassment. She interviews comedian Jess Thom, who has Tourette syndrome. Thom points out that children aren\u2019t awkward around disability \u2013 \u201ctoddlers think I\u2019m doing it purely for their own amusement\u201d \u2013 but adults teach them that disability is shameful. \u201cWheels are wicked, why are they good on buses and not for people [in wheelchairs]?\u201d she asks. Ouch: Disability Talk Ouch has been broadcasting since 2006, so there are umpteen episodes to choose from, featuring previous presenters Mat Fraser, Liz Carr and newer ones Simon Minty and Kate Monaghan (the programme has plenty of guest presenters). Pick any programme, really, they\u2019re all great, whether you fancy hearing about the trials and tribulations of comedian Tanyalee Davis, or about a cyclist who had a crash and forgot how to speak English. There are shows exploring life with Down\u2019s syndrome, autism, depression, Crohn\u2019s, almost anything you can think of. Recommended. Disability After Dark In which Andrew Gurza discusses sex and disability, no holds barred. A Canadian disability awareness consultant and \u2013 his words - \u201ccripple content creator\u201d, Gurza has been hosting his podcast since 2016. Sometimes his shows are just him talking; other times, he interviews other disabled people about their sexual preferences. It\u2019s strong stuff, quite rightly, and the tone is conversational. Gurza wants to talk about all the stuff that others are too embarrassed to mention, and his generous, relaxed personality means that interviewees do just that.

      "body": "<p>Russell Brand\u2019s diagnosis of the contemporary human predicament, as expressed in vlogs, standup and writing, seems inarguably right \u2013 that we are deluded into thinking that getting what we want makes us happy. His 2014 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/27/revolution-review-russell-brand-beverly-hills-buddhist\" title=\"\">Revolution, </a></em>explored how this delusion has trapped us in an unfulfilling consumerist system, while his next, <em>Recovery </em>(2017), a personal take on the 12-step programme, identified that the compulsive pursuit of satisfying desires can turn into an addiction. \u201cBut what does the wanting want?\u201d, Brand asks with his trademark playfulness in its successor, <em>Mentors</em>.</p> <p>In this compact book with a huge heart, Brand suggests that the \u201cwanting\u201d wants to find meaning, love and connection, and that a \u201cchain of mentorship\u201d can help towards a solution. He introduces us to eight of his own mentors, reviewing his relationships with them and reflecting on how they have helped him in different areas of his life. There are fellow recovering addicts, therapists, spiritual guides, a martial arts instructor, a comedian. For Brand, a mentor is someone who \u201ccan guide you to the frontiers of your self\u201d and unlock \u201cthe potential person that we can become\u201d. Indeed, the book is self-consciously a hero\u2019s journey, from lost youth to mentee to mentor and father.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brand seems to have learned to slow his mind down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One area in which Brand has developed in recent years is in terms of his education. Instead of writing <em>My Booky Wook 3</em>, Brand tried to do something important with <em>Revolution</em>, but it lacked focus. It was a book about everything \u2013 including, in passing, how to create a new kind of society. And it had seemingly been written by everyone: beat poet, standup comic, self-help guru, social sciences flim-flammer, Frank Butcher. <em>Recovery</em> was marginally tighter. But <em>Mentors</em> is altogether more mature. It has a more modest scope. It is written in a consistent voice. Gone are the garbled, irreverent references to canonical thinkers: Brand has outgrown the need to react to them. He seems to have learned to slow his mind down.</p> <p>There are occasional irritations. Vocabulary is in places needlessly obscure (\u201cprognathic\u201d, anyone?) or misused (\u201cinhere\u201d is a repeat offender), and at times the poetry is overstretched beyond sense. Some of the content alienates. Brand writes: \u201cYou know when someone says, \u2018Come and stay at our ashram in southern India\u2019?\u201d No, actually. And with an obliviousness that was highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/russell-brand-change-the-world-try-changing-nappies\" title=\"\">in a recent interview</a> in which his lack of familiarity with the more hands-on aspects of childcare became apparent, he says that \u201call my mentors have floated into my life, like celestial beings\u201d. But unlike Brand, you may not be able to maintain two therapists, an acupuncturist and a personal relationship with an Indian guru. Also, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/12-rules-for-life-jordan-b-peterson-review\" title=\"\">Jordan Peterson</a> really \u201cirrefutably persuasive\u201d?</p> <p>But these distractions are more than compensated for by many touching personal confessions and real, if not wholly original, insights. Among them is an acknowledgment that failure can elevate you, because it gives you a vantage point from which you can help others as a mentor, and because not getting what you want can inspire you to search for meaning.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped</em> by Russell Brand is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Russell Brand\u2019s diagnosis of the contemporary human predicament, as expressed in vlogs, standup and writing, seems inarguably right \u2013 that we are deluded into thinking that getting what we want makes us happy. His 2014 book, Revolution, explored how this delusion has trapped us in an unfulfilling consumerist system, while his next, Recovery (2017), a personal take on the 12-step programme, identified that the compulsive pursuit of satisfying desires can turn into an addiction. \u201cBut what does the wanting want?\u201d, Brand asks with his trademark playfulness in its successor, Mentors. In this compact book with a huge heart, Brand suggests that the \u201cwanting\u201d wants to find meaning, love and connection, and that a \u201cchain of mentorship\u201d can help towards a solution. He introduces us to eight of his own mentors, reviewing his relationships with them and reflecting on how they have helped him in different areas of his life. There are fellow recovering addicts, therapists, spiritual guides, a martial arts instructor, a comedian. For Brand, a mentor is someone who \u201ccan guide you to the frontiers of your self\u201d and unlock \u201cthe potential person that we can become\u201d. Indeed, the book is self-consciously a hero\u2019s journey, from lost youth to mentee to mentor and father. One area in which Brand has developed in recent years is in terms of his education. Instead of writing My Booky Wook 3, Brand tried to do something important with Revolution, but it lacked focus. It was a book about everything \u2013 including, in passing, how to create a new kind of society. And it had seemingly been written by everyone: beat poet, standup comic, self-help guru, social sciences flim-flammer, Frank Butcher. Recovery was marginally tighter. But Mentors is altogether more mature. It has a more modest scope. It is written in a consistent voice. Gone are the garbled, irreverent references to canonical thinkers: Brand has outgrown the need to react to them. He seems to have learned to slow his mind down. There are occasional irritations. Vocabulary is in places needlessly obscure (\u201cprognathic\u201d, anyone?) or misused (\u201cinhere\u201d is a repeat offender), and at times the poetry is overstretched beyond sense. Some of the content alienates. Brand writes: \u201cYou know when someone says, \u2018Come and stay at our ashram in southern India\u2019?\u201d No, actually. And with an obliviousness that was highlighted in a recent interview in which his lack of familiarity with the more hands-on aspects of childcare became apparent, he says that \u201call my mentors have floated into my life, like celestial beings\u201d. But unlike Brand, you may not be able to maintain two therapists, an acupuncturist and a personal relationship with an Indian guru. Also, is Jordan Peterson really \u201cirrefutably persuasive\u201d? But these distractions are more than compensated for by many touching personal confessions and real, if not wholly original, insights. Among them is an acknowledgment that failure can elevate you, because it gives you a vantage point from which you can help others as a mentor, and because not getting what you want can inspire you to search for meaning. \u2022 Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped by Russell Brand is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>I meet<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/28/eddie-mair-to-present-lbc-radios-drivetime-show\" title=\"\"> Eddie Mair</a> in the glistening cockpit of a futuristic spaceship. Actually, I meet him in his LBC radio studio, but it is so fluorescently lit that I almost have a spontaneous migraine. \u201cIt\u2019s like this because it looks better on screen,\u201d says Mair, which sounds odd, because he presents a radio show. But radio has a visual presence these days, and this bright broadcasting box is designed for that.</p> <p>Relaxed and dapper in his suit and shirt (his photo outfit: he\u2019s usually more casually dressed), Mair shows me around. \u201cHave a look at this!\u201d he says, pressing a button. Part of the wall slides back to reveal a small, sealed window that looks out over Charing Cross Road. He shows me hidden drawers that contain differently branded microphone covers, explains that the digital wall display can be changed to the logo of any one of the eight stations \u2013 which also include Heart, Capital and Classic FM \u2013 owned by radio firm Global. Mair seems very much at home in his hi-tech bunker; though, he says, he did have a panic when he first started.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d looked over people\u2019s shoulders when they were working the computer system, and I\u2019d thought: \u2018Oh I vaguely know what that\u2019s about,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut when we finally got into the studio, on the Thursday before the Monday I started, I couldn\u2019t work it. I went home thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get scripts on screen, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with the phones, or faders, or anything. This was a huge mistake!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After a sleepless night, he asked his producer for some one-to-one training, and by lunchtime it was fine. And that, says Mair, was the only time he\u2019s felt regret about leaving his old job, as presenter of Radio 4\u2019s <em>PM</em> show. Sorry, <em>PM</em> fans.</p> <p>Mair was at <em>PM</em> for 20 years, at BBC radio for 31 (he joined when he was 22), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/01/eddie-mair-to-leave-bbc-after-30-years-radio4-pm\" title=\"\">so it really was a surprise when he left</a>. Especially as many Radio 4 heads see LBC as infra-dig, a step down for one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/26/john-humphrys-radio-times-eddie-mair-kirsty-young\" title=\"\">most respected on-air presenters in the UK</a>. How could he switch to commercial radio? And, even worse: a phone-in show! But there it is: Mair\u2019s been at LBC since last September, happily presenting his own show from 4pm to 6pm every weekday. I listen a lot, and enjoy the programme very much: it\u2019s newsy, insightful and fun.</p> <p>And even before Mair tells me why he joined LBC, I can sense part of the reason. Global is the UK\u2019s largest commercial radio broadcaster and its HQ has a definite upbeat glamour. Walls are decorated with positive messages (\u201cHere\u2019s to the obsessives\u2026\u201d); the reception desk flashes with different colours; bright young things in ankle-flashing skinnies dash up and down the spiral staircase. If BBC radio is the sensible family estate car, Global is the glitzy midlife cabriolet. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a midlife crisis!\u201d Mair insists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t remember having fiery opinions which somehow the BBC drummed out of me. I\u2019m an observer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anyhow, when Mair announced his departure from <em>PM</em>, there was much listener woe. His wry humour and interviewing ability had made him an audience favourite, especially over his final few years; he\u2019d won several awards, including a Sony Gold in 2012. I speak to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/05/robert-peston-eddie-mair-twitter-radio-4\" title=\"\">Robert Peston about Mair</a>. Peston appeared on <em>PM</em> many times, and he had a funny, prickly on-air relationship with Mair, which stemmed from a genuine moment of irritation \u2013 Mair once mentioned a story that had been Peston\u2019s scoop; an annoyed Peston said: \u201cDon\u2019t you listen to the BBC?\u201d; then Mair got irritated too. The excellent thing about this story is that after that, every time Peston went on <em>PM</em>, Mair was a bit grumpy; and Peston didn\u2019t know if he was still cross or not. \u201cEventually I worked out that it was an act,\u201d says Peston. \u201cHe kept it going until I left.\u201d</p> <p>Peston spends quite some time telling me how great Mair is: he says Mair never tries to look clever, he\u2019s all about entertaining and engaging the listener. And when I ask for a quote about Mair from Joanna Carr, his long-term <em>PM</em> producer, she emails me a lengthy stream of compliments. \u201cForensic\u201d, \u201cwitty\u201d, \u201csense of theatre\u201d, \u201clistens so carefully\u201d\u2026 \u201cThe thing people don\u2019t see,\u201d she writes, \u201cis how incredibly hard Eddie works. He put so much effort into every part of <em>PM</em>. He thinks a lot about every single interview. He used to listen to every package, every trail, come up with these killer ad libs\u2026 He knows what\u2019s being said in jest and what\u2019s being said from a place of deep emotion and he knows they can coexist in the same minute.\u201d</p> <p>This last is very true: Mair\u2019s graceful ability to switch from seriousness to humour is unparalleled, I think. Plus <em>PM</em> had developed interesting offshoots: the weekly <em>iPM</em> podcast, which took listeners\u2019 stories and developed them into full programmes; the daily Grenfell inquiry podcast, which Mair continued to host after he\u2019d left until the first phase of the inquiry ended.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about <em>PM</em>,\u201d says Peston, \u201cis Eddie created it. It <em>was </em>Eddie.\u201d So why leave? A combination of reasons. First, three years ago, Carr was promoted to head of current affairs; and when she went, he\u2019d wondered: \u201cShould I stop now?\u201d He didn\u2019t, but the thought was there. Second, there was a problem with how <em>PM</em> was being treated within Radio 4. The BBC correspondents that <em>PM</em> wanted on the show were often busy doing other things, \u201cpulled in different directions, online and TV\u201d: <em>PM</em> was not a priority. Mair says, amiably enough, that \u201con <em>PM</em>, we were \u2013 very pleasantly \u2013 generally ignored by the BBC\u201d. But you note that the <em>Today</em> programme is never ignored, and that must have rankled. (Peston says: \u201cI fear he felt that he was undervalued.\u201d)</p> <p>Third: as happens in your 40s and 50s, friends were getting seriously ill, and Mair did too. In early 2018, he was mugged while on holiday in South America, and the cut he got on his neck developed into sepsis. He nearly died. He wrote about this in detail in his <em>Radio Times</em> column and it sounded terrible, but he shrugs it off today as \u201ca minor brush with illness\u201d. He became braver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ae1bb444c35b6a9b1a14685a5a05dee5e8efdb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ae1bb444c35b6a9b1a14685a5a05dee5e8efdb1/0_295_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Mair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Mair photographed in the LBC studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make me fear death,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it made me consider risk, taking a chance. Had it not been for the mugging, and the aftermath, I think I would have been too scared to leave.\u201d</p> <p>As it happened, six months earlier, James Rea, Global\u2019s head of news, had been in touch to say that he\u2019d thought Mair\u2019s <em>PM</em> interview with the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson was great (not the \u201cnasty piece of work\u201d one, but the one where Johnson <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-40358825/boris-johnson-struggles-in-interview\" title=\"\">shuffled his papers and didn\u2019t know his stuff about schools</a>), and had he ever thought about leaving? Mair didn\u2019t jump immediately \u2013 he\u2019s too cautious and respectful for that \u2013 but they had lunch and started a conversation. They still have a conversation now, he says: he and Rea meet every week. They\u2019re meant to talk about the show, \u201cbut honestly, we gossip. We shoot the breeze: \u2018Did you hear about that? What\u2019s going on with her?\u2019 It\u2019s very convivial.\u201d</p> <p>I would love to go for a lunch like this with Mair, because there is a side of him that is immense fun. You could sense this at <em>PM</em>, and it\u2019s there in his LBC show, bubbling under almost all his encounters. He likes to tease people: he pretends throughout our chat that he doesn\u2019t know his producers\u2019 names, he ribs me for being tied to my children\u2019s timetable \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault, Miranda, for procreating.\u201d I\u2019m sure, when he\u2019s not being recorded, he\u2019s a hoot.</p> <p>But when my recorder is on, he has his foot firmly on the emotional brake. He\u2019s far happier being the interviewer, as opposed to the interviewee. I ask him a fairly open question about what he thinks will happen with Brexit (we\u2019re talking before the Commons voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal) and he demurs.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I bet before it\u2019s over, someone else will be called a Nazi.\u201d</p> <p>Give me a guess, I say. You talk to loads of callers about it.</p> <p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t give me knowledge about how it\u2019s going to go. It gives me knowledge about how people are feeling. On one show, a woman said: \u2018I voted Leave and I can\u2019t wait.\u2019 She talked about her daughter\u2019s businesses and I said: \u2018What happens if your daughter\u2019s businesses are affected? What if they lose their jobs?\u2019 And there was a long pause as if she hadn\u2019t considered that, and she said: \u2018Well, that might change my mind but I still think it\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I notice that he shifts focus on to someone he\u2019s talked to, as opposed to saying what he thinks. He doesn\u2019t want to tell me his opinion, which is fair enough. But it\u2019s quite a strange approach for an LBC presenter.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one of the earlier conversations I had [with LBC] I said: \u2018Well, look, I don\u2019t have any opinions about anything. I\u2019m not even sure I have an opinion about having an opinion. So if you want someone to come on and rant at you, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 They said: \u2018No, we have a mix of people, just be you and that\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/21/boris-johnson-struggles-to-answer-questions-about-queens-speech-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/6ktb3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3595728\"            data-video-name=\"Boris Johnson struggles to answer questions about Queen\u2019s speech \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-594ac9cde4b0fb1893fa1624\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/06/22/170621Boriswave_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/06/22/170621Boriswave.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/06/22/170621Boriswave_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/21/boris-johnson-struggles-to-answer-questions-about-queens-speech-audio\">Boris Johnson struggles to answer questions about Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps not showing his hand is part of the BBC training: it\u2019s noteworthy that, of all the weekday LBC presenters, only Mair and Shelagh Fogarty, also ex-BBC, don\u2019t announce their politics loud and clear. With everyone else, you can make a good guess as to how they will vote. \u201cI\u2019ll maybe develop opinions at some point,\u201d says Mair. \u201cI don\u2019t remember having fiery opinions which somehow the BBC drummed out of me. I\u2019m an observer.\u201d</p> <p>He is; and so, he\u2019s a bit of an anomaly. LBC is known for its willingness to put controversialists on air. Katie Hopkins used to have a weekly show (supposedly, staff cheered when she left), and Mair\u2019s programme is followed by an hour of Nigel Farage\u2019s bluster and bluff. Just a few days after our interview, LBC gives Jacob Rees-Mogg his own show. So who are Mair\u2019s friends at his new home? He names Nick Ferrari, James O\u2019Brien, Fogarty, Steve Allen and Andrew Castle as people he would chat to at a party. Not Farage; but Mair tells me a funny story involving the two of them.</p> <p>Last March, Mair happened to be in Leicester Square. No one at the BBC knew he\u2019d been talking to LBC, but he found himself outside Global\u2019s front door.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I thought, I\u2019ll get a selfie of me outside,\u201d he says, looking for the picture on his phone. \u201cSo I line myself up and as I do, I see, behind me, Nigel Farage and someone else coming out of the pub and into the office. It was \u2013 look \u2013 18.40, so he was coming in for his show at 7pm. So I take the shot, and Farage is in it, and then, literally 10 seconds later, utterly randomly, a really senior figure from the BBC appears at my side, and says: \u2018What were you doing there?\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018Oh my God\u2019, and so I said: \u2018Well, I saw a photo opportunity to show what people have been wanting to see for many years \u2013 the back of Nigel Farage.\u2019 And no more questions were asked. Nigel gave me a cover.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good story; and it also shows how excited Mair was to be going to LBC, taking selfies before he\u2019d even arrived. So let\u2019s talk about why he might be so excited: his show.</p> <p>The very first Eddie Mair show was a little awkward \u2013 he had to introduce himself to listeners without a script, and he doesn\u2019t like to be in the spotlight. But since then, it\u2019s settled into a topical discussion of subjects including millennials, dementia care, what kind of king Prince Charles should be, whither M&amp;S and, of course Brexit (LBC listeners <em>love </em>Brexit chat). It also does foreign news (it covers Syria really well) and, naturally, listener experience. Mair enjoys trying to work out the show\u2019s balance: \u201cDo we do a topic at four and a topic at five, do we have a sub-topic that starts at 10 to five, and will that carry on to five-thirty? Do we need a guest there? Have we crowded out good calls with stuff we\u2019ve set up already, have we been brave enough? All that kind of nitty-gritty stuff that we have to worry about, that\u2019s what I love.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d always been frustrated at <em>PM</em> when the show was covering a very newsy subject: \u201cWe wanted to hear how the listeners would respond to it there and then, but we could only get texts and emails.\u201d With his LBC show, of course, he does get a response, and sometimes the topic hits a real nerve. Just before Christmas, on a show devoted to homelessness, \u201cJohn\u201d phoned in. A retired firefighter put on a zero-hours contract, John and his wife could no longer afford rent. They\u2019d fallen on such hard times that all their belongings had been sold and they\u2019d been sleeping in service stations and cheap hotels. John cried on air. Mair is careful when he talks about this, but the show <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/eddie-mair/homeless-pensioner-weeps-down-phone-failure/\" title=\"\">set up a GoFundMe page</a> and the listeners gave John \u00a325,000.</p> <p>Politicians are fond of LBC, too, possibly because they get more time to speak: in the first few weeks, says Mair, he interviewed more politicians than he had in all his years at <em>PM</em>. (He\u2019s never, for instance, interviewed Jeremy Corbyn, and not Theresa May since she\u2019s been prime minister, which I find astonishing.) Ken Clarke came on the show, and has been back twice: \u201cWe can\u2019t get him off.\u201d David Davis is coming in tomorrow, and the other evening, Vince Cable was in for a segment called Convince Vince, where Brexit fans called in to say why the UK should leave Europe, and Cable had to counter their reasons with his own. I listened; it was funny and informative. There are features in the show that are just there for a laugh: every day, for instance, there\u2019s a clip from Steve Allen\u2019s early morning show of him ranting about something random. And the show has a pot called <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/eddie-mair/eddie-mair-introduces-chris-grayling-jar-of-truth/\" title=\"\">the Chris Grayling Jar of Truth.</a> Mair puts a pound in the pot every day that Grayling doesn\u2019t answer his question: does Grayling take personal responsibility for awarding a \u00a314m contract to a firm that has no ships?</p> <p>When we talk about all of this, Mair is engaged and chatty. He could, of course, be earning more money: he was offered <em>Newsnight</em> but turned it down, because \u201cit\u2019s the day-to-day job that I\u2019m interested in\u201d, and TV presenters don\u2019t do half the journalism that radio presenters do.

      "bodyText": "I meet Eddie Mair in the glistening cockpit of a futuristic spaceship. Actually, I meet him in his LBC radio studio, but it is so fluorescently lit that I almost have a spontaneous migraine. \u201cIt\u2019s like this because it looks better on screen,\u201d says Mair, which sounds odd, because he presents a radio show. But radio has a visual presence these days, and this bright broadcasting box is designed for that. Relaxed and dapper in his suit and shirt (his photo outfit: he\u2019s usually more casually dressed), Mair shows me around. \u201cHave a look at this!\u201d he says, pressing a button. Part of the wall slides back to reveal a small, sealed window that looks out over Charing Cross Road. He shows me hidden drawers that contain differently branded microphone covers, explains that the digital wall display can be changed to the logo of any one of the eight stations \u2013 which also include Heart, Capital and Classic FM \u2013 owned by radio firm Global. Mair seems very much at home in his hi-tech bunker; though, he says, he did have a panic when he first started. \u201cI\u2019d looked over people\u2019s shoulders when they were working the computer system, and I\u2019d thought: \u2018Oh I vaguely know what that\u2019s about,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut when we finally got into the studio, on the Thursday before the Monday I started, I couldn\u2019t work it. I went home thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get scripts on screen, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with the phones, or faders, or anything. This was a huge mistake!\u2019\u201d After a sleepless night, he asked his producer for some one-to-one training, and by lunchtime it was fine. And that, says Mair, was the only time he\u2019s felt regret about leaving his old job, as presenter of Radio 4\u2019s PM show. Sorry, PM fans. Mair was at PM for 20 years, at BBC radio for 31 (he joined when he was 22), so it really was a surprise when he left. Especially as many Radio 4 heads see LBC as infra-dig, a step down for one of the most respected on-air presenters in the UK. How could he switch to commercial radio? And, even worse: a phone-in show! But there it is: Mair\u2019s been at LBC since last September, happily presenting his own show from 4pm to 6pm every weekday. I listen a lot, and enjoy the programme very much: it\u2019s newsy, insightful and fun. And even before Mair tells me why he joined LBC, I can sense part of the reason. Global is the UK\u2019s largest commercial radio broadcaster and its HQ has a definite upbeat glamour. Walls are decorated with positive messages (\u201cHere\u2019s to the obsessives\u2026\u201d); the reception desk flashes with different colours; bright young things in ankle-flashing skinnies dash up and down the spiral staircase. If BBC radio is the sensible family estate car, Global is the glitzy midlife cabriolet. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a midlife crisis!\u201d Mair insists. Anyhow, when Mair announced his departure from PM, there was much listener woe. His wry humour and interviewing ability had made him an audience favourite, especially over his final few years; he\u2019d won several awards, including a Sony Gold in 2012. I speak to Robert Peston about Mair. Peston appeared on PM many times, and he had a funny, prickly on-air relationship with Mair, which stemmed from a genuine moment of irritation \u2013 Mair once mentioned a story that had been Peston\u2019s scoop; an annoyed Peston said: \u201cDon\u2019t you listen to the BBC?\u201d; then Mair got irritated too. The excellent thing about this story is that after that, every time Peston went on PM, Mair was a bit grumpy; and Peston didn\u2019t know if he was still cross or not. \u201cEventually I worked out that it was an act,\u201d says Peston. \u201cHe kept it going until I left.\u201d Peston spends quite some time telling me how great Mair is: he says Mair never tries to look clever, he\u2019s all about entertaining and engaging the listener. And when I ask for a quote about Mair from Joanna Carr, his long-term PM producer, she emails me a lengthy stream of compliments. \u201cForensic\u201d, \u201cwitty\u201d, \u201csense of theatre\u201d, \u201clistens so carefully\u201d\u2026 \u201cThe thing people don\u2019t see,\u201d she writes, \u201cis how incredibly hard Eddie works. He put so much effort into every part of PM. He thinks a lot about every single interview. He used to listen to every package, every trail, come up with these killer ad libs\u2026 He knows what\u2019s being said in jest and what\u2019s being said from a place of deep emotion and he knows they can coexist in the same minute.\u201d This last is very true: Mair\u2019s graceful ability to switch from seriousness to humour is unparalleled, I think. Plus PM had developed interesting offshoots: the weekly iPM podcast, which took listeners\u2019 stories and developed them into full programmes; the daily Grenfell inquiry podcast, which Mair continued to host after he\u2019d left until the first phase of the inquiry ended. \u201cThe thing about PM,\u201d says Peston, \u201cis Eddie created it. It was Eddie.\u201d So why leave? A combination of reasons. First, three years ago, Carr was promoted to head of current affairs; and when she went, he\u2019d wondered: \u201cShould I stop now?\u201d He didn\u2019t, but the thought was there. Second, there was a problem with how PM was being treated within Radio 4. The BBC correspondents that PM wanted on the show were often busy doing other things, \u201cpulled in different directions, online and TV\u201d: PM was not a priority. Mair says, amiably enough, that \u201con PM, we were \u2013 very pleasantly \u2013 generally ignored by the BBC\u201d. But you note that the Today programme is never ignored, and that must have rankled. (Peston says: \u201cI fear he felt that he was undervalued.\u201d) Third: as happens in your 40s and 50s, friends were getting seriously ill, and Mair did too. In early 2018, he was mugged while on holiday in South America, and the cut he got on his neck developed into sepsis. He nearly died. He wrote about this in detail in his Radio Times column and it sounded terrible, but he shrugs it off today as \u201ca minor brush with illness\u201d. He became braver. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make me fear death,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it made me consider risk, taking a chance. Had it not been for the mugging, and the aftermath, I think I would have been too scared to leave.\u201d As it happened, six months earlier, James Rea, Global\u2019s head of news, had been in touch to say that he\u2019d thought Mair\u2019s PM interview with the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson was great (not the \u201cnasty piece of work\u201d one, but the one where Johnson shuffled his papers and didn\u2019t know his stuff about schools), and had he ever thought about leaving? Mair didn\u2019t jump immediately \u2013 he\u2019s too cautious and respectful for that \u2013 but they had lunch and started a conversation. They still have a conversation now, he says: he and Rea meet every week. They\u2019re meant to talk about the show, \u201cbut honestly, we gossip. We shoot the breeze: \u2018Did you hear about that? What\u2019s going on with her?\u2019 It\u2019s very convivial.\u201d I would love to go for a lunch like this with Mair, because there is a side of him that is immense fun. You could sense this at PM, and it\u2019s there in his LBC show, bubbling under almost all his encounters. He likes to tease people: he pretends throughout our chat that he doesn\u2019t know his producers\u2019 names, he ribs me for being tied to my children\u2019s timetable \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault, Miranda, for procreating.\u201d I\u2019m sure, when he\u2019s not being recorded, he\u2019s a hoot. But when my recorder is on, he has his foot firmly on the emotional brake. He\u2019s far happier being the interviewer, as opposed to the interviewee. I ask him a fairly open question about what he thinks will happen with Brexit (we\u2019re talking before the Commons voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal) and he demurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I bet before it\u2019s over, someone else will be called a Nazi.\u201d Give me a guess, I say. You talk to loads of callers about it. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t give me knowledge about how it\u2019s going to go. It gives me knowledge about how people are feeling. On one show, a woman said: \u2018I voted Leave and I can\u2019t wait.\u2019 She talked about her daughter\u2019s businesses and I said: \u2018What happens if your daughter\u2019s businesses are affected? What if they lose their jobs?\u2019 And there was a long pause as if she hadn\u2019t considered that, and she said: \u2018Well, that might change my mind but I still think it\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d I notice that he shifts focus on to someone he\u2019s talked to, as opposed to saying what he thinks. He doesn\u2019t want to tell me his opinion, which is fair enough. But it\u2019s quite a strange approach for an LBC presenter. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one of the earlier conversations I had [with LBC] I said: \u2018Well, look, I don\u2019t have any opinions about anything. I\u2019m not even sure I have an opinion about having an opinion. So if you want someone to come on and rant at you, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 They said: \u2018No, we have a mix of people, just be you and that\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d Perhaps not showing his hand is part of the BBC training: it\u2019s noteworthy that, of all the weekday LBC presenters, only Mair and Shelagh Fogarty, also ex-BBC, don\u2019t announce their politics loud and clear. With everyone else, you can make a good guess as to how they will vote. \u201cI\u2019ll maybe develop opinions at some point,\u201d says Mair. \u201cI don\u2019t remember having fiery opinions which somehow the BBC drummed out of me. I\u2019m an observer.\u201d He is; and so, he\u2019s a bit of an anomaly. LBC is known for its willingness to put controversialists on air. Katie Hopkins used to have a weekly show (supposedly, staff cheered when she left), and Mair\u2019s programme is followed by an hour of Nigel Farage\u2019s bluster and bluff. Just a few days after our interview, LBC gives Jacob Rees-Mogg his own show. So who are Mair\u2019s friends at his new home? He names Nick Ferrari, James O\u2019Brien, Fogarty, Steve Allen and Andrew Castle as people he would chat to at a party. Not Farage; but Mair tells me a funny story involving the two of them. Last March, Mair happened to be in Leicester Square. No one at the BBC knew he\u2019d been talking to LBC, but he found himself outside Global\u2019s front door. \u201cAnd I thought, I\u2019ll get a selfie of me outside,\u201d he says, looking for the picture on his phone. \u201cSo I line myself up and as I do, I see, behind me, Nigel Farage and someone else coming out of the pub and into the office. It was \u2013 look \u2013 18.40, so he was coming in for his show at 7pm. So I take the shot, and Farage is in it, and then, literally 10 seconds later, utterly randomly, a really senior figure from the BBC appears at my side, and says: \u2018What were you doing there?\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018Oh my God\u2019, and so I said: \u2018Well, I saw a photo opportunity to show what people have been wanting to see for many years \u2013 the back of Nigel Farage.\u2019 And no more questions were asked. Nigel gave me a cover.\u201d It\u2019s a good story; and it also shows how excited Mair was to be going to LBC, taking selfies before he\u2019d even arrived. So let\u2019s talk about why he might be so excited: his show. The very first Eddie Mair show was a little awkward \u2013 he had to introduce himself to listeners without a script, and he doesn\u2019t like to be in the spotlight. But since then, it\u2019s settled into a topical discussion of subjects including millennials, dementia care, what kind of king Prince Charles should be, whither M&amp;S and, of course Brexit (LBC listeners love Brexit chat). It also does foreign news (it covers Syria really well) and, naturally, listener experience. Mair enjoys trying to work out the show\u2019s balance: \u201cDo we do a topic at four and a topic at five, do we have a sub-topic that starts at 10 to five, and will that carry on to five-thirty? Do we need a guest there? Have we crowded out good calls with stuff we\u2019ve set up already, have we been brave enough? All that kind of nitty-gritty stuff that we have to worry about, that\u2019s what I love.\u201d He\u2019d always been frustrated at PM when the show was covering a very newsy subject: \u201cWe wanted to hear how the listeners would respond to it there and then, but we could only get texts and emails.\u201d With his LBC show, of course, he does get a response, and sometimes the topic hits a real nerve. Just before Christmas, on a show devoted to homelessness, \u201cJohn\u201d phoned in. A retired firefighter put on a zero-hours contract, John and his wife could no longer afford rent. They\u2019d fallen on such hard times that all their belongings had been sold and they\u2019d been sleeping in service stations and cheap hotels. John cried on air. Mair is careful when he talks about this, but the show set up a GoFundMe page and the listeners gave John \u00a325,000. Politicians are fond of LBC, too, possibly because they get more time to speak: in the first few weeks, says Mair, he interviewed more politicians than he had in all his years at PM. (He\u2019s never, for instance, interviewed Jeremy Corbyn, and not Theresa May since she\u2019s been prime minister, which I find astonishing.) Ken Clarke came on the show, and has been back twice: \u201cWe can\u2019t get him off.\u201d David Davis is coming in tomorrow, and the other evening, Vince Cable was in for a segment called Convince Vince, where Brexit fans called in to say why the UK should leave Europe, and Cable had to counter their reasons with his own. I listened; it was funny and informative. There are features in the show that are just there for a laugh: every day, for instance, there\u2019s a clip from Steve Allen\u2019s early morning show of him ranting about something random. And the show has a pot called the Chris Grayling Jar of Truth. Mair puts a pound in the pot every day that Grayling doesn\u2019t answer his question: does Grayling take personal responsibility for awarding a \u00a314m contract to a firm that has no ships? When we talk about all of this, Mair is engaged and chatty. He could, of course, be earning more money: he was offered Newsnight but turned it down, because \u201cit\u2019s the day-to-day job that I\u2019m interested in\u201d, and TV presenters don\u2019t do half the journalism that radio presenters do. Plus he\u2019s excited by the newness, the adventure, the non-BBC-ness. He tells me, with amazement, how Global hires a cinema for a big meeting of everyone in the company when the Rajars come out. (Rajars are the measurement of a show\u2019s audience; they\u2019re released every three months.) At the meeting, Richard Park, Global\u2019s director of broadcasting, goes through every show\u2019s results, in front of everyone else in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frank,\u201d says Mair. \u201cYou know, \u2018You\u2019re doing well, congratulations; you, however, have got to pull your socks up.\u2019\u201d (At PM, says Mair, they were never told their ratings. No one was, other than the Today programme.) \u201cDid you know,\u201d he says, warming to his theme, \u201cthat among 15 to 34-year-olds, in London, LBC has overtaken Radio 4 on both reach and share?\u201d (Reach and share are two ways of judging how people listen to radio.) \u201cWhen I heard that, it was breathtaking to me. In the BBC, there are subcommittees upon subcommittees trying to work out how to get replenishers [younger listeners] to listen to the radio, and people there say: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, they\u2019re not listening, don\u2019t try and get them when they\u2019re 18, 19.\u2019 And here, they seemed to have cracked it!\u201d Mair hastens to add that those figures are from before he came to the station, but it\u2019s clear that he finds them exciting. He\u2019s a work freak. But when I ask him about Beverley Turner, who has just quit LBC, pointing out that it only has two female presenters, he doesn\u2019t want to comment, other than to say: \u201cWell, there are certainly lots of males and lots of white people.\u201d And when I mention that Global\u2019s board is even more white and male than its presenter line-up, he says, mildly: \u201cIs it?\u201d No opinions, remember? Naturally, when I venture into more personal areas, he gets even more tight-lipped. He does try to give me information: he tells me he likes binge-watching TV, and recommends The Bureau and Schitt\u2019s Creek. He listens to podcasts: he loves Alec Baldwin\u2019s interview with Elaine Stritch \u2013 \u201cshe tells this story and for my money, pound for pound, it\u2019s the funniest story I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d He had a five-binbag declutter of his kitchen this weekend. He goes for walks (the day before he started at Global, he got lost three times). I try to find out his typical day and discover that he gets up at the most unbelievably early hour: four or five in the morning. Why, for God\u2019s sake? You don\u2019t have any kids. \u201cWell, I go on the laptop and see what\u2019s going on in the world. And then I compose an email to my producers Virginia and Steve, as I want you to call them in the article. I\u2019m a morning person.\u201d Because of this, he goes to bed at nine, though he does drag himself out on occasion: he\u2019s seen Company and the panto at the Palladium. \u201cLuckily they were loud enough.\u201d \u201cYou really don\u2019t like being interviewed, do you?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s always nicer to interview,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m very interested in other people.

The true, inner stuff, I feel quite at ease with all that. So, the sort of examination that I might get into with other people, I\u2019m there already with myself.\u201d As I leave, the Global PR, who sat in on the interview, asks me, \u201cDo you think Eddie was being serious about the therapy?\u201d And I say, \u201cYes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Activists and lawyers in Zimbabwe fear that the brutal crackdown by security forces will continue \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d as authorities seek to crush all possible opposition to the ruling Zanu-PF party. Hundreds of activists and opposition officials remain in hiding this weekend after almost two weeks of arbitrary arrests, beatings, rapes and abductions committed by police and military in the poor southern African country. The crackdown followed an outbreak of rioting and looting during a shutdown called by union leaders to protest a hike in fuel prices. So far 12 people have been killed, many more injured and between 700 and 1,500 detained. \u201cThis is not going to be over quickly. We have seen that the state have just notched up the level of oppression and that is the level they are going to be operating at for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Doug Coltart, a human rights lawyer in Harare. The abuses are the worst seen in Zimbabwe for at least a decade and have dashed any remaining hopes that the ousting of autocratic ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017 would lead to significant political reform. One veteran activist described the crackdown as likely to become \u201cthe new normal\u201d. \u201cThis is going to go on for weeks, months, however long it takes for the authorities to feel sure they have made certain that there\u2019s no real opposition left,\u201d the activist, who requested anonymity, said. Around 20 arrests were reported on Friday and Saturday across the country, as well as scattered incidents of assault. Police appeared to be targeting poor vendors and taxi drivers. Hundreds of opposition activists are currently in hiding, or have fled overseas. \u201cThey are not just trying to arrest me, they are trying to kill me,\u201d said Ishmael Kawzani, a former independent candidate in local elections, who has fled his home in Kuwadzana, a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of Harare, the capital, which has seen repeated army dragnets in recent days. Jacob Mafume, an MDC spokesperson, said the five members of parliament, 10 councillors and more than 200 members of the party had been detained. At least six people have been charged with subversion \u2013 an unprecedented number \u2013 and so face prison sentences of up to 20 years. They include four trade union officials, an MDC parliamentarian and a well-known social media activist. \u201cThere is a kind of messaging here. They are saying: \u2018We can go for your leaders, so we can go for anyone. They are saying to Zimbabweans we don\u2019t care who you are,\u201d said Alec Muchadehama, a lawyer representing Peter Mutasa, a senior trade union leader charged with subversion. There are also concerns about mass trials of up to 60 men and women accused of participating in riots and looting. It now appears very unlikely that Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe and won contested elections last year, will achieve his stated aim of ending Zimbabwe\u2019s pariah status to unlock the massive financial aid necessary to avert total economic collapse. This suggests that basic commodities such as food, fuel and medicine will remain both scarce and increasingly expensive, making further protests likely. Mnangagwa cut short a trip to Europe and Asia to return to deal with the unrest and pledged dialogue with opposition groups. Authorities have defended the crackdown as a necessary measure to restore order. Labour activists and unions are considering further protests in coming weeks. Teachers have been among the most vocal advocates of further direct action to force concessions from the government over pay and conditions. However, the detention of several leaders of teachers\u2019 unions has made mobilisation harder, officials said.

Small plates \u00a36-\u00a312.50; larger dishes \u00a311-\u00a354.50; wines from \u00a319</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://ollelondon.com/\" title=\"\">Olle</a> Korean barbecue on London\u2019s Shaftesbury Avenue has a shop window which puts the gorgeous displays of diamant\u00e9 alligators and glass slippers over at Fortnum &amp; Mason on Piccadilly to shame. I\u2019ve walked past Olle\u2019s brightly lit picture windows countless times over the past year, and the view has always been intoxicating: diners at broad communal tables, hunched over electric grill plates, tending to sizzling pieces of meat, fish and vegetables as if they were holy relics. It\u2019s dinner with a floor show. I knew it was only a matter of time before I would become one of those diners.</p> <p>And now, here I am, blinking furiously, because I\u2019ve worked out how this enticing shop window display thing works. Bloody hell, it\u2019s bright in here. I feel like I could get a tan just sitting at the table. Not only do the diners look like they are on display from the outside. It feels as if you\u2019re on display when you become one of them on the inside. And so, to my first tip: there\u2019s a downstairs dining room, which I only discovered when I went to the loo. It\u2019s still bright down there, but it\u2019s not encased in glass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4ed8a12e88d90b75fe01bc047b43171d8b02846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4ed8a12e88d90b75fe01bc047b43171d8b02846/0_200_5143_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olle Korean BBQ, 88 Shaftesbury Avenue, Central London, for Jay Rayner\u2019s restaurant review, OM, 14/01/2019.

If you\u2019ve been to a Korean restaurant before, the menu will be broadly familiar. They just do it very well and, most importantly, with an uncommon grace and charm.</p> <p>A decade ago, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, I found my way to <a href=\"https://www.laweekly.com/location/soot-bull-jeep-2182621\" title=\"\">Soot Bull Jeep</a>, one of the last barbecue places in Korea Town still to use red-hot guttering coals rather than an electric hot plate. It was dark in there \u2013 and smoky \u2013 and buckets were strategically placed to deal with plumbing leaks. It gave the whole thing a pleasingly raffish<em>, Blade Runner</em> vibe. Most memorably, the dining room was overseen by furrow-browed Korean women who seemed furious with me for coming at all. They huffed every time they tended my grill. I\u2019m sure the fact I kept returning for dinner didn\u2019t help.</p> <p>The staff at Olle seem genuinely pleased to see us. They want to help, which is good because, as I\u2019ve observed before, there can be an awful lot of admin with Korean food. It\u2019s literally high maintenance. The one bit of help they don\u2019t give is a warning that we should order what we want when we want it, rather than at the start. Because if you order it, they will bring it. All at once. We have the corner of an eight-seater communal table and it quickly fills with bowls and dishes of sauce, with salads and servings of rice. I find myself apologising for the lack of space when actually it\u2019s their fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56e8f7831fdd9d50798f956111315f24674f9199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e8f7831fdd9d50798f956111315f24674f9199/0_166_5160_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olle Korean BBQ, 88 Shaftesbury Avenue, Central London, for Jay Rayner\u2019s restaurant review, OM, 14/01/2019.

Their Korean fried chicken is everything I want it to be, with a double fried crunch that creates ricocheting echoes in every cranial hollow and cavity, followed by the confectionery-shop slap of the sweet-savoury sauce. Korean fried chicken is the food world\u2019s undercover agent. Because it represents a culture about which many of us feel we know relatively little, it gets a free pass on to our plates for being gently exotic. Health concerns do not figure. In truth, nutritionally, this KFC is on a par with something you\u2019d pick up at 2am from a south London branch of <a href=\"https://www.morleyschicken.com/\" title=\"\">Morley\u2019s</a> chicken shop when you\u2019re off your head on Diamond White. I mean all this in a very, very good way.</p> <p>A seafood pajeon, a cross between a pancake and an omelette, is full of the crunch of still pert spring onions, the softness of mollusc and crustacean, and lots of crispy frilly bits. From the thoroughly virtuous side of the ledger comes a stew of seafood and ivory white cubes of tofu in a soybean paste broth. It\u2019s a steamy and encouraging bowlful that feels as if it is determined to mother you, one spoonful at a time. At \u00a311.90, including rice, it\u2019s a substantial meal for one.</p> <p>And then there is the grilling, on a round metal electric hot plate, sunk into the corner of the table. All the usual suspects are here: the bulgogi, or thinly sliced curls of rib eye, to be unfurled once on the heat; galbi, or slivers of short rib, served bone in; the thick slabs of fatty pork belly, and the well-marbled chunks of rib eye. They also have a list of wagyu cuts, at punishing prices: 100gm of Grade 5 rib eye costs \u00a327.25. (Weirdly, this is very good value; at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/01/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-34\" title=\"\">Restaurant 34</a> it\u2019s \u00a345 for the same weight, and at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/07/cut-wolfgang-puck-london-review\" title=\"\">Cut</a> it\u2019s \u00a370).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23ceeef22042103163caece9039daf351f2c94da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ceeef22042103163caece9039daf351f2c94da/0_131_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seafood Pajeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seafood Pajeon: \u2018A cross between a pancake and an omelette.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, go for one of the selections. Ours costs \u00a354.50, includes various meats plus prawns the length of my hand, a pokey salad of shredded spring onions, slabs of onion and king oyster mushroom, plus soya bean paste and sesame oil dips. There is easily enough for three. Now the fun begins. We sizzle and we sear. Occasionally a waiter leans over to cut up pieces of meat that are otherwise too big for the metal chopsticks with which we have been supplied. The pork is for those with a taste for caramelised fat. I have that taste. We gnaw on beef rib bones, band-sawed when it was frozen. It is the slabs of rib-eye, charred outside and pink within, that are the stars. We are our own floor show. For those passing by outside we are also now the window display. A little smoke gets in our eyes and we like it like that. We drink a serviceable sauvignon, and hunker down.</p> <p>We don\u2019t even ask about dessert, because this isn\u2019t the place. Instead we cross the road to somewhere I had also walked past repeatedly. I thought it was a bog-standard caf\u00e9 knocking out boulders of dense and dispiriting cake. It turns out to be a franchised branch of <a href=\"https://pompi.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pompi</a>, the tiramisu specialists from Rome. I have the classic tiramisu for \u00a35.80. It is light and fluffy and creamy and spongy and utterly compelling. There is a heartening coffee kick and shortly after, an empty plate scraped to the glaze. Both Pompi and Olle are proof, if it were needed, that sometimes you really shouldn\u2019t just walk on by.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p><strong>Seoul Kimchi</strong>, a tiny restaurant by Manchester\u2019s Royal Infirmary, was originally a place where Korean students could buy the foods of home, but eventually started cooking and serving it as well. It is basic but good: there are hearty seafood stews, fully stacked bibimbaps and, of course, lots of kimchi. Get booze from the nearby Tesco Express. Search for their page on Facebook.</p> <p>The <strong>Cook Book Club</strong>, originally founded by food writer Thane Prince at the Drapers Arms pub in Islington, as a forum in which to meet cookery writers and share recipes, relaunches on 13 February. The guest speaker is Niki Segnit, author of <em>The</em> <em>F</em><em>lavour Thesaurus</em> and <em>Lateral Cooking</em>. Entry is \u00a310, including a glass of wine. Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrapersCookClub\">@DrapersCookClub</a> on Twitter for event details and more information.</p> <p>It\u2019s all change at the <strong>Swan Inn</strong>, Esher, which has been run for the past three years by chef Claude Bosi and his brother Cedric. It has been taken over by chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro and will re-open in early March with an all-Spanish menu.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2019.

Small plates \u00a36-\u00a312.50; larger dishes \u00a311-\u00a354.50; wines from \u00a319 Olle Korean barbecue on London\u2019s Shaftesbury Avenue has a shop window which puts the gorgeous displays of diamant\u00e9 alligators and glass slippers over at Fortnum &amp; Mason on Piccadilly to shame. I\u2019ve walked past Olle\u2019s brightly lit picture windows countless times over the past year, and the view has always been intoxicating: diners at broad communal tables, hunched over electric grill plates, tending to sizzling pieces of meat, fish and vegetables as if they were holy relics. It\u2019s dinner with a floor show. I knew it was only a matter of time before I would become one of those diners. And now, here I am, blinking furiously, because I\u2019ve worked out how this enticing shop window display thing works. Bloody hell, it\u2019s bright in here. I feel like I could get a tan just sitting at the table. Not only do the diners look like they are on display from the outside. It feels as if you\u2019re on display when you become one of them on the inside. And so, to my first tip: there\u2019s a downstairs dining room, which I only discovered when I went to the loo. It\u2019s still bright down there, but it\u2019s not encased in glass. You get used to it in the end, thankfully, because this restaurant is worth the effort. \u201cOlle\u201d is apparently the word for a path, in the dialect of an island off the coast of South Korea, though there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly regional or niche about the offering here. If you\u2019ve been to a Korean restaurant before, the menu will be broadly familiar. They just do it very well and, most importantly, with an uncommon grace and charm. A decade ago, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, I found my way to Soot Bull Jeep, one of the last barbecue places in Korea Town still to use red-hot guttering coals rather than an electric hot plate. It was dark in there \u2013 and smoky \u2013 and buckets were strategically placed to deal with plumbing leaks. It gave the whole thing a pleasingly raffish, Blade Runner vibe. Most memorably, the dining room was overseen by furrow-browed Korean women who seemed furious with me for coming at all. They huffed every time they tended my grill. I\u2019m sure the fact I kept returning for dinner didn\u2019t help. The staff at Olle seem genuinely pleased to see us. They want to help, which is good because, as I\u2019ve observed before, there can be an awful lot of admin with Korean food. It\u2019s literally high maintenance. The one bit of help they don\u2019t give is a warning that we should order what we want when we want it, rather than at the start. Because if you order it, they will bring it. All at once. We have the corner of an eight-seater communal table and it quickly fills with bowls and dishes of sauce, with salads and servings of rice. I find myself apologising for the lack of space when actually it\u2019s their fault. Alongside the ingredients for barbecuing, which we\u2019ll come to, there are many standards. Their Korean fried chicken is everything I want it to be, with a double fried crunch that creates ricocheting echoes in every cranial hollow and cavity, followed by the confectionery-shop slap of the sweet-savoury sauce. Korean fried chicken is the food world\u2019s undercover agent. Because it represents a culture about which many of us feel we know relatively little, it gets a free pass on to our plates for being gently exotic. Health concerns do not figure. In truth, nutritionally, this KFC is on a par with something you\u2019d pick up at 2am from a south London branch of Morley\u2019s chicken shop when you\u2019re off your head on Diamond White. I mean all this in a very, very good way. A seafood pajeon, a cross between a pancake and an omelette, is full of the crunch of still pert spring onions, the softness of mollusc and crustacean, and lots of crispy frilly bits. From the thoroughly virtuous side of the ledger comes a stew of seafood and ivory white cubes of tofu in a soybean paste broth. It\u2019s a steamy and encouraging bowlful that feels as if it is determined to mother you, one spoonful at a time. At \u00a311.90, including rice, it\u2019s a substantial meal for one. And then there is the grilling, on a round metal electric hot plate, sunk into the corner of the table. All the usual suspects are here: the bulgogi, or thinly sliced curls of rib eye, to be unfurled once on the heat; galbi, or slivers of short rib, served bone in; the thick slabs of fatty pork belly, and the well-marbled chunks of rib eye. They also have a list of wagyu cuts, at punishing prices: 100gm of Grade 5 rib eye costs \u00a327.25. (Weirdly, this is very good value; at Restaurant 34 it\u2019s \u00a345 for the same weight, and at Cut it\u2019s \u00a370). Instead, go for one of the selections. Ours costs \u00a354.50, includes various meats plus prawns the length of my hand, a pokey salad of shredded spring onions, slabs of onion and king oyster mushroom, plus soya bean paste and sesame oil dips. There is easily enough for three. Now the fun begins. We sizzle and we sear. Occasionally a waiter leans over to cut up pieces of meat that are otherwise too big for the metal chopsticks with which we have been supplied. The pork is for those with a taste for caramelised fat. I have that taste. We gnaw on beef rib bones, band-sawed when it was frozen. It is the slabs of rib-eye, charred outside and pink within, that are the stars. We are our own floor show. For those passing by outside we are also now the window display. A little smoke gets in our eyes and we like it like that. We drink a serviceable sauvignon, and hunker down. We don\u2019t even ask about dessert, because this isn\u2019t the place. Instead we cross the road to somewhere I had also walked past repeatedly. I thought it was a bog-standard caf\u00e9 knocking out boulders of dense and dispiriting cake. It turns out to be a franchised branch of Pompi, the tiramisu specialists from Rome. I have the classic tiramisu for \u00a35.80. It is light and fluffy and creamy and spongy and utterly compelling. There is a heartening coffee kick and shortly after, an empty plate scraped to the glaze. Both Pompi and Olle are proof, if it were needed, that sometimes you really shouldn\u2019t just walk on by. News bites Seoul Kimchi, a tiny restaurant by Manchester\u2019s Royal Infirmary, was originally a place where Korean students could buy the foods of home, but eventually started cooking and serving it as well. It is basic but good: there are hearty seafood stews, fully stacked bibimbaps and, of course, lots of kimchi. Get booze from the nearby Tesco Express. Search for their page on Facebook. The Cook Book Club, originally founded by food writer Thane Prince at the Drapers Arms pub in Islington, as a forum in which to meet cookery writers and share recipes, relaunches on 13 February. The guest speaker is Niki Segnit, author of The Flavour Thesaurus and Lateral Cooking. Entry is \u00a310, including a glass of wine. Follow @DrapersCookClub on Twitter for event details and more information. It\u2019s all change at the Swan Inn, Esher, which has been run for the past three years by chef Claude Bosi and his brother Cedric. It has been taken over by chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro and will re-open in early March with an all-Spanish menu. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1 \u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2019. An earlier version mistakenly called Niki Segnit\u2019s book the Food Thesaurus. This has been corrected.",

Lesson learned. In the run-up to the Bush 88 campaign, the then-vice-president and his staff internalized the significance of WAYRFP. The electorate rewarded their efforts.</p> <p>Generally, campaign books endeavor to simultaneously show enough leg and sanitize a wannabe\u2019s ambition, aiming to make the candidate interesting without giving too much away. But a political memoir can also say and do plenty. On that score, think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/05/politics\">The Audacity of Hope</a>, Barack Obama\u2019s profession of political faith from 2006.</p> <p>In his 2004 keynote speech at the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19751-2004Jul27.html?noredirect=on\">Democratic national convention</a>, the Illinois senator announced: \u201cThere is not a liberal America and a conservative America \u2013 there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America \u2013 there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d He used his book to further develop the themes that would underlie his 2008 campaign, namely his life story and an ambivalent relationship with identity politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I reject politics that is based solely on racial identity, gender identity, sexual orientation or victimhood generally</p> <footer> <cite>Barack Obama, The Audacity of Hope</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI reject politics that is based solely on racial identity, gender identity, sexual orientation or victimhood generally,\u201d he wrote, words that would reassure the swing voters who helped him stitch together the largest Democratic plurality in more than 40 years. For good measure, he won an absolute majority of the popular vote each time out and, these days, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/publicpolicypolling/ppp-alert-democrats-have-big-enthusiasm-edge-for-1525517?e=9531364849\">comes first</a> when it comes to who voters say is the best president in the past 40 years, a 180-degree turnabout <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/poll-obama-worst-president-since-wwii-108507\">from 2014</a>. As for the incumbent, 44% view Donald Trump as the worst.</p> <p>Not all memoirs are created equal. Some are genuinely poignant, many are personal and policy rollouts, others are cut-and-paste jobs that sandwich a candidate\u2019s recent speeches and essays between two covers, like an aging rock band\u2019s greatest hits album.</p> <p>Bernie Sanders\u2019 latest, Where We Go from Here, recapitulates his traditional themes and rightly takes credit for defining the fight for the 2016 Democratic nomination, shaping the party\u2019s platform and upping the use of social media as a campaign tool. But he leaves too many questions unanswered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a4401675d38acf438bc43f77b7b2ed144e78610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a4401675d38acf438bc43f77b7b2ed144e78610/0_100_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders speaks in Miami, in November 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders speaks in Miami, in November 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disappointingly, Vermont\u2019s septuagenarian junior senator essentially ignores how to pay for the vast expansion of government he expects. In 2016, Sanders <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/\">backed a plan</a> that one independent thinktank said would lead to steeply reduced growth, \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4194179/bernie-sanders-tax-plan/\">10.56% lower after-tax income for all taxpayers</a>, and a 17.91% lower after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans\u201d. Now, Sanders chooses to rely upon systemic condemnation, confident that in the Age of Trump detail is irrelevant.</p> <p>We have seen that movie before and it cost Sanders dearly. In the run-up to the 2016 New York primary, he appeared before the <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-bernie-sanders-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2588306\">New York Daily News editorial board</a> and proved himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/05/this-new-york-daily-news-interview-was-pretty-close-to-a-disaster-for-bernie-sanders/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.588ae7cd6a13\">unprepared and incapable</a> of meaningfully addressing the role of the Federal Reserve in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/bernie-sanderss-rough-ride-with-the-daily-news/476919/\">his proposed breakup of US banks</a>.</p> <p>Sanders veered and swerved but never delivered a coherent response. For good measure, he also <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/04/05/bernie-sanders-new-york-daily-news-edit-board/82677134/\">struggled to opine on Obama\u2019s drone-strike policy</a> (\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that\u201d) and where he would imprison a captured Isis militant (\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t thought about it a whole lot\u201d).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/26/promise-me-dad-review-joe-biden-memoir-trump\">Promise Me, Dad review \u2013 moving Biden memoir that wonders: could he have beaten Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The senator had served in Congress since 1991: one would have expected more.

To be clear, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/374912-sanders-why-didnt-clinton-campaign-speak-up-about-russian-bots-during-2016\">Sanders has denied</a> contemporaneous knowledge, saying: \u201cI did not know Russian bots were promoting my campaign.\u201d But he has also argued that Hillary Clinton could have done more to publicize interference by the Kremlin.</p> <p>Being a populist prophet is not the same as being ready on day one, although as Trump proved, straight answers and command of the facts are not prerequisites to electoral success. Social sentiments and grievance may propel a candidate to victory. Authenticity can carry the day.</p> <p>If Sanders is the Howard Beale of the Democratic field, the mad-as-hell TV commentator of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/23/network-40-years-reality-tv-donald-trump\">the 1976 movie Network</a>, then Joe Biden is the uncle you\u2019re happiest to see at Thanksgiving, the one with the jokes whose kids like him and whose wife smiles through unclenched teeth. Although this won\u2019t be enough for Biden to win the nomination if he chooses to run, it is the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/26/promise-me-dad-review-joe-biden-memoir-trump\">his latest book</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces</p> <footer> <cite>Kamala Harris, The Truths We Hold</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/26/promise-me-dad-review-joe-biden-memoir-trump\">Promise Me, Dad</a> is a father\u2019s story, a look back at the last year of the life of Beau Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s oldest son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/31/beau-biden-dies-of-brain-cancer\">who died of brain cancer in May 2015</a>. Beau was a former Delaware attorney general and Iraq war veteran. Promise Me, Dad melds his battle with cancer with the political events that filled his father\u2019s calendar. It is also the tale of an old-time north-east Democratic pol who understands that culture and coalitions both count.</p> <p>Among other things, Biden writes of paying his respects to two New York City policemen who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/mayor-bill-de-blasio-police-two-nypd-officers-shot-dead\">shot dead just for being cops</a>. One was Latino, the other Asian American. Biden\u2019s grief rings genuine: \u201cThe assassin\u2019s bullet targeted not just two officers, not just a uniform. It targeted this city.\u201d</p> <p>For the record, Biden \u201cgot it\u201d far more easily than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/mayor-bill-de-blasio-police-two-nypd-officers-shot-dead\">Bill de Blasio</a>, the city\u2019s tin-eared mayor who has also flirted with a 2020 run. As Biden put it, the mayor \u201cseemed happy that it was me representing the administration because he knew I had a close relationship with the police and the civil rights community\u201d.</p> <p>The book also covers Biden\u2019s globetrotting. He makes resoundingly clear his disdain for Vladimir Putin. Describing a meeting in Moscow, Biden writes, \u201cMr Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes \u2026 I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u201d To which Putin reportedly responded: \u201cWe understand each other.\u201d</p> <p>America awaits the Mueller report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff5c9dd47171e1c25004df2244e79d2743aa15d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff5c9dd47171e1c25004df2244e79d2743aa15d3/0_46_3643_2187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden salutes the audience at the United States Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden salutes the audience at the United States Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Harris threads the needle</h2> <p>Last Monday, Martin Luther King Day, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/21/kamala-harris-2020-president-election-run-democrat-senator-california-news\">California senator Kamala Harris formally announced her candidacy</a>. Later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillOReilly/status/1087486705433755648/video/1\">Bill O\u2019Reilly</a>, the disgraced former Fox host, tweeted that he would not vote for Harris, citing her denial of \u201cdue process\u201d to the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/21/kamala-harris-2020-president-election-run-meteoric-rise\">'Nobody works harder': insiders recall Kamala Harris's meteoric rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other words, race and gender will continue to buffet our politics. Harris\u2019s book released earlier this month, The Truths We Hold, signals that she will be doubling down rather than backing off.</p> <p>Harris, who is biracial, does not triangulate when it comes to identity politics. The book\u2019s preface proclaims: \u201cWe need to speak truth: that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces.\u201d Pages later, she delivers a shout-out to Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Further complicating Harris\u2019s road to the White House is her apparent discomfort with Brian Buescher, a Trump nominee for district court in Nebraska, being a member of the Knights of Columbus, <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/kamala-harris-knights-of-columbus-religious-test/\">a traditional Catholic social organization</a>. For conservatives and others, that will smack of anti-Catholicism and a religious litmus test.</p> <p>The senator bets that as a former prosecutor she can thread the needle between the demands of the Democrats\u2019 voting core and the wider electorate, moving left in the hope she will bring the center along. While The Truths We Hold disclaims being a policy platform, it is very much that. It offers up an array of middle-class-friendly initiatives, including a call for a tax break, and examines the housing collapse and mortgage crisis.</p> <p>Here, Harris gets granular and demonstrates a command of her brief. Specifically, she recounts her role in negotiations in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/business/how-kamala-harris-finessed-a-foreclosure-deal-for-california.html\">foreclosure abuse settlement</a>. Indeed, she delights in describing how the banks and their lawyers reacted in the course of negotiations. Beyond that, she vents her anger at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the regulators who were asleep at the switch. Or worse.</p> <p>Harris has had her share of scrapes with the GOP. She has been attacked for her questioning of <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/08/gop-senator-admonishes-democrat-for-persistent-questioning/\">Rod Rosenstein</a>, the deputy attorney general, and Gen John Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and second Trump chief of staff. For good measure, Harris writes about how in the administration\u2019s early days she called Kelly at home about the initial travel ban.

      "bodyText": "Our quadrennial marathon is on, and nothing says election season better than a campaign-ready memoir. Kamala Harris, who is running, and Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who may well run, have each released a book to answer the make-or-break question: \u201cWhy are you running for president\u201d, also known as WAYRFP. Make no mistake, coming up short in response can put an end to a candidacy. In 1979, Edward Kennedy struggled to respond to that query on national television, and never recovered in his bid to unseat Jimmy Carter. Lesson learned. In the run-up to the Bush 88 campaign, the then-vice-president and his staff internalized the significance of WAYRFP. The electorate rewarded their efforts. Generally, campaign books endeavor to simultaneously show enough leg and sanitize a wannabe\u2019s ambition, aiming to make the candidate interesting without giving too much away. But a political memoir can also say and do plenty. On that score, think The Audacity of Hope, Barack Obama\u2019s profession of political faith from 2006. In his 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic national convention, the Illinois senator announced: \u201cThere is not a liberal America and a conservative America \u2013 there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America \u2013 there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d He used his book to further develop the themes that would underlie his 2008 campaign, namely his life story and an ambivalent relationship with identity politics. \u201cI reject politics that is based solely on racial identity, gender identity, sexual orientation or victimhood generally,\u201d he wrote, words that would reassure the swing voters who helped him stitch together the largest Democratic plurality in more than 40 years. For good measure, he won an absolute majority of the popular vote each time out and, these days, comes first when it comes to who voters say is the best president in the past 40 years, a 180-degree turnabout from 2014. As for the incumbent, 44% view Donald Trump as the worst. Not all memoirs are created equal. Some are genuinely poignant, many are personal and policy rollouts, others are cut-and-paste jobs that sandwich a candidate\u2019s recent speeches and essays between two covers, like an aging rock band\u2019s greatest hits album. Bernie Sanders\u2019 latest, Where We Go from Here, recapitulates his traditional themes and rightly takes credit for defining the fight for the 2016 Democratic nomination, shaping the party\u2019s platform and upping the use of social media as a campaign tool. But he leaves too many questions unanswered. Disappointingly, Vermont\u2019s septuagenarian junior senator essentially ignores how to pay for the vast expansion of government he expects. In 2016, Sanders backed a plan that one independent thinktank said would lead to steeply reduced growth, \u201c10.56% lower after-tax income for all taxpayers, and a 17.91% lower after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans\u201d. Now, Sanders chooses to rely upon systemic condemnation, confident that in the Age of Trump detail is irrelevant. We have seen that movie before and it cost Sanders dearly. In the run-up to the 2016 New York primary, he appeared before the New York Daily News editorial board and proved himself unprepared and incapable of meaningfully addressing the role of the Federal Reserve in his proposed breakup of US banks. Sanders veered and swerved but never delivered a coherent response. For good measure, he also struggled to opine on Obama\u2019s drone-strike policy (\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that\u201d) and where he would imprison a captured Isis militant (\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t thought about it a whole lot\u201d). The senator had served in Congress since 1991: one would have expected more. After a drubbing by Empire State Democrats, his fate was sealed. Similarly, Where We Go from Here does not explain what assistance Sanders\u2019 campaign actually received from Russia. A February 2018 criminal indictment against 13 Russian nationals and three businesses alleged that they had \u201csupport[ed] Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump\u201d. To be clear, Sanders has denied contemporaneous knowledge, saying: \u201cI did not know Russian bots were promoting my campaign.\u201d But he has also argued that Hillary Clinton could have done more to publicize interference by the Kremlin. Being a populist prophet is not the same as being ready on day one, although as Trump proved, straight answers and command of the facts are not prerequisites to electoral success. Social sentiments and grievance may propel a candidate to victory. Authenticity can carry the day. If Sanders is the Howard Beale of the Democratic field, the mad-as-hell TV commentator of the 1976 movie Network, then Joe Biden is the uncle you\u2019re happiest to see at Thanksgiving, the one with the jokes whose kids like him and whose wife smiles through unclenched teeth. Although this won\u2019t be enough for Biden to win the nomination if he chooses to run, it is the foundation of his latest book. Promise Me, Dad is a father\u2019s story, a look back at the last year of the life of Beau Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s oldest son who died of brain cancer in May 2015. Beau was a former Delaware attorney general and Iraq war veteran. Promise Me, Dad melds his battle with cancer with the political events that filled his father\u2019s calendar. It is also the tale of an old-time north-east Democratic pol who understands that culture and coalitions both count. Among other things, Biden writes of paying his respects to two New York City policemen who were shot dead just for being cops. One was Latino, the other Asian American. Biden\u2019s grief rings genuine: \u201cThe assassin\u2019s bullet targeted not just two officers, not just a uniform. It targeted this city.\u201d For the record, Biden \u201cgot it\u201d far more easily than Bill de Blasio, the city\u2019s tin-eared mayor who has also flirted with a 2020 run. As Biden put it, the mayor \u201cseemed happy that it was me representing the administration because he knew I had a close relationship with the police and the civil rights community\u201d. The book also covers Biden\u2019s globetrotting. He makes resoundingly clear his disdain for Vladimir Putin. Describing a meeting in Moscow, Biden writes, \u201cMr Prime Minister, I\u2019m looking into your eyes \u2026 I don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u201d To which Putin reportedly responded: \u201cWe understand each other.\u201d America awaits the Mueller report. Harris threads the needle Last Monday, Martin Luther King Day, the California senator Kamala Harris formally announced her candidacy. Later, Bill O\u2019Reilly, the disgraced former Fox host, tweeted that he would not vote for Harris, citing her denial of \u201cdue process\u201d to the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh. In other words, race and gender will continue to buffet our politics. Harris\u2019s book released earlier this month, The Truths We Hold, signals that she will be doubling down rather than backing off. Harris, who is biracial, does not triangulate when it comes to identity politics. The book\u2019s preface proclaims: \u201cWe need to speak truth: that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and antisemitism are real in this country, and we need to confront those forces.\u201d Pages later, she delivers a shout-out to Black Lives Matter. Further complicating Harris\u2019s road to the White House is her apparent discomfort with Brian Buescher, a Trump nominee for district court in Nebraska, being a member of the Knights of Columbus, a traditional Catholic social organization. For conservatives and others, that will smack of anti-Catholicism and a religious litmus test. The senator bets that as a former prosecutor she can thread the needle between the demands of the Democrats\u2019 voting core and the wider electorate, moving left in the hope she will bring the center along. While The Truths We Hold disclaims being a policy platform, it is very much that. It offers up an array of middle-class-friendly initiatives, including a call for a tax break, and examines the housing collapse and mortgage crisis. Here, Harris gets granular and demonstrates a command of her brief. Specifically, she recounts her role in negotiations in the foreclosure abuse settlement. Indeed, she delights in describing how the banks and their lawyers reacted in the course of negotiations. Beyond that, she vents her anger at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the regulators who were asleep at the switch. Or worse. Harris has had her share of scrapes with the GOP. She has been attacked for her questioning of Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Gen John Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and second Trump chief of staff. For good measure, Harris writes about how in the administration\u2019s early days she called Kelly at home about the initial travel ban. Kelly sounded none too happy. The latest polls show Trump beatable. Harris has buzz, Biden has doubts, Sanders has memories. Over time, what they wrote will be less remembered than the fact that they each wrote a book \u2013 except during debate prep. Election day 2020 is closer than we realize.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told since fifth grade that college makes you a better person,\u201d said the young woman. Her mother, an immigrant from Mexico, had always dreamed of going to college, but never got the chance. So, as she started her senior year at KIPP University Prep, a charter school in San Antonio, she buckled down and filled out applications to more than a dozen schools.</p> <p>But then, suddenly, things went sideways. Her mother was in the process of becoming a US citizen this fall, and she was afraid that the financial aid application might derail the process. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the young woman asked me not to use her real name. I\u2019ll call her Mariela.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/18_0921_USCIS_Proposed-Rule-Public-Charge.pdf\">Back in September</a>, the Trump administration announced a<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/2/8/16993172/trump-regulation-immigrants-benefits-public-charge\"> long-rumored proposal</a> to deter immigrants seeking long-term legal residency from using public health, nutrition and housing programs. The result would be that immigrants who use these programs would have a lower chance of receiving long-term legal residency in the United States. While this so-called <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/commentary/new-proposed-green-card-rule-dramatically-misrepresents-immigrant-communities/\">\u201cpublic charge\u201d rule</a> does not apply to federal financial aid programs, Mariela\u2019s mother still worried.

It has left<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/\"> hundreds of thousands</a> of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipients uncertain about their legal status. It has ripped <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/immigrants-rights-and-detention/family-separation\">thousands</a> of vulnerable children from asylum-seeking families at the border. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2018/10/02/feature/a-14-year-old-prepares-for-life-without-her-immigrant-parents/?utm_term=.a73c2106303f\">Nearly 200,000</a> US-citizen children stand to lose their immigrant parents to the administration\u2019s sunsetting of their legal right to stay in the country. The public charge proposal alone would affect the long-term legal status of nearly 400,000 immigrants each year.</p> <p>The underlying message \u2013 the symbolism \u2013 is clear. In each of these cases, the administration presents immigrants as dangerous. It targets them as others, as not-fully-human, as competitors that undermine the values, pocketbooks and opportunities of native-born Americans. It demeans immigrants and divides them from native-born Americans.</p> <p>Think about the ugly messages Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda reinforces for native-born Americans. It suggests that, whenever possible, immigrants should be dissuaded from coming to the United States \u2013 even if that requires threatening and/or harming children. Further, it suggests that legal immigrants working and paying taxes in the United States should be discouraged from using public programs that would help them and their families live healthier, more productive lives.</p> <p>It seems almost quaint to insist on this in 2019, when the facts of so many matters have been so thoroughly damned so many times, but still: almost none of this thinking is even remotely tethered to the real world. There are reams of research<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078741/\"> showing</a> how immigrants make communities \u2013 and the country \u2013<a href=\"http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550\"> richer, safer and better</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/07/detained-us-immigration-jfk-white-woman-british-passport\">Detained at US immigration, I felt frightened. And very lucky | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mariela\u2019s ears are open too. Think about how she hears these messages emboldening many native-born Americans\u2019 prejudices. In the past two years, Mariela says that she\u2019s repeatedly been abused by white strangers. They taunt her \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re gonna get deported\u201d \u2013 and that, she says, \u201cmakes me feel like I\u2019m illegal here\u201d.</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s mistrust of an antagonistic, fickle US government could leave a citizen like Mariela without a path through college. It would scramble her precarious, carefully laid plans. She\u2019s done everything right \u2013 she\u2019s worked hard and built a foundation for her future. She wants to believe in this country, in its meritocratic promises \u2013 work hard, get a degree, do better than your parents. But, in 2019, it\u2019s not entirely clear to her that her country believes in or has a place for her.</p> <p>There are millions of others like Mariela \u2013 children with at least one immigrant parent are<a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/29106/412203-Young-Children-of-Immigrants-The-Leading-Edge-of-America-s-Future.PDF\"> a growing segment</a> of the US student body today, and will be<a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/37f7/e062eca591f51f7b4bf5666ff90df5200dc2.pdf\"> a large share</a> of the US workforce in the future. What happens if the Trump administration\u2019s agenda blocks their ambitions and dashes their hopes? Deterring these children from college will make them less educated, and less productive, but it\u2019s hard to see how it makes the country better.</p> <p>The administration\u2019s immigration agenda also divides immigrant families from native-born American families (many of whom, we should note, are just immigrant families of a marginally less recent vintage). It\u2019s undermining how these families see one another. And for what? Short-term political gains fueled by anxious American revanchism?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The United States is not what I\u2019d call a free country, because we\u2019re still in the shadows, hiding</p> <footer> <cite>Gustavo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of Mariela\u2019s classmates, who I will call Gustavo, ran into similar difficulties this fall.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019ve been told since fifth grade that college makes you a better person,\u201d said the young woman. Her mother, an immigrant from Mexico, had always dreamed of going to college, but never got the chance. So, as she started her senior year at KIPP University Prep, a charter school in San Antonio, she buckled down and filled out applications to more than a dozen schools. But then, suddenly, things went sideways. Her mother was in the process of becoming a US citizen this fall, and she was afraid that the financial aid application might derail the process. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the young woman asked me not to use her real name. I\u2019ll call her Mariela. Back in September, the Trump administration announced a long-rumored proposal to deter immigrants seeking long-term legal residency from using public health, nutrition and housing programs. The result would be that immigrants who use these programs would have a lower chance of receiving long-term legal residency in the United States. While this so-called \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule does not apply to federal financial aid programs, Mariela\u2019s mother still worried. Advocates for immigrant families call this \u201cthe chilling effect\u201d of the administration\u2019s approach to immigration. Mariela\u2019s story shows how, stunning as it sounds, the symbolism of the administration\u2019s immigration agenda may matter even more than the substance. Sure, the substance of the administration\u2019s agenda is amply cruel. It has left hundreds of thousands of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipients uncertain about their legal status. It has ripped thousands of vulnerable children from asylum-seeking families at the border. Nearly 200,000 US-citizen children stand to lose their immigrant parents to the administration\u2019s sunsetting of their legal right to stay in the country. The public charge proposal alone would affect the long-term legal status of nearly 400,000 immigrants each year. The underlying message \u2013 the symbolism \u2013 is clear. In each of these cases, the administration presents immigrants as dangerous. It targets them as others, as not-fully-human, as competitors that undermine the values, pocketbooks and opportunities of native-born Americans. It demeans immigrants and divides them from native-born Americans. Think about the ugly messages Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda reinforces for native-born Americans. It suggests that, whenever possible, immigrants should be dissuaded from coming to the United States \u2013 even if that requires threatening and/or harming children. Further, it suggests that legal immigrants working and paying taxes in the United States should be discouraged from using public programs that would help them and their families live healthier, more productive lives. It seems almost quaint to insist on this in 2019, when the facts of so many matters have been so thoroughly damned so many times, but still: almost none of this thinking is even remotely tethered to the real world. There are reams of research showing how immigrants make communities \u2013 and the country \u2013 richer, safer and better. Mariela\u2019s ears are open too. Think about how she hears these messages emboldening many native-born Americans\u2019 prejudices. In the past two years, Mariela says that she\u2019s repeatedly been abused by white strangers. They taunt her \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re gonna get deported\u201d \u2013 and that, she says, \u201cmakes me feel like I\u2019m illegal here\u201d. Her mother\u2019s mistrust of an antagonistic, fickle US government could leave a citizen like Mariela without a path through college. It would scramble her precarious, carefully laid plans. She\u2019s done everything right \u2013 she\u2019s worked hard and built a foundation for her future. She wants to believe in this country, in its meritocratic promises \u2013 work hard, get a degree, do better than your parents. But, in 2019, it\u2019s not entirely clear to her that her country believes in or has a place for her. There are millions of others like Mariela \u2013 children with at least one immigrant parent are a growing segment of the US student body today, and will be a large share of the US workforce in the future. What happens if the Trump administration\u2019s agenda blocks their ambitions and dashes their hopes? Deterring these children from college will make them less educated, and less productive, but it\u2019s hard to see how it makes the country better. The administration\u2019s immigration agenda also divides immigrant families from native-born American families (many of whom, we should note, are just immigrant families of a marginally less recent vintage). It\u2019s undermining how these families see one another. And for what? Short-term political gains fueled by anxious American revanchism? One of Mariela\u2019s classmates, who I will call Gustavo, ran into similar difficulties this fall. As he approached college and financial aid applications, his parents balked. \u201c[They] told me not to fill mine out. They were scared that something might happen to my mom,\u201d he said. She\u2019s in the country on a visa, and Gustavo said the family worried that applying for financial aid to support his education could cost her the right to stay with her husband and son, both of whom are native-born US citizens. Money\u2019s tight in Gustavo\u2019s family \u2013 he says he works after school to help pay the bills. He can\u2019t see a path to college without financial aid. Asked if he feels American, Gustavo hesitates, mulling his long life in the country, reflecting on his deferred dreams. Maybe someday, he says, when he and \u201cevery Hispanic person can feel safe going out and not have any type of racial slurs\u201d. He sighs. \u201cThe United States is not what I\u2019d call a free country, because we\u2019re still in the shadows, hiding.\u201d His situation more or less sums up the problem with the administration\u2019s immigration agenda. Most of it is substantively ineffective, more likely to inflict cruelty on vulnerable families than to achieve any meaningful improvements to the United States. And yet, all of it further stigmatizes immigrant families, and that detaches them from the country\u2019s social life and public institutions. Through a strange and selfish alchemy, it converts basic pieces of upward mobility \u2013 access to food, healthcare and education \u2013 into supposed luxuries that immigrants and their children should not be able to access. Like Mariela, Gustavo says he\u2019s trying to believe in the rules, trying to make his family proud. \u201cMost Hispanic parents \u2026 want something bigger. They always pushed me to go to college.\u201d Without the resources to pursue his college dream, afraid that his government would penalize or target his family if he applied for financial aid, frustrated and marginalized by his country\u2019s leadership, Gustavo needed another door to opportunity and the American Dream. So he\u2019s trying another way of proving to his birth country that he belongs, that he should have a shot: he\u2019s offering up his body. He\u2019s joining the military.

      "bodyText": "Awards season is upon us \u2013 first the Golden Globes and now Oscar nominations \u2013 and it has struck me just how odd it is that these Hollywood functions have come to be connected to #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up. Was there ever an industry so comically unsuited to driving an equality movement? Take the struggles of the Academy to catch up with the times, one year in. The day after it selected Bohemian Rhapsody as a nominee for best picture (reviews had been scathing, but it did after all feature Aids and a bisexual storyline), multiple allegations of sexual assault emerged against its director, Bryan Singer. Singer denied the accusations, but they had not come out of the blue: rumours of sexual misconduct had followed him for some years. Last month, no sooner had the Academy announced Kevin Hart as host \u2013 he would have been only the sixth African American in the job in some 91 years \u2013 reporters unearthed homophobic comments he had made on Twitter several years ago and he had to step down. Frozen by the not unlikely chance that its next candidate would turn out to be one of the \u201cless acceptable\u201d of the abusers and bigots who still dominate Hollywood, the Academy is now considering a \u201crange\u201d of hosts, presumably so as to spread the risk while appearing as inclusive as possible. It has nominated no female directors. It is easy to see why some are welcomed even as others are cast out: it is because they are leading players and part of the fabric of Hollywood. It is safe to condemn figures of lesser importance who have been accused of comparable behaviour. Pointing the finger at major producers worth hundreds of millions and with many influential friends could affect your career. The reason Hollywood cannot do activism is that it\u2019s an industry that reeks of fear. You can work in it only if you happen to appear likable to a few powerful people, each of whom, by the way, is connected to all the other powerful people and free to say anything they like to them about you. Before you make it, their approval is the only metric by which you can measure your worth, and even once you have, disapproval usually means you do not work again. Impressing these people is not just a matter of exuding general appeal, but also \u2013 as always happens when you indulge someone with too much power \u2013 a matter of making them specifically feel good about themselves. This is why the whole industry is so nauseatingly sycophantic and why at awards ceremonies actors will almost give themselves an aneurysm in their efforts to sufficiently grovel to their producers and directors. (Meryl Streep once called Harvey Weinstein \u201cGod\u201d.) And this it is why it simply cannot cope with a brave social movement, let alone lead one: it is just too cowardly. Stars can do activism only when it is safe, which is no kind of activism at all. They can do it when the movement is essentially over: when all the main power players are on board and everyone else is wearing a black dress or a Time\u2019s Up bracelet or making fierce (but crucially unspecific) speeches about making changes or women\u2019s voices being heard. But they cannot do it when it matters. During last year\u2019s black dress protest at the Golden Globes, Rose McGowan tweeted that \u201cnot one of those fancy people wearing black to honour our rapes would have lifted a finger\u201d had it not been for her and actress Asia Argento speaking out against Weinstein. In a now deleted tweet, she also accused Streep of hypocrisy for \u201chappily working\u201d for Weinstein when it suited her. Megan Fox, who publicly accused film-maker Michael Bay of sexism 10 years ago, was too badly burned by the reaction to join the movement now. \u201cI was ahead of my time so people weren\u2019t ready,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, I was rejected because of the qualities that are now being praised in other women coming forward.\u201d This was in 2009. Hollywood\u2019s idea of feminism is to idolise the champions of yesteryear \u2013 Ruth Bader Ginsburg or the suffragettes. It is less keen on today\u2019s heroes. No wonder so many women in Hollywood have such low expectations. Patricia Clarkson, who won for best supporting actress at this year\u2019s Globes, thanked her director for \u201cdemand[ing] everything of me except sex, which is exactly how it should be in our industry\u201d. But it is not surprising that Hollywood is a few steps behind the times. Like the advertising industry, the business of selling films to mass audiences demands catering to received ideas.

      "body": "<p>It looked like a burger from the cartoon <em>Scooby-Doo</em>: frilly green lettuce, neon-red slices of tomato, a yellow square of melted cheese, darkly caramelised onions, homemade ranch sauce and thick pieces of roasted portobello mushroom. The bun was as puffy as a pillow. The whole comforting edifice was so tall it needed to be held in place with a wooden skewer. There was so much savouriness going on in this burger \u2013 all of it good \u2013 that I hardly noticed the thick brown patty at the centre.</p> <p>I was having dinner with my family at a hip new <a href=\"https://www.dopplegangerburger.co.uk/\" title=\"\">burger place in Cambridge called DoppleGanger</a>. You order your food on touch screens as if you were at McDonald\u2019s. From the thin fries to the craft beers and homemade ketchup, you could be in a cool West Coast burger shack. The difference is that everything at DoppleGanger \u2013 from the hoisin \u201cduck\u201d strewn over a plate of fries to the rashers of \u201cbacon\u201d \u2013 is vegan. Taking the first juicy bite of burger, my nose and mouth were telling me \u201cbeef\u201d, even though I knew that I was eating textured soy protein.</p> <p>As a meat eater, I have never been especially interested in fake vegetarian burgers. When I am trying to eat less meat (which is often) I\u2019d rather have a grilled flat mushroom in a bun, which is delicious in its own right, than some weird slab of fakery. But this burger at DoppleGanger made me think again. If my senses could be fooled into thinking that I was eating a meat burger \u2013 and a very delicious one at that \u2013 then why should I ever need to eat a \u201creal\u201d burger again?</p> <p>Alfy Fowler, the chef and owner of DoppleGanger, is a 28-year-old former art designer who sees vegan burgers as one way to rethink our relationship with food. And he is not alone. His is one of a new wave of eateries not only marketing themselves as vegan but doing so via \u201cfake meat\u201d offerings. These are part of a wider, rapidly growing fake-meat sector, driven by a population that is increasingly turning to veganism for both health reasons and ethical ones.</p> <p>The takeaway service Just Eat reported that demand for vegetarian options among its customers grew by 987% in 2017. When Greggs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/greggs-launches-vegan-sausage-roll\" title=\"\">launched its mass-market vegan sausage roll</a> \u2013 containing a \u201cbespoke\u201d Quorn filling \u2013 at the start of January (or Veganuary), it created such a stir that for a few days there seemed to be something that people on social media cared about more than Brexit. The Greggs vegan roll achieved the distinction of being spat out by Piers Morgan on breakfast TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76836529b3197eb1646007bfe5cf32cf78a17cc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76836529b3197eb1646007bfe5cf32cf78a17cc5/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Morgan tries a vegan sausage roll on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piers Morgan tries a vegan sausage roll on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walk into the average supermarket and you will now see a bizarre array of processed vegan products that never used to be there \u2013 from pasties to imitation \u201cchorizo\u201d sausages. Quorn \u2013 a fake meat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/veggie-sausage-food-france-ban\" title=\"\">made from mycoprotein</a> \u2013 has been sold in Britain since 1985, but only in the past few years has it started to be sold in such a gallimaufry of versions, from vegetarian \u201cham\u201d to nuggets, from fake turkey and stuffing to steak and gravy pies.</p> <p>In the chilled vegetarian aisle there are now plant-based \u201cmeatballs\u201d, \u201cburgers\u201d and \u201cgoujons\u201d. You could wear your hands out making all the air quotes required to cover these vegan \u201cmeats\u201d. Quorn has also replaced the meat versions of nuggets and hot dogs on many school dinner menus.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the concept of imitation meat is anything new. For as long as there have been vegetarians \u2013 or people too poor to buy meat \u2013 there have been mock meats of one kind or another. For centuries in Russia cooks have made an aubergine puree that goes by the name of \u201ccaviar\u201d. Or consider the Welsh Glamorgan sausage made from cheese, leeks and bread crumbs, which became popular during the second world war when meat was rationed.</p> <p>The difference with the new fake meats is that, thanks to developments in food technology, many of them have become uncannily realistic in both texture and appearance. All the major supermarkets are now pushing increasingly plausible meat-free versions of animal proteins, from \u201cflaky\u2019\u201d fish to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/19/fake-steak-supermarkets-flexitarians-meat-free-burgers\" title=\"\">burgers oozing with beetroot juice</a>. </p> <p>Advocates of the new fake meats such as the Beyond Burger \u2013 and its main rival in the US, the Impossible Burger \u2013 claim they are a boon for the environment and for human health. One of the founders of Impossible Foods, Dr Patrick Brown, has said that his vision is to eliminate the inefficient and cruel demand for animals as food. \u201cWe now know how to make meat better \u2013 by making it directly from plants,\u201d Brown has said. Indeed, for some consumers, these fake meats are what they have long been craving \u2013 a sustainable answer to our meat-obsessed food culture that simultaneously offers different flavours and textures other than lentils and vegetables.</p> <p>The existence of realistic fake meat products raises interesting questions about what meat really is. When we say we love meat are we really talking about a set of nutrients? A certain flavour or texture? Or a set of cultural memories of shared meals such as Christmas turkey and Easter lamb? A culture that is much more advanced along the fake meat route is China, where for centuries Buddhist cooks have made ingenious \u201croast goose\u201d and \u201cduck\u201d and even \u201cintestines\u201d from layers of wheat gluten and tofu. Chinese food expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fuchsia-dunlop\" title=\"\">Fuchsia Dunlop</a> tells me that the \u201cbleeding\u2019 burgers\u201d of modern-day Britain \u201chave the same purpose as Chinese Buddhist imitation meats\u201d, of enabling people to eat vegan food without making dramatic changes to their eating habits. The difference, she notes, is that traditional Chinese fake meats tend to be made from tofu, mushrooms and other ordinary ingredients, whereas some of the new fake meats of the west \u201care manufactured with possibly unhealthy additives\u201d. And this is where the huge and ever-growing enthusiasm for fake meat becomes somewhat tricky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf06606502dbc028a960b21d19bc774383f2d4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbf06606502dbc028a960b21d19bc774383f2d4a/0_57_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cCrunch\u201d vegan burger from Doppleganger Burger restaurant in Cambridge, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vegan burgers, like DoppelGanger\u2019s <em>Crunch</em>, can be indistinguishable from their meat counterparts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concern for our health is one of the main reasons we are now buying vegetarian sausages and burgers in such quantities, according to survey data. The catch is that there is not necessarily anything particularly healthy about a vegan hotdog. Many see them as just another set of overly processed industrial foods in a world that is already awash with what food writer Michael Pollan calls \u201cfood-like substances\u201d.</p> <p>Jenny Rosborough is a registered nutritionist who worries that vegan \u201cmeats\u201d are perceived as automatically being healthier. Rosborough points out that meat-free burgers contain on average even more salt than meat burgers: 0.89g per serving as against 0.75g. Rosborough also notes that when switching to these products you also need to consider what nutrients might then be missing from your diet, such as iron and B vitamins.</p> <p>\u201cA vegan hotdog is probably no better for you than a meat one,\u201d says Renee McGregor, a registered dietitian who works with athletes and is the author of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/training-food-9781848992665.html\" title=\"\">Training Food</a></em>. As a vegetarian, McGregor sometimes uses tofu sausages but feels they do not deserve the \u201chealth halo effect\u201d they sometimes get, just on account of being vegan. \u201cThe key thing is that any food that has been highly processed should be eaten mindfully \u2013 so not necessarily avoided completely, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend a vegan sausage weekly due to the high salt content and most likely list of additives and preservatives,\u201d says McGregor.</p> <p>I started to question the healthiness of some of the new generation of vegan burgers after I ate a Beyond Burger, as served at the Honest Burger chain. While eating the burger \u2013 which came with guacamole and \u201cpulled\u201d barbecued jackfruit \u2013 I was stunned by how close it felt to meat in my mouth, with its rosy pink hue and fragile flesh-like texture. But it felt nothing like meat to my digestive system.</p> <p>Half an hour after lunch, I started to have griping stomach pains and a horrible junk-food aftertaste. When I looked up the ingredients, it occurred to me that had they not been marketed as quasi-meat I would never have chosen to lunch on \u201cpea protein isolate, expeller-pressed canola oil, refined coconut oil, water, yeast extract, maltodextrin, natural flavours, gum Arabic \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Clearly not everyone reacts to the Beyond Burger this way. Plenty of vegans will have enjoyed it without any ill-effects. But I can\u2019t help feeling that the novelty of these products means that their effects on human digestion are relatively untested. Quorn products warn you on the packet that the mycoprotein \u201cmay cause intolerance\u201d in some people.</p> <p>So can we actually say whether these fake meat products are healthier than meat?</p> <p>I consult Dr Fumiaki Imamura, an epidemiologist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge. He notes that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d from large-scale studies that specifically looks at such products. He directed me to a Harvard study from 2016 which suggested that people who ate more plant protein and less animal protein had lower overall risk of death, but the plant protein in the study was mostly beans, pulses and nuts rather than Quorn \u201cbacon\u201d strips.</p> <p>Then again, maybe the consumers of fake meats do not expect them to be particularly healthy, any more than I am prioritising health on those hurried nights when I sling fish fingers in the oven for my children. My sister, who lives in the US, is a big fan of frozen vegan nuggets of various kinds, but for her they are mostly about convenience (and animal rights).</p> <p>She is one of the busiest people I know and has three kids, two of whom are vegetarian, as is she. If health were her only consideration, she would make wholesome dinners of lentil dal or vegetable chilli. But her younger girls won\u2019t eat most cooked vegetables and she would find it exhausting to cook different meals to suit their different preferences every night alongside homework. \u201cSo I give them raw veg with whatever quick thing, and that\u2019s often vegan hotdog.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d1390be640103fb617f0d0f6a821202b36eda23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d1390be640103fb617f0d0f6a821202b36eda23/191_100_1537_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fry\u2019s vegan artisan smoked hotdog.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fry\u2019s vegan artisan smoked hotdog. What is real?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Deary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe the most pressing question raised by vegan fake meats is not why they aren\u2019t better or healthier, but why the meat that they are choosing to ape is itself so highly processed and poor in quality.</p> <p>Faced with the choice between a \u201cregular\u201d frankfurter and a vegan one, can we really say which one is \u201creal\u201d and which is not? Herta, the leading brand of pork frankfurters boasts that it is 74.5% pork. The rest of it includes wheat fibre, pea protein and dextrose \u2013 the same kind of industrial ingredients you would find in many fake meat products.</p> <p>Back at DoppleGanger, Alfy Fowler tells me that he feels that the soy patties he serves are more authentic in their way than most of what is consumed as \u201cmeat\u201d in modern Britain. In one of the bars where Fowler used to cook, they served a bar snack of \u201cchicken goujons\u201d. He could see on the packet that these goujons were only 50% chicken with the rest made up of wheat gluten and various additives, yet the customers who bought them believed they were eating meat. \u201cMeat has become so cheap that it isn\u2019t really meat any more,\u201d Fowler observes.</p> <p>Defenders of meat will say \u2013 with good reason \u2013 that an unprocessed home-cooked grass-fed leg of lamb is a far more \u201cnatural\u201d and nourishing thing than a Quorn burger. But the question is what to do if you lack the cash for grass-fed lamb.</p> <p>In the developed countries of the world, including Britain, about half of all meat consumed is now made up of processed meat products, from pork pies to kebabs, because this is the kind of meat the average person can afford.

      "bodyText": "It looked like a burger from the cartoon Scooby-Doo: frilly green lettuce, neon-red slices of tomato, a yellow square of melted cheese, darkly caramelised onions, homemade ranch sauce and thick pieces of roasted portobello mushroom. The bun was as puffy as a pillow. The whole comforting edifice was so tall it needed to be held in place with a wooden skewer. There was so much savouriness going on in this burger \u2013 all of it good \u2013 that I hardly noticed the thick brown patty at the centre. I was having dinner with my family at a hip new burger place in Cambridge called DoppleGanger. You order your food on touch screens as if you were at McDonald\u2019s. From the thin fries to the craft beers and homemade ketchup, you could be in a cool West Coast burger shack. The difference is that everything at DoppleGanger \u2013 from the hoisin \u201cduck\u201d strewn over a plate of fries to the rashers of \u201cbacon\u201d \u2013 is vegan. Taking the first juicy bite of burger, my nose and mouth were telling me \u201cbeef\u201d, even though I knew that I was eating textured soy protein. As a meat eater, I have never been especially interested in fake vegetarian burgers. When I am trying to eat less meat (which is often) I\u2019d rather have a grilled flat mushroom in a bun, which is delicious in its own right, than some weird slab of fakery. But this burger at DoppleGanger made me think again. If my senses could be fooled into thinking that I was eating a meat burger \u2013 and a very delicious one at that \u2013 then why should I ever need to eat a \u201creal\u201d burger again? Alfy Fowler, the chef and owner of DoppleGanger, is a 28-year-old former art designer who sees vegan burgers as one way to rethink our relationship with food. And he is not alone. His is one of a new wave of eateries not only marketing themselves as vegan but doing so via \u201cfake meat\u201d offerings. These are part of a wider, rapidly growing fake-meat sector, driven by a population that is increasingly turning to veganism for both health reasons and ethical ones. The takeaway service Just Eat reported that demand for vegetarian options among its customers grew by 987% in 2017. When Greggs launched its mass-market vegan sausage roll \u2013 containing a \u201cbespoke\u201d Quorn filling \u2013 at the start of January (or Veganuary), it created such a stir that for a few days there seemed to be something that people on social media cared about more than Brexit. The Greggs vegan roll achieved the distinction of being spat out by Piers Morgan on breakfast TV. Walk into the average supermarket and you will now see a bizarre array of processed vegan products that never used to be there \u2013 from pasties to imitation \u201cchorizo\u201d sausages. Quorn \u2013 a fake meat made from mycoprotein \u2013 has been sold in Britain since 1985, but only in the past few years has it started to be sold in such a gallimaufry of versions, from vegetarian \u201cham\u201d to nuggets, from fake turkey and stuffing to steak and gravy pies. In the chilled vegetarian aisle there are now plant-based \u201cmeatballs\u201d, \u201cburgers\u201d and \u201cgoujons\u201d. You could wear your hands out making all the air quotes required to cover these vegan \u201cmeats\u201d. Quorn has also replaced the meat versions of nuggets and hot dogs on many school dinner menus. It\u2019s not that the concept of imitation meat is anything new. For as long as there have been vegetarians \u2013 or people too poor to buy meat \u2013 there have been mock meats of one kind or another. For centuries in Russia cooks have made an aubergine puree that goes by the name of \u201ccaviar\u201d. Or consider the Welsh Glamorgan sausage made from cheese, leeks and bread crumbs, which became popular during the second world war when meat was rationed. The difference with the new fake meats is that, thanks to developments in food technology, many of them have become uncannily realistic in both texture and appearance. All the major supermarkets are now pushing increasingly plausible meat-free versions of animal proteins, from \u201cflaky\u2019\u201d fish to burgers oozing with beetroot juice. Advocates of the new fake meats such as the Beyond Burger \u2013 and its main rival in the US, the Impossible Burger \u2013 claim they are a boon for the environment and for human health. One of the founders of Impossible Foods, Dr Patrick Brown, has said that his vision is to eliminate the inefficient and cruel demand for animals as food. \u201cWe now know how to make meat better \u2013 by making it directly from plants,\u201d Brown has said. Indeed, for some consumers, these fake meats are what they have long been craving \u2013 a sustainable answer to our meat-obsessed food culture that simultaneously offers different flavours and textures other than lentils and vegetables. The existence of realistic fake meat products raises interesting questions about what meat really is. When we say we love meat are we really talking about a set of nutrients? A certain flavour or texture? Or a set of cultural memories of shared meals such as Christmas turkey and Easter lamb? A culture that is much more advanced along the fake meat route is China, where for centuries Buddhist cooks have made ingenious \u201croast goose\u201d and \u201cduck\u201d and even \u201cintestines\u201d from layers of wheat gluten and tofu. Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop tells me that the \u201cbleeding\u2019 burgers\u201d of modern-day Britain \u201chave the same purpose as Chinese Buddhist imitation meats\u201d, of enabling people to eat vegan food without making dramatic changes to their eating habits. The difference, she notes, is that traditional Chinese fake meats tend to be made from tofu, mushrooms and other ordinary ingredients, whereas some of the new fake meats of the west \u201care manufactured with possibly unhealthy additives\u201d. And this is where the huge and ever-growing enthusiasm for fake meat becomes somewhat tricky. Concern for our health is one of the main reasons we are now buying vegetarian sausages and burgers in such quantities, according to survey data. The catch is that there is not necessarily anything particularly healthy about a vegan hotdog. Many see them as just another set of overly processed industrial foods in a world that is already awash with what food writer Michael Pollan calls \u201cfood-like substances\u201d. Jenny Rosborough is a registered nutritionist who worries that vegan \u201cmeats\u201d are perceived as automatically being healthier. Rosborough points out that meat-free burgers contain on average even more salt than meat burgers: 0.89g per serving as against 0.75g. Rosborough also notes that when switching to these products you also need to consider what nutrients might then be missing from your diet, such as iron and B vitamins. \u201cA vegan hotdog is probably no better for you than a meat one,\u201d says Renee McGregor, a registered dietitian who works with athletes and is the author of Training Food. As a vegetarian, McGregor sometimes uses tofu sausages but feels they do not deserve the \u201chealth halo effect\u201d they sometimes get, just on account of being vegan. \u201cThe key thing is that any food that has been highly processed should be eaten mindfully \u2013 so not necessarily avoided completely, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend a vegan sausage weekly due to the high salt content and most likely list of additives and preservatives,\u201d says McGregor. I started to question the healthiness of some of the new generation of vegan burgers after I ate a Beyond Burger, as served at the Honest Burger chain. While eating the burger \u2013 which came with guacamole and \u201cpulled\u201d barbecued jackfruit \u2013 I was stunned by how close it felt to meat in my mouth, with its rosy pink hue and fragile flesh-like texture. But it felt nothing like meat to my digestive system. Half an hour after lunch, I started to have griping stomach pains and a horrible junk-food aftertaste. When I looked up the ingredients, it occurred to me that had they not been marketed as quasi-meat I would never have chosen to lunch on \u201cpea protein isolate, expeller-pressed canola oil, refined coconut oil, water, yeast extract, maltodextrin, natural flavours, gum Arabic \u2026\u201d Clearly not everyone reacts to the Beyond Burger this way. Plenty of vegans will have enjoyed it without any ill-effects. But I can\u2019t help feeling that the novelty of these products means that their effects on human digestion are relatively untested. Quorn products warn you on the packet that the mycoprotein \u201cmay cause intolerance\u201d in some people. So can we actually say whether these fake meat products are healthier than meat? I consult Dr Fumiaki Imamura, an epidemiologist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge. He notes that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d from large-scale studies that specifically looks at such products. He directed me to a Harvard study from 2016 which suggested that people who ate more plant protein and less animal protein had lower overall risk of death, but the plant protein in the study was mostly beans, pulses and nuts rather than Quorn \u201cbacon\u201d strips. Then again, maybe the consumers of fake meats do not expect them to be particularly healthy, any more than I am prioritising health on those hurried nights when I sling fish fingers in the oven for my children. My sister, who lives in the US, is a big fan of frozen vegan nuggets of various kinds, but for her they are mostly about convenience (and animal rights). She is one of the busiest people I know and has three kids, two of whom are vegetarian, as is she. If health were her only consideration, she would make wholesome dinners of lentil dal or vegetable chilli. But her younger girls won\u2019t eat most cooked vegetables and she would find it exhausting to cook different meals to suit their different preferences every night alongside homework. \u201cSo I give them raw veg with whatever quick thing, and that\u2019s often vegan hotdog.\u201d Maybe the most pressing question raised by vegan fake meats is not why they aren\u2019t better or healthier, but why the meat that they are choosing to ape is itself so highly processed and poor in quality. Faced with the choice between a \u201cregular\u201d frankfurter and a vegan one, can we really say which one is \u201creal\u201d and which is not? Herta, the leading brand of pork frankfurters boasts that it is 74.5% pork. The rest of it includes wheat fibre, pea protein and dextrose \u2013 the same kind of industrial ingredients you would find in many fake meat products. Back at DoppleGanger, Alfy Fowler tells me that he feels that the soy patties he serves are more authentic in their way than most of what is consumed as \u201cmeat\u201d in modern Britain. In one of the bars where Fowler used to cook, they served a bar snack of \u201cchicken goujons\u201d. He could see on the packet that these goujons were only 50% chicken with the rest made up of wheat gluten and various additives, yet the customers who bought them believed they were eating meat. \u201cMeat has become so cheap that it isn\u2019t really meat any more,\u201d Fowler observes. Defenders of meat will say \u2013 with good reason \u2013 that an unprocessed home-cooked grass-fed leg of lamb is a far more \u201cnatural\u201d and nourishing thing than a Quorn burger. But the question is what to do if you lack the cash for grass-fed lamb. In the developed countries of the world, including Britain, about half of all meat consumed is now made up of processed meat products, from pork pies to kebabs, because this is the kind of meat the average person can afford. If your idea of \u201cmeat\u201d is a nugget, I increasingly agree with my sister that it might as well be a vegetarian one. The bigger question is why we remain so hung up on this thing \u2013 \u201cmeat\u201d as the yardstick for our meals. Given that most meat is so highly processed and cruelly produced, why do we still prize its flavours and textures? The rise of fake meat is not yet a true food revolution because it leaves our preferences untouched. The real change to our food culture will come the day that someone designs a steak that tastes like a carrot.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s impossible to overstate the sense of shock that swept across Scotland when it was revealed what charges Alex Salmond is facing after his appearance on petition at Edinburgh sheriff court last Thursday. Scotland\u2019s former first minister has been charged with two counts of attempted rape and multiple counts of sexual assault. He immediately said that he was \u201cinnocent of any criminality whatsoever\u201d and would defend himself in court \u201cto the utmost\u201d. In Holyrood a little while later, Nicola Sturgeon cut a weary figure as she talked about how shocked \u201cmany people\u201d would be at this news.</p> <p>Scotland is weeks away from being dragged out of the European Union against its overwhelmingly settled will, while even the most fervently rightwing publications have stopped pretending that all will be well across the nation following a possible no-deal Brexit. And yet this most profoundly damaging event will be submerged in terms of importance by the long list of very serious charges that Salmond must face. It\u2019s highly unlikely that this case will be heard in court before another 12 months have elapsed.</p> <p>Already, some predictable voices have begun to assess what \u201cdamage\u201d the Salmond case will inflict on the SNP and the wider independence movement. Some of these will require to exercise a degree more caution in discussing this in public forums than has been apparent until now. To talk about \u201cscandals\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d in the case of an individual who remains innocent until proved guilty risks prejudicing the integrity of future proceedings.</p> <p>Drawing parallels with events in history that bear some of the imprints of this case is not a wise course to follow either. The time to assess how much this case has affected the movement that Salmond once led will come at the end of the case.</p> <p>Very little of the way that this case has been reported so far has spared the feelings of the women who have made these allegations. Much has been said about creating a safe space for people in all walks of life to come forward and seek to have their concerns about possible misconduct heard. The way this case unfolds and how it is reported will have a profound bearing on the willingness of many women to place their trust in the process. Thus far, the mental welfare of those at the centre of the media frenzy has not been a consideration.</p> <p>What can be permitted is some analysis of how much the due processes of the law in this case will affect any timetable for a second referendum on Scottish independence. It now seems unthinkable that Sturgeon will make any moves towards a referendum in the near future and certainly not before the case arrives in court. Effectively, the question of a second referendum is off the table until the autumn of 2020 at the earliest. This will play to Sturgeon\u2019s political instincts. She had been coming under increasing pressure from some in her own party to signal an early referendum as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit begins to form.</p> <p>The absence of anything remotely approaching good leadership by either Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit had once more cast Sturgeon\u2019s adroit interventions from a Scottish perspective in a favourable light. The trickle of UK companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/22/no-deal-brexit-panic-grips-major-uk-firms\" title=\"\">seeking to relocate </a>elsewhere now resembles a wave and each week seems to reveal the perfidy of another hard Brexiter in accepting cash payments and plum directorships from interested firms. Last week, just days after May had promised an enhanced role for the devolved governments in Brexit negotiations, yet another meeting of the joint ministerial committee was cancelled.</p> <p>This all seemed to be providing a favourable wind for those in the SNP who advocate an early referendum. The developments in the Salmond case render any such thoughts redundant. Moreover, the sheer number and scope of the charges he faces make it likely that several key personnel involved in the SNP\u2019s rise to the pinnacle of Scottish politics may consider that they have more pressing issues to contend with in the coming months.</p> <p>Since the news of the impending police investigation into allegations of misconduct was broken last August, some have sought to make political capital by claiming that the SNP is grievously split between Salmond supporters and Sturgeon supporters. In the light of the charge sheet that followed Salmond\u2019s arrest, such talk has become facile and not a little callous. There has never been any evidence of a split along these lines among the ordinary members of the party, the overwhelming majority of whom hold each in high esteem.</p> <p>Following publication of the charges against Salmond, there was barely disguised glee being expressed across social media, including by some experienced observers who ought to know better. Again, little of this was expressed with any thought to the feelings of those making the accusations, who are also facing the distressing prospect of a trial.</p> <p>Senior SNP figures who have professed surprise at the seriousness of the charges facing Salmond may now be discussing historic timelines and consulting old diaries. As they do so, they should be advised to keep a lid on the scarecrow wing of the party, who, even now, are loudly proclaiming a Westminster stitch-up of their former leader and MI5 plots. Such sentiments are delusional and risk undermining the credibility of the independence case.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist</p>",

In Holyrood a little while later, Nicola Sturgeon cut a weary figure as she talked about how shocked \u201cmany people\u201d would be at this news. Scotland is weeks away from being dragged out of the European Union against its overwhelmingly settled will, while even the most fervently rightwing publications have stopped pretending that all will be well across the nation following a possible no-deal Brexit. And yet this most profoundly damaging event will be submerged in terms of importance by the long list of very serious charges that Salmond must face. It\u2019s highly unlikely that this case will be heard in court before another 12 months have elapsed. Already, some predictable voices have begun to assess what \u201cdamage\u201d the Salmond case will inflict on the SNP and the wider independence movement. Some of these will require to exercise a degree more caution in discussing this in public forums than has been apparent until now. To talk about \u201cscandals\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d in the case of an individual who remains innocent until proved guilty risks prejudicing the integrity of future proceedings. Drawing parallels with events in history that bear some of the imprints of this case is not a wise course to follow either. The time to assess how much this case has affected the movement that Salmond once led will come at the end of the case. Very little of the way that this case has been reported so far has spared the feelings of the women who have made these allegations. Much has been said about creating a safe space for people in all walks of life to come forward and seek to have their concerns about possible misconduct heard. The way this case unfolds and how it is reported will have a profound bearing on the willingness of many women to place their trust in the process. Thus far, the mental welfare of those at the centre of the media frenzy has not been a consideration. What can be permitted is some analysis of how much the due processes of the law in this case will affect any timetable for a second referendum on Scottish independence. It now seems unthinkable that Sturgeon will make any moves towards a referendum in the near future and certainly not before the case arrives in court. Effectively, the question of a second referendum is off the table until the autumn of 2020 at the earliest. This will play to Sturgeon\u2019s political instincts. She had been coming under increasing pressure from some in her own party to signal an early referendum as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit begins to form. The absence of anything remotely approaching good leadership by either Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit had once more cast Sturgeon\u2019s adroit interventions from a Scottish perspective in a favourable light. The trickle of UK companies seeking to relocate elsewhere now resembles a wave and each week seems to reveal the perfidy of another hard Brexiter in accepting cash payments and plum directorships from interested firms. Last week, just days after May had promised an enhanced role for the devolved governments in Brexit negotiations, yet another meeting of the joint ministerial committee was cancelled. This all seemed to be providing a favourable wind for those in the SNP who advocate an early referendum. The developments in the Salmond case render any such thoughts redundant. Moreover, the sheer number and scope of the charges he faces make it likely that several key personnel involved in the SNP\u2019s rise to the pinnacle of Scottish politics may consider that they have more pressing issues to contend with in the coming months. Since the news of the impending police investigation into allegations of misconduct was broken last August, some have sought to make political capital by claiming that the SNP is grievously split between Salmond supporters and Sturgeon supporters. In the light of the charge sheet that followed Salmond\u2019s arrest, such talk has become facile and not a little callous. There has never been any evidence of a split along these lines among the ordinary members of the party, the overwhelming majority of whom hold each in high esteem. Following publication of the charges against Salmond, there was barely disguised glee being expressed across social media, including by some experienced observers who ought to know better. Again, little of this was expressed with any thought to the feelings of those making the accusations, who are also facing the distressing prospect of a trial. Senior SNP figures who have professed surprise at the seriousness of the charges facing Salmond may now be discussing historic timelines and consulting old diaries. As they do so, they should be advised to keep a lid on the scarecrow wing of the party, who, even now, are loudly proclaiming a Westminster stitch-up of their former leader and MI5 plots. Such sentiments are delusional and risk undermining the credibility of the independence case. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "If enthusiasm and grassroots support are the keys to a successful political campaign, Zali Steggall got off to a flying start in her quest to wrest Warringah from former prime minister Tony Abbott and the Liberal party. More than 400 supporters wearing striking turquoise \u201cVote 1 Zali Steggall\u201d T-shirts assembled under a Moreton Bay fig in a park in Balgowlah on Sunday morning as the athlete-turned-barrister launched her campaign as an independent. \u201cZali, Zali,\u201d they chanted as kids and dogs milled around the large media pack. The former alpine skiing Olympian is taking on one of Australia\u2019s toughest politicians who has held the seat of Warringah for 25 years, something she acknowledged in her launch speech. But Steggall is also Abbott\u2019s worst fear: a photogenic woman with a strong public profile and deep roots in the electorate \u2013 she was born and grew up in Manly, went to school at Queenwood in Mosman (she now serves on its board) and lives in Balgowlah in the heart of the electorate. As one attendee put it: \u201cYou needed to have been wheeled in a pram down the Corso to qualify as local \u2013 and she was.\u201d Steggall\u2019s father was a solicitor in Manly for 30 years and a member of the Manly rugby club \u2013 a bastion of Liberal party support. And as Steggall quipped: she drives the bridge (that\u2019s the Spit bridge for non-locals) and knows the traffic problems facing her electorate. With a high profile already established, Steggall\u2019s task now is to define what she stands for and to differentiate herself from Abbott without breaking her own promise of a respectful campaign and new-style politics. \u201cI certainly never started a race at the Olympics thinking I had a sure thing won. [Abbott is] a wily and seasoned politician. He\u2019s been there for many years,\u201d she said. Is Abbott an embarrassment? \u201cAsk the voters,\u201d Steggall said, as the crowd erupted into shouts of \u201cyes\u201d. Rather, Steggall pointed out that many constituents see Abbott as out of step with their concerns. Climate change policy provides the starkest contrast, and is a potent issue with progressives in this northern beaches and harbourside electorate. Steggall said it would be a focus of her campaign. She has enlisted well-known climate change campaigner Tim Flannery as a policy adviser, and he was by her side at Sunday morning\u2019s launch. \u201cWe do not want to be remembered as the generation who had all the facts but failed to act. Climate change is not a political football,\u201d she said. \u201cWarringah has for too long had someone who is set in his ways, unwilling and unable to change. He does not represent who we are and what we stand for.\u201d Steggall also promised to tackle mental health issues, and expressed support for Kerryn Phelps\u2019s campaign to bring children to Australia from Nauru and for the humane treatment of refugees. Phelps is already acting as a sounding board, but the other worry for Abbott is the Manly end of his electorate, which has dallied with independents in the past by electing David Barr and Peter McDonald to state parliament. There are still shoals to be negotiated. In this wealthy electorate, Steggall was quick to rule out supporting Labor\u2019s changes to negative gearing or its plans to stop people being able to claim back franking credits in excess of the tax paid by companies. Steggall said she would support stability in the superannuation system and would not back changes where people have put in place investment strategies. But further announcements from Liberal and Labor during the election campaign, including possible tax cuts, will call into question where she stands on economic issues. Steggall said she will support tax cuts for small and medium businesses, and appeared to rule out a carbon tax, saying the debate had \u201cmoved on\u201d . There will be constant attempts to either paint Steggall as a Labor plant or a tool of the Liberal moderate faction, which in New South Wales is locked in a vicious war for control of the heart and soul of the party. Her campaign has signed on Anthony Reed, the former chief of staff to former NSW Labor politician Phil Costa, and she is already being asked about who is funding it. The former Liberal moderate convener Michael Photios and other former Liberal party members were sighted at anti-Abbott and climate change events in the electorate almost a year ago. Alex Turnbull, the son of Abbott\u2019s bitter rival, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, has also offered support for the Vote Tony Out campaign. Steggall said she hoped to attract the support of moderate Liberals \u2013 but it was clear she was talking voters, not apparatchiks. \u201cWe have a website \u2013 zalisteggall.com.au; there is a donate button, please click on it,\u201d she said. So far Steggall\u2019s campaign has been powered by local groups with a uniting goal of just getting rid of Abbott. Now they have a candidate, the campaign could get more willing. Abbott responded to the day\u2019s events on Twitter, going hyper-local: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep pushing for the northern beaches tunnel to beat the traffic jams and for a safe and prosperous Australia as part of a good government,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday. Later in the day, asked about Steggall\u2019s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would \u201cnot get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate\u201d, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t make a scrap of difference,\u201d he said.",

At a doorstop in Sydney on Sunday, Abbott said the Australia Day weekend was \u201cnot a time for heavy politics\u201d but made his case for re-election based on policies including lowering power prices and his \u201c120% support\u201d for the northern beaches tunnel. \u201cApart from that, we\u2019ve just got to have the best possible government in Canberra and the best possible government is a Liberal government that keeps our country safe and our economy strong,\u201d he said. Asked about Steggall\u2019s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would \u201cnot get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate\u201d, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWe could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn\u2019t make a scrap of difference,\u201d he said. The education minister Dan Tehan, appearing on Sky News on Sunday, said Abbott would put a strong case forward for his re-election. \u201cPeople underestimate what Tony does within the community, for the community, they underestimate his ability to campaign,\u201d Tehan told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cThere was talk before the last election that Tony might have been in trouble in Warringah, he was re-endorsed by the voters there quite strongly.\u201d Tehan later told reports in Melbourne that Abbott has a \u201cvery good record to stand on\u201d and will put a compelling case to voters because he has \u201cmore to offer in politics\u201d. Two other women \u2013 Indigenous Australian Susan Moylan-Coombs and Alice Thompson, a former employee of Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 have also said they would run as independents in Warringah. However, Steggall is likely to have the backing of several grassroots groups that have been running a campaign against the former prime minister, including selling anti-Abbott T-shirts and posters. The groups have been liaising with GetUp, which has vowed to work to remove Abbott and other climate change deniers from their seats at the forthcoming election, likely to be held in May. Abbott has vowed to take on GetUp and the groups seeking to oust him, and has begun a social media campaign using the title of his first book, Battlelines. An email from Vote Tony Out endorsing Steggall as the independent candidate for Warringah in the next federal election said: \u201cMore and more details will come out about Zali in the next couple of days but I can tell you she is an amazing woman who will make Warringah proud. She has been through quite a process to get to this point.\u201d Warringah has voted conservative since 1922 and Abbott, who first won the seat 25 years ago, holds it with a margin of about 15%.

Animated images, rendered in smoky black charcoal, are projected on to the stage. The live singers seem at one with them, stepping out of the sketches, only to sink back in, sometimes disappearing entirely into the landscape.</p> <p>In a production that highlights the cruel banality of war, there is nothing restful in this bombardment of images. There are destroyed streets, spread-eagle corpses, eerie faces and surreal live footage (one shows a black woman twirling on and off a white man\u2019s lap) all cast over a busy set of wooden steps, stairways and scattered furniture.</p> <p>As Kentridge put it in a director\u2019s note, which, tellingly, focuses almost entirely on how the opera looks, \u201cI made drawings of landscapes, of blasted buildings, of severed heads, of wounded bodies, of night skies.\u201d</p> <p>Kentridge attended theatre school in Paris for a year as a young man and had dreams of becoming an actor or film-maker. Over the last decade he has experimented with ever-bigger stage productions, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63nfCe6RZ-g\">Dmitri Shostakovich\u2019s absurdist tale The Nose (2010)</a> followed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/31/william-kentridge-lulu-opera-metropolitan\">2015 by Berg\u2019s Lulu</a>, with both premiering at the Metropolitan in New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070dc6a97241440c832c55d0a2f3833c4634f6da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070dc6a97241440c832c55d0a2f3833c4634f6da/0_0_4972_3907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opera Australia's production of Wozzeck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To watch Wozzeck is to gorge on visuals in a way I have never done before.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Saunders</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They were met with critical acclaim and Wozzeck, too, is in many ways startlingly original: to watch it is to gorge on visuals in a way I have never done before. Mirroring Berg\u2019s atonal score (which has none of the melody or anthems of more popular operas), Kentridge provides us with an apocalyptic vision.</p> <p>Navigating this is a confident cast: Australian-born Michael Honeyman, playing the red-haired Wozzeck, seems to crouch and hunch ever further into his body as he descends into violent hallucinations. Lorina Gore shows his love interest Marie as a flawed woman, hungry for male attention while simultaneously scolding herself for her lax chastity. Then there\u2019s the creepy Doctor, Richard Anderson, whose amoral experiments on Wozzeck seem to feature as a premonition of Nazi medical trials on Jewish prisoners.</p> <p>But while Kentridge\u2019s own inventiveness and power of imagination imbues every pore of the opera, there is a cost.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI suppose I did what all children do: I drew,\u201d the South African artist William Kentridge once said. \u201cAll children draw. And I simply forgot to stop.\u201d That delight \u2013 in the power of draughtsmanship, in the sheer energy of putting pen to paper and allowing it to dance \u2013 is in full force in Wozzeck, the opera directed by Kentridge which premiered at Salzberg festival last year and is now showing at the Sydney Opera House. Alban Berg\u2019s score and libretto, completed in 1922 and based on a play by Georg B\u00fcchner, follows the troubled, downtrodden anti-hero Wozzeck. In a tragedy, he descends into madness, eventually ending his own life, and the woman he loves. This version, however, is more art installation than traditional opera. Animated images, rendered in smoky black charcoal, are projected on to the stage. The live singers seem at one with them, stepping out of the sketches, only to sink back in, sometimes disappearing entirely into the landscape. In a production that highlights the cruel banality of war, there is nothing restful in this bombardment of images. There are destroyed streets, spread-eagle corpses, eerie faces and surreal live footage (one shows a black woman twirling on and off a white man\u2019s lap) all cast over a busy set of wooden steps, stairways and scattered furniture. As Kentridge put it in a director\u2019s note, which, tellingly, focuses almost entirely on how the opera looks, \u201cI made drawings of landscapes, of blasted buildings, of severed heads, of wounded bodies, of night skies.\u201d Kentridge attended theatre school in Paris for a year as a young man and had dreams of becoming an actor or film-maker. Over the last decade he has experimented with ever-bigger stage productions, including Dmitri Shostakovich\u2019s absurdist tale The Nose (2010) followed in 2015 by Berg\u2019s Lulu, with both premiering at the Metropolitan in New York. They were met with critical acclaim and Wozzeck, too, is in many ways startlingly original: to watch it is to gorge on visuals in a way I have never done before. Mirroring Berg\u2019s atonal score (which has none of the melody or anthems of more popular operas), Kentridge provides us with an apocalyptic vision. Navigating this is a confident cast: Australian-born Michael Honeyman, playing the red-haired Wozzeck, seems to crouch and hunch ever further into his body as he descends into violent hallucinations. Lorina Gore shows his love interest Marie as a flawed woman, hungry for male attention while simultaneously scolding herself for her lax chastity. Then there\u2019s the creepy Doctor, Richard Anderson, whose amoral experiments on Wozzeck seem to feature as a premonition of Nazi medical trials on Jewish prisoners. But while Kentridge\u2019s own inventiveness and power of imagination imbues every pore of the opera, there is a cost. For all the talent of the cast, they come across more as archetypes than real people, a consequence of putting their development second to the visual theatrics. Take Wozzeck and Marie\u2019s son, portrayed in this case by a macabre wooden puppet (where his face should be, there is simply a gas mask). It\u2019s an image straight out of a horror film. And yet ... he never seems like a real boy or a victim we can sympathise with. In the midst of writing Wozzeck, as the first world war broke out, Berg was sent to serve in the Austro-Hungarian army. His experiences there \u2013 of myriad untold horrors \u2013 formed his magnum opus. \u201cThere is a bit of me in his character,\u201d he wrote to his wife in 1918, \u201csince I have been spending these war years just as dependent on people I hate, have been in chains, sick, captive, resigned, in fact humiliated.\u201d To Kentridge\u2019s credit, his Wozzeck, too, reeks of humiliation. Here is a weak man, abused by higher-ups, beaten down by poverty and battered by war. Ultimately, it\u2019s a draining, tense, damning view of the world. Still, watching the opera unfold, it is hard not to luxuriate in Kentridge\u2019s artistry. In the beauty of his drawings. \u2022 Wozzeck, a co-production between Salzburg festival, the Metropolitan Opera, Opera Australia and the Canadian Opera Company, is playing at the Sydney Opera House from 30 January to 15 February 2019",
