      "bodyText": "Labour will face increased pressure from local party activists to adopt a more wholehearted anti-Brexit stance at its upcoming conference, according to an analysis of submitted motions which shows 90% want the party to openly back remain in any future referendum. The scrutiny of the 90 motions connected to Brexit tabled by local parties ahead of the conference in Brighton, which will begin on Saturday 21 September, showed 81 of them called for Labour to explicitly support remain, while there were none opposing a second referendum which included a remain option. The group Another Europe is Possible, which carried out the study and which campaigns for remain from a leftwing perspective, said the results showed the Labour leadership should listen to the views of party members on Brexit. Labour is currently committed to going into a general election pushing for a new referendum, which would include a \u201ccredible\u201d leave option \u2013 possibly a deal negotiated by Labour \u2013 and an option to stay in the EU. However, there has been no decision as to what side Labour would back in a referendum, with some tension between more remain-minded elements of the parliamentary party and the more cautious approach of Jeremy Corbyn and his allies. Last week the party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, used a speech to argue that Labour should \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d, and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it \u201cTom\u2019s view\u201d. Remain-minded campaigners are set to push the issue at the conference. A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour. Michael Chessum from Another Europe is Possible said: \u201cLabour members are the secret weapon of the party at a general election, and the party ignores them at its peril. \u201cSupport for an explicit remain stance is evidently overwhelming. If backroom manoeuvres are deployed to stop this being debated on conference floor it will be a disaster for morale and for Labour\u2019s prospects. \u201cWe need a debate and a vote at conference. Only if Labour can get clarity on this part of its policy can it fight the election on its domestic agenda.\u201d Polling has indicated that the mass Labour membership is notably more remain-minded than the party\u2019s official policy, with one survey from January saying 72% sought a second referendum, and 88% saying they would back remain if one was held.",

      "body": "<p><em>Question Time</em> turns 40 at the end of this month. The BBC institution is not immune to that birthday\u2019s particular mix of crisis and denial. While the programme\u2019s 25th year was marked with affectionate celebration and nostalgic retrospectives, this time around there will be little fanfare. Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words \u201cno deal\u201d or \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d or \u201cthe Irish backstop\u201d.</p> \n<p>For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, <em>Question Time</em> has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: \u201cWe are better than this.\u201d Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not.</p> \n<p>I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back <em>Question Time</em> earlier than scheduled \u201cbecause we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament\u201d. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to <em>Fake </em><em>Or Fortune?</em>, <em>The Antiques Roadshow</em> and the news?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cefafa39-4b99-49a1-b081-b34cfe92684d\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(September 13, 1979)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first episode of <i>Question Time</i> is broadcast on BBC One on 25 September, hosted by Robin Day.

But I tell myself a) times will not always be this fraught, and b) I will get more used to it. So it won\u2019t always be like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why?</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we get the questions in from the audience, we are trying to plot a way through the programme. But last week the plan was just to try to find a way forward [in the current political stalemate].\u201d</p> \n<p>She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC\u2019s every utterance.</p> \n<p>Of course, it achieved no such thing. <em>Question Time</em> has a bigger Twitter response in the UK <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-island-beats-politics-tweeted-about-tv-show-2018/1521081\" title=\"\">than any programme other than </a><em><a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/love-island-beats-politics-tweeted-about-tv-show-2018/1521081\" title=\"\">Love Island</a></em>. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party\u2019s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b651e39-3d5d-46c3-b10b-05bd77f89673\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bGnEcyxZIOM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bruce rolls her eyes just a little. \u201cLast week, it was six people on the panel [instead of the usual five] and that definitely made it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there is little point counting the minutes and seconds each person gets. Partly because you need to take the political representation over the series rather than one snapshot programme, and of course how much you talk doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how much impact you have.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Question Time</em> was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of \u201cwhat\u2019s described in TV circles as \u2018real people\u2019 to distinguish them from people who work in television\u201d. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience\u2019s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day\u2019s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions \u2013 and belief in their need to be heard.</p> \n<p>In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show\u2019s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal \u201caudience at home\u201d as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe one thing that <em>Question Time</em> still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,\u201d she says. \u201cI always ask people to be polite; sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day \u2013 you just don\u2019t know who is going to shake your hand and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/06/walkabout-goes-awry-for-johnson-in-straight-talking-yorkshire\" title=\"\"> politely tell you to \u2018leave their town\u2019</a>. That is where the jeopardy comes on <em>Question Time</em> and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74f4789832c09dd65d3ba6bb21d8a515a0e68ce0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74f4789832c09dd65d3ba6bb21d8a515a0e68ce0/188_246_886_886/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Robin Day, Question Time\u2019s first presenter.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Robin Day, Question Time\u2019s first presenter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn\u2019t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on \u2013 he has actually only been on once since I started \u2013 and someone asked him: \u2018What other country trades only on WTO rules?\u2019 The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn\u2019t. The best thing, on <em>Question Time</em>, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession?</p> \n<p>\u201cI do get involved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: \u2018let\u2019s have Michael Gove this week\u2019, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cNot as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.\u201d</p> \n<p>But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cI am not fully across why that was,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIt was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d3f5fb20370477957b27544e0777e9a316c47a7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3f5fb20370477957b27544e0777e9a316c47a7/28_0_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Question Time in London, 5 September 2019: (left to right) Layla Moran, Richard Tice, Emily Thornberry, Fiona Bruce, Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford, Iain Dale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Question Time in London, 5 September 2019: (left to right) Layla Moran, Richard Tice, Emily Thornberry, Fiona Bruce, Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford, Iain Dale.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In some ways Bruce\u2019s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls \u201cthe BBC sisterhood\u201d \u2013 Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis \u2013 had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks.</p> \n<p>You don\u2019t have to spend long in her company to understand that her <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on <em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/new-stories/fiona-bruce/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Who Do You Think You Are?</a></em> revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father\u2019s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever.</p> \n<p>Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible?</p> \n<p>\u201cHe never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.\u201d</p> \n<p>When <em>Question Time</em> came her way, she followed Dimbleby\u2019s obvious advice and just tried to be herself.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am a simple soul,\u201d she says, not quite believably. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I\u2019m not sure how you would do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends?</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.\u201d</p> \n<p>That sense of perspective, of an outsider\u2019s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever\u2019s east Asian operation.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in this British system,\u201d she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, \u201ca Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities\u201d. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the \u201ckids of international business people\u201d, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another \u201cbig adjustment\u201d. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was \u201cinterested in women\u2019s politics and having a good time\u201d. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common; she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party \u201cbecause no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c85e54b4858a47f708b12768a051084c8479966\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c85e54b4858a47f708b12768a051084c8479966/0_110_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Dimbleby with guest Tony Blair in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Dimbleby with guest Tony Blair in 2000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years \u2013 \u201chad a blast\u201d \u2013 and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on <em>Panorama</em> after she met its editor at a wedding.</p> \n<p>She became the first woman to have presented both <em>News at Six</em> and <em>News at 10</em>. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist?</p> \n<p>\u201cI think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before Dimbleby took on the <em>Question Time</em> job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth?</p> \n<p>\u201cNot always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: \u2018I might need to build some energy in the room.\u2019 On <em>Question Time</em>, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don\u2019t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?\u201d</p> \n<p>The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/23/bnp-nick-griffin-question-time\" title=\"\">the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin</a>. More than 8 million people \u2013 nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record \u2013 tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on?</p> \n<p>The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. \u201cIf Robinson hasn\u2019t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn\u2019t arise.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b90ec931222158d2612c52681eec10f332103b48\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90ec931222158d2612c52681eec10f332103b48/0_382_5729_3437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Bruce on Antiques Roadshow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Bruce on Antiques Roadshow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time <em>Question Time</em> first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind.</p> \n<p>The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby\u2019s <em>Question Time</em> panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist\u2019s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson\u2019s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with \u201ca grasp of plot and character\u201d: Dick Francis was his suggestion.<br>One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from <em>Question Time</em> are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: \u201cWatch X get owned by Y\u201d; \u201cY tears Z a new one\u201d. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about <em>Question Time</em> being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately.</p> \n<p>It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely?</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"009d48a9e9a616e3f0f79dd54dac2b8441d8bc2f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/009d48a9e9a616e3f0f79dd54dac2b8441d8bc2f/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds outside New Broadcasting House in central London protest against then BNP leader Nick Griffin\u2019s 2009 Question Time appearance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds outside the BBC\u2019s former headquarters in White City, London, protest against then BNP leader Nick Griffin\u2019s 2009 Question Time appearance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The other armchair <em>Question Time</em> sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the <em>Today</em> programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it \u201cthe Brexit Broadcasting Corporation\u201d, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as \u201cthe enemy\u201d should be careful what they wish for.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe BBC value I aspire to represent on <em>Question Time</em> is simply impartiality,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cFrom what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite.

      "bodyText": "Question Time turns 40 at the end of this month. The BBC institution is not immune to that birthday\u2019s particular mix of crisis and denial. While the programme\u2019s 25th year was marked with affectionate celebration and nostalgic retrospectives, this time around there will be little fanfare. Mostly, you imagine, like many of us who have experienced that midlife milestone, the show would ideally like to take to its bed in a darkened room to fret about its blood pressure and its sell-by date, and to relive those golden years before any red-faced audience member ever yelled the words \u201cno deal\u201d or \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d or \u201cthe Irish backstop\u201d. For those who hold to the idea that politics and journalism should be more about listening than lecturing, more about informed doubt than angry certainty, Question Time has for a long while been an uncomfortable watch. Since the redoubtable charmer David Dimbleby finally threw in the towel after 25 years, aged 80, in December, the hottest seat in British broadcasting has belonged to Fiona Bruce, who maintains a measure of order with a mixture of good humour and exasperation and that judiciously raised eyebrow. Her early outings on the show were praised for their briskness and confidence. As this long year has worn on, however, she has, like the rest of us, looked a little more beleaguered. She was not 20 minutes into the first show after the summer break before she was calling a time-out to the partisan bickering: \u201cWe are better than this.\u201d Most evidence in the current public square suggests that we are not. I met her last Monday, at the same moment that her equivalent in the House of Commons, John Bercow, was announcing his departure. She had been instrumental, the week before, in bringing back Question Time earlier than scheduled \u201cbecause we all felt it was important for people to be able to hold their elected representatives to account in the absence of parliament\u201d. Was there a part of her that wished she had stuck to Fake Or Fortune?, The Antiques Roadshow and the news? She insists none at all. \u201cAt the moment, Question Time occupies so much mental energy [for me]. But I tell myself a) times will not always be this fraught, and b) I will get more used to it. So it won\u2019t always be like this.\u201d I wish I shared her confidence. That first week back she gave in to the inevitable and the audience talked Brexit and prorogation for the whole hour. Why? \u201cWhen we get the questions in from the audience, we are trying to plot a way through the programme. But last week the plan was just to try to find a way forward [in the current political stalemate].\u201d She began that quest by asking the audience in advance to signal whether they were remainers or leavers, roundheads or cavaliers. The gesture looked like a pre-emptive strike to appease those critics who see bias in the BBC\u2019s every utterance. Of course, it achieved no such thing. Question Time has a bigger Twitter response in the UK than any programme other than Love Island. Each episode of the programme has long since become a real-time media studies lesson. Bruce and the panel and selected members of the audience are freeze-framed for evidence of Brexit collusion or Remoaner conspiracy. No one, it can seem on Twitter at least, is immune to these tribal knee-jerks. Iain Dale, the LBC presenter and Tory commentator, who was a guest on that first show, was thrilled to note the boost it had given to his online following. He immediately fed that crowd by tweeting a tally of the amount of time each panellist had been allowed to speak. Despite the fact that by far the most newsworthy moment of that programme involved Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry being exposed explaining the absurdist contradictions of her party\u2019s current policy, Dale used the data to support his belief that there was an anti-Brexit conspiracy on the show. Bruce rolls her eyes just a little. \u201cLast week, it was six people on the panel [instead of the usual five] and that definitely made it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there is little point counting the minutes and seconds each person gets. Partly because you need to take the political representation over the series rather than one snapshot programme, and of course how much you talk doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how much impact you have.\u201d Question Time was born in a similar moment of political polarisation: 1979, the first year of the Thatcher government. As the first chair, Sir Robin Day, said, it was an experiment in putting politicians in front of \u201cwhat\u2019s described in TV circles as \u2018real people\u2019 to distinguish them from people who work in television\u201d. It was the third episode before a cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, appeared, and offered himself as a rather grandiose conductor of the audience\u2019s discontent. Watching those early episodes now, you have a sense of a different kind of relationship between panel and questioners. There is a little more general politeness from the latter, and a degree of anxiety about being the target of Day\u2019s gruff wit. In the years since then, many things have changed. But the most obvious one is that people now have more practice and opportunity in broadcasting opinions \u2013 and belief in their need to be heard. In the early days of social media, Dimbleby used to read out the show\u2019s Twitter hashtag in the style of a high court judge presented with the latest fashion in tattoos. Latterly, he acknowledged the highly vocal \u201caudience at home\u201d as a crucial part of the reach of the show. Our greater access to politicians, and to commenting on their every gesture, has led to two things: their calibre has apparently fallen, and the collective mistrust of them has grown. Does Bruce think the relationship is retrievable? \u201cThe one thing that Question Time still does which other programmes cannot do is cut through the political messaging,\u201d she says. \u201cI always ask people to be polite; sometimes they are very direct. And as any politician knows, if you face the public directly, anything can happen. Look at Boris Johnson in West Yorkshire the other day \u2013 you just don\u2019t know who is going to shake your hand and politely tell you to \u2018leave their town\u2019. That is where the jeopardy comes on Question Time and not all politicians want to come on it, for that reason.\u201d Those who do rarely seem to have the time or the inclination to utter anything other than practised party lines. Hasn\u2019t it actually become yet another opportunity for the two tribes that now make up our nation to display their colours, and to let off some steam? \u201cIt can be cathartic, people like to vent on Brexit, but I still think it works best when people want an answer to a specific question. For example, I remember Nigel Farage was on \u2013 he has actually only been on once since I started \u2013 and someone asked him: \u2018What other country trades only on WTO rules?\u2019 The man in the audience just kept trying to get him to name one, which he didn\u2019t. The best thing, on Question Time, is when the reality confronts the rhetoric.\u201d In his own recollections of the programme, Day mentioned that he regretted not having a greater say in choosing panellists. Has Bruce managed to win that concession? \u201cI do get involved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be wonderful if I could sit there and say: \u2018let\u2019s have Michael Gove this week\u2019, or whatever. But sadly it is not like that. Mostly there is a member of the government and a member of the opposition put forward, and then the rest is worked out over a year to get fair representation.\u201d Farage, who has an amazing appearance record, seems to have been a particularly fortunate beneficiary of that system\u2026 \u201cNot as amazing as Ken Clarke, who has been on it 59 times, I think.\u201d But whereas Clarke has held many of the highest offices in the land over half a century, Farage has been on 33 times having never been elected an MP\u2026 \u201cI am not fully across why that was,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cIt was before my time. He came on with me after the European elections, once, which seemed reasonable, as he led the largest party.\u201d In some ways Bruce\u2019s own appointment appeared an odd choice at the time. It was generally accepted that whoever would replace Dimbleby had to be a woman, but others among what Bruce sweetly calls \u201cthe BBC sisterhood\u201d \u2013 Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis \u2013 had arguably a greater depth of political experience. Bruce, by all accounts, aced the audition process, which involved a practice live show. Her apparently impermeable good humour was no doubt a factor. Anyone who took the thing more to heart would probably go bonkers after a couple of weeks. You don\u2019t have to spend long in her company to understand that her Antiques Roadshow bonhomie is not just for the cameras. There is a cloak of cheery confidence about her. A 2009 appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? revealed some of the roots of that, when she traced her father\u2019s family back to an impoverished fishing village in Scotland. Her old man had escaped that, a considerable autodidact, to make it from the post room to the boardroom at Unilever. Would she say that he had imbued his youngest child with a sense that anything was possible? \u201cHe never said that in so many words. But yes, given where he came from and what he did, I think subconsciously I have always felt that.\u201d When Question Time came her way, she followed Dimbleby\u2019s obvious advice and just tried to be herself. \u201cI am a simple soul,\u201d she says, not quite believably. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have time to dissemble on live TV even if you wanted to. Everything is happening around you and you just react. If you were also trying to be a character, I\u2019m not sure how you would do that.\u201d Day in particular gave the show its knockabout gravitas by being a political insider. Would she count politicians among her friends? \u201cThat is not the world I have inhabited. God, who knows how long I will do this and if that will change. But I think it is healthy for me to keep a distance.\u201d That sense of perspective, of an outsider\u2019s eye, she suggests, is rooted in a childhood that began in Singapore where her father ran Unilever\u2019s east Asian operation. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in this British system,\u201d she says. The family came back briefly to live on the Wirral when she was six. Then later, until she was 14, she was sent to an international school in Milan, \u201ca Tower of Babel of different languages and nationalities\u201d. Her best friend was Norwegian, and they remain close. She returned from Milan, where she mixed with the \u201ckids of international business people\u201d, to a comprehensive in New Cross, south London, another \u201cbig adjustment\u201d. From there, she used the language skills she had to win a place at Oxford, where she was \u201cinterested in women\u2019s politics and having a good time\u201d. She was very briefly a protester at Greenham Common; she fronted a punky band and dyed her hair blue (but only for a week). She was not involved in student party politics, and never a member of any party \u201cbecause no party has ever had sufficient pull for me. And that is just as well now.\u201d Her desire to go into journalism came quite late. She worked at the management consultancy Accenture for a year, with airy ideas of an MBA, but spent much of it crying in the loos. She escaped to a job in advertising for four years \u2013 \u201chad a blast\u201d \u2013 and met her husband of 25 years, Nigel Sharrocks, who was a director at the BMP agency. She eventually talked her way into a job as a researcher on Panorama after she met its editor at a wedding. She became the first woman to have presented both News at Six and News at 10. Does she think of herself as a presenter or a journalist? \u201cI think of myself as a journalist first and foremost.\u201d Before Dimbleby took on the Question Time job, Jeremy Paxman auditioned. By some accounts he savaged both the panel and the audience. Does Bruce feel TV journalism has to be combative to get at the truth? \u201cNot always. I had done debate programmes before and quite often you go into them thinking: \u2018I might need to build some energy in the room.\u2019 On Question Time, the reverse is true. A lot of the time, I am just trying to not have it turn into a slanging match. You want some heat in the programme, but you need more light than heat. I think if I don\u2019t do that, sometimes it is just going to run away and be incredibly ill tempered. Who wants to watch that?\u201d The answer to that question is perhaps: quite a lot of people. For a while, in more politically stable times, there seemed to be an effort to invite mostly career contrarians on the programme in case it became dull. Ten years ago, there was considerable furore around the appearance of BNP leader Nick Griffin. More than 8 million people \u2013 nearly three times the regular audience, and still easily a record \u2013 tuned in to see him undone by Jack Straw and Bonnie Greer. Could Bruce imagine having a figure like Tommy Robinson on? The thing about Griffin was that he had become an MEP, Bruce says. \u201cIf Robinson hasn\u2019t won representation through a national election, then the question wouldn\u2019t arise.\u201d The audience appetite for something of a political ruck, however, appears to have sharpened, ingrained by the winner-takes-all mentality of first past the post, and a mistrust of coalition and compromise. Since about the time Question Time first appeared on our screens, it could be argued that we have increased the demand for politicians to entertain us, to be colourful rather than competent. We are, you might say, now reaping that particular whirlwind. The present prime minister was a regular fixture on Dimbleby\u2019s Question Time panels. He played a characteristic part in one of the most memorable exchanges on the programme, when the panel debated the award of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie in 2007. Dame Shirley Williams, surprisingly and to her discredit, suggested that the honour was ill judged since it risked insulting some Muslim groups and inflaming tensions. The late Christopher Hitchens made a robust defence of the novelist\u2019s right to offend, with a righteous erudition rarely heard on British TV. When Johnson\u2019s turn came, he inevitably ducked that nuanced and principled argument, and instead mumbled a crowd-pleasing wish that the knighthood had gone to an English novelist with \u201ca grasp of plot and character\u201d: Dick Francis was his suggestion. One result of that ongoing desire for politicians that look for easy applause, rather than confronting hard choices, is a sense of debate as a zero-sum game, rather than an attempt to find consensus. The clips that trend on Twitter from Question Time are often prefaced by the language of cage fighting: \u201cWatch X get owned by Y\u201d; \u201cY tears Z a new one\u201d. The clips are followed by dialogue in which people shout intemperately on Twitter about Question Time being unwatchable because it reflects a nation in which people shout intemperately. It is hard to see that temper cooling. Does Bruce imagine that she might soon have to start programmes by asking everyone to play nicely? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the schoolmarm. You just have to sense the feeling in the room. We had one guy who became so irate he stood up and started haranguing one of the panellists. I had to tell him to sit down, which sounded a little odd.\u201d The other armchair Question Time sport is the opportunity is provides for the current national pastime of bias-hunting. It is good fodder for those who would rather put our current political impasse down to a misjudged sneer from John Humphrys on the Today programme, or an answer cut short by Fiona Bruce, than to three decades of rising inequality and underinvestment in infrastructure and skills. The BBC has been found wanting in various ways in reporting our political meltdown, but those who, like the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, call it \u201cthe Brexit Broadcasting Corporation\u201d, or conversely, along with Nigel Farage, characterise it as \u201cthe enemy\u201d should be careful what they wish for. \u201cThe BBC value I aspire to represent on Question Time is simply impartiality,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cFrom what I can tell on social media people think the programme is too rightwing. And when you look at the audience research we get people thinking it is too leftwing. I can only hope we fall between those two and plot a course down the middle.\u201d The problem is that the middle ground no longer appears to exist, even as a widely held aspiration. Bruce can look like an easy target for those political forces that want to suggest the BBC is the voice of a supposed metropolitan elite. She has homes in Hampstead and Oxfordshire, and has been known to write about nice holidays for the Telegraph. I wonder if she thinks the scrutiny of the corporation in general and Question Time in particular has been helped or hindered by publishing presenters\u2019 and journalists\u2019 salaries? (Bruce\u2019s was reportedly between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3400,000 before she accepted the Question Time job.) \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it has been helpful for women. And I think: why not?\u201d Does she not think average earners might look at those numbers and think: why on earth are taxpayers paying TV presenters four times as much as the prime minister? \u201cI can understand that. And I feel incredibly lucky to be doing the jobs I do and be remunerated as I am.\u201d Does she see any danger of becoming too far removed from the people she is giving voice to, the audience and the viewers? \u201cI don\u2019t think that. But I also think that is partly why I cannot see myself becoming the person who goes to Westminster parties and so on. I see my role on the programme as helping the audience get their answers.\u201d You believe Bruce when she says she has the will to escape from work, though it can be all-encompassing. \u201cI go and walk the dog or go horse-riding or whatever it is in the great outdoors and that, for me, is a switch-off,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter does not like to talk about politics, though my son does, but that means we talk about it at home less than we might.

It is not a happy country at all at the moment.\u201d Does she not fear, whatever madness happens in the coming months, that if she sits there for another five years, or 10 years, every show is going to be about Brexit and its consequences?

A plurality of Democrats and nearly two-thirds of Americans <a href=\"#page=3\">disagree</a> with Massachusetts\u2019 senior senator.</p> <p>Looking at Brexit and immigration, Greenberg acknowledges that he has long been \u201ccritical of center-left parties for not showing that managing immigration was first principle and not showing that they would prioritize citizens over non-citizens\u201d.</p> <p>As part of his examination of the topic, Greenberg refers to the 15th amendment of the constitution as the legal foundation for \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d, by which those born within the US are automatically deemed to be citizens. Here Greenberg errs. That rule is enshrined in the 14th amendment, which secures equal protection and due process. The 15th amendment guarantees the voting rights of former slaves.</p> <p>If history is a guide, the embrace of identity politics results in pushback. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat was not just about having a tin ear to economic anxiety or income stagnation, a source of finger-pointing by Greenberg. Nor was it solely due to Trump\u2019s race-baiting.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s loss also stemmed from her worship at the altars of multiculturalism and political correctness. Showcasing Lesley McSpadden, mother of the late Michael Brown, at the Democratic convention may have been too much for too many after police were gunned down in Dallas and Baton Rouge earlier that July.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concerns and interests of middle-aged suburbia do not necessarily line up with those of the Squad or Bernie Sanders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump fell into a similar trap. He persisted in harping on grievances, real and imagined, long after taking the oath of office. He continued to demonize minorities and migrants and made no attempt to reach to the center. Charlottesville and Pittsburgh indelibly stain his already toxic legacy.</p> <p>Furthermore, bashing Colin Kaepernick hurt more than it helped in suburbia and swing districts. In those precincts, the public turned a deaf ear as the president kept on yammering about caravans and gangs.</p> <p>Greenberg is optimistic that if the Democrats win they will be able to press for a more activist government. To a point.</p> <p>The concerns and interests of middle-aged suburbia do not necessarily line up with those of the Squad or Bernie Sanders. Culture counts. If the midterms taught us anything, it is that imposing a check upon an untethered president should not be equated with a desire for a revolution or turning the US on its head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos review: James Mattis pulls a flanking manuever on Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Preserving the social safety net is different from unbridled government expansion. Safeguarding social security, Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare brings a larger constituency than stripping people of private insurance for the sake of single-payer healthcare. If the Democrats succeed as Greenberg predicts, they will do so by bringing some Republicans along for the ride, by definition a moderating action and influence.</p> <p>Having been stung by the effective abolition of the deductibility of state and local taxes, wealthier coastal voters will also likely be resistant to a potpourri of costly initiatives. Infrastructure is one thing. The Green New Deal is probably something else.</p> <p>Trade is another issue that may pit Democrats against each other.

Looking at Brexit and immigration, Greenberg acknowledges that he has long been \u201ccritical of center-left parties for not showing that managing immigration was first principle and not showing that they would prioritize citizens over non-citizens\u201d. As part of his examination of the topic, Greenberg refers to the 15th amendment of the constitution as the legal foundation for \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d, by which those born within the US are automatically deemed to be citizens. Here Greenberg errs. That rule is enshrined in the 14th amendment, which secures equal protection and due process. The 15th amendment guarantees the voting rights of former slaves. If history is a guide, the embrace of identity politics results in pushback. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat was not just about having a tin ear to economic anxiety or income stagnation, a source of finger-pointing by Greenberg. Nor was it solely due to Trump\u2019s race-baiting. Clinton\u2019s loss also stemmed from her worship at the altars of multiculturalism and political correctness. Showcasing Lesley McSpadden, mother of the late Michael Brown, at the Democratic convention may have been too much for too many after police were gunned down in Dallas and Baton Rouge earlier that July. Trump fell into a similar trap. He persisted in harping on grievances, real and imagined, long after taking the oath of office. He continued to demonize minorities and migrants and made no attempt to reach to the center. Charlottesville and Pittsburgh indelibly stain his already toxic legacy. Furthermore, bashing Colin Kaepernick hurt more than it helped in suburbia and swing districts. In those precincts, the public turned a deaf ear as the president kept on yammering about caravans and gangs. Greenberg is optimistic that if the Democrats win they will be able to press for a more activist government. To a point. The concerns and interests of middle-aged suburbia do not necessarily line up with those of the Squad or Bernie Sanders. Culture counts. If the midterms taught us anything, it is that imposing a check upon an untethered president should not be equated with a desire for a revolution or turning the US on its head. Preserving the social safety net is different from unbridled government expansion. Safeguarding social security, Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare brings a larger constituency than stripping people of private insurance for the sake of single-payer healthcare. If the Democrats succeed as Greenberg predicts, they will do so by bringing some Republicans along for the ride, by definition a moderating action and influence. Having been stung by the effective abolition of the deductibility of state and local taxes, wealthier coastal voters will also likely be resistant to a potpourri of costly initiatives. Infrastructure is one thing. The Green New Deal is probably something else. Trade is another issue that may pit Democrats against each other. Although Greenberg has long sounded the klaxon concerning the impact of trade on America\u2019s vulnerable, Trump\u2019s embrace of protectionism has made free trade popular among Democrats. Trumpism won\u2019t be disappearing anytime soon. Rural Americans and evangelicals will not stop making themselves heard. Calls to blood and soil will continue. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s minions endeavor to enshrine a dynasty. Our political landscape has changed.",
