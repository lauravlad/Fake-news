In an email seen by the Guardian, Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, told his constituents this week he would campaign for remain, joining his senior colleagues John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Keir Starmer and Tom Watson in backing that position. The growing number of shadow cabinet members backing remain increases the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn, to voice his support for staying in the EU. He and others in the shadow cabinet have been reluctant to say how they would campaign in the event of a second referendum, as they try to avoid angering Labour voters in leave areas. Brown, who first said he would campaign for remain in March in an email to a constituent in his Newcastle East seat, wrote in his latest message that he was a \u201cmoderate remainer\u201d and had consistently believed staying in the EU was in the national interest. However, since March Labour\u2019s stance has been hammered out at the top levels of the party and has settled on trying to renegotiate a Brexit deal and then putting that to a second referendum with an option to remain. Brown wrote: \u201cThe Labour party would campaign to put any Brexit outcome under this government back to the people through a referendum with the option to remain.

Corbyn will face fresh pressure over Brexit from scores of activists at the party\u2019s conference in Brighton later this month. Brexit and whether Labour should back a second referendum dominated last year\u2019s conference, which resulted in the party deciding to adopt an \u201call options on the table\u201d policy, including the possibility of a public vote. So far this year motions have been submitted by more than 60 local Labour branches calling for Corbyn to abandon his plan to renegotiate a Brexit deal and then put it to a second referendum.

But whatever happens we will come out on October 31st.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>To the second, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs, in the course of the next few days, will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him. Not least for what he did in turning this country around after Labour left it bankrupt, and delivering a jobs miracle in the UK, record low unemployment.

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n      <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n      <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n      <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n      <p></p>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7b56748f08143ee1ae584e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/josh-halliday\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-13T08:50:06.911Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit party takes control of Hartlepool</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85408ff1223a70362793baeace50cf6bea133e19\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85408ff1223a70362793baeace50cf6bea133e19/0_31_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hartlepool dock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hartlepool dock</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in its north-east heartlands.<br><br>Labour lost overall control of the council in May when its leader <a href=\"https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/politics/council/deputy-council-leader-loses-seat-and-labour-left-without-majority-in-hartlepool-after-suffering-losses-118157\">blamed \u201ca divided party\u201d</a> nationally for it haemorrhaging votes in the heavily leave-voting town. </p> \n  <p>Hartlepool becomes the first council under the control of the Brexit party in the UK and a boost to the party in the north-east, where Nigel Farage is fighting hard to make inroads.</p> \n  <p>The Brexit party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives.<br><br>The Brexit party-Conservative coalition now has 13 councillors on the 32-seat council, compared with Labour\u2019s 10.</p> \n  <p>Of the nine new Brexit party councillors, six sat as independents (four of whom were ex-Ukip) plus three defectors who until last night represented Ukip, Putting Hartlepool First and the Veterans and People\u2019s party respectively.</p> \n  <p>One of the new Brexit party councillors, Shane Moore, said on Friday the move was about \u201csending an absolutely clear message to those nationally who would frustrate the result of the referendum\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Moore, who quit Ukip last year and previously sat as a Conservative councillor, said he had no intention of joining the Brexit party until the past fortnight when MPs voted to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that in Westminster, remain parties and remain groups are clubbing together to form an alliance to put Brexit at risk,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe felt that, in conjunction with our Conservative colleagues, we needed to form an alliance of our own and send a very clear message to those people \u2013 and especially to the Labour party locally \u2013 that they need to stop playing games. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey need to listen and respect the result of the referendum.

It\u2019s an unsourced article.

But that\u2019s different from giving carte blanche to the EU and saying whatever regulations you introduced in the future will automatically apply to Northern Ireland whether they\u2019re good for Northern Ireland, or whether they damage the Northern Ireland economy.

A speech to northern politicians and business leaders in Rotherham was interrupted by a man who urged him to get back to parliament to sort out the mess he had created. Earlier a woman in Doncaster confronted Boris Johnson face-to-face and accused him of telling fairytales about spending and Brexit. Scotland Yard has announced that no further action will be taken against Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign founded by businessman Arron Banks and spearheaded by Nigel Farage. It said there had been \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d of electoral law but insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation. Johnson will head to Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier to try to break the Brexit impasse. The prime minister said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about getting a deal. Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit. Major policy differences and serious personal worries about Corbyn and Johnson meant she could not support either in government, Swinson told the Guardian. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Johnson was serious about a deal after their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. The Democratic Unionist party has played down a report that it is softening its line on a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Its leader, Arlene Foster, and its Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, both described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a Times story claiming the DUP was dropping its objection to a border in the Irish Sea. Support for Welsh independence would soar if it meant Wales could remain in the EU, a new poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in the north-east of England. The party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin has accused John Bercow of wielding a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit. He called for the Speaker\u2019s powers to be curtailed. The election of the new Speaker will take place on Monday 4 November. Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, will take the chair for tge final time on Thursday 31 October. In response to the decision by the Metropolitan police not to take any further action against Leave.EU, its financial backer Arron Banks has called for the resignation of the head of the Electoral Commission, Bob Posner, and the chair of the Commons\u2019 culture committee, Damian Collins. In a statement Banks said: The disgraceful political collusion between the Electoral Commission and the Damian Collins \u2018remain-biased\u2019 DCMS committee and a number of leading remain MPs, demonstrates a serious abuse of public office and we will be demanding a full public inquiry investigation into their actions. We will be writing to the prime minster today demanding a public inquiry into the actions of the Electoral Commission. I am today calling for the resignation of Damian Collins and the CEO of Electoral Commission as a result of today\u2019s news. The Electoral Commission have serious questions to answer about political bias and whether it is fit for purpose as a regulator. The management board is overseen by third-rate politicos and people who have shown clear political bias. The chairman himself described Brexit as a \u201ccollection of Eurosceptic nonsense\u201d and one of the EC board called for a second referendum. The investigation has taken a huge personal toll on Liz Bilney, her family and the harassment and lies perpetrated by anti-Brexit MPs is disgraceful. MPs like Stephen and Ian Lavery should apologise to Liz and the 1.5 million supporters of Leave.EU they tried to smear. During the last two years, the Metropolitan police have been professional and thorough. They spent many hours investigating our case and they should be commended for doing a difficult job in a difficult political climate. They remained impartial and operated with complete integrity. \u201cWe would like to thank the Metropolitan police commissioner for giving her officers her full support at all times. Here\u2019s video of Johnson being challenged in Doncaster. Here\u2019s a summary of Johnson\u2019s trip to Yorkshire: The prime minister has been challenged by voters in Doncaster and Rotherham. A speech to northern politicians and business leaders in Rotherham was interrupted by a man who urged him to get back to parliament to sort out the mess he had created. Earlier a woman in Doncaster confronted Johnson face-to-face and accused him of telling fairytales about spending and Brexit. \u201cPeople have died because of austerity, and you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity\u2019s over and it\u2019s all good now,\u201d she said. Johnson insisted he won\u2019t be deterred by political turmoil from delivering Brexit by the 31 October deadline. He said: \u201cWhatever the shenanigans that may be going on at Westminster we will get on with delivering our agenda and preparing to take this country out of the EU on October 31st.\u201d Johnson confirmed he will be meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for Brexit talks on Monday. He said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reaching a deal. The prime minister refused to commit to various northern projects, including Yorkshire devolution, a Leeds mass transit system and extra spending in Sheffield. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to make more spending commitments,\u201d he admitted. Johnson denied accusing police forces of \u201cspaffing money up the wall\u201d on historical child abuse cases, six months after telling LBC just that. He said he wanted police to concentrate on fighting crime. In his speech, Johnson announced plans to devolve transport powers for fares, stations and rolling stock. \u201cIt is time for the north to run its own trains,\u201d he said. In the Q&amp;A with journalists, the best questions came from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. He asked: You\u2019ve got five weeks left to get a Brexit deal, can you update us on what you think is the latest probability of finding an agreement that the DUP can get behind? And secondly, you called David Cameron \u2018a girly swot\u2019, are you a little bit be worried what he might call you in his upcoming memoirs? On the first part, Johnson replied: On where we are with Brexit, I think people do deserve to know what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re working incredibly hard to get a deal, there is the rough shape of a deal to be done. I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France, and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress. I\u2019m seeing the president of the [European] commission, and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Monday, and we\u2019ll talk about the ideas that we\u2019ve been working on. And we\u2019ll see where we get. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. But whatever happens we will come out on October 31st. To the second, he said: Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs, in the course of the next few days, will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him. Not least for what he did in turning this country around after Labour left it bankrupt, and delivering a jobs miracle in the UK, record low unemployment. I think he has a very distinguished record and a legacy to be proud of. While Johnson was speaking, Scotland Yard announced that no further action will be taken against Leave.EU, the Brexit campaign founded by businessman Arron Banks and spearheaded by Nigel Farage. A Met statement said: \u201cOn 5 August 2019 the MPS submitted a file to the CPS for Early Investigative Advice in relation to the Leave.EU investigation and this advice has now been received. \u201cIt is clear that whilst some technical breaches of electoral law were committed by Leave.EU in respect of the spending return submitted for their campaign, there is insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation. \u201cLeave.EU\u2019s responsible person has been has been told that they will face no further police action.\u201d The force said investigations into the spending returns of Vote Leave and BeLeave were ongoing. Here\u2019s a fuller transcript of Johnson\u2019s response to both the heckler and a question from a journalist about how he can deliver various promises when he can\u2019t get an election and Brexit done. Johnson said: I certainly won\u2019t be deterred by anybody from our goal of coming out of the EU on October 31st. I think the people of this country want us to get Brexit done. But I also won\u2019t be deterred with getting on with our domestic agenda. I\u2019m a passionate believer in devolution and in giving power to strong local leaders to champion their areas and to be accountable for their transport networks. Whatever the shenanigans that may be going on at Westminster we will get on with delivering our agenda and preparing to take this country out of the EU on October 31st. And there will be ample time for parliament to consider the deal that I very much hope to do at the EU summit on October 17th and 18th. To the gentleman who left prematurely, not necessarily under his own steam, that is the answer to his question. To have a Queen\u2019s speech and to set out our domestic agenda, we\u2019ve lost about four days of parliamentary sitting time. There\u2019s ample time for parliament to consider not just Brexit but all kinds of things both before and after the European council on October 17th so lets get on and do it. Q: You called David Cameron a \u2018girly swot\u2019 are you worried about what he\u2019ll say in his memoirs? Nothing Cameron writes in his memoirs diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him, Johnson says. Q: What\u2019s the probability of a Brexit deal? We\u2019re working incredibly hard. We\u2019ve made a good deal of progress, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we get\u201d on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but whatever happens we will come out on October 31st.\u201d Q: Will you commit to mass transit system in Leeds? Oh God, Johnson says. I want to do it, Leeds should have a mass transit system, but I\u2019m not going to commit to a budget to it today. Q: Are you committed to Yorkshire devolution. Further work needs to be done on that, Johnson says, acknowledging different views. Q: Why has Sheffield been underfunded? I\u2019ve just but \u00a33.6bn into towns, Johnson says before admitting it won\u2019t apply to Sheffield. I\u2019m reluctant to make more spending commitments, he says. Q: Do you still think police forces are \u2018spaffing up the wall\u2019 on historical child abuse allegations? That\u2019s not what I said, Johnson said. I want to see police officers fighting crime, he added. Fact check by my boss: Q: Why did you delay the domestic abuse bill? The bill is certainly going to be carried over. It will be right there in the Queen\u2019s speech, Johnson says. In the Q&amp;A Johnson says political uncertainty won\u2019t put him off getting Brexit done by 31 October. He also repeats that there will be \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit, in response to the heckler. Johnson confirms plans to devolve transport to regions in the north. \u201cIt is time for the north to run its own trains,\u201d he says. This will involve powers over fares, stations and rolling stock, Johnson says. The arrangement will involve a partnership between the railways and the north. Johnson comes up with a better joke about pacer trains. Here\u2019s video of that heckler: Helen Pidd, who is in Rotherham, says the heckler was promptly thrown out. Johnson says he is the first prime minister since Clement Attlee to have been a mayor. He then gets heckled about proroguing parliament. The heckler says: \u201cWhy are you not with them in parliament sorting out the mess that you have created?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to get back to parliament very soon.\u201d Johnson finally starts his speech in Rotherham at the Convention of the North. He starts with a lame joke about Magna, the location for the event, ice cream and latin. Not much laughter. But someone liked it: But a point about a nearby bagel factory also falls flat. Channel 4 News has more from the woman in Doncaster challenging Johnson on spending and his Brexit \u201cfairytale\u201d. She asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the money coming from now then?\u201d And added: \u201cAll you\u2019re going to do is put the same amount of police on the streets as what you\u2019ve took off.\u201d Boris Johnson has been confronted by a voter in Doncaster who accused him of telling fairytales. She said: \u201cPeople have died because of austerity. And then you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now, we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything is going to be great. It\u2019s just a fairytale.\u201d While we wait for Johnson\u2019s speech to the Convention of the North, the FT has a preview. It says he will announce that elected mayors in the north of England will be given London-style powers over their railway budgets and timetables. Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit. Speaking ahead of her first Lib Dem conference as party leader, Swinson said she favoured \u201cpluralist politics\u201d and cross-party working such as that which saw opposition MPs group together to force a Brexit extension and block an election. Before his speech to the Convention of the North, Boris Johnson has been visiting Doncaster market. PA said he purchased a cob loaf and English fruit and joked with one lobster seller: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a few claws out of that withdrawal agreement.\u201d He told one trader \u201cwe\u2019re going to get a deal\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, anyway. And if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re coming out on October 31. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Here we go, that\u2019s democracy.\u201d He showed no reaction as one man told him: \u201cFind a deal here \u2013 this is Doncaster, not Europe.\u201d The DUP could be willing to shift its red lines on Brexit if it had a legally binding \u201cStormont lock\u201d which would give the Northern Ireland assembly a say on alignment with EU rules, sources say. Arlene Foster, the party leader, has dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d reports that the party had said it would accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules after Brexit in a deal to replace the Irish backstop. But sources do not rule out the possibility of a deal, if were it backed up by a legally binding guarantee for the DUP. They point to paragraph 50 of the December 2017 joint report saying it is the \u201cglue\u201d that could hold all sides together. At issue is the importance of keeping the Irish border invisible. In the backstop arrangement outlined in Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the republic until a wider trade deal was struck which included solutions for the frontier. Paragraph 50 of the joint report was inserted at the last minute after May ceded to demands by the DUP to prevent checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It says that in the absence of a Brexit deal, \u201cno new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d unless, in line with the 1998 peace deal, Stormont agrees \u201cthat distinct arrangements are appropriate for Northern Ireland\u201d. \u201cParagraph 50 is the glue that will hold any deal together that will get approval from the DUP,\u201d said one source. The DUP dismissed the Stormont lock as \u201ccosmetic and meaningless\u201d when it was first proposed in January, because it was not legally binding. The EU has said it is opposed to giving Stormont a legally binding veto, but there is widespread feeling that a space has opened up to crash-test the DUP\u2019s red lines and this is why reports are emerging about the party potentially softening its stance. Earlier this week the new EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, indicated there would be room for manoeuvre. A longstanding ally of Leo Varadkar, he told RTE that if \u201cthere are constitutional issues that are already in the withdrawal agreement that might have to be improved upon, if this is a request that\u2019s made, of course we can look at it\u201d. Hogan also said he detected a shift in Johnson\u2019s position also: \u201cI also note that the British prime minister has moved away from his position \u2026 where he\u2019s now prepared to look at divergence of certain rules and regulations on the island of Ireland vis-a-vis the United Kingdom. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s movement happening on both sides. Let\u2019s see over the next four weeks how we can advance those intensive negotiations to reach an agreement.\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: Boris Johnson will head to Luxembourg on Monday to meet Jean-Claude Juncker for the first time in an attempt to break the Brexit impasse. The prime minister will hold his first face-to-face talks at a \u201cworking lunch\u201d hosted by Juncker. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Johnson was serious about a deal following their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. The DUP has played down a report that it is softening its line on a Northern Ireland only backstop. Its leader, Arlene Foster, and its Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, both described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a Times story claiming the DUP was dropping its objection to a border in the Irish Sea. Johnson is continuing his unofficial election campaign with another trip to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands. In a speech in Rotherham he is expected to promise northern communities \u201ccontrol over the things that matter to them\u201d, and a new Northern Powerhouse growth body to drive the region\u2019s economy. Support for Welsh independence would soar if it meant that Wales could remain in the EU, a new poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in the north-east of England. The party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin has accused John Bercow of wielding a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit. He called for the Speaker\u2019s powers to be curtailed. The election of the new Speaker will take place on Monday 4 November. Bercow, who has held the office since 2009, will take the chair for a final time on Thursday 31 October. The Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp has some puzzled Brussels reaction to that Johnson/Juncker meeting. The prime minister will hold his first face-to-face talks at a lunch hosted by Juncker in the European commission president\u2019s home country, where he was prime minister for 18 years. Johnson will then hold talks with the current prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel. EU sources suggested Johnson had sought to avoid a meeting in Brussels for fear of giving the impression that the new prime minister was begging for concessions. A European commission spokeswoman said Juncker would meet Johnson for a \u201cworking lunch\u201d. The spokeswoman said the location had been chosen by \u201ccommon accord\u201d and that it would allow Juncker the benefit of going straight from the talks to Strasbourg, where the European parliament is sitting next week. She declined to disclose details about the precise location of the meeting. \u201cYou can imagine it is somewhere where they serve food,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The new communications team in Downing Street is understood to believe that Theresa May undermined herself in the public eye by making dashes to Brussels to seek movement in the negotiation. Johnson had hinted at plans for further meetings with EU leaders next week. His first visits in August to Berlin and Paris to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, were widely seen as a success. The election of the new Speaker of the House of Commons will take place on Monday 4 November, the House of Commons has announced, according to PA. The current Speaker, John Bercow, who has held the office since June 22 2009, will take the chair for a final time on Thursday 31 October. Bercow will formally resign as an MP on Monday 4 November. The election of a new Speaker will be presided over by the father of the house, the Conservative MP Ken Clarke. Nominations of candidates must be submitted between 9.30am and 10.30am on Monday 4 November, with the house proceeding immediately to the election when business begins at 2.30pm. Candidates will each address MPs in an order selected by ballot, before MPs vote in secret. Successive ballots will be held until either a candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, or only one candidate remains. The successful candidate \u2013 who will then become the Speaker elect \u2013 will attend the lords commissioners in the House of Lords to receive royal approbation. Johnson is due to hold a \u201cworking lunch\u201d with Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday, according to the European commission. A spokeswoman said: \u201cPresident Juncker will hold a working lunch with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson. This working lunch will take place in Luxembourg.\u201d AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp reminds us that Juncker\u2019s working lunches can also be liquid lunches. Downing Street has told lobby journalists that Boris Johnson will meet EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday. The announcement is likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal, despite claims by the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that there is no grounds for optimism about a possible breakthrough. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson is reported to have been released from prison after serving nine weeks of a nine-month sentence for contempt of court. Speculation about the prospects of a new Brexit deal has boosted the value of the pound, Bloomberg reports. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the \u201cgap is very wide\u201d between the EU and the UK on Brexit. The taoiseach said he got the impression that Boris Johnson was serious about a deal following their meeting on Monday in Dublin but what the UK was talking about \u201cfalls very far short\u201d of what is required for a deal. Asked whether he trusted Johnson he said: \u201cI do, I believe when he says he wants a deal on Brexit, he is acting in good faith and our teams are in contact and we are exploring what is possible. \u201cThe gap is very wide but we will fight for and work for no no deal until the last moment, but not at any cost, and at the same time we are preparing the country for no deal if we end up in that scenario,\u201d he said. He was speaking at the Fine Gael annual think-in in Cork on Friday. Varadkar told RTE that while some customs checks could be required close to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government had yet to identify locations. Sammy Wilson has repeated his leader, Arlene Foster\u2019s line that the Times story about the DUP softening its line on an Northern Ireland only backstop is \u201cnonsense\u201d. The odds of a no-deal exit have increased over the last week despite parliament\u2019s determination to prevent such an outcome, according to the Eurasia group thinktank. Its boss Mujtaba walks us through what the group reckons is likely to happen over the next few weeks. Support for Welsh independence will soar if it meant that Wales could remain in the EU, a poll suggests. According to the YouGov poll commissioned by Plaid Cymru, 41% of those who expressed a preference would back independence if it led to Wales remaining in the EU. The poll follows rallies in Cardiff, Caernarfon and \u2013 last weekend - Merthyr Tydfil where 8,000 people marched in support of independence. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price AM said: \u201cThese are sensational figures which put support for Plaid Cymru\u2019s ambition of securing Welsh independence at a historic high. \u201cWestminster is in turmoil. Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless Tory government and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s chaotic so-called opposition are wrecking Wales\u2019s future. \u201cIt is no wonder that we are witnessing a surge in support for a new Wales \u2013 a nation proudly taking its place as an equal partner on the international stage. \u201cIndependence is moving from the margins to the mainstream. Our nation is on the march. As Boris Johnson takes us closer to the cliff edge, more and more people will demand an outward looking Wales free from Westminster\u2019s contempt.\u201d Total sample size was 1,039 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 6-10 September. The survey was carried out online. Confused about a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Here\u2019s an explainer. The Brexit party has taken control of Hartlepool borough council after forming a pact with the Conservatives overnight, dealing a significant blow to Labour in its north-east heartlands. Labour lost overall control of the council in May when its leader blamed \u201ca divided party\u201d nationally for it haemorrhaging votes in the heavily leave-voting town. Hartlepool becomes the first council under the control of the Brexit party in the UK and a boost to the party in the north-east, where Nigel Farage is fighting hard to make inroads. The Brexit party announced it had taken control of the local authority at a council meeting on Thursday night, where it revealed that nine councillors had joined the party and formed a pact with the council\u2019s three Conservatives. The Brexit party-Conservative coalition now has 13 councillors on the 32-seat council, compared with Labour\u2019s 10. Of the nine new Brexit party councillors, six sat as independents (four of whom were ex-Ukip) plus three defectors who until last night represented Ukip, Putting Hartlepool First and the Veterans and People\u2019s party respectively. One of the new Brexit party councillors, Shane Moore, said on Friday the move was about \u201csending an absolutely clear message to those nationally who would frustrate the result of the referendum\u201d. Moore, who quit Ukip last year and previously sat as a Conservative councillor, said he had no intention of joining the Brexit party until the past fortnight when MPs voted to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that in Westminster, remain parties and remain groups are clubbing together to form an alliance to put Brexit at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that, in conjunction with our Conservative colleagues, we needed to form an alliance of our own and send a very clear message to those people \u2013 and especially to the Labour party locally \u2013 that they need to stop playing games. \u201cThey need to listen and respect the result of the referendum. If they don\u2019t, a formal leave alliance should and will be formed to tackle them head-on and deliver the result.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has urged people to register to vote. As a spur he claims that Boris Johnson team have admitted they want to fix the date of the election to make it harder for people to register. Meanwhile, Momentum is launching a new digital tool for students to decide whether to vote at university or at home in an effort to drive up the Labour vote in marginal seas. Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat \u2013 home to students of Brunel University London \u2013 will be targeted by the campaign group who believe they can overturn the prime minister\u2019s 5,000-strong majority. The new tool will allow students to put in both their home and university postcodes and will indicate which location will ultimately be more advantageous to register to vote in order to enable a Labour victory. Here\u2019s some highbrow reaction to Bernard Jenkin\u2019s claim that that Speaker Bercow is leading a \u201cmajoritarian dictatorship\u201d against Brexit (see earlier). Here\u2019s more from that Sammy Wilson interview rejecting the Times report that DUP is softening its stance on the Irish backstop. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cThe Times article is totally untrue. It\u2019s an unsourced article. What it says is contrary to the position, which we have adopted throughout these negotiations. \u201cAnd it runs contrary to what the government is saying, because the government has made it quite clear that it will not accept an arrangement which has a backstop, which separates Northern Ireland out from the rest United Kingdom.\u201d But Wilson conceded that there had been \u201cdifferent attitude\u201d in the talks this week between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar. He said: We want to see a deal, the UK government wants to see a deal. And I think that as the deadline approaches, the Irish government recognise the damage to their economy if they don\u2019t try and get some arrangement with the UK, because they have a significant stake in keeping the UK market open for their exporters. We have always said that there are alternative means by which the border can be policed without creating the hard border. Asked whether the DUP was open to allowing some EU legislation to apply in Northern Ireland, Wilson said: That\u2019s something that we said to the prime minister ... that where it was appropriate and EU legislation was necessary to keep the free flow of trade across the Irish border, especially in the agrifood industry, and where it didn\u2019t damage our relationships with our biggest market in GB, then, of course, that\u2019s the kind of thing that the North Ireland assembly should be open to consider, and that would not be opposed to that kind of arrangement. But that\u2019s different from giving carte blanche to the EU and saying whatever regulations you introduced in the future will automatically apply to Northern Ireland whether they\u2019re good for Northern Ireland, or whether they damage the Northern Ireland economy. We\u2019ve all been reasonable, as far as this is concerned, because we understand that there are there are industry interests, and that there are good reasons why cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is beneficial on occasions. The senior Conservative MP and leading Brexiter Bernard Jenkin has launched an attack on John Bercow accusing him of being \u201cpartisan\u201d and holding too much power. He was responding to the Speaker\u2019s warning that parliament would use \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit in a speech which he also likened Boris Johnson to a bank robber. Jenkin told to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe office of Speaker has become irretrievably politicised and radicalised. It would have been unthinkable 10 or 15 years ago for the Speaker of the House of Commons to launch a personal attack on the prime minister like this.\u201d Jenkin called for reform of the office of Speaker and claimed that under Bercow, support for Brexit had been marginalised because it was a minority view among MPs. He said: \u201cFor one individual in now what is a contested, televised very public and controversial position to have so much unregulated, untrammelled power, is something that the House of Commons is going to have to look at ... \u201cMaybe I should ask my unconstitutional affairs committee to look at the role of Speaker because it\u2019s clearly not functioning in the way that it used to function until Mr Bercow arrived.\u201d He added: We usually have majority governments, and the Speaker of the House of Commons is there to ensure the protection of minorities. We\u2019ve got a minority government, a very partisan Speaker, and a Speaker who is using the majority and doing nothing to protect the minority. The number of leavers in the House of Commons is vastly outnumbered by the number of MPs who voted remain. And if the speakership is to become a majoritarian office like the speakership in the [US] Congress, is a very different proposition. He\u2019s not subject to any court or any \u2026 it\u2019s a kind of majoritarian dictatorship position. It would be very sensible if the Speaker is going to make a controversial decision, that should be a consensus decision amongst him and his deputies, not just a sole decision. It will be more of a collective. Jenkin also suggested Bercow had resigned as Speaker before he was pushed. He\u2019s avoided personal scrutiny of his own personal behaviour, even though he\u2019s introduced all kinds of new systems to regulate the behaviour of MPs. People have speculated that one of the reasons he\u2019s going is because finally the house has voted to look at the historic cases, which would include his own case. Sammy Wilson MP, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, has also dismissed that Times report, which claimed his party has softened its red lines on a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said it was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d. According to the Larne Times, Wilson earlier told the BBC: We will not be accepting separate arrangements for Northern Ireland that cut us off from the United Kingdom. The only different arrangements we will accept for Northern Ireland are those where the assembly has total scrutiny of any EU legislation it decides are in the interest of Northern Ireland and doesn\u2019t damage our relationship with the UK. And in those situations we will consider adopting appropriate legislation if we believe it is to the advantage of industry in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnson continues his unofficial election campaign with another trip to Labour\u2019s northern heartlands today. In a speech in Rotherham to the Convention of the North, he is expected to promise northern communities \u201ccontrol over the things that matter to them\u201d, and a new Northern Powerhouse growth body to drive the region\u2019s economy. The speech is due to start at 12.30pm, and will take questions from journalists afterwards, according to Politico\u2019s London Playbook. Meanwhile, politicians from northern England who will gather at the convention have made a joint call for more help for the region. Mayors and city leaders from Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield, along with business leaders, have set out their priorities for the north in a joint article in the Times. It said: To get this country working again, there is an urgent need to take power out of Westminster and give it to our great cities and regions. We need to build a new, healthier politics that unifies people around place and positive change and delivers practical change for citizens. The crisis over Brexit makes this a make or break moment for northern devolution. \u201cTake Back Control\u201d may have been directed at Brussels during the referendum campaign but the reality is that many people were also sending the same message to Westminster. Whilst central government has been stuck in the Brexit mire, we have used devolution to deliver for our local communities on the things that matter to them. So today we are making a new joint call on the government for action in five priority areas. Welcome to another special Friday edition of Politics Live. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has played down a report that her party is softening its opposition to a Northern Ireland-only backstop to help Boris Johnson get a new Brexit deal. The Times claimed the DUP has agreed to shift its red lines on Brexit, saying it could accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules post-Brexit as part of a new deal to replace the Irish backstop. It reported that the DUP had privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea, something it had previously said was unacceptable since it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland. In return for such concessions, Brussels would abandon its insistence on Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU, sources told the paper. But, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, insists that, as previously indicated, any moves which did make Northern Ireland different to the rest of the UK would be unacceptable to the party. In a strongly worded tweet, she suggested the story was \u201cnonsense\u201d. She said: \u201cUK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade. Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories.\u201d Meanwhile, the prime minister has been warned against breaking the law over Brexit by the Speaker John Bercow, who said parliament would use \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d to prevent no-deal exit. And the EU\u2019s chief negotiator said there was \u201cno reason to be optimistic\u201d that a new agreement can be brokered before the 31 October deadline. Michel Barnier told political leaders in the European parliament on Thursday that he was unable to say whether contacts with the UK government would result in a deal by mid-October.",

      "body": "<p>On Monday, only hours before the drama of parliament\u2019s prorogation, John Bercow announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/john-bercow-to-step-down-as-speaker-by-31-october\" title=\"\">retire as Speaker</a> before the next election. Downing Street had declared war on him in the Sunday papers, briefing that it would break convention and seek his removal from his seat at the next election. Instead, Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament, habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips, a vote on his successor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bercow\u2019s \u2018constitutional vandalism\u2019 is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An erstwhile member of the Tory hard right \u2013 in the 1980s he chaired the Federation of Conservative Students, which was notorious for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela\" title=\"\">\u201cHang Nelson Mandela\u201d literature</a> \u2013 his political journey has seen him end up an improbable poster boy for dewy-eyed liberals. Even more surprisingly, his glowering manner, gravel-voiced barking and theatrical chiding of MPs have made him an internet meme. He has presided over significant, and in some parts deeply resented, changes to parliament\u2019s functioning; the contest to replace him will be the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/next-speaker-house-of-commons-who-are-the-candidates\" title=\"\">highly politicised and bitterly fought in living memory</a>, with MPs aware that in a deadlocked Commons the Speaker\u2019s powers are profound.</p> <p>When elected, a new Speaker lays claim to \u201c<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso54.htm\" title=\"\">ancient and undoubted rights and privileges</a>\u201d of parliament, including \u201cfreedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest\u201d. Defence of those rights has been the Speaker\u2019s watchword since the tenure of William Lenthall in the 17th century. In one of the most dramatic episodes of England\u2019s descent into civil war, Lenthall had refused, to the king\u2019s face, to identify five MPs Charles I sought to arrest. The moment has entered British civic myth as the first clear assertion of the Speaker\u2019s loyalty to parliament rather than to an overmighty executive power; it is painted in fresco in Westminster.</p> <p>Lenthall\u2019s lessons for modern Speakers aren\u2019t confined to the doughty defence of parliamentary rights. His defiance was a finely tuned balancing act: courage hedged with deference to an irascible monarch. Fraught management of contending political forces made him a target of a newly free press, which gossiped of his avarice and pilloried him as a secret royalist. Bercow might recognise that.</p> <p>The Speakership is an odd institution. Its long evolution since Lenthall\u2019s day has imbued it with considerable power: to shape the debate in parliament, select amendments and interpret parliament\u2019s rules. That power comes at the cost of scrupulous political neutrality, a principle that emerged in the 18th century and which has been observed as ironclad for at least the past 100 years. In the US House of Representatives the role is highly partisan; in France and in Germany the speaker maintains an active involvement in party politics. The UK\u2019s Speaker resigns from their party and usually stands for re-election unopposed by major parties; Baroness Boothroyd, Bercow\u2019s only living predecessor, observed that a new Speaker is frequently harder on their former ideological confreres, in an attempt to achieve impartiality. Bercow\u2019s enemies in parliament \u2013 the current government and its predecessor, as well as the no-deal hardcore of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 charge him with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/17/tory-mp-launches-attempt-to-oust-john-bercow-as-speaker\" title=\"\">shattering this impartiality</a> during the long Brexit impasse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2019/sep/12/operation-yellowhammer-and-parliament-prorogued-politics-weekly-podcast\">Operation Yellowhammer and parliament prorogued - Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bercow had to change things. His election, in 2009, came after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/19/speaker-michael-martin-to-resign\" title=\"\">resignation of Michael Martin</a>, in the midst of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal. Bercow billed himself as a moderniser and \u201cbackbencher\u2019s friend\u201d \u2013 his drift towards social liberalism had left him out of favour with Tory leaders, and was disfavoured by the whips. A memo circulated to all candidates by the then clerk of legislation, Robert Rogers (now Lord Lisvane), laid out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/jun/19/commons-reform-plan-speaker\" title=\"\">75-point menu for reform</a> of the Commons; it was beyond the Speaker\u2019s scope alone to implement much of it, but it certainly inspired Bercow\u2019s expansive granting of urgent questions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/harriet-harman-vows-to-be-scrupulously-neutral-if-elected-as-speaker\" title=\"\">152 in the last year</a>, as opposed to just two in the year before his accession \u2013 allowing MPs to haul ministers to account in the Commons. Any Speaker elected in 2009 would have necessarily been a reformer: the impetus to reform came from the political establishment itself, aware that Westminster had reached a new nadir in public esteem.</p> <p>Until this parliament, it was Bercow\u2019s personality rather than his relatively modest procedural innovations that was the focus of ire. His aggressive, occasionally vaudevillian style in the chair, and his willingness to chastise ministers, led to an abortive plot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/26/tory-backbench-rebellion-defeats-hagues-attempt-to-unseat-speaker-john-bercow\" title=\"\">oust him in 2015</a>. More seriously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/john-bercow-further-bullying-claims-emerge-against-house-of-commons-speaker\" title=\"\">allegations of bullying</a> have overshadowed his office in recent years, and perhaps as a consequence he has been ineffective in acting to stem the bullying and harassment endemic in Westminster. Accusations of partiality, some rather confected, long smouldered on the Tory benches \u2013 but it is his handling of Brexit procedure that whipped them into conflagration.</p> <p>Bercow\u2019s accusers claim he has ripped up parliament\u2019s rulebook to suit his own political preferences (in 2017 he unwisely disclosed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/12/john-bercow-speaker-voted-remain-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">his own vote for remain</a>). Not only has he allowed MPs to seize control of proceedings from the government, but colluded with them by widening the scope of emergency debates to allow parliamentary insurrections. The latter is inescapably a constitutional innovation. Bercow doesn\u2019t shy away from the charge of novelty: for him, the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life \u2013 he insists on parliament\u2019s right to express its will, and on defending that right in the face of an executive determined to marginalise it. Nor is he finished yet: in last night\u2019s Bingham lecture, he vowed further \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/bercow-warns-pm-not-to-defy-law-on-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">procedural creativity</a>\u201d should Boris Johnson prove determined to ignore the law.</p> <p>The orgy of suspicion and paranoia that followed the Brexit referendum has touched many putatively impartial institutions: both press and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/brexit-kwasi-kwarteng-criticised-for-biased-judges-comment\" title=\"\">judiciary</a> are regularly accused of barely veiled remainer bias, but nowhere has been more assailed than parliament itself. It is a symptom of a deeper malaise, in which the reserves of civic trust necessary for political representation have evaporated.</p> <p>The Speaker\u2019s rulings are a consequence, not a cause, of the political impasse \u2013 the unavoidable effect of a conflict between legislature and executive eagerly pursued by successive governments. Small majorities or minority governments \u2013 as much the result of a democratic process as the referendum \u2013 find their rebels empowered; if any such government treats parliament as a truculent inconvenience, it will find MPs ready to humble it. Bercow\u2019s instinct to empower parliament is real and consistent \u2013 though he delights in making enemies \u2013 but his \u201cconstitutional vandalism\u201d is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority. Whatever the tabloids claim, this government\u2019s inability to win a vote is its fault, and its fault alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/13/progressive-alliance-win-election-labour-liberal-democrat\">An alliance between progressive parties would be fragile, but it could win an election | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The competition to replace Bercow is already under way. Some candidates, such as Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, promise a return to procedural orthodoxy: umpire-like impartiality, slavish adherence to the rulebook. Yet it is hard to see how any candidate could avoid controversy in a restive, finely balanced parliament with an executive determined to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/boris-johnson-sabotage-letter-to-eu-would-break-law\" title=\"\">test the limits of its power</a> and a legislature impatient with abuse.</p> <p>Brexit has seen the withering of many parliamentary delusions: the strictures of convention, the stability of the parties, the reliability of the \u201cgood chap\u201d theory of office. Bercow\u2019s pugnacious defence of the legislature is a boon, but he must realise that reform conducted solely through the Speaker\u2019s chair also tests democratic legitimacy; such a realisation must be behind his embrace, in last night\u2019s lecture, of a more codified constitutional settlement. As the legal case over prorogation waits to be heard by the supreme court next week, and the looming Brexit deadline leaves the government scrambling for political safety, Bercow\u2019s final act remains yet to be played. It is certain to be a stormy one.</p> <p>\u2022 James Butler is co-founder of Novara Media, and hosts its weekly radio show on Resonance FM. He writes regularly at the London Review of Books</p>",

Instead, Bercow has sought to undercut the government by giving the current parliament, habituated to autonomy and rebellion against the whips, a vote on his successor. An erstwhile member of the Tory hard right \u2013 in the 1980s he chaired the Federation of Conservative Students, which was notorious for its \u201cHang Nelson Mandela\u201d literature \u2013 his political journey has seen him end up an improbable poster boy for dewy-eyed liberals. Even more surprisingly, his glowering manner, gravel-voiced barking and theatrical chiding of MPs have made him an internet meme. He has presided over significant, and in some parts deeply resented, changes to parliament\u2019s functioning; the contest to replace him will be the most highly politicised and bitterly fought in living memory, with MPs aware that in a deadlocked Commons the Speaker\u2019s powers are profound. When elected, a new Speaker lays claim to \u201cancient and undoubted rights and privileges\u201d of parliament, including \u201cfreedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest\u201d. Defence of those rights has been the Speaker\u2019s watchword since the tenure of William Lenthall in the 17th century. In one of the most dramatic episodes of England\u2019s descent into civil war, Lenthall had refused, to the king\u2019s face, to identify five MPs Charles I sought to arrest. The moment has entered British civic myth as the first clear assertion of the Speaker\u2019s loyalty to parliament rather than to an overmighty executive power; it is painted in fresco in Westminster. Lenthall\u2019s lessons for modern Speakers aren\u2019t confined to the doughty defence of parliamentary rights. His defiance was a finely tuned balancing act: courage hedged with deference to an irascible monarch. Fraught management of contending political forces made him a target of a newly free press, which gossiped of his avarice and pilloried him as a secret royalist. Bercow might recognise that. The Speakership is an odd institution. Its long evolution since Lenthall\u2019s day has imbued it with considerable power: to shape the debate in parliament, select amendments and interpret parliament\u2019s rules. That power comes at the cost of scrupulous political neutrality, a principle that emerged in the 18th century and which has been observed as ironclad for at least the past 100 years. In the US House of Representatives the role is highly partisan; in France and in Germany the speaker maintains an active involvement in party politics. The UK\u2019s Speaker resigns from their party and usually stands for re-election unopposed by major parties; Baroness Boothroyd, Bercow\u2019s only living predecessor, observed that a new Speaker is frequently harder on their former ideological confreres, in an attempt to achieve impartiality. Bercow\u2019s enemies in parliament \u2013 the current government and its predecessor, as well as the no-deal hardcore of the European Research Group (ERG) \u2013 charge him with shattering this impartiality during the long Brexit impasse. Bercow had to change things. His election, in 2009, came after the resignation of Michael Martin, in the midst of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal. Bercow billed himself as a moderniser and \u201cbackbencher\u2019s friend\u201d \u2013 his drift towards social liberalism had left him out of favour with Tory leaders, and was disfavoured by the whips. A memo circulated to all candidates by the then clerk of legislation, Robert Rogers (now Lord Lisvane), laid out a 75-point menu for reform of the Commons; it was beyond the Speaker\u2019s scope alone to implement much of it, but it certainly inspired Bercow\u2019s expansive granting of urgent questions \u2013 152 in the last year, as opposed to just two in the year before his accession \u2013 allowing MPs to haul ministers to account in the Commons. Any Speaker elected in 2009 would have necessarily been a reformer: the impetus to reform came from the political establishment itself, aware that Westminster had reached a new nadir in public esteem. Until this parliament, it was Bercow\u2019s personality rather than his relatively modest procedural innovations that was the focus of ire. His aggressive, occasionally vaudevillian style in the chair, and his willingness to chastise ministers, led to an abortive plot to oust him in 2015. More seriously, allegations of bullying have overshadowed his office in recent years, and perhaps as a consequence he has been ineffective in acting to stem the bullying and harassment endemic in Westminster. Accusations of partiality, some rather confected, long smouldered on the Tory benches \u2013 but it is his handling of Brexit procedure that whipped them into conflagration. Bercow\u2019s accusers claim he has ripped up parliament\u2019s rulebook to suit his own political preferences (in 2017 he unwisely disclosed his own vote for remain). Not only has he allowed MPs to seize control of proceedings from the government, but colluded with them by widening the scope of emergency debates to allow parliamentary insurrections. The latter is inescapably a constitutional innovation. Bercow doesn\u2019t shy away from the charge of novelty: for him, the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life \u2013 he insists on parliament\u2019s right to express its will, and on defending that right in the face of an executive determined to marginalise it. Nor is he finished yet: in last night\u2019s Bingham lecture, he vowed further \u201cprocedural creativity\u201d should Boris Johnson prove determined to ignore the law. The orgy of suspicion and paranoia that followed the Brexit referendum has touched many putatively impartial institutions: both press and judiciary are regularly accused of barely veiled remainer bias, but nowhere has been more assailed than parliament itself. It is a symptom of a deeper malaise, in which the reserves of civic trust necessary for political representation have evaporated. The Speaker\u2019s rulings are a consequence, not a cause, of the political impasse \u2013 the unavoidable effect of a conflict between legislature and executive eagerly pursued by successive governments. Small majorities or minority governments \u2013 as much the result of a democratic process as the referendum \u2013 find their rebels empowered; if any such government treats parliament as a truculent inconvenience, it will find MPs ready to humble it. Bercow\u2019s instinct to empower parliament is real and consistent \u2013 though he delights in making enemies \u2013 but his \u201cconstitutional vandalism\u201d is unlikely to trouble any government with a majority. Whatever the tabloids claim, this government\u2019s inability to win a vote is its fault, and its fault alone. The competition to replace Bercow is already under way. Some candidates, such as Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, promise a return to procedural orthodoxy: umpire-like impartiality, slavish adherence to the rulebook. Yet it is hard to see how any candidate could avoid controversy in a restive, finely balanced parliament with an executive determined to test the limits of its power and a legislature impatient with abuse. Brexit has seen the withering of many parliamentary delusions: the strictures of convention, the stability of the parties, the reliability of the \u201cgood chap\u201d theory of office. Bercow\u2019s pugnacious defence of the legislature is a boon, but he must realise that reform conducted solely through the Speaker\u2019s chair also tests democratic legitimacy; such a realisation must be behind his embrace, in last night\u2019s lecture, of a more codified constitutional settlement. As the legal case over prorogation waits to be heard by the supreme court next week, and the looming Brexit deadline leaves the government scrambling for political safety, Bercow\u2019s final act remains yet to be played. It is certain to be a stormy one. \u2022 James Butler is co-founder of Novara Media, and hosts its weekly radio show on Resonance FM. He writes regularly at the London Review of Books",

His Lilliput is one in which strangers are welcomed in and emperors have been replaced with storytellers. I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\">the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015.</p> <p>\u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu\">Lilliput</a>\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87/0_1372_6495_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Foreman 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world. He ranges from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush</a>, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir\">Kashmir</a>. And he speaks of his first-hand experience in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\">Calais refugee camp</a>. We have turned, he says, into a \u201cnot-caring society\u201d.</p> <p>He concludes that there is no use pointing the finger at the \u201csupremely arrogant\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a>. \u201cThis is our fault,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is us. We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people. I think this thing of kindness is very important. It\u2019s thought to be sort of soft and a bit liberal to be kind. Well, no, it\u2019s not. If someone is starving in the street, you feed them.\u201d</p> <p>Morpurgo believes we\u2019ve become progressively less open-hearted in the century since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar\">first world war</a>, when Britain took in 250,000 Belgian refugees. \u201cWe were at war at the time, our backs against the wall, and I\u2019m sure there were people who moaned about it, but the government took the decision that these people needed help.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't know what it is like to be chased from our homes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By world war two, hearts had hardened. Apart from taking in nearly 10,000 mainly Jewish children, Britain left the rest \u201cto the tender mercies of these ghastly, ghastly tyrants and these fascists, when everyone who cared about these things knew what Hitler might do to the Jewish people.\u201d</p> <p>In the current crisis, it is believed that Britain hasn\u2019t taken in anywhere near the proposed 3,000 child refugees from Europe. Morpurgo detects an empathy gap arising from the fact that, unlike almost every other country on the continent, \u201cfor 1,000 years, we have never been invaded. We do not know what it is like to be chased from our homes.\u201d</p> <p>The 75-year-old also details his anger at the 210,000 homeless children in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/21/homeless-children-put-up-in-shipping-containers-report-says\">some living in shipping containers</a>. \u201cThere are still more than 2,000 children\u2019s homes in this country. Unwanted children, in a society that professes to love children. In my old age, I\u2019m thinking more and more about how appalling that is. And that\u2019s what Swift was on about. It\u2019s not good enough to go and pray in church and to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful. This is a cruel world \u2013 and it\u2019s got no better.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"932c64d8adfa5295747e8f87173069631b007cf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932c64d8adfa5295747e8f87173069631b007cf7/475_777_5424_3254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dreamed up in the pub \u2026 War Horse at the National Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dreamed up in the pub \u2026 War Horse at the National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brinkhoff/Moegenburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morpurgo\u2019s own upbringing was unconventional.

Van Bridge returned to find \u201cthere was no place for him\u201d and left the new family to get on with it. Despite this, the author was made to feel \u201cquite secure\u201d and looks at the state of modern childhood with a degree of dread.</p> <p>\u201cI think this business of being forced to grow up too quick,\u201d he says, \u201cis causing an awful lot of mental illness and difficulties. There\u2019s so much that they\u2019re having to deal with \u2013 whether it\u2019s the shape of their bodies, or things being beamed into their iPads. [Abuse] used to be shouted across the street, and then it was gone. It wasn\u2019t written down for the rest of the world to see.

I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015. \u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d The book\u2019s Brexit and Trump parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, Lilliput\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world. He ranges from the Grenfell Tower fire and Windrush, to the US-Mexico border and Kashmir. And he speaks of his first-hand experience in Gaza and the Calais refugee camp. We have turned, he says, into a \u201cnot-caring society\u201d. He concludes that there is no use pointing the finger at the \u201csupremely arrogant\u201d Boris Johnson. \u201cThis is our fault,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is us. We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people. I think this thing of kindness is very important. It\u2019s thought to be sort of soft and a bit liberal to be kind. Well, no, it\u2019s not. If someone is starving in the street, you feed them.\u201d Morpurgo believes we\u2019ve become progressively less open-hearted in the century since the first world war, when Britain took in 250,000 Belgian refugees. \u201cWe were at war at the time, our backs against the wall, and I\u2019m sure there were people who moaned about it, but the government took the decision that these people needed help.\u201d By world war two, hearts had hardened. Apart from taking in nearly 10,000 mainly Jewish children, Britain left the rest \u201cto the tender mercies of these ghastly, ghastly tyrants and these fascists, when everyone who cared about these things knew what Hitler might do to the Jewish people.\u201d In the current crisis, it is believed that Britain hasn\u2019t taken in anywhere near the proposed 3,000 child refugees from Europe. Morpurgo detects an empathy gap arising from the fact that, unlike almost every other country on the continent, \u201cfor 1,000 years, we have never been invaded. We do not know what it is like to be chased from our homes.\u201d The 75-year-old also details his anger at the 210,000 homeless children in the UK, some living in shipping containers. \u201cThere are still more than 2,000 children\u2019s homes in this country. Unwanted children, in a society that professes to love children. In my old age, I\u2019m thinking more and more about how appalling that is. And that\u2019s what Swift was on about. It\u2019s not good enough to go and pray in church and to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful. This is a cruel world \u2013 and it\u2019s got no better.\u201d Morpurgo\u2019s own upbringing was unconventional. While his father, actor Tony van Bridge, was stationed in Baghdad during the war, his mother fell in love with another man, Jack Morpurgo. Van Bridge returned to find \u201cthere was no place for him\u201d and left the new family to get on with it. Despite this, the author was made to feel \u201cquite secure\u201d and looks at the state of modern childhood with a degree of dread. \u201cI think this business of being forced to grow up too quick,\u201d he says, \u201cis causing an awful lot of mental illness and difficulties. There\u2019s so much that they\u2019re having to deal with \u2013 whether it\u2019s the shape of their bodies, or things being beamed into their iPads. [Abuse] used to be shouted across the street, and then it was gone. It wasn\u2019t written down for the rest of the world to see. By and large, the adults could protect you from the worst of what was out there.\u201d Morpurgo, who failed his 11-plus and scraped a third-class degree, ended up at Sandhurst military academy, fuelled by praise for his \u201cleadership qualities\u201d, his \u201csimplistic ideas of duty\u201d and his love of a uniform. After marrying Clare at 19 \u2013 she is the daughter of Penguin books founder Allen Lane who sent his son-in-law\u2019s handwriting to a graphologist, in the hope of proving he was a gold-digger \u2013 Morpurgo decided he believed in peace more than war and began teaching. A frequent critic of the education policies of successive governments, he says if he were education secretary he would have children start formal learning at seven, eradicate exam pressure and have universal state education for all; private schools, he says, could be turned into specialist sixth-form colleges. It was in front of the fire in the pub in which we\u2019re sitting that Morpurgo dreamed up War Horse, after a conversation with a veteran of the trenches. \u201cWhen I wrote the book, Clare loved it immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s never said anything was better, which is slightly annoying.\u201d However, it was three decades after publication before Hollywood made miraculous horse Joey world famous. Morpurgo had spent years insisting on picking up every phone call, quipping: \u201cIt might be Steven Spielberg.\u201d However, he concedes that after the director did finally call, the 2011 film that resulted \u201cwas not as great as I\u2019d wanted it to be\u201d. In 1982, War Horse failed to win the Whitbread prize for which it was nominated, with chairman of the judges Roald Dahl advising Morpurgo: \u201cIt\u2019s a good book, but children don\u2019t like history.\u201d His neighbour, the poet Ted Hughes, took his crestfallen friend out for a consolatory tea in the Devon town of Bideford. \u201cWinning is just as damaging to you as losing,\u201d Hughes told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve written a fine book and you\u2019ll write a finer one.\u201d Does Morpurgo think he has? He winces, then smiles. \u201cEvery time.\u201d \u2022 Boy Giant: Son of Gulliver by Michael Morpurgo is published by HarperCollins on 19 September.",
