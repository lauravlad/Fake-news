The new measure was passed by a hefty 41-vote majority, after a day of drama in Westminster which saw the resignation of one minister and abstentions from four rebellious cabinet ministers, who will soon be on the backbenches, as well as half a dozen others. Among ministers who defied the whip and did not vote on the complex backbench amendment were the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the justice secretary, David Gauke; the business secretary, Greg Clark; and Rory Stewart, the international development secretary.

The chancellor thinks that despite change at No 10, opposition in parliament means there is no more chance of a no-deal Brexit than there was before Theresa May announced she was stepping down. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, was also absent from the voting lists, and later admitted that he did so by accident after wrongly thinking he had been excused. Margot James, the digital industries minister, quit her job to vote in favour of the amendment from Hilary Benn and Alistair Burt attached to a bill about Northern Irish affairs, but there was no action taken against Hammond and the other frontbench abstainers. May\u2019s spokesman said she was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d at the abstentions, but that it was now up to Johnson or Hunt to decide what to do with rebellious ministers once one of them becomes leader. \u201cNo doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government,\u201d a Downing Street spokesman said, in a coded warning both to ministers about their futures, and to Johnson about the state of the rebellious parliament he is set to inherit. Should Johnson win the Tory leadership contest and become prime minister, ministers are likely to pre-emptively walk out, forming an instant and influential Conservative bloc opposing no-deal Brexit \u2013 one towards which other Tories, perhaps even May, might gravitate. Among the 17 Conservatives who backed the amendment on Thursday was Tory veteran Keith Simpson, who said it was the first time he had defied party whips during 22 years in parliament. \u201cThis is a huge national issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no-deal. So this is the first time I have rebelled but you can get a taste for it.\u201d The success of the amendment by 315 votes to 274 also presents any Johnson government with a very practical obstacle, as well as serving as an example of the ingenuity of backbench rebels in thwarting his Brexit plans. While Johnson has said he is not overly keen on the idea of proroguing, or suspending parliament to prevent MPs blocking an overt no-deal policy, he has pointedly refused to rule this out. The amendment now makes this markedly more difficult, building on a series of amendments in the Commons and Lords to dictate that ministers must report regularly to the Commons up to and beyond the Brexit deadline. The host bill is a largely technical measure connected to elections and budgets for the long-suspended Northern Ireland government, and an initial attempt by Conservative remainer Dominic Grieve to attach an explicitly prorogation-blocking amendment was quashed by the Speaker, John Bercow. Bercow did, however, allow another Grieve-tabled amendment, requiring a minister to report to the Commons every two weeks until December on the progress of talks on restoring the Northern Ireland assembly, which was passed last week by a single vote. This was beefed-up by further amendments in the House of Lords. On Wednesday, peers added the condition that the fortnightly reports must be debated in the Commons. When the Lords amendments returned to the Commons, Bercow accepted the Benn-Burt amendment which then made explicit the requirement for the chamber to sit if it had been prorogued. While the combined amendment does make prorogation difficult, a no-deal departure is still the default option on the Brexit deadline of 31 October unless Johnson or Hunt are able to swiftly conclude a new departure deal, something the EU has dismissed as extremely unlikely. The vote came on the day the government\u2019s independent forecasting body predicted a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5% and send house prices tumbling by around 10%. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the result would be a year-long downturn that would increase borrowing by \u00a330bn a year, prompting a fresh warning from Hammond to MPs backing no-deal Brexit. After her resignation, James said the majority for the amendment had been emphatic because of the concerns of so many ministers and ex-ministers who rebelled or abstained. She hinted more resignations could follow if Johnson was confirmed as leader next Tuesday. \u201cI think we have to wait and see what happens next. Jeremy Hunt would behave in an appropriate way, he does not believe in proroguing parliament, which is just too extreme, so I don\u2019t expect people to resign until they know for sure what the outcome is next week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is difficult for anyone to resign, yes, and very difficult for me.

That is the responsibility of the National Executive Committee (NEC), of which the leader is only one member. Discipline is the responsibility of the National Constitutional Committee (NCC), and Jeremy is not part of this at all. The party\u2019s rules are not imposed, dictated by or changed by the leader.</p> <p>After a period when the governance unit was under-resourced, and the NEC singularly failed to address the problem, and ignored recommendations which would have helped, contrary to the peers\u2019 view, the party structures in relation to complaints have been strengthened in the last year. The NCC has been expanded, legal representation increased. In February, general secretary Jennie Formby reported that since April 2018 the party had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47203397\" title=\"\">investigated 673 complaints against members and gave details of progress</a>. It would be helpful for Formby\u2019s deputy now to give an update so we can see exactly what has been done to address the party\u2019s antisemitism problem, and what remains to be done.<br><strong>Phil Tate</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 It was a famous Jewish singer, Bob Dylan, who coined the lyric \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t talk, it swears\u201d, which seems quite apt for the minority of Labour peers who have paid for an advert to subvert the democratically expressed wishes of Labour members who have twice voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party.</p> <p>In those leadership elections of 2015 and 2016, thousands of Labour members \u2013 overwhelmingly Corbyn supporters \u2013 many with decades of commitment to the party, and including a significant number of Jews, were told they were definitely unwelcome in the most brutal way, when they were summarily suspended and excluded from participating in those elections with little or no explanation.</p> <p>I know the toll that had on individuals, whose reputations, social networks and self-esteem were seriously damaged overnight by unfounded allegations or none at all. Who was overseeing that process? Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary until 2018, who is one of the signatories of this advert.</p> <p>As an elected officer of my constituency Labour party I have never felt at all unwelcome as a Jew in the party, where I am surrounded by people who have fought racism and bigotry all their lives, including other Jews. The worst I have felt is great embarrassment at the reactionary interventions and policy positions put forward by some of the same Labour peers who signed that advert, such as Peter Mandelson, John Reid and Michael Levy.<br><strong>David Rosenberg</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Full-page Guardian adverts won\u2019t come cheap, of course, even between 67 people. I find myself asking why they\u2019ve done it? I note the names like Mandelson in there, whose hostility to Corbyn is very well documented, but it does appear to me that people who have never accepted Corbyn as leader of the party have now decided that losing a possible forthcoming general election to the Tories is a price worth paying to rid the party of him. Interesting to note, too, that Donald Trump is now using the same kind of language against \u201cthe squad\u201d of four female Democrats, that they too are antisemitic. The 67 Labour peers now find themselves sharing the same kind of ideology that Trump does. I also find that disheartening, and unsurprising, sadly.<br><strong>John Holroyd</strong><br><em>Thornhill, Dumfries</em></p> <p>\u2022 With Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s swift action in sacking his Brexit spokesperson in the Lords (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/17/labour-shadow-brexit-minister-sacked-over-corbyn-comments\" title=\"\">Corbyn sacks senior peer over \u2018Hitler bunker\u2019 remark</a>, 18 July), I hope the 67 fellow Labour peers who attacked Mr Corbyn in an advert in the Guardian on 17 July for not taking leadership on controversial comments by Labour members will be happy that they have had a quick impact.<br><strong>Dr David Lowry</strong><br><em>Stoneleigh, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 I actually drew some limited comfort from reading the names of former Commons colleagues \u2013 now peers \u2013 in their advert attacking the conduct of the party leader. I had genuinely been under the impression that several of them were dead.<br><strong>David Hinchliffe</strong><br><em>Labour MP for Wakefield, 1987-2005</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Labour peers who signed an advert in Wednesday\u2019s Guardian would be most welcome to come to our constituency Labour party and explain to the many Jewish members, including our immediate past chair, why they are apparently no longer welcome in the party.<br><strong>Professor Emeritus Nick Spencer</strong><br><em>Leamington Spa, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/14/labour-positive-change-faction-fighting-antisemitism-brexit\" title=\"\">Labour can effect positive change despite its discord</a>, 15 July) seems to have let his enthusiasm for linking anti-imperialism and antisemitism run away with him. In particular he tries to show a connection between Jeremy Corbyn, some of his advisers and the political forces who \u201ceventually formed the deeply inconsistent and compromised Stop the War coalition\u201d.</p> <p>We have always been consistent in opposing our government\u2019s military interventions, and \u2013 far from being compromised \u2013 the Chilcot inquiry vindicated our criticisms, as do the continued failed wars from Libya to Afghanistan. We opposed bombing by Russia in Syria, but argued that intervention by the US and UK would lead to further misery for ordinary Syrians. We currently oppose Trump\u2019s dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran.</p> <p>The latest attempt to blame the left for antisemitism is turning reality on its head. Those fighting imperialism have long been champions of anti-racism, including antisemitism, and we are proud that some of those most able and consistent at doing so have been Jewish. <br><strong>Lindsey German</strong><br><em>Conven</em><em>er, Stop the War Coalition</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is no doubt that there is antisemitism in the Labour party, as everywhere, and it has been badly handled, not least by its equivocating leader, but I would like to ask MPs who have submitted dossiers of complaints just how many turned out to be members of the party, and how many were vile, troublemaking trolls?

      "bodyText": "The advertisement from Labour peers (Peers tell Corbyn he has \u2018failed test of leadership\u2019, 17 July) does a fine job in spelling out accusations against Jeremy Corbyn (saying he is \u201cpresiding over the most shaming period in Labour\u2019s history\u201d shows peers still in denial over Iraq, never mind 1931), but unhelpfully they say nothing about what should be done next. Labour leaders, Jeremy Corbyn included, are not responsible for enforcing the rules and constitution of the party. That is the responsibility of the National Executive Committee (NEC), of which the leader is only one member. Discipline is the responsibility of the National Constitutional Committee (NCC), and Jeremy is not part of this at all. The party\u2019s rules are not imposed, dictated by or changed by the leader. After a period when the governance unit was under-resourced, and the NEC singularly failed to address the problem, and ignored recommendations which would have helped, contrary to the peers\u2019 view, the party structures in relation to complaints have been strengthened in the last year. The NCC has been expanded, legal representation increased. In February, general secretary Jennie Formby reported that since April 2018 the party had investigated 673 complaints against members and gave details of progress. It would be helpful for Formby\u2019s deputy now to give an update so we can see exactly what has been done to address the party\u2019s antisemitism problem, and what remains to be done. Phil Tate Edinburgh \u2022 It was a famous Jewish singer, Bob Dylan, who coined the lyric \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t talk, it swears\u201d, which seems quite apt for the minority of Labour peers who have paid for an advert to subvert the democratically expressed wishes of Labour members who have twice voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn to lead the party. In those leadership elections of 2015 and 2016, thousands of Labour members \u2013 overwhelmingly Corbyn supporters \u2013 many with decades of commitment to the party, and including a significant number of Jews, were told they were definitely unwelcome in the most brutal way, when they were summarily suspended and excluded from participating in those elections with little or no explanation. I know the toll that had on individuals, whose reputations, social networks and self-esteem were seriously damaged overnight by unfounded allegations or none at all. Who was overseeing that process? Iain McNicol, the party\u2019s general secretary until 2018, who is one of the signatories of this advert. As an elected officer of my constituency Labour party I have never felt at all unwelcome as a Jew in the party, where I am surrounded by people who have fought racism and bigotry all their lives, including other Jews. The worst I have felt is great embarrassment at the reactionary interventions and policy positions put forward by some of the same Labour peers who signed that advert, such as Peter Mandelson, John Reid and Michael Levy. David Rosenberg London \u2022 Full-page Guardian adverts won\u2019t come cheap, of course, even between 67 people. I find myself asking why they\u2019ve done it? I note the names like Mandelson in there, whose hostility to Corbyn is very well documented, but it does appear to me that people who have never accepted Corbyn as leader of the party have now decided that losing a possible forthcoming general election to the Tories is a price worth paying to rid the party of him. Interesting to note, too, that Donald Trump is now using the same kind of language against \u201cthe squad\u201d of four female Democrats, that they too are antisemitic. The 67 Labour peers now find themselves sharing the same kind of ideology that Trump does. I also find that disheartening, and unsurprising, sadly. John Holroyd Thornhill, Dumfries \u2022 With Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s swift action in sacking his Brexit spokesperson in the Lords (Corbyn sacks senior peer over \u2018Hitler bunker\u2019 remark, 18 July), I hope the 67 fellow Labour peers who attacked Mr Corbyn in an advert in the Guardian on 17 July for not taking leadership on controversial comments by Labour members will be happy that they have had a quick impact. Dr David Lowry Stoneleigh, Surrey \u2022 I actually drew some limited comfort from reading the names of former Commons colleagues \u2013 now peers \u2013 in their advert attacking the conduct of the party leader. I had genuinely been under the impression that several of them were dead. David Hinchliffe Labour MP for Wakefield, 1987-2005 \u2022 The Labour peers who signed an advert in Wednesday\u2019s Guardian would be most welcome to come to our constituency Labour party and explain to the many Jewish members, including our immediate past chair, why they are apparently no longer welcome in the party. Professor Emeritus Nick Spencer Leamington Spa, Warwickshire \u2022 John Harris (Labour can effect positive change despite its discord, 15 July) seems to have let his enthusiasm for linking anti-imperialism and antisemitism run away with him. In particular he tries to show a connection between Jeremy Corbyn, some of his advisers and the political forces who \u201ceventually formed the deeply inconsistent and compromised Stop the War coalition\u201d. We have always been consistent in opposing our government\u2019s military interventions, and \u2013 far from being compromised \u2013 the Chilcot inquiry vindicated our criticisms, as do the continued failed wars from Libya to Afghanistan. We opposed bombing by Russia in Syria, but argued that intervention by the US and UK would lead to further misery for ordinary Syrians. We currently oppose Trump\u2019s dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran. The latest attempt to blame the left for antisemitism is turning reality on its head. Those fighting imperialism have long been champions of anti-racism, including antisemitism, and we are proud that some of those most able and consistent at doing so have been Jewish. Lindsey German Convener, Stop the War Coalition \u2022 There is no doubt that there is antisemitism in the Labour party, as everywhere, and it has been badly handled, not least by its equivocating leader, but I would like to ask MPs who have submitted dossiers of complaints just how many turned out to be members of the party, and how many were vile, troublemaking trolls? Figures from the party state, for instance, that the 200 examples submitted by Margaret Hodge concerned 111 people, 91 of whom turned out not to be Labour party members. Reportedly, 1,100 complaints were lodged between April 2018 and January 2019, but 433 (nearly 40%) were found to relate to people who weren\u2019t Labour members. If the figures have been exaggerated, they have unnecessarily alarmed the Jewish population and made the Labour party seem far more antisemitic than it really is. I therefore hope that the current EHRC investigation publishes some figures on actual membership involvement as against vile social media trolling.

My constituents voted to leave in Stourbridge by 70 percent, so I\u2019ve honoured that commitment, voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal three times, but when that didn\u2019t get through parliament I became more and more worried that there is the potential to crash out with no-deal at the end of October. The fact that Boris Johnson - and he hasn\u2019t won yet by the way but obviously he may - is not ruling out proroguing parliament, I felt that this time that rather than just abstain I would vote for the amendments that will make it more difficult ...</p> \n   <p>I think a lot of people would be prepared to serve under Jeremy Hunt if he gets in. If we do end up with Boris as our prime minister, then I think quite a number of people who would have always been voting with the government will leave the government and will be doing everything they can with myself and others to make sure we leave with a deal, or we carry on negotiating or we look for another outcome.</p> \n   <p>You have to remember that democracy isn\u2019t just about the majority wins and has everything its way \u2013 especially when the minority is as big as 48%, and also when a majority actually voted to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. So I think we have to treat the minority with more respect than proroguing parliament and clearing off without a deal \u2013 leaving us very exposed as an economy and a society and reliant on the United States at a very bad time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20e1c5f3e6f8c64f4f8dee5f1a3e4a82bf1427d8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e1c5f3e6f8c64f4f8dee5f1a3e4a82bf1427d8/129_481_3573_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot James,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot James,</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3081818f08cf92bb7725cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T14:28:38.658Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As my colleagues<strong> Peter Walker </strong>and <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/mps-pass-amendment-seeking-to-thwart-no-deal-prorogation\">in their story on the prorogation vote,</a> the 17 Tory rebels included<strong> Keith Simpson</strong>, who was voting against his party for the first time in his long career as an MP.

This afternoon\u2019s vote relating to a no-deal Brexit is important, but probably not decisive. Here are some thought on what it means.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Boris Johnson has suffered his first Commons defeat - before even becoming prime minister. </strong>Jeremy Hunt, his rival for the Tory leadership, has ruled out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, but Johnson pointedly hasn\u2019t. Over the last two days peers and MPs have voted to tie his hands on this point. Coming after the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington in response to comments from Johnson, this is fresh evidence that the Westminster machine already regards him as PM.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) This vote probably means proroguing parliament in the autumn to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit is now closed as an option for Johnson.</strong> The Benn amendment says, if parliament were prorogued or adjourned in this timescale, it would have to be recalled. But a tiny window of uncertainty remains because a) if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland were to revive, the Benn amendment would become redundant; and b) there is always the faint chance of a rogue PM trying to ignore this law.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Stopping parliament being prorogued is not the same as stopping a no-deal Brexit. </strong>It remains the case that, if Johnson were to opt for a no-deal Brexit<strong>, </strong>MPs sitting in the Commons in September or October would have no obvious means of stopping him. <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/new-prime-minister-intent-no-deal-brexit-cant-be-stopped-mps-0?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInfiqy7--4wIVgrHtCh32cAe9EAAYASAAEgKtN_D_BwE\">An <strong>Institute for Government </strong>report</a> said, under the rules as they are now, it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for MPs to stop no-deal without using a no confidence vote to bring down the government. Even if Johnson did lose a no confidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2dce148f0845f89e30e24e#block-5d2dce148f0845f89e30e24e\">there is no guarantee he would pause Brexit to allow the electorate to have its say.</a> But the IfG report also says the situation might be different if the Speaker were to be more \u201cflexible\u201d in his interpretation of Commons procedure, and John Bercow has repeatedly hinted that he would be willing to bend the rules to help MPs vote against no-deal (as he did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/20/brexit-latest-news-letter-article-50-extension-pmqs-theresa-may-bends-to-pressure-from-tory-brexiters-and-rules-out-asking-for-long-article-extension-politics-live?page=with:block-5c9218cce4b0480f6c022620#block-5c9218cce4b0480f6c022620\">here, </a>referring to standing order 24).</p> \n  <p><strong>4) But Tory opposition to no-deal is looking a bit more robust this afternoon than it was. </strong>As I mentioned this morning, in recent weeks MPs trying to use parliamentary process to block no-deal have suffered a series of defeats. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/18/brexit-latest-newst-commons-vote-no-deal-gauke-hints-he-may-rebel-ahead-of-knife-edge-vote-intended-to-stop-no-deal-prorogation-live-news?page=with:block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5#block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5\"> 9.09am.) </a>Today they won a handsome victory. Some 17 Conservative MPs voted against the government, and five ministers seem to have abstained deliberately; by this time next week those five will probably be on the back benches, making a \u201cGauke-ward squad\u201d of 20-plus. If Johnson sacks more ministers in a reshuffle, that could get even bigger. Most of these MPs would probably not vote against the government on no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit, but with the government\u2019s working majority set to fall to just three after the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, the rebels probably have enough muscle to bring Johnson down.</p> \n  <p><strong>5) An early election looks ever more likely. </strong>Johnson would want to avoid an early election until he has delivered Brexit, but these numbers mean that he might not be left with any choice. Here is an assessment from <strong>Mujtaba Rahman</strong>, who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1151771425818185728\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our revised, short term <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> probabilities:-<br><br>40% Early election* (basecase); <br>25% No-deal; <br>20% Tweaked deal*; <br>10% Referendum*; <br>5% Other scenarios - clean A50 extension, no strings attached; caretaker Govt*; revoking A50; proroguing Parliament <br><br>*Accompanied w A50 ext <a href=\"https://t.co/FIKHl4ygGp\">pic.twitter.com/FIKHl4ygGp</a></p>\u2014 Mujtaba Rahman (@Mij_Europe) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mij_Europe/status/1151771425818185728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T14:36:31.815Z\">at 3.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3073d38f08d0b6ca533196\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T13:35:15.056Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">May refuses to punish ministers who abstained - but suggests her successor will sack them</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has put out this statement about the vote.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt - a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiters. They are talking about a much harder version, which would cause much more disruption to our economy. And the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. </p> \n   <p>So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his press conference <strong>Robert Chote,</strong> the head of the OBR, explained the difference between the more benign no-deal that on which the OBR stress test was based, and a more disruptive no-deal. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve looked at the fiscal implications of the less severe of the two no-deal, no-transition scenarios set out by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook. This scenario is not necessarily the most likely outcome, and it is relatively benign compared to some, for example, assuming no major short-term border disruptions.

He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And then the first time I saw public utterances by David Davis and I saw him not coming [to Brussels], not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere I thought: \u2018Oh my God, they haven\u2019t got a plan, they haven\u2019t got a plan\u2019.</p> \n   <p>That was really shocking frankly, because the damage if you don\u2019t have a plan \u2014 you know, we see it \u2014 time\u2019s running out and you don\u2019t have a plan, it\u2019s like Lance Corporal Jones \u2014 you know, \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic\u2019, running around like idiots.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Lord Callanan,</strong> a Brexit minister, has responded with his own Dad\u2019s Army quote, my colleague <strong>Jennifer Rankin</strong> reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1151770853752922113\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brexit war of words via Dad's Army lines.<br><br>Bx minister Callanan responds to Timmermans \"running around like idiots\u201d comments.<br><br>\"If he was such a big fan of Dad\u2019s army he would know the riposte from Captain Mainwaring to such comments: \u2019stupid boy\u2019\"</p>\u2014 Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/1151770853752922113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb0eeb735b9e184f7b62c7b43e38f2817ed8c77\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb0eeb735b9e184f7b62c7b43e38f2817ed8c77/0_128_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European commission\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European commission</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3030a58f0845f89e30f618\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:45:00.353Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">No-deal Brexit would trigger a recession, says OBR</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is an extract from what <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscalrisksreport2019.pdf\">the OBR report</a> says about a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In Chapter 10 we carry out a fiscal \u2018stress test\u2019 that quantifies the impact on the public finances of a particular no-deal, no-transition Brexit scenario, namely the less disruptive of the two presented by the IMF in its April 2019 World Economic Outlook. While it is a scenario, rather than a forecast, it is nevertheless useful for exploring the channels through which the public finances might respond in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>Heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on exports. Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply. Real GDP falls by 2% by the end of 2020 and is 4% below our March forecast by that point. Higher trade barriers also slow growth in potential productivity, while lower net inward migration reduces labour force growth, so potential output is lower than the baseline throughout the scenario (and beyond). The imposition of tariffs and the sterling depreciation raise inflation and squeeze real household incomes, but the monetary policy committee is able to cut bank rate to support demand, helping to bring output back towards potential and inflation back towards target. </p> \n   <p>Borrowing is around \u00a330bn a year higher than our March forecast from 2020-21 onwards. Lower receipts \u2013 in particular income tax and NICs (due to the recession) and capital taxes (due to weaker asset prices) \u2013 explain most of the deterioration. These are partly offset by lower debt interest spending (thanks to lower interest rates and RPI inflation) and the revenue raised customs duties (which are treated as EU rather than UK taxes in the baseline). Higher borrowing and the assumed rollover of Term Funding Scheme loans leave public sector net debt around 12% of GDP higher than our March forecast by 2023-24.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The OBR also says this stress test is \u201cby no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal, no-transition Brexit\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d302fea8f0845f89e30f615\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:38:21.947Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 300-page Fiscal Risks Report is <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Fiscalrisksreport2019.pdf\">here (pdf).</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d302f298f08d0b6ca532dc9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:36:46.208Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">OBR warns no-deal Brexit could leave \u00a330bn hole in public finances</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Graeme Wearden </strong>is covering the publication of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Fiscal Risks Report on his business live blog here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-uk-recession-obr-fiscal-risks-retail-sales-business-live\">No-deal Brexit 'would send UK into recession', forecasters fear - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>The blog also has a link to a live feed from the OBR\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <p>This is from Sky\u2019s <strong>Ed Conway.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1151771506667638786\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OBR_UK</a> warns that a no deal Brexit could cause leave a \u00a330bn hole in the public finances</p>\u2014 Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1151771506667638786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d3020838f0845f89e30f5a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-18T08:09:25.830Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gauke hints he may rebel ahead of knife-edge vote intended to stop no-deal prorogation</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>MPs trying to use parliamentary votes to stop a no-deal Brexit have not had much luck recently. Last month <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48613921\">the government comfortably defeated a Labour attempt to allow backbenchers to take control of the Commons timetable </a>which, if passed, might have allowed a bill opposing no-deal to be passed. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/09/theresa-may-stands-by-uk-ambassador-in-wake-of-trump-criticism-politics-live?page=with:block-5d247afb8f08cf92bb76c443#block-5d247afb8f08cf92bb76c443\">the Speaker refused to call a Dominic Grieve amendment that would definitely prevented the next prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. </a>Grieve also lost votes on two other related amendments. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/09/theresa-may-stands-by-uk-ambassador-in-wake-of-trump-criticism-politics-live?page=with:block-5d24df2a8f08cf92bb76c9b7#block-5d24df2a8f08cf92bb76c9b7\">he did win a vote on a move saying the government would have to publish fortnightly reports in the autumn on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland.</a> He acknowledged that this on its own would not necessarily stop an autumn prorogation, but he said he hoped peers would beef it up in the Lords. But even this relatively anaemic amendment only passed by one vote, and that was just because <a href=\"https://www.buryfreepress.co.uk/news/jo-churchill-mp-forgot-to-cast-vote-on-key-no-deal-brexit-amendment-9076209/\">a government whip, Jo Churchill, forgot to cast her vote.</a></p> \n  <p>Last night the House of Lords did beef up the original Grieve proposal, by passing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f422e8f08d0b6ca5327db#block-5d2f422e8f08d0b6ca5327db\">an amendment saying there would have to be debates on those fortnightly reports mandated by Grieve. </a>Whether this would stop a new PM proroguing parliament is a matter of debate, but at the very least it would provide stronger legal grounds for a court challenge against a decision to prorogue.</p> \n  <p>Today the government will try to reverse that decision in the Commons.

      "bodyText": "MPs have easily passed a backbench amendment seeking to block any attempt by a future government to prorogue parliament to ensure a no-deal Brexit, in what is likely to be seen as a pre-emptive strike against Boris Johnson\u2019s authority. A no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5% and send house prices tumbling by around 10%, according to the government\u2019s independent forecasting body. Claims by Boris Johnson that regulations imposed by \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d were damaging the trade in kippers have been debunked by the European commission, which said that the food safety obligations criticised by him were due to rules set by Britain. Boris Johnson could be the UK\u2019s last prime minister, Gordon Brown has warned, after the Conservative leadership frontrunner met Scottish MPs to reassure them of his desire to bolster the union. Jeremy Corbyn faces a new front of internal dissent over his handling of antisemitism in the party, with Labour peers potentially set to hold a vote of no-confidence in him next week, it has emerged. Conservative former ministers and human rights groups have accused the government of failing to outlaw torture as it published fresh guidance on the treatment of detainees abroad and refused to launch a judge-led inquiry into post-9/11 rendition cases. Leading British politicians including Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan are among thousands of people who have signed a letter of support f the four US congresswomen of colour who were targeted by Donald Trump in a series of racist tweets this week. The mayors of London, Greater Manchester and other English cities have written to the government urging faster implementation of \u201cdesperately needed\u201d changes to gender recognition legislation. Civil servants working for the Department for Exiting the European Union have been awarded nearly \u00a31.3m in bonuses, new figures show. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Rafael Behr on what today\u2019s vote means. And this is how his column starts. It is a measure of how far British politics has passed through the looking glass that MPs feel compelled to put in law that prime ministers should govern with the consent of parliament. There was a time, not too long ago, when that sort of thing was understood as a convention underpinning democracy. The imminent arrival of Boris Johnson in Downing Street has made it prudent to get implicit constitutional principles down in writing. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been explaining why he did not vote with the government against the Hilary Benn amendment intended to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Newsnight Margot James, who resigned as a culture minister today so that she could vote against the government for the anti-prorogation amendment, said \u201cquite a number\u201d of ministers would leave the government if Boris Johnson becomes PM and join the campaign to block a no-deal Brexit. She said Over the course of the last few months I\u2019ve been increasingly uncomfortable about the way the rhetoric is developing on Brexit. My constituents voted to leave in Stourbridge by 70 percent, so I\u2019ve honoured that commitment, voted for the prime minister\u2019s deal three times, but when that didn\u2019t get through parliament I became more and more worried that there is the potential to crash out with no-deal at the end of October. The fact that Boris Johnson - and he hasn\u2019t won yet by the way but obviously he may - is not ruling out proroguing parliament, I felt that this time that rather than just abstain I would vote for the amendments that will make it more difficult ... I think a lot of people would be prepared to serve under Jeremy Hunt if he gets in. If we do end up with Boris as our prime minister, then I think quite a number of people who would have always been voting with the government will leave the government and will be doing everything they can with myself and others to make sure we leave with a deal, or we carry on negotiating or we look for another outcome. You have to remember that democracy isn\u2019t just about the majority wins and has everything its way \u2013 especially when the minority is as big as 48%, and also when a majority actually voted to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. So I think we have to treat the minority with more respect than proroguing parliament and clearing off without a deal \u2013 leaving us very exposed as an economy and a society and reliant on the United States at a very bad time. As my colleagues Peter Walker and Jessica Elgot report in their story on the prorogation vote, the 17 Tory rebels included Keith Simpson, who was voting against his party for the first time in his long career as an MP. Simpson said: This is the first time I have rebelled against my party in 22 years in parliament. This is a huge national issue, I said months ago to my local paper and my association that I was totally against no deal. So this is the first time I have rebelled but you can get a taste for it. The Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has apologised after revealing that he missed today\u2019s vote by accident. He would have voted with the government, he says. Votes in the House of Commons can have legislative consequences and political consequences, and sometimes it is not entirely obvious what either of them will be. This afternoon\u2019s vote relating to a no-deal Brexit is important, but probably not decisive. Here are some thought on what it means. 1) Boris Johnson has suffered his first Commons defeat - before even becoming prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, his rival for the Tory leadership, has ruled out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, but Johnson pointedly hasn\u2019t. Over the last two days peers and MPs have voted to tie his hands on this point. Coming after the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington in response to comments from Johnson, this is fresh evidence that the Westminster machine already regards him as PM. 2) This vote probably means proroguing parliament in the autumn to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit is now closed as an option for Johnson. The Benn amendment says, if parliament were prorogued or adjourned in this timescale, it would have to be recalled. But a tiny window of uncertainty remains because a) if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland were to revive, the Benn amendment would become redundant; and b) there is always the faint chance of a rogue PM trying to ignore this law. 3) Stopping parliament being prorogued is not the same as stopping a no-deal Brexit. It remains the case that, if Johnson were to opt for a no-deal Brexit, MPs sitting in the Commons in September or October would have no obvious means of stopping him. An Institute for Government report said, under the rules as they are now, it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d for MPs to stop no-deal without using a no confidence vote to bring down the government. Even if Johnson did lose a no confidence, there is no guarantee he would pause Brexit to allow the electorate to have its say. But the IfG report also says the situation might be different if the Speaker were to be more \u201cflexible\u201d in his interpretation of Commons procedure, and John Bercow has repeatedly hinted that he would be willing to bend the rules to help MPs vote against no-deal (as he did here, referring to standing order 24). 4) But Tory opposition to no-deal is looking a bit more robust this afternoon than it was. As I mentioned this morning, in recent weeks MPs trying to use parliamentary process to block no-deal have suffered a series of defeats. (See 9.09am.) Today they won a handsome victory. Some 17 Conservative MPs voted against the government, and five ministers seem to have abstained deliberately; by this time next week those five will probably be on the back benches, making a \u201cGauke-ward squad\u201d of 20-plus. If Johnson sacks more ministers in a reshuffle, that could get even bigger. Most of these MPs would probably not vote against the government on no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit, but with the government\u2019s working majority set to fall to just three after the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, the rebels probably have enough muscle to bring Johnson down. 5) An early election looks ever more likely. Johnson would want to avoid an early election until he has delivered Brexit, but these numbers mean that he might not be left with any choice. Here is an assessment from Mujtaba Rahman, who does Brexit analysis for the Eurasia Group consultancy. Downing Street has put out this statement about the vote. A spokesman said: The prime minister is obviously disappointed that a number of ministers failed to vote in this afternoon\u2019s division. No doubt her successor will take this into account when forming their government. This is probably less aggressive than it sounds. If you look at the list of ministers who abstained (see 2.11pm) - Greg Clark, Sir Alan Duncan, David Gauke, Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart - they are all people who were never expected to serve in government with Boris Johnson anyway. Theresa May could have chosen to sack them now, but with only a week to go before the new PM forms a government, that would have been a bit pointless. Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, rises to make a point of order. He says by the time a bill has got this far, it is the property of the house, not the government. He says there have been rumours that the government might drop the bill at this late stage to stop it becoming law. Can the Speaker rule that out? The Speaker, John Bercow, says he has not heard that suggestion. But he says the chief whip, Julian Smith, and the Northern Ireland minister, John Penrose, are both on the front bench now indicating that that will not happen. Penrose rises himself and confirms this. MPs have backed the rest of the Lords amendments by 328 votes to 65. From the Times\u2019 Stephen Swinford Earlier I featured a tweet saying Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, abstained. But she voted with the government. And here is the list of MPs who voted against the Benn amendment. Only one Labour MP, Kate Hoey, voted with the Tories and the DUP against it and only one independent, Ian Austin. Here is the division list with all the MPs who voted for the Benn amendment in the first vote. There were 17 Conservatives voting for it. MPs are now voting on whether or not the accept the other Lords amendments, from two to 18. MPs have now voted to accept the Lords amendment as amended (see 1.48pm) by 315 votes to 273 - a majority of 42. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, one of the strongest advocates in the party of a second referendum. From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth MPs are now voting on the Lords amendment to the bill passed last night, as amended by the Benn amendment. Broadly speaking, this should be a re-run of the previous vote. The government lost that vote by a much bigger margin than people were expecting. Although opinion is split as to whether or not the Commons could block a no-deal Brexit - as this Institute for Government briefing argued, under current procedure it is \u201cnear impossible\u201d, but it might be possible because this Speaker has hinted he would bend the rules - the size of this victory will embolden those who think parliament does have the muscle to block a no-deal Brexit. MPs have voted to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit by 315 votes to 274 - a majority of 41. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner These are from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. UPDATE: In fact, Caroline Nokes did vote with the government. See 2.11pm. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth This is from @PoliticalPics, a photographer specialising in the Number 10 beat. Perhaps it is coincidence. Or perhaps Philip Hammond wants people to know he is not voting. What we don\u2019t know is whether he has permission from the whips to abstain (because they have paired him with a non-voting Labour MP), or whether he is abstaining unilaterally. Only seven Tory MPs rebelled on the last comparable vote on prorogation - the vote last week on the Dominic Grieve amendment saying the government should have to produce fortnightly reports in the autumn on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive. It would not have stopped a new PM proroguing parliament, but Grieve argued it was a step in the right direction. As the voting list shows, the seven Tory rebels were: Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Phillip Lee and Sir Oliver Letwin. From the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby MPs are now voting on the Benn amendment. (See 12.34pm.) John Penrose is making a broader point. He says he voted remain. But he accepts the democratic decision of the public. Brexit must be implemented, he says. MPs are \u201crunning out of road\u201d. Voters\u2019 patience is running out. He says this amendment is about trying to prevent Brexit happening. MPs shout \u201crubbish\u201d at him. John Penrose, the Northern Ireland minister, is winding up the debate now. He says too many additional issues have been added to this bill. He says he has two narrow criticisms of the Benn amendment. Parts of this amendment were defeated in the Commons, he says, and parts were ruled out of scope. He says MPs should reject the amendment on those grounds. John Baron, a Tory Brexiter, claims the rebels are \u201ctilting at windmills\u201d. The Conservatives would never allow parliament to be prorogued. Penrose goes on. He says his other criticism of the Benn amendment is that it does not have anything to do with Northern Ireland. If the Stormont assembly restarts before the bill gets royal assent, it will never become law, he says. He says passing the amendment would set an unwelcome constitutional precedent. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. In theory David Gauke, the justice secretary, and Greg Clark, the business secretary, could be sacked for abstaining. If Tory MPs are being whipped to vote against the Benn amendment (as they are), an abstention counts as an act of dissent - although obviously it is not as serious as voting in favour. But, in practice, Number 10 is more likely to turn a blind eye - not least because, in private, Theresa May would probably not consider it the end of the world if MPs did vote for a mechanism to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament. The SNP\u2019s Gavin Newlands says the default assumption, if parliament is deadlocked, should be revoking article 50, not proroguing parliament to allow a no-deal Brexit to happen. He says the fact that Boris Johnson won\u2019t rule out prorogation shows he is not fit for office. The DUP\u2019s Emma Little-Pengelly says the Northern Ireland assembly has never voted to relax abortion laws in Northern Ireland. If you want to know more about what prorogation actually involves, this is worth a read. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley complains about how the bill has been hijacked for other purposes. And he says the bill will make the restoration of the power-sharing executive less likely (because those who want abortion laws relaxed and same-sex marriage allowed in Northern Ireland now have no incentive to back the resumption of the executive). Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says he has some sympathy for the points made by Fiona Bruce and Nigel Dodds. But MPs are responding to a power vacuum in Northern Ireland. Referring to the Benn amendment, Grieve says it is extraordinary to suggest that MPs might not be allowed to sit when they need to consider important matters. Sir Oliver Letwin asks Grieve to confirm this this amendment is designed to block the use of prerogative powers to prorogue parliament. Grieve confirms that. Grieve says, if MPs do not back this amendment, their role as a protector of democracy will have been \u201cshot to pieces\u201d. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to prorogue parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit would shame a dictator in a banana republic. Now in the debate Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, is also complaining about how this bill have been extended beyond its original intent, as a result of the abortion amendment passed when it was in the Commons last week. She says Northern Ireland should decide its own abortion law. She says MPs talk about what it means to be colonial. She suggests that this is what new colonialism looks like (Westminster legislating for Northern Ireland). The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes thinks Nigel Dodds has a point about new abortion laws for Northern Ireland being rushed through. (See 12.50pm.) Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, also complains that this Northern Ireland bill is being hijacked for alternative purposes. He says the abortion amendments added to the bill, particularly one added in the Lords, would leave Northern Ireland in \u201climbo\u201d for a period of months without an effective abortion law. Justine Greening, the Tory former education secretary, says MPs should back this \u201ccommon sense\u2019 amendment. She says, if this amendment does not pass, \u201cwe will have crossed a rubicon\u201d. If it is defeated, it will establish the precedent that if a government is running into trouble, it can just shut parliament down. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Conservative, says in future people will look back and think it was extraordinary that there was ever any controversy about ensuring the Commons is sitting at a time when a major national decision needs to be taken. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle agrees. She says any proper Conservative, unlike Boris Johnson, would have ruled out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley complains that a bill that was supposed to be about the Northern Ireland executive has been hijacked and turned into a bill about Brexit. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says she understands Paisley\u2019s point. But it\u2019s a case of \u201cneeds must\u201d, she says. She says this has been the longest session of parliament since the civil war. That is because the government daren\u2019t prorogue parliament and have a new Queen\u2019s speech in case that gets voted down, she says. She says MPs are amending this bill because it is the legislative vehicle that is available. Here is the full text of the Benn amendment. Page 1, line 16, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(2C) If, as a result of parliament standing prorogued or adjourned, a minister of the crown cannot comply with the obligations in subsection (2A) or (2B), a proclamation under the Meeting of Parliament Act 1797 (c. 127) shall require parliament to meet on a specified day within the period within which compliance with subsection (2B) is required and to meet on the five following days (other than Saturdays, Sundays or a day which is a bank holiday in the United Kingdom or in any part of the United Kingdom) to allow for compliance with subsection (2B).\u201d Alistair Burt, the Conservative former Foreign Office minister who has also signed the Benn amendment (see 11.26am), says this proposal would not force the Commons to vote in any given way on a no-deal Brexit in the autumn. It would just ensure that the Commons was sitting, so that MPs could take a decision, he says. MPs are now debating the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. The bill has already gone through the Commons and the Lords, and this debate is what\u2019s known as \u201cconsideration of Lords amendments\u201d. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, goes first. He is moving his amendment 1. (See 11am.) He says his amendment would ensure that, if parliament is prorogued in the autumn, it would get recalled under the terms of this bill. He says the amendment does not create a new constitutional principle. It just ensure that parliament would be sitting when it needs to be sitting, in line with existing legislation. Jeremy Corbyn faces a new front in internal dissent over his handling of antisemitism in the party, with Labour peers set to hold a vote of no-confidence in the leader next week, it has emerged. The plan is for Labour peers to hold an emergency meeting on Monday afternoon to consider the idea. If it is taken forward, the ballot would take place over Tuesday and Wednesday, with the result soon afterwards, it is understood. If the no-confidence motion was passed it would have no formal effect, but would be a blow to the authority of Corbyn. Earlier this week more than 60 took out an advertisement in the Guardian accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d over his handling of antisemitism complaints within the party. The latest move follows the decision by Corbyn\u2019s office to sack Baroness Hayter as a Brexit minister in the Lords after she accused Corbyn of having a \u201cbunker mentality\u201d similar to the final days of Hitler. The European commission has now itself debunked Boris Johnson\u2019s claim about kipper food safety regulations, the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp reports. At the last Tory leadership hustings last night Boris Johnson brandished a kipper from the Isle of Man, and claimed that it exemplified why EU rules were so damaging. He said that the producer was complaining that, because of new EU regulations, he now has to send kippers through the post with a plastic ice pillow, making the whole process much more expensive. As is often the case when Johnson is talking about EU regulations, it turns out that he was not being accurate. The Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp explains why here. Turning back to Brexit, Nick Robinson has written a very thorough summary of the revelations in his Panorama programme tonight here, under the title \u201c10 things that stopped Brexit happening\u201d. In the programme Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiate, and Martin Selmayr, the European commission\u2019s secretary general, both say Theresa May never explicitly threatened to leave without a deal in their private talks. Barnier told the programme: I think that the UK side, which is well informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we\u2019ve never been impressed by such a threat. It\u2019s not useful to use it. May\u2019s remaining time in No 10 might be so short that it can now safely be measured in hours, but it seems she is not above still getting furiously annoyed by political foes \u2013 and at this morning\u2019s lobby briefing we got a clue as to how she feels about Barnier. Asked about Barnier\u2019s claim, May\u2019s spokesman not only denied this, but gave a reply dripping with sarcasm. Can I begin by saying how nice it was to hear from Michel Barnier again this morning, and how generous it was of the BBC to give him a platform to share his views with us all. On that specific point, the prime minister was clear, both in public and in private that the UK was prepared to leave without a deal. No love lost, it would seem. In the Commons David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is making a statement now about covering rendition and the treatment of detainees. He says the UK does not practice or condone torture. There is already guidance for the security services setting out the rules for detainees who are interrogated overseas. He says that new guidance is being issued. Theresa May has set out details in a written statement today, he says. Lidington says, after 9/11, it took the British intelligence agencies too long to appreciate the extent to which other countries were using torture (or unacceptable practices, as Lidingon puts it). He says lessons have been learnt. Three separate reports into this have been published, he says. He says better guidance is now coupled with a world-leading oversight regime. The intelligence and security committee has new powers to oversee the intelligence services, he says. He says the rules make it clear that ministers must be consulted if there is a real risk of detainees being mistreated by others. Addressing calls for a further public inquiry, Lidington says in 2013 the government said it would consider the case for a further judicial inquiry after other investigations were over. Lidington says the government has ruled out a further judicial inquiry. There is no policy need for one, he says. And there is no judicial need for one. He says mistreatment allegations have been investigated by the police. Lidington rules out further judicial inquiry into British collusion with rendition and the torture of terrorist suspects. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, and Alistair Burt, the the former Foreign Office minister, have joined up to table a new amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill that would categorically stop a new prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. She says it has been selected. Knife crime in England and Wales hit a record high in 2018/19, up 8% on the previous year, the Press Association reports. Police recorded 43,516 offences involving knives or sharp objects in the year to March 2019, the highest since comparable records began in 2011. The figures released this morning by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) do not include Greater Manchester Police, which records data differently. There was a rise of 3,301 knife crime offences from 2017/18, with the volume of offences up 42% since the year ending March 2011. The total number of homicides in 2018/19 increased slightly to 701 offences from 693 in the previous 12 months, excluding terror attacks. Mark Bangs, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said: The picture of crime is a complex one. Overall levels of crime have remained steady, but this is not the case for all types of crime. For example, overall levels of violence have remained steady but we have seen increases in violent crimes involving knives and sharp instruments. We have seen increases in fraud and overall theft, but decreases in burglary following recent rises. The RAF is heading into space, Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, told a conference this morning. As the Press Association reports, the UK is joining Operation Olympic Defender, a US-led international unit aimed at strengthening deterrence against hostile actors in space and at stopping the spread of debris in orbit. Mordaunt told the Air and Space Power Conference in central London that an RAF pilot is set to be seconded to the Virgin Orbit small satellite programme. She noted that Virgin Orbit already has pilots with astronaut training and it is carrying out research into launching small satellites into space from the wing of a Boeing 747. She said: Science fiction is becoming science fact. One day I want to see RAF pilots earning their space wings and flying beyond the stratosphere. So, today I can announce we\u2019re making a giant leap in that direction by working towards placing a test pilot into the Virgin Orbit programme. Here is my colleague Larry Elliott\u2019s story about what the Office for Budget Responsiblity is saying about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. As mentioned earlier (see 9.45am), the OBR say itself that it\u2019s no-deal stress test is not based on a worst-case scenario. And Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just been making this point too. In a clip broadcast by Sky, Hammond said that a no-deal Brexit of the kind being considered by some prominent Brexiters (he meant Boris Johnson) would hit the economy much harder. He explained: The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt - a recession caused by a no-deal Brexit. But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiters. They are talking about a much harder version, which would cause much more disruption to our economy. And the OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now. In his press conference Robert Chote, the head of the OBR, explained the difference between the more benign no-deal that on which the OBR stress test was based, and a more disruptive no-deal. He said: We\u2019ve looked at the fiscal implications of the less severe of the two no-deal, no-transition scenarios set out by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook. This scenario is not necessarily the most likely outcome, and it is relatively benign compared to some, for example, assuming no major short-term border disruptions. A more disruptive outcome, closer to the Bank of England scenario that we used for our stress test two years ago, would have more severe consequences. As Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, told MPs yesterday, the government\u2019s no-deal planning does assume delays at the border. Tonight the BBC is showing a Panorama programme made by Nick Robinson exploring why the Brexit talks failed. Among the people he interviewed was Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European commission. As Politico Europe reports, Timmermans said that before the negotiations started the EU assumed that the British team would be \u201cbrilliant\u201d because of the professionalism of their civil service. But the EU quickly realised this was not the case, Timmermans said. He went on: And then the first time I saw public utterances by David Davis and I saw him not coming [to Brussels], not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere I thought: \u2018Oh my God, they haven\u2019t got a plan, they haven\u2019t got a plan\u2019. That was really shocking frankly, because the damage if you don\u2019t have a plan \u2014 you know, we see it \u2014 time\u2019s running out and you don\u2019t have a plan, it\u2019s like Lance Corporal Jones \u2014 you know, \u2018Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic\u2019, running around like idiots. Lord Callanan, a Brexit minister, has responded with his own Dad\u2019s Army quote, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. And here is an extract from what the OBR report says about a no-deal Brexit. In Chapter 10 we carry out a fiscal \u2018stress test\u2019 that quantifies the impact on the public finances of a particular no-deal, no-transition Brexit scenario, namely the less disruptive of the two presented by the IMF in its April 2019 World Economic Outlook. While it is a scenario, rather than a forecast, it is nevertheless useful for exploring the channels through which the public finances might respond in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on exports. Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply. Real GDP falls by 2% by the end of 2020 and is 4% below our March forecast by that point. Higher trade barriers also slow growth in potential productivity, while lower net inward migration reduces labour force growth, so potential output is lower than the baseline throughout the scenario (and beyond). The imposition of tariffs and the sterling depreciation raise inflation and squeeze real household incomes, but the monetary policy committee is able to cut bank rate to support demand, helping to bring output back towards potential and inflation back towards target. Borrowing is around \u00a330bn a year higher than our March forecast from 2020-21 onwards. Lower receipts \u2013 in particular income tax and NICs (due to the recession) and capital taxes (due to weaker asset prices) \u2013 explain most of the deterioration. These are partly offset by lower debt interest spending (thanks to lower interest rates and RPI inflation) and the revenue raised customs duties (which are treated as EU rather than UK taxes in the baseline). Higher borrowing and the assumed rollover of Term Funding Scheme loans leave public sector net debt around 12% of GDP higher than our March forecast by 2023-24. The OBR also says this stress test is \u201cby no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal, no-transition Brexit\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 300-page Fiscal Risks Report is here (pdf). My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering the publication of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s Fiscal Risks Report on his business live blog here. The blog also has a link to a live feed from the OBR\u2019s press conference. This is from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. MPs trying to use parliamentary votes to stop a no-deal Brexit have not had much luck recently. Last month the government comfortably defeated a Labour attempt to allow backbenchers to take control of the Commons timetable which, if passed, might have allowed a bill opposing no-deal to be passed. Last week the Speaker refused to call a Dominic Grieve amendment that would definitely prevented the next prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Grieve also lost votes on two other related amendments. But he did win a vote on a move saying the government would have to publish fortnightly reports in the autumn on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. He acknowledged that this on its own would not necessarily stop an autumn prorogation, but he said he hoped peers would beef it up in the Lords. But even this relatively anaemic amendment only passed by one vote, and that was just because a government whip, Jo Churchill, forgot to cast her vote. Last night the House of Lords did beef up the original Grieve proposal, by passing an amendment saying there would have to be debates on those fortnightly reports mandated by Grieve. Whether this would stop a new PM proroguing parliament is a matter of debate, but at the very least it would provide stronger legal grounds for a court challenge against a decision to prorogue. Today the government will try to reverse that decision in the Commons. At one level it is just a dispute about a narrow procedural amendment, but of course this has become a contest about whether or not parliament should be willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit. Based on how MPs voted last week, the government should have a decent chance of winning. But last night Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt reported that some pro-European cabinet ministers were considering resigning so that they could vote against the government. And this morning David Gauke, the justice secretary, refused to rule out rebelling over this issue. He did not say he definitely would resign (and on many occasions pro-Europeans ministers have threatened to quit over Brexit only to back down at the last minute). But instead of just saying that he would support the government, he told the Today programme that he had not yet made up his mind. This is what he said when asked how he would vote: I will have to see what the precise amendments are and we\u2019re hearing what the whipping will be and the arguments for that so I\u2019m not in a position to necessarily say. But what I would say is the idea that parliament should be suspended in October - a period where it always sits, parliament has always in recent years sat at that time of year - at a crucial point in this country\u2019s history, if you like, that parliament should not be able to sit, should not be able to express its opinion and its will, I think would be outrageous. I very much doubt that any prime minister would in fact suspend parliament in these circumstances but I can understand the concerns that a lot of my colleagues have. Gauke, of course, expects to be sacked by the new prime minister (almost certainly Boris Johnson) next week. So he does not really have much to lose. I will be covering the debate in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: David Gauke, the justice secretary, gives a speech on sentencing. 9.30am: Crime figures for England and Wales are published. 9.30am: The Office for Budget Responsibility publishes is Fiscal Risks Report. 10am: The Alternative Arrangements Commission, an independent body set up to look for alternatives to the Northern Ireland backstop, publishes its final report. Around 12pm: MPs debate the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. As Jessica Elgot reports, the government will seek to overturn a vote in the Lords adding an amendment to the bill intended to make it harder for the next PM to prorogue parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

      "bodyText": "Civil servants working for the Department for Exiting the European Union have been awarded nearly \u00a31.3m in bonuses, new figures show. DExEU disclosed on Thursday that it had paid out \u00a3350,000 in bonuses in the year after the referendum. This is in addition to the revelation last month that it had paid out \u00a31m in performance-related awards for April 2017 to March 2018. It made the late disclosure on its first-year bonuses on Thursday in a bid for full transparency, it said. The department paid \u00a3343,650 to delegated graded civil servants, in amounts ranging from \u00a3700 to \u00a32,500, for the year 2016 to 2017. In its annual report for 2018-19 also published on Thursday, it revealed that the highest-paid official was the recently retired permanent secretary, Philip Rycroft, who earned between \u00a3225,000 and \u00a3230,000 including benefits in kind of \u00a317,900 and a pension of \u00a346,000. His benefits in kind included travel costs between home and work. About 16,000 civil servants have been working on Brexit at an estimated cost of \u00a31.5bn to date. While no-deal planning has continued across Whitehall, some staff working on emergency Operation Yellowhammer duties were stood down in April by the Cabinet Office when article 50 was extended until Halloween, after an estimated \u00a31.5bn had been spent including on recruits from the private sector. Now departments are expected to be ordered to ramp up no-deal planning immediately after the new prime minister, expected to be Boris Johnson, gets into No 10 next Wednesday. It is not known who is going to be on his Brexit team but the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is being tipped, as is the pro-Brexit trade consultant Shanker Singham as an adviser. He is the leading force at the privately funded Alternative Arrangements Commission, which has sought to find solutions to the Irish border question. It is understood he has not been approached but would be willing to work on a Johnson or Hunt team. It is thought all big Whitehall departments have made Brexit bonuses but virtually all have refused Guardian freedom of information requests for disclosure. So far the House of Commons is the only other department to disclose its payments. Last month, it revealed it had made \u00a3700,000 in extra payments involving a \u00a3250 bonus to all 2,800 Commons administration and parliamentary Digital Service staff in recognition of their hard work sitting additional days and working into the night. The departments that did respond to freedom of information requests include the Ministry of Defence, which said it paid 19 staff \u201ca reward\u201d or gave them a \u201cthank you\u201d voucher for their work on Brexit up to April 2019. In March, the armed forces mobilised a special team in a 24-hour cover in a nuclear-proof bunker under their headquarters as part of the military\u2019s crisis management operation, dubbed Operation Redfold. They were due to direct 3,500 military personnel on standby if required in the case of chaos on the streets, which could have included congestion on the roads to Dover, disruption to medical supplies and aviation. The MoD said it had paid out a total of \u00a38,250: the highest award was \u00a32,000 and the smallest \u00a3100. The Food Standards Agency paid out almost \u00a330,000 to 64 staff in bonuses ranging from \u00a3250 per person to \u00a31,000, while the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency paid seven staff between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800 in a Brexit bonus. It is responsible for the safety of medicines and medical devices, many of which come from the EU. While virtually all the big departments refused to disclose Brexit bonus data, some did reveal what they had spent on Brexit so far. DExEU spent \u00a3101.6m in the year 2017-18. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs spent \u00a3308m on Brexit: \u00a347m in 2017-18 and \u00a3261m for the financial year 2018-19. The Home Office, which was responsible for developing the settled status scheme for EU citizens, spent \u00a370m in the year 2017-18. The Ministry of Justice revealed it had spent \u00a39.7m on Brexit-related work in 2018-19. The Cabinet Office, the Environment Agency, and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland said they did not award bonuses. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council revealed that the International Crime Coordination Centre, which was set up to provide continuity for UK law enforcement following Brexit, said it spent \u00a318,000 in 2017-18 and \u00a31.75m in the year 2018-19.",

      "body": "<p>Twenty-nine years ago this week I carried out an investigation for the Guardian about the endemic levels of sexism in parliament. A generation later, although much has been done, it is shocking to discover that so little has changed.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s reports on bullying and harassment in the Commons and Lords by the QCs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/westminster-bullying-and-harassment-is-significant-problem\" title=\"\">Gemma White</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/house-of-lords-staff-too-scared-to-complain-about-harassment\" title=\"\">Naomi Ellenbogen</a> reveal a parliament that is still chauvinistic, lecherous and patriarchal.</p> <p>In 1990, when just 42 of the 650 MPs were women, this was unacceptable but perhaps less surprising. We hoped having more women MPs and friendlier sitting hours would transform the environment.</p> <p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t be deceived by the numbers game,\u201d says Helena Kennedy QC, the Labour peer and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/14/eve-was-shamed-how-british-justice-failing-women-review-helena-kennedy\" title=\"\">Eve Was Shamed: How British Justice is Failing Women</a>. \u201cYes we have more women in both houses and almost everywhere in society, but that alone isn\u2019t enough to bring about change. Deeply held attitudes of entitlement and misogyny persist because our patriarchal culture is so deeply ingrained.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Nicholson, who I interviewed when she was a Conservative MP for my original piece, and who now sits in the Lords, says the situation has got worse. She points to how PMQs has replaced two brief and containable sessions of debate with a single gladiatorial dual: \u201cIf parliamentary debate\u2019s centrepiece is one woman being pelted with mud for up to an hour by predominantly male opponents it sets the tone for the whole week: it\u2019s a bear pit.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Dent Coad \u2013 elected the Labour MP for Kensington in 2017 \u2013 says she\u2019s never experienced such blatant sexism. She cites the rise of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson as evidence that conditions are regressing: \u201cIf you have no moral integrity you can\u2019t be a good leader. To treat women as expendable objects is misogyny.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Jess Phillips says she\u2019s supporting a number of women who have experienced groping, persistent inappropriate messaging and one incident of rape. The processes aren\u2019t easy for women, she says, because they have to decide which flawed complaints process \u2013 parliamentary, legal, party \u2013 to pursue.</p> <p>Complainants are also worried about the political harm speaking out might do, she tells me. That\u2019s a dilemma I can relate to. As a radical young reporter, I was pounced on by a member of the Greater London Council. Although I was horrified I remained silent because of the potential damage speaking out might do to the wider political cause.</p> <p>For those who choose to take their complaints to their party, there\u2019s an inherent flaw. The party\u2019s purpose is to succeed politically and therefore to protect its public image. So the odds are stacked against women who do pursue a complaint, not least because it is often their word against that of a much more powerful and politically \u201csignificant\u201d man.</p> <p>White\u2019s and Ellenbogen\u2019s reports contain strong recommendations to safeguard the working conditions of staff in parliament and these must be adopted. But they won\u2019t be enough unless we also address the wider picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e6376285d44114ba754ed6162f70d3db0364fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e6376285d44114ba754ed6162f70d3db0364fa/31_0_3204_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The speaker, John Bercow, during prime minister's questions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Why are politicians allowed to howl in a way that wouldn\u2019t be tolerated in any classroom?\u2019 The speaker, John Bercow, during prime minister\u2019s questions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bullying \u2013 and gender-based harassment \u2013 are what people with power do to those they perceive to have less power.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-nine years ago this week I carried out an investigation for the Guardian about the endemic levels of sexism in parliament. A generation later, although much has been done, it is shocking to discover that so little has changed. Last week\u2019s reports on bullying and harassment in the Commons and Lords by the QCs Gemma White and Naomi Ellenbogen reveal a parliament that is still chauvinistic, lecherous and patriarchal. In 1990, when just 42 of the 650 MPs were women, this was unacceptable but perhaps less surprising. We hoped having more women MPs and friendlier sitting hours would transform the environment. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t be deceived by the numbers game,\u201d says Helena Kennedy QC, the Labour peer and author of Eve Was Shamed: How British Justice is Failing Women. \u201cYes we have more women in both houses and almost everywhere in society, but that alone isn\u2019t enough to bring about change. Deeply held attitudes of entitlement and misogyny persist because our patriarchal culture is so deeply ingrained.\u201d Emma Nicholson, who I interviewed when she was a Conservative MP for my original piece, and who now sits in the Lords, says the situation has got worse. She points to how PMQs has replaced two brief and containable sessions of debate with a single gladiatorial dual: \u201cIf parliamentary debate\u2019s centrepiece is one woman being pelted with mud for up to an hour by predominantly male opponents it sets the tone for the whole week: it\u2019s a bear pit.\u201d Emma Dent Coad \u2013 elected the Labour MP for Kensington in 2017 \u2013 says she\u2019s never experienced such blatant sexism. She cites the rise of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson as evidence that conditions are regressing: \u201cIf you have no moral integrity you can\u2019t be a good leader. To treat women as expendable objects is misogyny.\u201d The Labour MP Jess Phillips says she\u2019s supporting a number of women who have experienced groping, persistent inappropriate messaging and one incident of rape. The processes aren\u2019t easy for women, she says, because they have to decide which flawed complaints process \u2013 parliamentary, legal, party \u2013 to pursue. Complainants are also worried about the political harm speaking out might do, she tells me. That\u2019s a dilemma I can relate to. As a radical young reporter, I was pounced on by a member of the Greater London Council. Although I was horrified I remained silent because of the potential damage speaking out might do to the wider political cause. For those who choose to take their complaints to their party, there\u2019s an inherent flaw. The party\u2019s purpose is to succeed politically and therefore to protect its public image. So the odds are stacked against women who do pursue a complaint, not least because it is often their word against that of a much more powerful and politically \u201csignificant\u201d man. White\u2019s and Ellenbogen\u2019s reports contain strong recommendations to safeguard the working conditions of staff in parliament and these must be adopted. But they won\u2019t be enough unless we also address the wider picture. Bullying \u2013 and gender-based harassment \u2013 are what people with power do to those they perceive to have less power. And our whole political system is built on it. Take the whipping system, which nearly all parties rely on. Whips are chosen for their prowess at bullying MPs into voting \u201cwith the party\u201d (rather than for the country). Do we honestly think we can eradicate bullying elsewhere in political life whilst leaving the whipping system intact? Then there\u2019s the first-past-the-post electoral system, which results in millions of voters\u2019 preferences being ignored because their party wasn\u2019t \u201cfirst\u201d. It\u2019s a winner-takes-all system that thrives on competitive self-interest rather than cooperation and collaboration. And even more basic is the way MPs conduct themselves in debate. Why are politicians allowed to shout, jeer and howl in a way that wouldn\u2019t be tolerated in any classroom, board meeting or family home? At Compassion in Politics \u2013 the organisation I co-founded \u2013 we are working with MPs and peers across six political parties as well as organisations such as 50:50 Parliament, Make Votes Matter, Compass, the Compassionate Mind Foundation and the Jo Cox Foundation to create a better way of doing politics. It matters not just because bullying and sexism are wrong but also because we can\u2019t expect good policies to emerge from a toxic system. Polling conducted for the campaign by Opinium reveals that voters too want radical reforms. For example, two-thirds of the public (67%) would like to see MPs carry out three weeks of work experience in their constituency and 70% would like to see ministers complete a similar amount of on-the-ground training in the portfolio they are appointed to. Such a change could see ministers helping out in schools, hospitals and on the railways. They also want to be involved in the reforms with 69% wanting public involvement in the rewriting of MPs code of conduct. If we are serious about stamping out gender-based abuses of power in parliament it\u2019s time for radical solutions and zero tolerance of practices that enshrine a bullying culture, no matter how longstanding and historic. It is also time for wider societal measures. If misogyny were to be made a hate crime a clear message would be sent to politicians and public alike that the unacceptable will no longer be tolerated.
