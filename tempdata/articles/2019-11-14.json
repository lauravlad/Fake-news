      "body": "<p>The Labour party has nothing to fear from a voting system that ensures parliament closely reflects the balance of opinion held by the British people.</p> <p>We support Make Votes Matter\u2019s campaign for proportional representation. We believe Labour should fight for PR and we are not alone. Seventy-eight constituency Labour parties and two affiliated unions have formally called for PR in the last two years. But, at the very least, Labour must now commit to reviewing the voting system in our planned constitutional convention.</p> <p>The Brexit crisis has tested our constitution to near destruction, bitterly divided the country, and left millions feeling unrepresented at Westminster. We cannot simply hope that politics goes back to normal. We must lead the way to a democratic rebirth \u2013 transforming the political paralysis of recent years into a modern, dynamic and optimistic democracy for the many, not the few.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has nothing to fear from a voting system that ensures parliament closely reflects the balance of opinion held by the British people. We support Make Votes Matter\u2019s campaign for proportional representation. We believe Labour should fight for PR and we are not alone. Seventy-eight constituency Labour parties and two affiliated unions have formally called for PR in the last two years. But, at the very least, Labour must now commit to reviewing the voting system in our planned constitutional convention. The Brexit crisis has tested our constitution to near destruction, bitterly divided the country, and left millions feeling unrepresented at Westminster. We cannot simply hope that politics goes back to normal. We must lead the way to a democratic rebirth \u2013 transforming the political paralysis of recent years into a modern, dynamic and optimistic democracy for the many, not the few. The countries that come closest to this ideal all achieved what they have through PR systems. Including electoral reform in the remit of the convention is a small clarification that could make a huge difference. Not only will it show Labour is serious about democratising the UK, but it will help attract the votes needed to see off a Conservative majority. Most importantly, it promises an exciting opportunity for citizens to consider, deliberate, and decide for themselves how the House of Commons should be elected.

      "bodyText": "The authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd are among a string of public figures declaring they refuse to vote Labour because of its association with antisemitism. In a letter to the Guardian, they said: \u201cTo ignore it because Brexit looms larger is to declare that anti-Jewish prejudice is a price worth paying for a Labour government.\u201d Both Le Carr\u00e9, whose real name is David Cornwell, and Boyd have previously expressed strongly anti-Brexit views. They joined others including Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia who has previously been sympathetic to Labour, the actor Simon Callow , and the historians Antony Beevor, Tom Holland and Dan Snow. Trevor Phillips, a former Labour politician and ex-chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), and Fiyaz Mughal, the founder of the Tell Mama group fighting Islamophobia, also said they could not vote Labour. The letter said: \u201cThe coming election is momentous for every voter, but for British Jews it contains a particular anguish: the prospect of a prime minister steeped in association with antisemitism. Under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, Labour has come under formal investigation by the EHRC for institutional racism against Jews. Two Jewish MPs have been bullied out of the party. Mr Corbyn has a long record of embracing antisemites as comrades. \u201cWe listen to our Jewish friends and see how their pain has been relegated as an issue, pushed aside by arguments about Britain\u2019s European future. For those who insist that Labour are the only alternative to Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit, now, it seems, is not the time for Jewish anxiety. \u201cBut antisemitism is central to a wider debate about the kind of country we want to be. To ignore it because Brexit looms larger is to declare that anti-Jewish prejudice is a price worth paying for a Labour government. Which other community\u2019s concerns are disposable in this way? Who would be next? \u201cOpposition to racism cannot include surrender in the fight against antisemitism. Yet that is what it would mean to back Labour and endorse Mr Corbyn for Downing Street. The path to a more tolerant society must encompass Britain\u2019s Jews with unwavering solidarity. We endorse no party. However, we cannot in all conscience urge others to support a political party we ourselves will not. We refuse to vote Labour on 12 December.\u201d Other signatories on the list include Frederick Forsyth, a Eurosceptic Conservative, Tony Parsons, the author who identified himself as \u201cTory scum\u201d in 2015, and the actor Joanna Lumley, whom David Cameron once tried unsuccessfully to persuade to stand as a Conservative candidate and who supported Johnson\u2019s ill-fated garden bridge project when he was mayor of London. Ghanem Nuseibeh, a businessman and chair of Muslims Against Antisemitism, has tweeted supportively about the Conservatives. There are also Liberal Democrtat supporters on the list, including Maajid Nawaz, the broadcaster and founding chair of the Quilliam anti-extremist thinktank, and Oz Katerji, a journalist and film-maker. A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that several of those who have signed this letter have themselves been accused of antisemitism, Islamophobia and misogyny. It\u2019s less surprising that a number are Conservatives and Lib Dems. \u201cWe take allegations of antisemitism extremely seriously, we are taking robust action and we are absolutely committed to rooting it out of our party and wider society.\u201d Labour has been under pressure for some time over accusations it has not dealt swiftly enough with allegations of antisemitism by members. However, the party maintains it has overhauled its systems and now has a streamlined complaints process. In May, the EHRC began its formal investigation into Labour over whether the party has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish. On Thursday, Luciana Berger, the Lib Dem candidate and former Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, called on the equalities watchdog to publish its report into allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party before the election, saying voters deserved to know what they were voting for. Speaking at an event, Berger said: \u201cMy last contribution in parliament was to say that Boris Johnson should release the intelligence committee\u2019s report into [Russian interference in British politics] and similarly the Equality and Human Rights Commission should release its report into institutional antisemitism in [Labour]. \u201cBoth of them point to issues that people should be concerned about and aware of in the run-up to the general election in four weeks\u2019 time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What should we make of the Conservatives\u2019 claims this morning that Labour policy would mean net migration would increase by 1.2 trillion over the next five years? Oh, wait. That was their claim about Labour spending plans \u2013 in fact, their \u201cresearch\u201d suggests that migration would rise by a mere 840,000. For those of us who work with numbers for a living, and frequently bemoan the lack of public understanding of key economic and social statistics, the way figures are abused by political parties during election campaigns is deeply depressing. (While not on the same scale as the torrent of unreliable Tory projections, Labour has made some dishonest predictions of its own \u2013 such as the claim that a Trump trade deal would cost the NHS \u00a3500m a week.) The Conservatives\u2019 migration numbers can easily be dismissed \u2013 in fact, they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get the current levels of migration right, ignoring the latest official Office for National Statistics projections. Even better, they\u2019ve invented something called a \u201cnet visa grant\u201d, a completely nonexistent concept that I suspect will mystify the Home Office officials who are actually in charge of granting visas. I doubt this will have much credibility with anyone who hasn\u2019t already bought into a completely paranoid narrative about \u201cfloods\u201d of migrants, or the entire population of Turkey moving here if we stay in the EU. There are definitely legitimate questions about Labour policy: as part of its proposed renegotiation of the Brexit deal, would it now be prepared to accept free movement with the EU, which in turn would unlock the possibility of continued UK membership of the single market (a policy that recent polls suggest is surprisingly popular)? And, while they have rejected quotas and income thresholds, how would their policy on non-EU migration for work differ in practice from the Conservatives\u2019 proposals?
