In a stirring intervention on Wednesday, the European council president praised those who marched on the streets of London and the millions who are petitioning the government to revoke article 50. Speaking to the European parliament, Tusk reprimanded those who voiced concerns about a potential lengthy extension to article 50 in the event of the Commons rejecting the withdrawal agreement again this week. Tusk said: \u201cLet me make one personal remark to the members of this parliament. Before the European council, I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK\u2019s participation in the European parliament elections.

Because they are Europeans.\u201d In London, MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday to allow the House of Commons to explore over the coming days whether there could be support for alternatives to Theresa May\u2019s twice-defeated Brexit deal, including a possible second public vote. That proposal, put forward by the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett, lost by 27 votes on Wednesday evening, the second smallest loss among the eight solutions to the Brexit impasse, offering some hope to campaigners in future votes to come. But EU sources said they were concerned that the UK parliament was still unable to coalesce around a solution, saying: \u201cOur interlocutor remains the British government.\u201d The Guardian revealed on Wednesday morning that the EU has pencilled in April Fools\u2019 Day 2020 as a first day for the UK outside the bloc since 1973 if May fails to ratify her deal but seeks a long extension of article 50 on the basis that a new plan has emerged. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage responded to Tusk by describing him as \u201cdeluded\u201d and claiming that a second referendum would deliver a larger majority for leave. In a pantomime moment, Farage turned to those sat behind him to ask whether they really wanted him to return as an MEP.

Tusk\u2019s comments came as the British government emailed the 5.8 million people who have signed a UK parliament petition seeking the revocation of article 50. The email informed signatories that \u201cthis government will not revoke article 50\u201d. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking after Tusk on the subject of Tuesday\u2019s summit, told MEPs he awaited the Commons decision with interest. \u201cThe debate on China was far less complicated than the debate on the UK and I was saying to some of you that if I was to compare Great Britain to a sphinx, the sphinx would be an open book by comparison,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how that book speaks over the next week or so.\u201d Barnier warned the British government that the Irish backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the customs union, would continue to form the basis of the EU\u2019s policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow housing minister has resigned and three shadow cabinet ministers abstained in protest against a three-line whip to vote in favour of plans for a second referendum. Melanie Onn confirmed she had resigned to vote against the option in the ballot of MPs on Wednesday and the shadow cabinet ministers Jon Trickett, Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne all abstained to register their discomfort with the plan. Labour confirmed on Wednesday that it would expect MPs to support a motion, tabled by Margaret Beckett, which said parliament should not ratify any Brexit deal \u201cunless and until\u201d it has been approved in a \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d. Corbyn wrote to Labour MPs on Wednesday afternoon stressing that his party\u2019s first priority was \u201cto deliver our credible Brexit plan\u201d in an attempt to avert a wave of resignations from his frontbench. But the Labour leader was already facing a fierce backlash from a group of shadow cabinet ministers, many of them strong supporters of his leadership, who are wary of supporting a measure that appeared to be aimed at overturning Brexit. Onn was among 27 MPs who rebelled and voted against the amendment, including the mayor of the Sheffield city region, Dan Jarvis, as well as other vocal referendum sceptics Caroline Flint, John Mann and Gareth Snell. Eighteen more MPs abstained, including the three shadow cabinet ministers and others including Tracy Brabin, Stephen Kinnock and Lisa Nandy. Corbyn was visited earlier on Wednesday by sceptical colleagues including Gwynne, Lavery, Trickett, Angela Rayner and Rebecca Long-Bailey, after which he issued his letter to Labour MPs. He wrote: \u201cLabour\u2019s proposed deal remains our preferred solution: based on a customs union, close alignment with the single market and dynamic alignment on rights, standards and protections.\u201d Corbyn told MPs the party was supporting Beckett\u2019s proposal, \u201ceven where it can be read as going beyond our policy\u201d, to \u201ckeep the option of a public vote on the table in order to stop a disastrous no deal or May\u2019s unacceptable deal\u201d. One shadow minister had earlier warned that Labour would face \u201ca very significant rebellion\u201d if it tried to force MPs to back the motion, and another said: \u201cIf we whip for it, we won\u2019t have a shadow cabinet by the end of the day.\u201d However, the Guardian understands that most shadow cabinet ministers agreed to support the amendment, on the condition that the letter was sent; although some junior frontbenchers were still considering their options. However, there was also a angry comeback on Wednesday morning from the pro-referendum wing of the party against an interview by the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, in which he said Labour was \u201cnot a remain party now\u201d and that it could have difficulty supporting a motion for a referendum on any Brexit deal. Gardiner also suggested Labour was concerned that the motion could suggest the party would allow Theresa May\u2019s deal to pass if it led to a referendum. \u201cIt would be saying we could accept what we have always said is a very bad deal. Therefore it looks as if the attempt to have a public vote on it is simply a way of trying to remain because nobody likes this deal,\u201d Gardiner told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cTo put that up as the only alternative in a public vote and say we will let it go through looks as though you believe that, at the end of it, remain would be the result. It is not where our policy has been. \u201cOur policy is clearly that we would support a public vote to stop no deal or to stop a bad deal, but not that we would allow a bad deal as long as the public had the opportunity to reject Brexit altogether.\u201d He said Labour could not be portrayed as a party that wanted remain at any price. \u201cWe have accepted the result of the referendum,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, tweeted within the hour that he supported the referendum approach and later pushed Corbyn to impose strict discipline on Labour MPs who defied the whip and failed to vote for the amendment on Wednesday evening. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman confirmed the party would whip for Beckett\u2019s \u201cconfirmatory public vote\u201d option \u2013 as well as the one put forward by Snell and Ken Clarke, calling for a customs union, and the one setting out Labour\u2019s own Brexit policy. He said whips would also be \u201cencouraging\u201d Labour MPs to support common market 2.0, the cross-party proposal drawn up by Labour\u2019s Kinnock, among others. Asked if shadow frontbenchers would be sacked if they disobeyed the whip, he said: \u201cThe discipline arrangements are a matter for the chief whip.\u201d But he stressed that the indicative votes process was \u201cunusual\u201d. No decision is expected to be made until Thursday about the future of the shadow cabinet ministers who abstained, but a Labour spokesperson said the circumstances \u201care exceptional,\u201d a hint that they may face no sanction. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to find common ground in parliament to stop either a disastrous no deal Brexit or the prime minister\u2019s botched deal,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cLabour is well placed to lead these efforts as our MPs represent constituencies that voted both leave and remain.

      "bodyText": "A first attempt by MPs to find a consensus route forward for Brexit has ended in deadlock and confusion after the Commons rejected every option put forward, albeit with a near-even split on the idea of joining a customs union. Oliver Letwin, the veteran Conservative MP who led the process which allowed backbenchers to seize control of the order paper to hold a series of indicative votes, said the results were \u201cdisappointing\u201d but he hoped a new round of votes would be held on Monday. The Speaker, John Bercow, said he would allow this to take place, prompting shouts of protests from many MPs. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said the results strengthened the government\u2019s view that Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was the best and only way forward. On the lack of a majority for any of the eight alternatives put to the vote on Wednesday, he said: \u201cIt demonstrates that there is not easy option here, that there is no easy way forward.\u201d Groups of MPs had suggested 15 ideas, of which eight were selected by Bercow for votes. The closest result was a commitment for the government to negotiate a \u201cpermanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU\u201d in any Brexit deal. Put forward by the pro-EU Tory veteran Ken Clarke and others, it was voted down by 271 votes to 265.

Play is a powerful builder of community cohesion, bringing children and families from different backgrounds together. Here, sadly, it has been used to drive families apart.</p> <p>All children have the right to play, as recognised in the UN convention on the rights of the child. Through play children develop social skills, awareness of identity and culture, health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Governments have a responsibility for play and leadership is needed. Local, regional and national government can together make sure that all children can benefit from quality play opportunities in their neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Clear guidance on planning and design of play provision is needed. Along with investment in play provision and a statutory duty on local authorities to provide sufficient play opportunities in their area.</p> <p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and a number of local authorities are leading the way because they see the benefits to children and to society. Children in England need consistent leadership and support for play from Westminster.<br><strong>Nicola Butler</strong><br><em>Chair of </em><em>trustees, Play England</em></p> <p>\u2022 What Gaby Hinsliff identifies as \u201cthe crabbily diminishing understanding of the public good\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/playgrounds-rich-kids-housing-social-apartheid\" title=\"\">The social apartheid of the playground</a>, 27 March) is an intended effect of Tory policy in the 1980s and this decade. Margaret Thatcher really did say \u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d and many agreed with her. Her governments tried to make reality conform to such ideas, eroding local authority powers, trashing trade unions, enforcing the sale of public assets, and deregulating financial institutions.</p> <p>Many in the current Tory party think \u201cThatcherism\u201d didn\u2019t go far enough. Some of them are members of the political elite who Aditya Chakrabortty says are \u201cstrangers to collective interest or public responsibility\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/brexit-referendum-conservative-party\" title=\"\">Britain has been betrayed by an amoral venal establishment</a>, 27 March). They serve a different principle: the accumulation of wealth in selected families, starting with their own. <br><strong>Jan Dub\u00e9</strong><br><em>Peebles, Scottish Borders</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is dispiriting that we still accept the argument that \u201ccouncils under intense pressure to build often aren\u2019t in a position to play hardball with developers\u201d (Gaby Hinsliff). Of course they are \u2013 particularly in London where land is scarce and expensive. I am tired of hearing councils bleat that \u201cif we don\u2019t agree they will go elsewhere\u201d \u2013 no they won\u2019t, not if all councils stand their ground and make it a condition of sale if it is their land, or of planning if it is not.</p> <p>It may be harder to negotiate as part of the planning process and changes to planning law have certainly watered down the ability to impose conditions, but once in place this is a legal obligation. Local authorities should be thinking more carefully about what is being developed and how it is to be implemented, and more canny about how they word conditions.<br><strong>Gillian Fearnyough</strong><br><em>Beaminster, Dorset</em></p> <p>\u2022 The rise of segregated play zones in new housing developments is a retrograde step for the capital\u2019s built environment and should be immediately discouraged by the London boroughs and the Greater London Authority.</p> <p>One of London\u2019s enduring strengths as a global city has been its historic commitment to pepper-potting social housing. While its execution hasn\u2019t always been perfect, it has largely avoided the \u201cghetto-isation\u201d that has taken place elsewhere and has contributed towards maintaining social cohesion in a city with huge wealth inequality.</p> <p>The collective aspiration of all those involved in delivering new housing should soar higher than a dystopian future in which children in rented accommodation are denied access to the most basic human right of open space and fresh air, while their neighbours play freely outside.</p> <p>Delivering mixed-tenure housing isn\u2019t easy and inevitably involves some compromises, but these must be challenged thoroughly at every stage lest they start to form dangerous precedents.<br><strong>Graham Haworth</strong><br><em>Director, Haworth Tompkins</em></p> <p>\u2022 JG Ballard had already flagged this up in 1975 in his novel High Rise.

I have no doubt that they would have taken up their pruning shears and cut a gate through the hedge that prevents children living in Wren Mews from joining their equals on the \u201cother side\u201d. My old friend Stephen Eyers must be spinning in his grave. Fiona Collins Carrog, Sir Ddinbych \u2022 The segregation of play areas for richer and poorer children is a shocking development. Play is a powerful builder of community cohesion, bringing children and families from different backgrounds together. Here, sadly, it has been used to drive families apart. All children have the right to play, as recognised in the UN convention on the rights of the child. Through play children develop social skills, awareness of identity and culture, health and wellbeing. Governments have a responsibility for play and leadership is needed. Local, regional and national government can together make sure that all children can benefit from quality play opportunities in their neighbourhoods. Clear guidance on planning and design of play provision is needed. Along with investment in play provision and a statutory duty on local authorities to provide sufficient play opportunities in their area. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and a number of local authorities are leading the way because they see the benefits to children and to society. Children in England need consistent leadership and support for play from Westminster. Nicola Butler Chair of trustees, Play England \u2022 What Gaby Hinsliff identifies as \u201cthe crabbily diminishing understanding of the public good\u201d (The social apartheid of the playground, 27 March) is an intended effect of Tory policy in the 1980s and this decade. Margaret Thatcher really did say \u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d and many agreed with her. Her governments tried to make reality conform to such ideas, eroding local authority powers, trashing trade unions, enforcing the sale of public assets, and deregulating financial institutions. Many in the current Tory party think \u201cThatcherism\u201d didn\u2019t go far enough. Some of them are members of the political elite who Aditya Chakrabortty says are \u201cstrangers to collective interest or public responsibility\u201d (Britain has been betrayed by an amoral venal establishment, 27 March). They serve a different principle: the accumulation of wealth in selected families, starting with their own. Jan Dub\u00e9 Peebles, Scottish Borders \u2022 It is dispiriting that we still accept the argument that \u201ccouncils under intense pressure to build often aren\u2019t in a position to play hardball with developers\u201d (Gaby Hinsliff). Of course they are \u2013 particularly in London where land is scarce and expensive. I am tired of hearing councils bleat that \u201cif we don\u2019t agree they will go elsewhere\u201d \u2013 no they won\u2019t, not if all councils stand their ground and make it a condition of sale if it is their land, or of planning if it is not. It may be harder to negotiate as part of the planning process and changes to planning law have certainly watered down the ability to impose conditions, but once in place this is a legal obligation. Local authorities should be thinking more carefully about what is being developed and how it is to be implemented, and more canny about how they word conditions. Gillian Fearnyough Beaminster, Dorset \u2022 The rise of segregated play zones in new housing developments is a retrograde step for the capital\u2019s built environment and should be immediately discouraged by the London boroughs and the Greater London Authority. One of London\u2019s enduring strengths as a global city has been its historic commitment to pepper-potting social housing. While its execution hasn\u2019t always been perfect, it has largely avoided the \u201cghetto-isation\u201d that has taken place elsewhere and has contributed towards maintaining social cohesion in a city with huge wealth inequality. The collective aspiration of all those involved in delivering new housing should soar higher than a dystopian future in which children in rented accommodation are denied access to the most basic human right of open space and fresh air, while their neighbours play freely outside. Delivering mixed-tenure housing isn\u2019t easy and inevitably involves some compromises, but these must be challenged thoroughly at every stage lest they start to form dangerous precedents. Graham Haworth Director, Haworth Tompkins \u2022 JG Ballard had already flagged this up in 1975 in his novel High Rise. A novel, sadly, for our times \u2013 we have clearly learnt nil. Josine Meijer London \u2022 I wept as I read of children excluded from a play area because of where they lived. Cry the Beloved Country comes to mind.

Even if this many MPs in the European Research Group (ERG) switched, the vote would be extremely tight, but there was mounting speculation the government could table it on Thursday or Friday. This plan, however, could be scuppered after the Speaker told ministers he stood by his ruling that the twice-defeated motion could not be put to MPs again without significant change. Bercow said he had instructed officials to block any attempts to put forward the same or similar plan using procedural rule changes, for example, by using a vote by MPs to instruct the Commons to overlook the rule behind his block. \u201cI understand that the government may be thinking of bringing meaningful vote three before the house either tomorrow or even on Friday, if the house opts to sit that day,\u201d Bercow told the Commons before the start of a debate on indicative votes on Brexit. \u201cTherefore, in order that there should be no misunderstanding, I wish to make clear that I do expect the government to meet the test of change. They should not seek to circumvent my ruling by means of tabling either a notwithstanding motion or a tabling motion. \u201cThe table office has been instructed that no such motions will be accepted. I very much look forward, colleagues, to today\u2019s debate and votes which give the house the chance to start the process of positively indicating what it wants.\u201d Bercow\u2019s original ruling, earlier this month, plunged the Brexit plan into procedural chaos. Citing Erskine May, the official guide to parliamentary procedure, the Speaker said the bar on the same measure being brought more than once in the same parliamentary session was a \u201cstrong and longstanding convention\u201d dating back to 1604. If the vote does eventually happen, May will require support from the Democratic Unionist party and almost all the ERG to win. She could afford to do without around 10 \u201cBrexit ultras\u201d, with the exact number depending on whether any more Labour MPs, such as Jim Fitzpatrick, end up folding as well. There are currently at least 15 Conservative MPs who appear implacably opposed to changing their minds, including six who are pro-remain, such as Justine Greening and Sam Gyimah. A frantic campaign is under way among some Eurosceptics to persuade the last of their colleagues to get behind May\u2019s deal for fear of there being no Brexit at all, as MPs prepared to vote for eight alternative options, from a Norway-style departure to revoking article 50, or holding a second referendum, on Wednesday evening. They can choose to support as many as they want. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, is said to be in talks to persuade May to privately agree to stand down if the withdrawal agreement is passed. She would then publicly announce a departure date, with MPs reserving the right to vote down her deal at the second reading if she did not honour the pledge to announce her resignation. May is due to address a gathering of Conservative backbenchers on the 1922 Committee at 5pm, leading to rumours that she will declare her timetable for leaving office. However, people around the prime minister are understood to be worried that openly saying she will quit after Brexit will look like a stitch up in exchange for votes, while some senior ERG MPs are keen to make her departure look dignified rather than forced. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has given the most overt hints that he could back the deal if May made way for a successor. He described it as a \u201cterrible deal, something which I bitterly opposed for a long time\u201d. However, he said he needed \u201cto see that the second phase of the negotiations will be different from the first\u201d and highlighted the \u201cappreciable risk\u201d that not voting for the deal could lead to no Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has admitted the government\u2019s plan to waive all tariffs on goods crossing the Irish border into Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be legally challenged under World Trade Organization rules. The environment secretary told MPs that legal advice had been sought, and it was \u201ccertainly the case that other countries could have an arguable case at [the] WTO\u201d over a zero-tariff plan for Ireland. But he said the political needs outweighed those concerns. \u201cWe believe there are specific exemptions because of the broader political and security situation in Northern Ireland underpinning the Good Friday agreement, which mean that we can be allowed to do everything that we can. \u201cOf course we couldn\u2019t keep this situation indefinitely but we can do everything we can for a period in order to maintain a frictionless border,\u201d Gove told the environment select committee. Under the no-deal tariff plan the UK would levy import tariffs on beef, lamb, pork and dairy products if it crashed out of the EU but waive them in Northern Ireland to avoid putting infrastructure on the Irish border. The plan, revealed two weeks ago, has caused controversy in Northern Ireland with claims the double standards could prove disastrous for farmers who would face EU tariffs on dairy and meat products exported into Irish food processing plants that made everything from pizza toppings to cheese and infant milk formula. This could be deemed illegal under WTO rules, which must be applied equally to all countries. Neil Parish, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told Gove the no-deal tariff regime for Irish exporters would \u201ccrush\u201d Northern Ireland\u2019s agrifood industry and lead to bankruptcies and business closures. \u201cIt would certainly put Northern Ireland\u2019s agrifood industry at a disadvantage, yes,\u201d Gove replied. He admitted the zero-tariff plan could have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the dairy industry. Goves warning comes as Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party continues to withhold support for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal over Irish border issues. It has put the DUP at odds with local businesses and farmers, who say no deal would be a disaster as they would have to compete with cheaper food coming in from Ireland but face tariffs on their own exports of dairy, beef and lamb across the border. About a third of all Northern Irish milk goes to the Irish Republic to be processed into butter, cheese and infant formula, while 400,000 sheep are exported a year to Ireland for slaughter and meat processing. Parish asked Gove whether he would deploy emergency measures to protect Northern Irish farmers. Gove said he had met representatives from Northern Ireland\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs on Monday and had told the department he would \u201cprovide whatever support they request to the best of our ability\u201d. Gove revealed his department had 2,800 staff working on Brexit, with 55 seconded from Natural England and 30 from the Environment Agency.",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Cummings, the former director of the official leave campaign, has been ruled to be in contempt of parliament after failing to appear before MPs investigating fake news. The House of Commons committee of privileges said Cummings\u2019 refusal to give oral evidence to MPs constituted a significant interference in the work of the inquiry. In a statement, Cummings, who was portrayed last year in a Channel 4 Brexit drama by Benedict Cumberbatch, said he had offered to give evidence but was rebuffed. He was responding to a committee report released on Wednesday. MPs had examined correspondence between Cummings and the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee, which was investigating the proliferation of false news stories during the EU referendum campaign. The privileges committee acknowledged its sanctions were limited to recommending the Commons issue a formal admonishment for Cummings\u2019 conduct, raising questions about the committee\u2019s enforcement powers. The admonishment would require a resolution of the house, which, if passed, \u201cshould be communicated to Mr Cummings by the clerk of the house\u201d, the committee said in its report. Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, said it was clear the powers of the house had been \u201cfound wanting\u201d. He said Cummings \u2013 the director of the campaign spearheaded by Boris Johnson \u2013 had shown a \u201ctotal disregard\u201d for the authority of parliament and called for statutory powers to \u201creassert the authority that is missing\u201d. \u201cThe Dominic Cummings case highlights the need for parliament to define in law what its powers should be to require witnesses to attend hearings, and what sanctions should apply if they do not,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe current powers have been tested to their limits and found wanting.\u201d The committee of privileges said the case \u201craised further questions about the enforceability of the house\u2019s powers and those of its committees to secure evidence\u201d, and that it would be resuming an inquiry into the matter. The case was referred to the committee last June after Cummings failed to respond to an order of the house requiring him to give an undertaking to appear before the inquiry by a specified date. In launching its inquiry, the committee said the house had previously decided its penal jurisdiction should be exercised as sparingly as possible. It added that it would not recommend the use of any \u201cpower of committal to prison\u201d in this case. The report concluded that Cummings committed a contempt \u201cboth by his initial refusal to obey the DCMS committee\u2019s order to attend and by his subsequent refusal to obey the house\u2019s order of 7 June\u201d. It also expressed regret for the tone adopted by Cummings in his dealings with the DCMS committee and in comments posted on his blog, which included accusations of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and \u201cspreading errors and lies\u201d. \u201cThis attitude did not serve the interests of civilised public debate,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe have no doubt that, had Mr Cummings attended a hearing of the DCMS committee, he would have given robust and articulate responses to the questions put to him, and would have had no difficulty in communicating his standpoint to the public and the media. \u201cAttending the hearing and defending his position when called upon to do so would have been the right thing to do.\u201d While Cummings\u2019 reputation may be tarnished inside the Commons by Wednesday\u2019s report, it could well be enhanced among his followers on the libertarian right who have celebrated his battles with the political establishment. Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, was once described as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d by the prime minister at the time, David Cameron. He was widely seen as the brains behind the \u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d slogan written on Vote Leave\u2019s red bus. The campaign group has been referred to the police for overspending on the eve of the 2016 vote. In a blog post on Wednesday, Cummings claimed he was willing to appear before the committee but had told Collins to \u201cget lost\u201d after receiving a summons from the MPs. He said he was later willing to give evidence to the privileges committee but only if both he and the MPs agreed to swear an oath. \u201cMy offer to give evidence to MPs remains open. As does my reasonable demand that ALL OF US ARE UNDER OATH TO TELL THE TRUTH. I hope they take it up but am not hopeful,\u201d he wrote.",

      "bodyText": "The British government has rejected a petition calling for Brexit to be stopped, which gathered more than 5.8 million signatures. The petition is due to be debated by MPs on 1 April, after breaking the 100,000 threshold for consideration and becoming the best-supported proposal in the history of the House of Commons and government\u2019s e-petitions website. Rejecting the oft-repeated claim that EU withdrawal is the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, it calls for the revocation of the Article 50 letter informing the European Council of the UK\u2019s intention to leave. The Article 50 letter can be withdrawn by the UK unilaterally, without the need for EU agreement, leaving Britain free to continue as a member on its current terms. But in its official response to the petition, the department for exiting the EU said: \u201cIt remains the Government\u2019s firm policy not to revoke Article 50. We will honour the outcome of the 2016 referendum and work to deliver an exit which benefits everyone, whether they voted to Leave or to Remain. \u201cRevoking Article 50, and thereby remaining in the European Union, would undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in government.\u201d The department said while it acknowledged the \u201cconsiderable number\u201d of people who had signed the petition, the government had written to every household prior to the 2016 referendum promising the outcome of the referendum would be implemented and people voted with that understanding. \u201c17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK government,\u201d said the department\u2019s statement. The department added that 80% of those who voted in the 2017 general election voted for parties who committed in their manifestos to uphold the referendum result. \u201cRevoking Article 50 would break the promises made by Government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy. \u201cAs the Prime Minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause \u2018potentially irreparable damage to public trust\u2019, and it is imperative that people can trust their Government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them.\u201d The petition will be debated by MPs in the Commons\u2019 secondary chamber Westminster Hall. A Government minister will be required to respond to the petition, but there will be no vote on the action it demands. The woman behind the petition, Margaret Georgiadou, said on Saturday she had received death threats. She also said she had deleted her Facebook account after receiving a \u201ctorrent of abuse\u201d. MPs will also debate a petition calling for a second EU referendum, which has received more than 120,000 signatures, and another - signed by more than 140,000 - demanding that the UK leave with or without a deal on 29 March.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Oliver Letwin, the unlikely leader of parliament\u2019s Brexit takeover, has been at the heart of Conservative policy-making for so long that papers he once wrote for Margaret Thatcher have been released by the National Archives. Those who know the Eton and Cambridge-educated MP say it is entirely characteristic of Letwin, 62, to be intimately involved in such a complex scheme as directing the next steps of Brexit by means of indicative votes among MPs. \u201cHe has no shortage of ideas,\u201d said one colleague at Westminster. \u201cBut the trouble is four of them will be complete duds \u2013 and one of them will be absolutely brilliant.\u201d Poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as \u201ca trailblazer for the real thing\u201d. Once introduced, first in Scotland and then elsewhere, it proved so unpopular it helped bring down Thatcher. Three years ago, Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth following the 1985 riots would only end up in the \u201cdisco and drug trade\u201d. The memo, Letwin admitted, was \u201cbadly-worded and wrong\u201d. In his own memoir, Hearts and Minds, written in 2017, Letwin was honest enough to admit mistakes he had made in his 20s. \u201cI am ashamed for [Thatcher], and ashamed of myself \u2026 I don\u2019t believe she ever really took on board the extent to which some people are victims of the society.\u201d But the path to moderation was not smooth. Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had promised \u00a320bn of tax and spending cuts in an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party\u2019s manifesto at the time. It culminated in a bizarre episode when he was tracked down by Jeremy Vine, of Newsnight, to his constituency where he had agreed to take part in a Roman-themed novelty hustings. The TV cameras found him dressed in a toga, at which point he was also confronted by the singer Billy Bragg, who was dressed as a Roman soldier. \u201cIn front of his bemused constituents,\u201d Vine wrote in his memoir It\u2019s All News To Me, Letwin \u201cremoved the toga to reveal a tie and neatly press shirt underneath. He then conducted a serious Newsnight interview with me while being heckled by a Roman centurion.\u201d In many respects, the best periods of Letwin\u2019s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron\u2019s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title. Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin\u2019s big idea, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it. Once his indicative votes amendment was passed on Monday night, some wounded Tory MPs on the other side of the argument seemed to suggest Letwin had effectively taken over the country, and not just the parliamentary agenda to allow MPs to vote on their preferred Brexit option on Wednesday. David TC Davies, a Conservative backbencher, asked: \u201cSince he now seems to have installed himself as a kind of jobbing prime minister, could you tell me how we can hold him to account in this house?\u201d It was the culmination of a Brexit journey that has taken him from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January, when he voted with Labour to give May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down. \u201cMy right honourable friend Sir Nicholas Soames, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,\u201d Letwin said. A month later, his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d the government \u201cwould prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal\u201d.
