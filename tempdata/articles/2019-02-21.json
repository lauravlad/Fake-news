      "bodyText": "The family of Shamima Begum are exploring legal and practical options to bring her baby son to the UK without her while she embarks on the potentially lengthy appeal against the removal of her British citizenship, the Guardian has learned. The lawyer representing the 19-year-old\u2019s family is planning to travel to the refugee camp in Syria where she is living as soon as possible, to set in motion the legal appeal process and to ask her consent to bring her newborn son back to Britain while she awaits a resolution of her legally tangled case. Begum gave birth to a baby boy last weekend in a refugee camp in northern Syria, just days before the Home Office moved to strip her of her British nationality. Because the baby boy was born while Begum was still a UK citizen, he is British, according to legal experts. The child\u2019s citizenship is unaffected by the move to deprive her of her rights, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, indicated on Wednesday. Begum\u2019s family has written directly to Javid, asking him to help bring her newborn son to Britain. The letter, written by Begum\u2019s oldest sister, Renu, also says the family will help her in challenging Javid\u2019s decision to strip her of her British citizenship. The letter says: \u201cWe were pleased to learn from your comments in the Commons that you recognise my nephew, Shamima\u2019s son, as a British citizen. \u201cAs a family, we ask now how we can assist you in bringing my nephew home to us. In all of this debacle, he is the one true innocent and should not lose the privilege of being raised in the safety of this country.\u201d The letter states that her family are \u201cshocked and appalled at the vile comments\u201d Begum has made in recent days, which are not representative of British values. Begum, now 19, has been in the \u201cthrall\u201d of Isis for four years now, and \u201cher exploitation at their hands has fundamentally damaged her\u201d, the letter continues. \u201cWe hope you understand our position in this respect and why we must, therefore, assist Shamima in challenging your decision to take away the one thing that is her only hope at rehabilitation, her British citizenship.\u201d Tasnime Akunjee, the Begum family\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian: \u201c[Begum] has a child and we are going to see what we can do to make sure that the child isn\u2019t suffering, because that child isn\u2019t affected by this order administratively at all. \u201cWe would really like to know from Sajid Javid what practical steps he would take to assist a four- or five-day-old British citizen in difficult circumstances to come back to the UK.\u201d The decision to send the baby to Britain pending his mother\u2019s appeal would be one for Begum herself, her lawyer stressed, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything against her will, so I would hope that I would be able to outline the options for her, explain things to her.

In a letter dated 19 February, the Home Office informed the teenager\u2019s family that it had stripped her of her British citizenship, and asked them, if they were in contact with their daughter, to inform her.

Ajunkee suggested it was for the government to outline what measures it intended to put in place to safeguard the child. Responding to an urgent question on the case on Wednesday, Javid told the House of Commons: \u201cIn the case of a minor clearly even more care must be taken, because it is absolutely paramount in all cases that we take into account the welfare of minors.\u201d Javid\u2019s decision to strip Begum\u2019s citizenship has caused controversy, with many experts questioning its legality since removing someone\u2019s citizenship in a way that leaves them stateless is illegal under international law. The teenager, whose family are originally from Bangladesh, insists she has never applied for or held Bangladeshi citizenship and has never visited the country. Bangladesh\u2019s foreign ministry has also unequivocally stated that she is not a citizen of that country, and said that \u201cthere is no question of her being allowed to enter into Bangladesh\u201d. Akunjee said: \u201cWe are interested in the statement released by the Bangladeshi government and that will form part of the mix of our appeal.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Jeremy Corbyn described the Home Office move as \u201ca very extreme manoeuvre\u201d and called for the government to offer Begum \u201csome support\u201d. \u201cShe was born in Britain, she has that right to remain in Britain and obviously a lot of questions she has to answer but also some support that she needs,\u201d he said. \u201cShe obviously has, in my view, a right to return to Britain.

The team noted the condition was most common among those who had been assaulted or threatened, particularly those who had experienced sexual assault or other violence. \u201cAlthough these direct interpersonal traumas [accounted for] about 20% of all the types of trauma, they accounted for half of the cases of PTSD,\u201d said Danese. The team said that, as well as potentially leading to PTSD, trauma can have other profound ramifications: participants who had been exposed to traumatic events had higher rates of mental health-related problems in the previous year \u2013 ranging from anxiety to psychosis and drug dependence \u2013 than those unexposed to trauma. Such problems were even more prevalent among those who had had PTSD, with three in four experiencing another mental health problem. That said, the team said the study was observational and interplay between PTSD and other mental health problems was complex \u2013 with the latter potentially increasing the risk for the former. Almost half of those who had had PTSD had self-harmed at some point since the onset of adolescence, compared with 17% who had experienced trauma but not PTSD and 8.4% who had no experience of trauma. Suicide attempts were more than eight times more prevalent among those who had had PTSD than who had not. Such trends remained even when other mental health problems were taken into account. Danese said it is of particular concern that so few of those with PTSD had accessed help with their mental health: only 30% went to their GP and just 10% saw a psychiatrist. Dr Louise Theodosiou from the Royal College of Psychiatrists described the findings as alarming, saying that more needed to be done to prevent young people being exposed to trauma and to support those who have had such experiences. Those working with children, she added, needed to be on the watch for symptoms of PTSD, including troubles with managing emotions. \u201cWhile young people are generally resilient \u2013 and in many cases symptoms of trauma will diminish and many will recover completely \u2013 others may go on to develop serious mental illnesses. It is essential that these children and young people are able to access appropriate support,\u201d she said. While Theodosiou welcomed the plan from NHS England to improve mental health care for children, she said investment was crucial. Emma Thomas, chief executive of the children\u2019s mental health charity YoungMinds, agreed urgent action was needed, including a national commitment to address childhood adversity. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and upsetting that so many young people have experienced trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were disappointed that the government recently rejected a vital report on early intervention for children who have experienced adversity and trauma, and hope this research will urge them to reconsider.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "The government has spent at least $400m to recover $500m from welfare recipients through the controversial robodebt scheme, a Senate estimates hearing has been told. Under questioning by the Labor senator Murray Watt on Thursday night, department officials said the scheme had \u201craised\u201d about $1.5bn in debts from welfare recipients since it was rolled out. But only about $5oom had actually been repaid. Another $500m was the subject of a payment arrangement while the remaining money was \u201cunconfirmed\u201d and could be subject to an appeal, the Department of Human Services (DHS) said. On Thursday night, Watt questioned the point of the scheme when the government only had \u201c$100m to show for it\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m just concerned there\u2019s been a litany of terrible stories,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, to have only recovered $100m. Does that meet your expectations?\u201d The department spent $375m on the robodebt scheme between 2015-16 and 2017-18, while about $200m in administrative costs was budgeted for the current financial year, officials said. In total, it meant the scheme would have cost at least $400m to the end of 2018, Watt said. The running costs have increased each year as the department has been forced to redesign the program amid public criticism. The DHS secretary, Renee Leon, said: \u201cIn the most recent budget we readjusted the costs and the saves because the original measure was costed on the assumption that the great bulk of the work would be done online without staff involvement.\u201d \u201cWe have now applied more staff support and involvement to it.\u201d Over the next four years, the government forecasts it will recover about $4bn from the robodebt scheme, officials said. Leon said it was common that social security debts were never fully repaid because customers were on low incomes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to allow the integrity of the welfare program to deteriorate because our customers can\u2019t necessarily repay what they owe immediately,\u201d she said. Leon said the federal budget did not \u201crun on a cash basis\u201d, which means the debts the government believes it is owed are included in the budget balance even if the money may never be recouped. The figures come as the program faces a legal challenge from Victoria Legal Aid, which argues the way Centrelink calculates a debt is unlawful. More than 400,000 debts have now been initiated over two years. People are asked to provide evidence to disprove the debt, which is calculated using income-matching from a person\u2019s tax return. Officials also faced a grilling about how they had responded to figures that showed 2,030 people had died after they were sent a debt notice, including 812 who were considered vulnerable by Centrelink. About one in five were under the age of 35. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert stressed that she was not suggesting a \u201ccausation\u201d between the letters and the deaths. But it was vital the department investigate the figures \u201cso there can be some analysis done on whether there is a level of association\u201d, she said. \u201cIt seems to me the department is in denial about the stress and anxiety that robodebt has caused,\u201d Siewert said. Leon said the figures did not suggest there was \u201can elevated death rate\u201d when compared with the total cohort of welfare recipients. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not troubled that people die,\u201d she said. Linking the debt letters to suicide was a \u201ca dangerous path to go down\u201d, she said, because vulnerable people may be \u201ctriggered by that assertion\u201d.",

He sought to explain: \u201cI felt the media was falsely saying that I was posing a danger, which was not my intention. This was not a crosshairs, in my opinion, and I did not wish to be blamed for something that was not my intention.\u201d</p> <p>Government prosecutor Jonathan Kravis pressed Stone on the names of his volunteers and which of them had sent the image to him. The defendant could not come up with a satisfactory answer, saying he could not remember their identities.</p> <p>After Stone had returned to a seat with his legal team, Jackson delivered a withering decision. \u201cMr Stone could not even keep his story straight on the stand,\u201d she said.</p> <p>His Instagram post had a \u201csinister message\u201d that could incite supporters to turn violent, she continued, observing that the defendant is an expert in communications. \u201cRoger Stone fully understands the power of words and the power of symbols and there\u2019s nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\u201d</p> <p>While he had taken the post down, she added, \u201cIn the media there\u2019s no such thing as a take back.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson summed up: \u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow \u2026 So no, Mr Stone, I\u2019m not giving you another chance.\u201d</p> <p>She imposed a full gagging order that prevents Stone making any statements about the case, including press releases, press conferences and social media posts, although he can still solicit donations to his personal defence fund. Any violation, she warned, could result in his bond being revoked and detention.</p> <p>Stone has pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. Since his arrest in January, he has been free on a $250,000 bond with court permission to travel to certain American cities.</p> <p>With Thursday\u2019s decision, he is denied the limelight he has built a career craving.</p>",

The longtime confidant of Donald Trump was spared prison for posting an Instagram picture lambasting Judge Amy Berman Jackson but he was slapped with an expanded gagging order that prevents him speaking publicly about his ongoing criminal case. The courtroom rebuke was a humbling moment for the self-proclaimed dirty trickster, notorious for his love of cigars, shades and tailor-made suits, and whose public appearances usually consist of bravado and Richard Nixon-style victory salutes. On Instagram he had posted a picture of Jackson next to an image that appeared to show the crosshairs of a gun, with a caption that described her as an \u201cObama-appointed judge who dismissed the Benghazi charges against Hillary Clinton\u201d. Stone, 66, was found to have abused a previous gag order imposed following charges against him in the justice department\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. Wearing a grey suit with handkerchief in the top left pocket and a blue tie, Stone walked steadily to the witness stand in the packed courtroom at the United States district court for the District of Columbia in Washington. \u201cI believe I abused the order, for which I am heartfully sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI am kicking myself for my own stupidity, but not more than my wife is kicking me.\u201d Stone suggested the rash act was \u201can outgrowth\u201d of extreme stress, saying he was struggling to pay rent and, while he was seasoned in \u201cpolitical combat\u201d, this was the first time in his life he had faced criminal charges. \u201cI now have television commentators talking about the likelihood I will be raped in prison,\u201d he said, in an apparent play for sympathy that fell on deaf ears. Unmoved, Judge Jackson demanded: \u201cHow hard was it to come up with a photo that didn\u2019t have the crosshairs in the corner?\u201d Stone claimed the image had been sent to him by one of his volunteers and he posted it on Instagram without thinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice it until it was brought to my attention by a reporter.\u201d He did not believe the symbol shows crosshairs, he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a Celtic occult symbol,\u201d he said. Pressed for details, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not into the occult.\u201d Despite his dramatic fall, Stone remained a forceful presence, breathing heavily into the microphone and sometimes speaking over the judge to get his point across. \u201cLet me finish my question!\u201d she snapped at one point. Jackson grilled him over a series of media interviews in which he appeared to defend the post and criticize her and the special counsel, Robert Mueller. He sought to explain: \u201cI felt the media was falsely saying that I was posing a danger, which was not my intention. This was not a crosshairs, in my opinion, and I did not wish to be blamed for something that was not my intention.\u201d Government prosecutor Jonathan Kravis pressed Stone on the names of his volunteers and which of them had sent the image to him. The defendant could not come up with a satisfactory answer, saying he could not remember their identities. After Stone had returned to a seat with his legal team, Jackson delivered a withering decision. \u201cMr Stone could not even keep his story straight on the stand,\u201d she said. His Instagram post had a \u201csinister message\u201d that could incite supporters to turn violent, she continued, observing that the defendant is an expert in communications. \u201cRoger Stone fully understands the power of words and the power of symbols and there\u2019s nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\u201d While he had taken the post down, she added, \u201cIn the media there\u2019s no such thing as a take back.\u201d Jackson summed up: \u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow \u2026 So no, Mr Stone, I\u2019m not giving you another chance.\u201d She imposed a full gagging order that prevents Stone making any statements about the case, including press releases, press conferences and social media posts, although he can still solicit donations to his personal defence fund. Any violation, she warned, could result in his bond being revoked and detention. Stone has pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. Since his arrest in January, he has been free on a $250,000 bond with court permission to travel to certain American cities. With Thursday\u2019s decision, he is denied the limelight he has built a career craving.",

They\u2019ll ... surely? ... do enough against a Malmo side they managed to beat 2-1 away without being at their best, but that won\u2019t really tell us much about the burning issue at hand: will Maurizio Sarri keep his job? A week from now, once they\u2019ve played Manchester City in the League Cup final and Spurs in the top flight, we\u2019ll probably know the answer to that, but I\u2019m not sure anything we see tonight will make a massive difference.</p> <p><strong>That said! </strong>There is still a job to do and Malmo did, at times, look quite lively next week. If the Swedish team score first you can bet it will get <em>very </em>antsy inside Stamford Bridge. More chants of \u201cF*ck Sarriball\u201d (which I thought were ridiculous, by the way)? And if they don\u2019t, and Chelsea really turn up and turn it on, then it\u2019ll be a very nice pep before face ... errrm ... Pep at Wembley on Sunday.</p> <p>So let\u2019s see if we have a real game of things tonight. From a neutral perspective, I really hope we do. Do send your emails in and tell me what you\u2019re expecting \u2013 and perhaps we can grapple a little bit with the question of whether Sarri should, indeed, be under as much pressure as he currently seems to be. <strong>Kick-off is at 8pm, UK time!</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T17:01:55.077Z\">at 5.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It got better! And Chelsea got through. Thanks for your company and emails, which helped made it fun throughout. Sarri is safe for the next few days at least, but Wembley looks like a date with destiny. I\u2019ll see you for that one \u2013 until then, bye for now. Here\u2019s how our man at Stamford Bridge saw it \u2013 Dominic Fifield has filed his on-the-whistle report: Giroud speaks: \u201cWe needed a good win tonight and especially to be strong defensively. And we\u2019ve been efficient up front so it\u2019s been a good night for us. We were expecting them to press us a bit high, it was difficult for us to find solutions but we kept going. Our manager said we needed to play more quickly and that\u2019s what we did in the second half. They ran a lot in the first half and we knew we\u2019d get a bit tied. It\u2019s good for the confidence but now we need a bit of momentum and it\u2019s going to be a different game at Wembley, a final.\u201d Hudson-Odoi speaks: \u201cHappy with the result today. I think all the boys worked really hard. Our mentality was strong, we knew they\u2019d come out strongly. I\u2019m happy with the goal and the good work the team did today. Hopefully I did well and made an impact on the game as well.\u201d Rennes have won that one 3-1 (6-4 agg). We won the second half! Kari Tulinius has wrapped it up for us and it does sound fun: \u201cReal Betis were throwing everything they had at Rennes, but a combination of heroic defending and glorious timewasting were keeping them at bay. Then Rennes got the ball and broke up field and M\u2019Baye Niang scored with the last kick of the game. Rennes players and fans are delirious, Betis players and fans are heartbroken.\u201d Want some other scores from the 8pms? Read on: Inter Milan 4-0 Rapid Vienna (5-0 agg); Bayer Leverkusen 1-1 Krasnodar (1-1 agg, Krasnodar win on away goals); Benfica 0-0 Galatasaray (2-1 agg); Genk 1-4 Slavia Prague (1-4 agg); Dynamo Kiev 1-0 Olympiakos (3-2 agg). Dahlin denies Loftus-Cheek from close range and then there\u2019s the whistle, so Chelsea are through. Relief all round and a clinical second-half performance, with three good goals. Malmo had those near-obligatory early flurries but looked very limited after that. Has Hudson-Odoi played his way into the League Cup final lineup with that late, low strike? 90+1 min: We are into three minutes of added time. Chelsea\u2019s job is nearly done. 88 min: Chelsea earn a free-kick in almost exactly the position Barkley scored from. But he\u2019s left us now so Willian has a go, trying a clever one where you slip it under the jumping wall. Malmo don\u2019t fall for it and it looks a bit soft in the end. 87 min: This half has had a lot more going for it, if not drama-wise then certainly in terms of Chelsea\u2019s application and ability to use the space they\u2019ve been given. The goals have all been very good. And it\u2019s the one they all came for! Hudson-Odoi had been a bit quieter this half but no longer. Willian finds him with the final third of the right flank all to himself, aiming a perfect ping across from the left. Hudson-Odoi is faced with a back-pedalling Rieks, who took a bad knock earlier, and makes no mistake \u2013 he flashes a fierce low shot across Dahlin, who gets a finger to it but can\u2019t keep the ball out. Sarri notes something on a pad. \u201cPlay him more\u201d? 83 min: Right of reply for Ian Burch \u2013 \u201cI too wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the same face in the dugout for a couple of years running, just not Sarri\u2019s. If you don\u2019t have the players to play your system then find a system that does suit them until you get the players you need. He refuses to compromise. Same tactics, same substitutions every game, same poor performances and results. What other manager trying to chase two goals in an FA Cup tie against Man Utd would bring on a right-back for another right-back. Honestly he\u2019s just trolling the Chelsea fans with that.\u201d 81 min: Vindheim scurries back well to prevent a Willian break. A third goal doesn\u2019t look out of the question if Chelsea want one. Gall makes a rare Malmo foray down the left for Malmo straight afterwards but his cross is smuggled away. 79 min: Here comes Ethan Ampadu for Azpilicueta. Chelsea\u2019s three best youth products are all on the pitch now. Tune in, Bundesliga scouts! 76 min: It\u2019s quite a way for Barkley to go. He\u2019s replaced by Jorginho, while Loftus-Cheek is on for Kante. Was it my imagination or did Jorginho get a bit of a hostile reception there? Did I hear that correctly? Short memories! Ah, that\u2019s really nice. The free-kick, a yard outside the box and a tad to the left of centre, invites a skilled technician to flip it up, round and into the near corner. Barkley does exactly that with the best piece of play of the night, and Stamford Bridge sounds a lot happier now. Bengtsson, already booked, topples Barkley on the very edge of the area and the referee, after a long think, rightly shows the second yellow. If that wasn\u2019t already that, it\u2019s definitely that now! 72 min: Chelsea want blood, or at least a card, as Nielsen seems to clip Willian down in full flight but is adjudged to have got a bit on the ball. Last throws for Malmo now as Lewicki and Gall enter in place of Christiansen and Traustason. 71 min: Matt Muir writes \u2013 \u201cIsn\u2019t the thing about \u2018Sarriball\u2019 (horrid term) that it requires technically excellent players who can play a very specific way? And if so, don\u2019t you either have to buy them in or grow them? And if so, and you neither have budget or a club that puts faith in a (preposterously successful) academy, aren\u2019t you f*cked? Poor Maurizio.\u201d I definitely get this point. He only really brought Jorginho in during the summer to dictate his style but after that he has been trying to effect a huge sea change amon the existing bunch. It needs time. 69 min: Neal Butler is back and has a reply for Ian Burch \u2013 \u201cTo counter Ian Burch\u2019s mail \u2013 I became a Chelsea fan during Glenn Hoddle\u2019s reign, as Ruud Gullit was my favourite player at the time; but I would love to see Sarri given time. It\u2019s nice to not have an objectionable boss like Mourinho, or a moaner like Conte. And it would be nice to have the same face in the dugout for more than two seasons ...\u201d This is nice, reasoned, polite debate between readers. Every internet user should have a copy of this. 66 min: No further goals in Betis v Rennes, while we\u2019ve had one here, so who\u2019s having a terrible time now? 64 min: Chelsea briefly think they have another after Kante, who is finding spaces to course through now, makes more ground and finds Barkley via a ricochet. He finishes well but is correctly flagged offside. 62 min: A Malmo change as they look to turn this around. Rosenberg picked up an injury just now and goes off. On comes another striker, Strandberg. 61 min: Sarri IN? Not according to self-confessed Chelsea old timer Ian Burch ... \u201cThere is a real disparity of opinions on social media disgrace Twitter about Sarri and his brand of football. The younger PlayStation generation of Chelsea fans are all in favour of him and lay the blame for the situation he finds himself in on the players. The old cynical lags want him out and feel that the emperor has no clothes. Arguments abound and are quite vitriolic. Seeing it\u2019s the older generation which actually goes to the games rather than watching it on illegal streams online at home then I can understand why they\u2019re fuming. Personally I can see sh*t on a stick when I see it and he should be told to do one asap which obviously gives my age away.\u201d 59 min: \u201cSince this match isn\u2019t up to much, can we talk balls?\u201d asks Peter Oh. \u201cNo, not Diego Simeone-style cojones. The match ball. I noticed that the Europa League has ditched the usual Adidas in favour of a ball made by Japanese outfit Molten. As far as I know, they\u2019ve built their reputation on their volleyballs and basketballs and this could be their most high-profile foray into the football market. From spikes and slam dunks to Sarriball!\u201d We\u2019ve learned something there, well I have anyway, so all\u2019s not lost after all. 58 min: In a way that ... wait for it ... doesn\u2019t change anything, because Malmo still need to score twice and would force extra time if they do. But in fact it changes a lot because it\u2019ll surely relax Chelsea and just one more goal would totally nail it. Ok, that probably does it. And it\u2019s a good goal, Kante leaping onto a loose Malmo header in midfield and driving through a chasm in the heart of the pitch before laying left to an open Willian. His slide-rule centre is met by Giroud, who finishes clinically. 54 min: We resume, the miscreant having presumably been ushered into the warm, and while we press on with this Kari Tulinius is having a nice time \u2013 \u201cI can confirm that Real Betis v. Rennes is a very entertaining game worth anyone\u2019s time, two excellent and well-matched attacking teams playing each other. Also, on a human level seeing Hatem Ben Arfa enjoying himself on the football field is always a cheerful sight.\u201d 52 min: Another yellow, this time for Bengtsson, who absolutely slices through Barkley. We have a pitch invader in the meantime and, though it be after the watershed, the camera studiously pans to Sarri. Which do Chelseas fans find the more offensive, though? 51 min: Now Christiansen is booked, though, for preventing Emerson from surging deep into the Malmo half. 50 min: Now then, Malmo win a corner after Azpilicueta heads a good Vindheim cross behind. Can they make this interesting? It\u2019s worked to Christiansen, whose delivery to the back post is very tempting indeed, but Emerson defends it excellently under pressure. 48 min: We can see now. And we\u2019ve just seen Hudson-Odoi cause a few more gasps with an extravagant spin on the ball, but it doesn\u2019t quite come off and Malmo\u2019s defence block. 47 min: Some sort of smoke bomb has gone off from the away end and we can\u2019t see a lot, which is no loss etcetera and so forth. No doubt that will incur the fury of UEFA. Until the fog clears, an email from Ciaran Crowther that I pretty much entirely agree with: \u201cI believe Sarri could mould Chelsea in his image and compete for trophies if given time. But on the evidence of recent games as well as the dross his team is serving up tonight, a couple of batterings at the hands of Man City and Spurs will probably be the last straw for Granovskaia and co. And the vicious cycle of managerial hirings and firings at Chelsea continues.\u201d Ok, let\u2019s say it, this is going to be great! If this were UK politics I\u2019d be agitating for a breakaway group of MBM aficionados to salivate over Real Betis v Rennes, which the French side lead 2-1 (and 5-4 on aggregate) at the break. Tantalisingly poised! Neal Butler, writing in from New Mexico, has wider concerns about Sarri\u2019s side this season and lists them thus: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of how Kovacic is usually deployed on the left. He seems to spend a lot of time dropping back to cover for Alonso and Luiz. I\u2019m curious as to why Kante doesn\u2019t play that side, if Sarri absolutely has to field those two shmucks on the left side of defence. \u201cI also have concerns about Luiz and Alonso. I\u2019m not a fan of the Mourinho-esque preference for Alonso simply because he is tall, and I\u2019d love to see Christensen get his mojo back and displace Luiz \u2013 I don\u2019t recall the opposition, but after he was at fault for goals in two matches in a row last season, he just seemed to have a crisis of confidence, and still isn\u2019t back to the level he was at during Conte\u2019s first year in charge. \u201cOther than that ... Well, they are just too over-reliant on Hazard, really. Willian and Pedro seems to have become diligent, workmanlike wingers, rather than real creators. Like most Chelsea fans, I want to see Hudson-Odoi get more playing time, if only for something different on the pitch.\u201d I mean, look, Malmo began with a lot of intent and had a couple of decent early openings, particularly the Rosenberg shot that went just wide. But they ran out of puff after the 20-minute mark and Chelsea started using the ball with more care, without really creating much. Hudson-Odoi has looked lively in spells but you\u2019d want that, given a chance like this. Apart from that I don\u2019t have a lot for you. Chelsea will probably sneak a winner during the second half as Malmo, who will not score two goals here, tire. I\u2019d like to say that this is bound to get more exciting after the break but I don\u2019t think that, so I won\u2019t say it. 44 min: Vindheim is booked for fouling Kovacic after Malmo, given a little encouragement by Rosenberg\u2019s pursuit of a bouncing ball with Rudiger, up the tempo again for a bit. 43 min: Malmo have, as predicted, not managed to keep that early press up and I\u2019m not sure what else they have, really. They are sitting off now and allowing Chelsea to do what they want. Which is to pass. A lot. We need a laugh tonight, I\u2019ll take it. 40 min: Barkley shoots optimistically from 25 yards and forces Dahlin to gather down to his right. 38 min: Malmo now head another Chelsea corner away and it\u2019s they, at this point, who can\u2019t really get a grip on anything. Not that they\u2019re being run ragged, because Chelsea are *definitely* not doing that to them. 37 min: Bengtsson clears at the near post after Hudson-Odoi\u2019s radar-like crossfield ball to Willian is spirited along to Emerson, who delivers first-time. 35 min: They have taken their sweet time about it but Chelsea are getting a bit of a grip. Giroud heads back a Willian free-kick at the far post but Malmo hack it away before anyone can run onto the loose ball. 32 min: Hudson-Odoi wins Chelsea a corner on that right side. It\u2019s nicely worked between him and Willian, before the latter slides a delivery towards the near post and Azpilicueta, diving in among a ruck of players, gets a touch but sees Dahlin block. It\u2019s the closest Chelsea have come so far! 31 min: Now Hudson-Odoi brings the ball down inside his own box before scorching fully 40 yards up the flank. He\u2019s stopped agriculturally by Safari, who takes a booking. We are, at least, beginning to see a little more of what he can do. 29 min: Hudson-Odoi causes the first \u201cooohs\u201d of the night with a lovely bit of skill to lose his man in midfield. He\u2019s had his lively moments, but also one sloppy bit of play that almost cost his team dearly. 28 min: I\u2019ll say it again, Malmo aren\u2019t good enough to capitalise on this but Chelsea are very, very panicky whenever they are pressured on the ball. They have hardly constructed a thing here, really. 26 min: Malmo win a promising throw-in, again because of their ferocious press, but the return pass is laid straight out of play. It\u2019s become that sort of night. 24 min: Still not a lot happening. Chelsea are not exactly constructing things at speed. Heard that before? Malmo, still keen, are winning more than their fair share of the 50/50s but their threat has dulled a bit. 22 min: A quite lengthy lull. I\u2019m not going to pretend this looks like being a classic. It really needs a Malmo goal. They\u2019re trying, I\u2019ll give them that. 19 min: Vindheim volleys a delicious ball across goal but Rosenberg doesn\u2019t gamble and isn\u2019t placed to convert. Malmo have had decent ideas and good positions but I just don\u2019t think they\u2019ll have a finisher here. Chelsea don\u2019t yet, either, as Barkley drills low at Dahlin after a Hudson-Odoi jink inside. 17 min: Giroud has a right-footed shot blocked by Safari from an angle, after better work from Hudson-Odoi. Then Barkley is booked for bundling over the breaking Christiansen. Chelsea continue to be a little ragged. 16 min: A long spell of Sarriball constructive, considered Chelsea possession, now, as they look to take the sting out of Malmo\u2019s fast start. 13 min: A better bit of play from Chelsea, Emerson seeing a cross-shot blocked by the goalkeeper, Dahlin. But then Malmo come very close! It\u2019s a sloppy touch from Hudson-Odoi just outside his own box and Rosenberg grabs the ball, sashaying into the area and flashing a shot inches wide! 12 min: Malmo are really penning Chelsea in when they try to play from the back. The home side are finding it very hard to get out although I\u2019m not really sure how long the Swedes can keep this up for. Their league season doesn\u2019t start for five weeks. 10 min: The Swedes have another nibble at Chelsea, Traustason hitting a snap shot well wide from an angle. They are having a go here. 9 min: Christiansen aims a diagonal towards Antonsson but it\u2019s just over his head and floats off for a goal kick. Malmo have started aggressively, with a very high press, but it\u2019s going to be a big ask for them to score twice here. 6 min: An awful ball from Kovacic in midfield is seized upon by Antonsson but he hasn\u2019t got the pace to get away down the middle and inflict punishment. Then we see our first bit of Hudson-Odoi, and indeed Chelsea, as the young winger delivers from the right but sees a twisting Giroud head well over. 4 min: Malmo have the first chance to sling one into the box after Rudiger fouls Rieks on the left. A chance to torment Chelsea from one of those set-pieces? They do indeed cause a flutter \u2013 Safari\u2019s delivery is cleared but Vindheim, driving it back in, sees his cross met by a powerful header from Bengtsson. It doesn\u2019t drop far wide at all. 2 min: Nothing much to report yet. Chelsea with most of the early \u201cball\u201d, as our rugby-loving friends would say, but Malmo have got their foot on it once or twice too. Will tonight be sleepy or seismic? The teams are coming out at the Bridge now. Cheers tonight, not boos just yet. Malmo are noisily repped by 2,900 away fans. It\u2019s nearly time ... Suspected as much. Chelsea fans, any real concerns about this one? It feels like the calm before the Sarri-storm. Uwe Rosler, the Malmo boss and all-round lovely guy, has just been on. He says Malmo will be looking to Markus Rosenberg, the 36-year-old striker who had a rather bleak stint at West Brom, to inspire them tonight. He also thinks they can hurt Chelsea at set-pieces. Want to see some full-times from the early games? It\u2019s been a good night for many of the big dogs so far, meaning that we should see some nice last-16 ties as this tournament whittles down. Arsenal 3-0 BATE (3-1 agg); Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 Shakhtar (6-3 agg); Valencia 1-0 Celtic (3-0 agg); Red Bull Salzburg 4-0 Club Brugge (5-2 agg); Villarreal 1-1 Sporting (2-1 agg); Dinamo Zagreb 3-0 Plzen (4-2 agg); Zenit 3-1 Fenerbahce (3-2 agg); Napoli 2-0 Zurich (5-1 agg). Still, it\u2019ll be nice to see Hudson-Odoi, eh? Haven\u2019t really had many chances yet to see what it is Bayern Munich are so hellbent on paying for, and really the lad needs a run of games for us to truly appreciate his gifts. But this is a nice chance for him to make a difference against moderate opponents and perhaps emphasise that he really ought to be involved more. Note also, from that Chelsea team news we saw, that Jorginho is among the subs while Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain are there for emergencies. That tie now seems to be over, though, as the German side have scored again within moments of Shakhtar hitting the bar! Told you it was fun. I\u2019d be very interested to see them up against Chelsea or Arsenal. Confession: I\u2019m currently watching Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 Shakhtar Donetsk (4-3 agg), which is an absolutely belting game. Chelsea have been linked with Frankfurt\u2019s brilliant young striker, Luka Jovic, who scored one of those goals, so there\u2019s a connection! Oh and Valencia v Celtic is pretty much wrapped up too but, again, Paul Doyle is better-placed to tell you that: Arsenal are, I\u2019d say, home and hosed against BATE Borisov. It\u2019s 3-0 (3-1 agg) there with 17 to play. Scott Murray will steer you smoothly through the rest before we get immersed in this one: Chelsea: Caballero, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger, Emerson, Kovacic, Kante, Barkley, Hudson-Odoi, Willian, Giroud. Subs: Cumming, David Luiz, Ampadu, Jorginho, Loftus-Cheek, Hazard, Higuain. Malmo: Dahlin, Safari, Bengtsson, Christiansen, Nielsen, Rieks, Vindheim, Bachirou, Traustason, Antonsson, Rosenberg. Subs: Ahmedhodzic, Binaku, Gall, Larsson, Lewicki, Melicharek, Strandberg. Funny one for Chelsea, this one, isn\u2019t it? It feels like a bit of a distraction before we get around to the *actual* judgement day. They\u2019ll ... surely? ... do enough against a Malmo side they managed to beat 2-1 away without being at their best, but that won\u2019t really tell us much about the burning issue at hand: will Maurizio Sarri keep his job? A week from now, once they\u2019ve played Manchester City in the League Cup final and Spurs in the top flight, we\u2019ll probably know the answer to that, but I\u2019m not sure anything we see tonight will make a massive difference. That said! There is still a job to do and Malmo did, at times, look quite lively next week. If the Swedish team score first you can bet it will get very antsy inside Stamford Bridge. More chants of \u201cF*ck Sarriball\u201d (which I thought were ridiculous, by the way)? And if they don\u2019t, and Chelsea really turn up and turn it on, then it\u2019ll be a very nice pep before face ... errrm ... Pep at Wembley on Sunday. So let\u2019s see if we have a real game of things tonight. From a neutral perspective, I really hope we do. Do send your emails in and tell me what you\u2019re expecting \u2013 and perhaps we can grapple a little bit with the question of whether Sarri should, indeed, be under as much pressure as he currently seems to be. Kick-off is at 8pm, UK time!",

The prop appeared in all three British &amp; Irish Lions Tests against New Zealand under Gatland in 2017 and has gone on to establish himself as England\u2019s first-choice tighthead. In both their Six Nations matches so far he has been involved in flashpoints, however, with Ireland\u2019s Peter O\u2019Mahony and France\u2019s Arthur Iturria.</p> <p>\u201cThere is sometimes a challenge with temperament,\u201d said Gatland, who brushed off speculation linking him with the England job after Jones leaves his role. \u201cHe is aware of it, as are other players. He has been involved in a couple of incidents this Six Nations. Emotionally he can be a bit of a timebomb. We will not be going out to antagonise him but the big challenge for him is to keep his emotions under control.\u201d</p> <p>England have informed Wales of their decision to keep the Principality Stadium\u2019s roof open, as was the case two years ago \u2013 with Jones stating: \u201cIt\u2019s still a winter sport, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/19/jonny-may-england-six-nations-form-psychological-effect\">My form is having a mental effect on England\u2019s opponents, says Jonny May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gatland consistently questions why it is not Wales\u2019s choice but believes England decision not to travel earlier will be more costly. \u201cI think it is a significant mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through Newport at 5pm on a Friday is not the best thing to do and it will be an experience for them with tractors and buses holding things up.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has a 100% record in his four matches against Wales, and an England victory would put them two wins away from the grand slam.

      "bodyText": "Warren Gatland has responded to Eddie Jones\u2019s attempts to wind up Wales before the Six Nations game on Saturday by describing the England tighthead Kyle Sinckler as an \u201cemotional timebomb\u201d. Gatland also called England\u2019s decision to delay their journey to Cardiff until Friday afternoon as a \u201csignificant mistake\u201d and dismissed Jones\u2019s claim that Gatland\u2019s current side are the greatest in Welsh history. The England coach had earlier questioned whether Wales can handle the expectation that comes with seeking a record 12th consecutive win in what will be Gatland\u2019s last Six Nations match against England. It is the dig at Sinckler which resonates most, however. The prop appeared in all three British &amp; Irish Lions Tests against New Zealand under Gatland in 2017 and has gone on to establish himself as England\u2019s first-choice tighthead. In both their Six Nations matches so far he has been involved in flashpoints, however, with Ireland\u2019s Peter O\u2019Mahony and France\u2019s Arthur Iturria. \u201cThere is sometimes a challenge with temperament,\u201d said Gatland, who brushed off speculation linking him with the England job after Jones leaves his role. \u201cHe is aware of it, as are other players. He has been involved in a couple of incidents this Six Nations. Emotionally he can be a bit of a timebomb. We will not be going out to antagonise him but the big challenge for him is to keep his emotions under control.\u201d England have informed Wales of their decision to keep the Principality Stadium\u2019s roof open, as was the case two years ago \u2013 with Jones stating: \u201cIt\u2019s still a winter sport, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Gatland consistently questions why it is not Wales\u2019s choice but believes England decision not to travel earlier will be more costly. \u201cI think it is a significant mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through Newport at 5pm on a Friday is not the best thing to do and it will be an experience for them with tractors and buses holding things up.\u201d Jones has a 100% record in his four matches against Wales, and an England victory would put them two wins away from the grand slam. It is the first time he and Gatland have locked horns in Cardiff, however. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be full of emotions,\u201d Jones added. \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying they\u2019re ready to rip off heads \u2026 the senior players are holding them back. It\u2019s Warren\u2019s last game [against us] as Wales coach, it\u2019s a big week for them, a lot of expectation. That can either be wind in your sails or a ball and chain.\u201d Gatland moved to play down the pressure on his side. \u201cThe only quotes I can see about this being the greatest Wales team are from Eddie Jones,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be disrespectful enough to say this was the greatest Welsh team ever. It\u2019s a long way off being the greatest Welsh team ever. He\u2019s the one talking us up.\u201d",

Chelsea may have left it late to impose themselves properly on Malm\u00f6 and smooth passage into the last 16 of the Europa League but, at present, any kind of victory is to be celebrated by head coach and club alike.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/21/chelsea-malmo-maurizio-sarri-europa-league\">Chelsea win against Malm\u00f6 gives Maurizio Sarri some breathing space | Ed Aarons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There had been periods in both games when the Premier League side had seemed stretched by Swedish opponents essentially still in pre-season, but as the visitors tired, their numbers depleted after Rasmus Bengtsson\u2019s dismissal for a pair of desperate fouls, Chelsea\u2019s quality told. It was fitting Callum Hudson-Odoi, one of the few in home ranks whose display had not initially been cramped by nerves, should fizz in the third goal late on, even if there was an irony he had made the occasion feel so comfortable given how hard the 18-year-old has found it to convince Sarri he deserves proper involvement.</p> <p>Even picking Hudson-Odoi for a first start since the closure of the transfer window, and his failed attempt to force a move to Bayern Munich, had at least lifted the local gloom. The winger offers something different to so much of the dirge served up of late. He is skilful, quick and unpredictable in the final third, and now has three goals and as many assists from six starts this term. None have been in the Premier League, however. \u201cHopefully I did well and made an impact,\u201d the winger offered.</p> <p>Sarri has been more wary of the innocence of youth, presumably fearing ill-discipline might undermine the collective effort, and must have winced at the youngster\u2019s slack touch when the game was goalless and which presented Markus Rosenberg with Malm\u00f6\u2019s clearest chance. But Chelsea needed something fresh and exciting to lift spirits, and the sight of Hudson-Odoi tearing away down the right, spreading panic, served a purpose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/jorginho-malmo-chelsea-sarri\">Sarri: slow start against Malm\u00f6 showed Jorghino\u2019s importance to Chelsea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether Sarri will now consider Hudson-Odoi\u2019s credentials for the Carabao Cup final is less certain. \u201cCallum is 18 and has to improve a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are using him in the right way at the moment, and the 20 matches this season will be 30 matches in the next, and 40 in two years. People need to understand that in the same position we have Pedro, Willian and [Eden] Hazard.</p> <p>\u201cI want to remind you that Callum, with this game, has played 14 matches. In England this season, there isn\u2019t another 18-year-old player with 14 matches in the first-team.\u201d That conveniently overlooked the games played by Phil Foden and Ryan Sessegnon at Manchester City and Fulham respectively.</p> <p>Sarri pointed to the impact made by Emerson Palmieri, who drew the foul from Bengtsson which saw the centre-half dismissed 17 minutes from time, and Andreas Christensen. The suspicion remains that the same old suspects, those overwhelmed at the Etihad a few weeks ago, will probably start at Wembley, when the respite offered up by Europe will seem a distant memory. That is the truer test of this team\u2019s ability to recover their poise, and may determine the manager\u2019s future, particularly with Tottenham lying in wait just a few days later back at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>At least Sarri, who had endured the locals\u2019 frustration as their defence of the FA Cup petered out in disappointment earlier in the week, escaped a barracking from the sidelines. He remains without his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, who has suffered complications after a gallstone problem, and cut a lonely, agitated figure on the sidelines at times, forever fretting beyond the fringes of his technical area and sucking ever more deeply on the cigarette butt which is supposed to serve as a comforter. It offered no solace through that anxious opening half hour, when Malm\u00f6 had pinned his team back and the nerves gripped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/05/the-fiver-email-sign-up\">Sign up to The Fiver email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Order was only really restored after the moment Willian conjured a step-over and burst to the byline, reassuring Chelsea\u2019s senior players of their quality. They would prove ruthless after the interval, as the Swedes chased the tie and left themselves open on the counterattack. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s anticipation, bursting forward from the halfway line to intercept Lasse Nielsen\u2019s stray header, would force the home side ahead. Kant\u00e9 would not be caught, with Malm\u00f6\u2019s rearguard suddenly ragged, before he fed the overlapping Willian down the left.

      "bodyText": "Maurizio Sarri limps on, his tenure surely extended to a Wembley cup final on Sunday and that daunting collision with Manchester City at the very least. Chelsea may have left it late to impose themselves properly on Malm\u00f6 and smooth passage into the last 16 of the Europa League but, at present, any kind of victory is to be celebrated by head coach and club alike. There had been periods in both games when the Premier League side had seemed stretched by Swedish opponents essentially still in pre-season, but as the visitors tired, their numbers depleted after Rasmus Bengtsson\u2019s dismissal for a pair of desperate fouls, Chelsea\u2019s quality told. It was fitting Callum Hudson-Odoi, one of the few in home ranks whose display had not initially been cramped by nerves, should fizz in the third goal late on, even if there was an irony he had made the occasion feel so comfortable given how hard the 18-year-old has found it to convince Sarri he deserves proper involvement. Even picking Hudson-Odoi for a first start since the closure of the transfer window, and his failed attempt to force a move to Bayern Munich, had at least lifted the local gloom. The winger offers something different to so much of the dirge served up of late. He is skilful, quick and unpredictable in the final third, and now has three goals and as many assists from six starts this term. None have been in the Premier League, however. \u201cHopefully I did well and made an impact,\u201d the winger offered. Sarri has been more wary of the innocence of youth, presumably fearing ill-discipline might undermine the collective effort, and must have winced at the youngster\u2019s slack touch when the game was goalless and which presented Markus Rosenberg with Malm\u00f6\u2019s clearest chance. But Chelsea needed something fresh and exciting to lift spirits, and the sight of Hudson-Odoi tearing away down the right, spreading panic, served a purpose. Whether Sarri will now consider Hudson-Odoi\u2019s credentials for the Carabao Cup final is less certain. \u201cCallum is 18 and has to improve a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are using him in the right way at the moment, and the 20 matches this season will be 30 matches in the next, and 40 in two years. People need to understand that in the same position we have Pedro, Willian and [Eden] Hazard. \u201cI want to remind you that Callum, with this game, has played 14 matches. In England this season, there isn\u2019t another 18-year-old player with 14 matches in the first-team.\u201d That conveniently overlooked the games played by Phil Foden and Ryan Sessegnon at Manchester City and Fulham respectively. Sarri pointed to the impact made by Emerson Palmieri, who drew the foul from Bengtsson which saw the centre-half dismissed 17 minutes from time, and Andreas Christensen. The suspicion remains that the same old suspects, those overwhelmed at the Etihad a few weeks ago, will probably start at Wembley, when the respite offered up by Europe will seem a distant memory. That is the truer test of this team\u2019s ability to recover their poise, and may determine the manager\u2019s future, particularly with Tottenham lying in wait just a few days later back at Stamford Bridge. At least Sarri, who had endured the locals\u2019 frustration as their defence of the FA Cup petered out in disappointment earlier in the week, escaped a barracking from the sidelines. He remains without his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, who has suffered complications after a gallstone problem, and cut a lonely, agitated figure on the sidelines at times, forever fretting beyond the fringes of his technical area and sucking ever more deeply on the cigarette butt which is supposed to serve as a comforter. It offered no solace through that anxious opening half hour, when Malm\u00f6 had pinned his team back and the nerves gripped. Order was only really restored after the moment Willian conjured a step-over and burst to the byline, reassuring Chelsea\u2019s senior players of their quality. They would prove ruthless after the interval, as the Swedes chased the tie and left themselves open on the counterattack. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s anticipation, bursting forward from the halfway line to intercept Lasse Nielsen\u2019s stray header, would force the home side ahead. Kant\u00e9 would not be caught, with Malm\u00f6\u2019s rearguard suddenly ragged, before he fed the overlapping Willian down the left. The Brazilian\u2019s cross was pinpoint for Olivier Giroud to prod home a sixth goal in seven Europa League matches this term. That deflated the visitors whose own deficiencies, both in terms of quality and basic fitness, had finally been exposed. Ross Barkley curled in a free-kick in the wake of Bengtsson\u2019s sending off, before Hudson-Odoi made his favourable impression near the end. A far sterner test than this awaits at Wembley. \u201cYou want me to be honest?\u201d asked Malm\u00f6\u2019s manager, the former City striker Uwe R\u00f6sler, when asked if he had spied signs Sarri\u2019s team would offer sterner resistance in the final than they did at the Etihad earlier this month. \u201cCity are another calibre to us. They will ask more questions of Chelsea.\u201d It was impossible to disagree.",

      "bodyText": "Golden State Warriors center DeMarcus Cousins has attacked college basketball after the game\u2019s top prospect, Zion Williamson, suffered a scary injury on Wednesday night. Williamson, who is expected to be the No1 overall pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft and is tipped as a future superstar in the pros, hurt his knee playing for Duke against North Carolina. The 18-year-old suffered the injury when his shoe fell apart, and at first some feared it could be a career-changing incident. It later transpired the knee was sprained although Williamson may miss the rest of the season. The injury highlighted the lack of a safety net for college players.

A headline about the far-right extremist Blair Cottrell losing a high court case appeared on the homepage with the headline \u201cActivist loses free speech bid\u201d. The original AAP report had been headed: \u201cFar-right leader Blair Cottrell fails in high court bid\u201d. Psyched up for Q&amp;A Canadian psychologist and writer Jordan Peterson has been touring Australia and New Zealand this week and sections of the media are very excited. The Australian\u2019s resident Peterson correspondent, Caroline Overington, has described him as \u201cthe 21st century\u2019s first rock-star psychologist\u201d in one of her many articles. This week she lamented he wouldn\u2019t get a fair hearing on Q&amp;A when he appears on Monday. \u201cI still fear an ambush,\u201d said one of the Oz readers Overington quoted. \u201cHe will be the one voice of sanity. But that one voice can be drowned out and suppressed by the rabid mob that is Q&amp;A.\u201d Overington described the invitation to appear on Tony Jones\u2019s show as \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cmiraculous\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t just the Oz that was excited to welcome the charismatic conservative speaker. The Young IPA Podcast, hosted by James Bolt and Peter Gregory, dedicated an hour to interviewing Peterson\u2019s warm-up guy, US political commentator Dave Rubin. (Yes James Bolt is the son of Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt.) Rubin is no fan of the Australian media, referring to the \u201chit pieces\u201d which keep appearing. He said the Australian audience for Peterson was similar to that in the US and Europe in their belief that \u201cthe mob is coming for them and free speech is being killed\u201d. \u201cThis is the media world we live in,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cJordan is popular so the media has a vested interest in attacking him because they know it will get them clicks. And there\u2019s very little journalistic integrity left, apparently worldwide. I thought it was just an American phenomenon but it\u2019s pretty much everywhere.\u201d Playing it by the book The Herald Sun splashed with a story last May about local councils banning books and toys that used the terms boy and girl. \u201cBAN THE BOOKS: Councils\u2019 gender war to hit kinders, libraries\u201d was continued inside the paper under the headline \u201cFavourite children\u2019s tales face gender ban\u201d. \u201cVictorian councils are auditing libraries, schools and kindergartens and urging a ban on the terms \u2018boy\u2019 and \u2018girl\u2019 in a bid to teach kids as young as three to have \u2018gender equitable relationships\u2019,\u201d the paper reported. The Municipal Association of Victoria issued a statement on the day the article appeared: \u201cThere will be no book or toy bans\u201d. This week the Australian Press Council slapped the Hun over the wrist for breaching standards of accuracy and fairness because it could not find \u201cany instance where banning of books was proceeding\u201d. ABC veteran ticked off? The ABC\u2019s acting managing director, David Anderson, was scheduled to appear at Senate estimates on Tuesday in what one report described as a \u201cjob interview\u201d for the managing director position, which has just been advertised. But poor old Dave, an affable ABC veteran, was struck down with an illness before he could front up to the Canberra stage. He was very ill because he had been bitten by a tick, was the whisper in Canberra. But the truth was a little more prosaic. The head of television and entertainment at Aunty was indeed bitten by a tick last year, but he simply had the flu.",

His endearing personality, willingness to engage in goofy stunts and odd turns of phrase have made him a cult figure with Nintendo\u2019s fans: at 2004\u2019s E3 video game conference, he introduced himself on stage with the now-infamous words \u201cMy name is Reggie, I\u2019m about kickin\u2019 ass, I\u2019m about takin\u2019 names, and we\u2019re about makin\u2019 games.\u201d In a video message accompanying the announcement on Thursday, Fils-Aime paid tribute to his successor, Doug Bowser, as well as Nintendo\u2019s fans. \u201cThank-you for your never-ending support and for your passionate love of Nintendo \u2013 and personally, for giving me a Mushroom Kingdom full of memories that I will never forget \u2026 I realise that Nintendo fans share a sense of community that goes beyond video games. For these past 15 years I have been honoured to be included as part of your family.\u201d Bowser will take over as president of Nintendo of America on 16 April. He joined Nintendo in 2015, having previously worked at Electronic Arts and Procter and Gamble. He oversaw the launch of the Nintendo Switch, which has sold over 9m units in the US. In a statement, Nintendo\u2019s global president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said: \u201cI really appreciate everything Reggie has done for Nintendo. Inside and outside our company, Reggie is known as an exceptional leader. We are grateful that he is leaving the business in good shape with strong momentum. While we will miss him and we wish him the very best in his retirement, we are also pleased to have such an able successor ready to step into that role. Doug Bowser and the rest of the team will ensure a seamless transition and continued momentum for Nintendo.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of the six California police officers who fired a barrage of bullets at Willie McCoy at a Vallejo Taco Bell had previously shot and killed an unarmed man and is the subject of an ongoing excessive force lawsuit. A second officer had been sued by the family of a Vallejo teenager in a police brutality case. The Vallejo officer Ryan McMahon and five other policemen fired at McCoy, a 20-year-old aspiring rapper, after officers woke him up inside his car at a fast-food drive through earlier this month. McCoy died at the scene. The McCoy family\u2019s attorney, who recently viewed the young man\u2019s body, said he was hit by what appeared to be roughly 25 shots, including in his face, throat, chest, ear and arms. His loved ones have called the death an \u201cexecution by a firing squad\u201d and have accused police of racial profiling. The department released the names of the six officers on Wednesday night in response to a Bay Area News Group records request. They were Ryan McMahon, Collin Eaton, Bryan Glick, Jordon Patzer, Anthony Romero-Cano and Mark Thompson. Officer McMahon, who has been on the force for more than seven years, shot an unarmed black father of two just last year. On 13 February 2018, McMahon stopped Ronnell Foster, 32, who was riding his bike in downtown Vallejo. Foster fled toward an alley, prompting McMahon to chase after him and strike him over the head with a flashlight, according to a federal complaint. McMahon eventually shot Foster several times in the back and the back of his head. The department claimed McMahon fired the fatal shots after Foster took the officer\u2019s flashlight and raised it in a threatening manner, but an eyewitness disputed that account. The complaint noted there was no evidence that the officer was injured in any way, and when he called in the shooting to dispatch, his only statement was that Foster had fled from him. It is unclear why McMahon followed or stopped Foster in the first place. Foster left behind two children, now ages six and 14.

Arsenal had 70 percent possession in the first leg, so they\u2019ll be confident of digging themselves out of this hole. The last 16 awaits. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> Everyone should, because scheduling a weekday match at 5.55pm is a rum do and no mistake.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T16:57:58.531Z\">at 4.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s your lot. Amy Lawrence was at the Emirates, and here\u2019s her verdict. Thanks for reading! Nighty night! Unai Emery speaks to BT Sport: \u201cThe result is good. We are improving, and our mentality was good for this match. This competition is important for us, and the result in the first match was not good. So the team did very well to come back. We spoke this morning, and in the dressing room before the match: if we score, carry on. If we score a second goal, carry on. If we score a third goal, carry on. We need this mentality. The players did the gameplan like we want.\u201d Some post-match platitudes from Arsenal\u2019s goalscorers. \u201cIt was better than last week,\u201d begins Shkodran Mustafi. \u201cWe managed it well. We showed that we wanted to play our game and score our goals. We work on our set pieces and it was good that it paid off. There is a lot to improve still, but we are doing well.\u201d Sokratis Papastathopoulos adds: \u201cWe are happy and now we look to the next game. The Europa League is very important for us.\u201d And that\u2019s that! Arsenal are through to the last 16 of the Europa League, Unai Emery\u2019s dream of a fourth title still alive. The Gunners were thoroughly professional tonight. They went ahead early, and after surviving a couple of scares during a brief spell when BATE threatened an away goal, eased clear of limited opponents. \u201cYour Portuguese-speaking readers might get a kick out of the fact that \u2018Arsenal bate Borisov\u2019 means \u2018Arsenal beats Borisov\u2019,\u201d notes Peter Oh. 90 min +2: Dubajic shoulder barges Monreal to the floor. It\u2019s a garden-variety foul, but Xhaka takes great exception to it and races in, chest out, baiting Dubajic like Scrappy Doo. For goodness sake, man, you\u2019ve won the match and there are about ten seconds to go! A totally disproportionate response to not very much. He\u2019s lucky the ref doesn\u2019t at least book him, because he\u2019s right up in the official\u2019s grille, swearing like billy-o. 90 min +1: But that\u2019s not going to happen, is it. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. A goal a minute, and BATE are through on away goals. 88 min: More of the Arsenal possession. It\u2019s been a thoroughly drama-free second half. The loudest noise for a while is generated when the guy on the PA announces that Finsbury Park tube station is shut, causing all manner of effin\u2019 and jeffin\u2019. 86 min: Suarez and Ozil buzz around the edge of the BATE box, but can\u2019t find the combination to unlock the door. 84 min: A ball rears up in the BATE area and hits Simovic on the arm. The referee considers giving Arsenal a penalty, raising his whistle to his lips momentarily, but then changes his mind, perhaps after consultation with his linesman. 83 min: Arsenal continue to ping it around in the relaxed style. The crowd get a little agitated, because they\u2019d like to see a couple more goals whistling into the BATE net, but the players don\u2019t seem too fussed, which is fair enough given they\u2019re the ones who have done all the running tonight. 81 min: Arsenal play keep-ball in the midfield. Time is their pal now. 79 min: Mkhitaryan is replaced by Suarez. 78 min: A rare period of BATE possession in the Arsenal half. Simovic sends a heatseeker towards the top left from 30 yards. A really good effort from such a long way out, but always curling wide of the post. Cech calmly watches it sail out for a goal kick. 76 min: Aubameyang takes, fizzing the free kick through the wall but straight down the throat of Scherbitski, who has had a very good game if you factor out the unfortunate flap for Arsenal\u2019s third. 75 min: Volkov hangs out a tired leg to bring down Monreal, who was cutting in from the left, 30 yards from goal. A free kick, and Aubamayang fancies it. 74 min: Arsenal ping it about in the clock-watching fashion, just because they can. 72 min: BATE make their last change of the night, and almost certainly their last of their Europa League run. Dubajic comes on for Skavysh, who has run himself into the ground. 71 min: Mkhitaryan slips a clever pass down the inside-right channel to release Aubameyang into the area. He draws the keeper as he glides a little to the right, then dinks the ball over him towards the unguarded bottom left. Agonisingly, his effort bounces inches wide of the post. 70 min: Aubameyang jigs down the inside-right channel but upon reaching the byline can only slap a shot-cum-cross into the side netting. Torreira was waiting, hoping to be set up. 69 min: The Emirates is calm. Nothing much going on. A sense that everyone just wants to pack up and go home now. This is done. 67 min: Stasevich tries to clear, but slices backwards into the mixer. Mustafi wins a header, and the ball drops to Ozil, in a pocket of space 12 yards out, level with the left-hand post. He\u2019s not offside. In going for the near post, he flashes a first-time shot inches wide of the goal. A real chance; he smiles ruefully. 66 min: Iwobi races down the left and slips Monreal free on the overlap. Monreal\u2019s cross is deflected out for a corner, from which ... 64 min: It\u2019s all change at the minute, with Dragun, BATE\u2019s first-leg goalscoring hero, making way for Berezkin. 63 min: Guendouzi departs to warm applause. The Arsenal fans have taken to him. They\u2019re big fans of Torreira, too, and he\u2019s cheered to the rafters when he comes on. 62 min: Arsenal are as good as in the last 16 now, unless something very odd occurs, because BATE aren\u2019t doing anything in attack. Lichtsteiner clearing off the line seems an awfully long time ago now. Mkhitaryan bursts down the right and very nearly gets a shot away from a tight angle. Filipovic does extremely well to slide in and block for a corner. But it\u2019s only brief relief. Xhaka whips the corner towards the far post. Scherbitski comes off his line to punch, but makes an awful balls of it, flapping at thin air. Sokratis, only just on, heads home from a couple of yards. 58 min: Ozil is now wearing the captain\u2019s armband. He sends Iwobi away down the left; a dink to the far post is headed wide by Mkhitaryan. Then a lovely moment as former Arsenal midfielder Alex Hleb comes on for Baga. He\u2019s given an ovation of great warmth as he takes to the pitch. 57 min: The Arsenal captain is on the bench getting his calf checked out by the physio. Hopefully that\u2019s nothing too serious; he\u2019s had hellish luck with injury of late. 56 min: Koscielny has picked up a knock, and is replaced by Sokratis. 54 min: The corner leads to very little. 53 min: Rios slips a ball down the right for Skavysh, and for a second Arsenal are on the back foot. But Monreal holds him up well, and Arsenal break upfield. Iwobi drives into the BATE box from the left and tries a low curler towards the bottom right. Scherbitski parries well. BATE half clear, Mkhitaryan\u2019s shot from the right deflected out for a corner. 51 min: Ozil plays a cute ball down the inside-right channel to release Mkhitaryan into the BATE area. Mkhitaryan shapes to shoot but slips. The ball breaks back to Xhaka on the edge of the area. He balloons a wild effort off target. 49 min: A worrying game of pinball in the Arsenal box. Monreal falls over backwards while attempting to clear, and only succeeds in gifting the ball to Skavysh, who shifts his feet in tight space and snatches a shot straight at Cech. A reminder that one slip could cost Arsenal dear. 48 min: Now Guendouzi takes a potshot from outside the BATE area. That one\u2019s not on target either, but not a bad effort at all, looped in from the right and not a million miles away from the top corner. 47 min: Monreal has a dig from distance. No. Meanwhile here\u2019s Paul Bowes, who knows full well what I meant: \u201cWith regard to your remark at 29 minutes: surely Aubameyang has always been within his rights to shoot himself? But it seems excessive for one miscued shot.\u201d And we\u2019re off again! Arsenal get the second half underway; there have been no half-time changes in this Europa League tie. \u201cNot that it takes too much to turn my thoughts to the notion of heavy metal football, but crikey that Big Vase arm badge seems like a nod to The Object from Zep\u2019s seventh album,\u201d writes rock music\u2019s Grant Tennille. \u201cGiven the travel distances and fixture quantity, it\u2019s not a bad reference, really; considered to be a bit of a downer by all but the most committed fans, Jimmy Page always fancied it as their \u2018album against adversity\u2019.\u201d Half-time entertainment. There\u2019s been plenty of European action already this week, of course. Max Rushden and pals pick over the bones in Football Weekly. Enjoy! That brings a satisfactory half of football for Arsenal to an end. They should ease clear in the second half, but will remember that BATE seriously threatened during the early exchanges, and an away goal will change everything. Back in 15. No flipping! 45 min: Ozil, Iwobi and Guendouzi attack as a trio down the left flank. BATE are light at the back, and the correct passing sequence should send one of the three clear on goal. But Ozil goes inside to Guendouzi when he should find Iwobi on the left, then Guendouzi finds himself unable to reach Iwobi with a threaded pass. All three have the good grace to look frustrated. 43 min: Iwobi\u2019s brought down 30 yards from goal, just to the left of centre. Ozil takes it quickly, dinking a ball down the inside-left channel to release Aubameyang into the area. He\u2019s clear, but faced with a tight angle and Scherbitski again shows his quality by narrowing the angle further and denying the striker a chance to shoot. That\u2019s fine last-ditch keeping. 41 min: So this match can\u2019t go to extra time now. It could be over soon, too, if BATE don\u2019t clear their heads. Volkov plays a weak backpass down the Arsenal right, and Ozil nearly latches onto it. Not for the first time, Scherbitski does extremely well to read the danger, race from his box, and clear. Aubameyang\u2019s good work earns a corner on the left. Xhaka sends the set piece towards the penalty spot, where Mustafi rises above a dozy Baga and plants a header into the bottom left! Simple, and Arsenal hit the front in this tie for the first time. 38 min: This is much better from Mkhitaryan, who dances this way and that down the right wing, reaches the byline, and dinks a cross to the far post that\u2019s half cleared. The ball drops to Ozil, 12 yards out and level with the right-hand post. He creams a rising volley towards the top left ... but it\u2019s a little bit too high. Lovely effort, though. 36 min: Mkhitaryan drives towards the BATE box from the right wing. He\u2019s got Lichtsteiner on the overlap, and tries to release him into space, but the pass is no good, clanked at the full-back\u2019s feet instead of in front of him. Lichtsteiner has no chance to control, and that\u2019s the danger over. 34 min: Milic comes through the back of Mkhitaryan and is slightly fortunate to escape a booking. It\u2019s not exactly been a physical battle so far, and that might explain the referee\u2019s lenience. 33 min: The Iwobi-Monreal combination nearly opens BATE up down the left again. Not quite, but it\u2019s enough to earn another corner. From the set piece, the ball drops towards Lichtsteiner, who attempts a volley from 25 yards. No Matthew Le Tissier he. 32 min: Iwobi races down the left and slips Monreal clear on the overlap. Monreal cuts back towards Ozil, who takes a comedic fresh-air swipe at the ball. It breaks to Xhaka, trundling in from deep. Xhaka lashes a wild shot high and wide right. 30 min: Arsenal are beginning to find some rhythm. Iwobi tears down the left and floats one into the centre. Aubameyang heads harmlessly over. 29 min: Lichtsteiner hooks a cross into the mixer from the right. Aubameyang brings it down on the penalty spot, his back to goal. He spins and sends a pea-roller into the arms of Scherbitski. He had Ozil totally free to his left, though in fairness was within his rights to shoot himself. 28 min: Arsenal are beginning to press BATE back. Mkhitaryan reaches the byline to the left of goal, but his cutback doesn\u2019t find a red shirt. Again the visitors hack clear. 27 min: Monreal crosses deep from the left. Ozil, just to the right of the area, wedges it into the centre. Volkov does very well to head over his own bar under pressure from Aubameyang. Not a great deal occurs at the corner. 26 min: Ozil conducts from deep. He slips a ball wide for Mkhitaryan, who slams a low cross into the area. Filipenko hoicks clear. Guendouzi storms back at BATE and nearly releases Lichtsteiner down the right. Just a little too much pace on the pass. 24 min: As things stand, this match is going to extra time, and perhaps penalties. However it\u2019s hard to see both of these defences holding out for another 66 minutes plus stoppages. We\u2019re surely not here for the long haul. 22 min: Monreal makes his way down the left and hopes to break into the box. No luck, as he loses control and runs into Rios. He wants a penalty but that\u2019s never going to happen. 20 min: Xhaka sends a rising pearler towards the top left from 25 yards. It\u2019s a fine effort, but Scherbitski is behind it all the way and punches over. The resulting corner is worked to the right wing where Mkhitaryan flashes a low cross towards Aubameyang. Volkov is on hand to blooter clear. This game is fun, if a little frantic. 18 min: Milic dinks a ball down the left-hand channel. Lichtsteiner covers well, with Stasevich hovering. There were huge gaps in the Arsenal defence there; had BATE moved the ball quicker, there\u2019d have been bother. 16 min: Milic is OK to continue. A couple of corners for Arsenal out on the right, but nothing much comes of them. At least they\u2019ve calmed everything down, because BATE were beginning to build up a head of steam, a little uncertainty bubbling up in the stands. 14 min: Milic accidentally boots a stooping Koscielny in the grid, then injures himself falling awkwardly. A passage of play that in an ideal world would have been soundtracked by trombone slides. 12 min: Space for Stasevich out on the left. He reaches the byline and dinks one to the far post, but Skavysh can\u2019t get to it and Arsenal clear. BATE are threatening to score the away goal that\u2019d put the Gunners in all sorts of bother. 10 min: Then almost immediately, Arsenal break forward, Aubameyang chasing a long punt down the right. Scherbitski races from his area and clears to touch, just in time. Had he not got there, Aubameyang was clear. 9 min: And BATE come again! Baga surges down the right and loops a cross into the centre. Dragun meets the dropping ball, six yards out and level with the left-hand post, and drives goalwards. Lichtsteiner is forced to hack off the line! 8 min: But Arsenal can\u2019t get too carried away. One simple ball down the inside-right channel and Skavysh is romping ahead of Koscielny and into the Arsenal area. Hearts in mouths as he slams his shot into the side netting. Should have done so much better. 7 min: Ozil combines well with Iwobi down the inside-left channel. Reaching the byline, he cuts back for Mkhitaryan, who slashes a first-time shot miles over the bar, and wide to boot. He had more time than he thought. 6 min: Iwobi bustles down the left and earns another Arsenal corner. Ozil\u2019s delivery isn\u2019t all that, and Stasevich tries to break upfield. But Xhaka presses hard and wins the ball back immediately. It breaks to Iwobi, who is unchallenged on the left-hand corner of the box. He opens his body and attempts to send a curler into the top right. Not quite; it floats wide. But this is some start by Arsenal! The Gunners are level in the tie already! Aubameyang bombs down the right and crosses low. There\u2019s no red shirt nearby, but no worries, because Volkov, facing his own goal, hangs out a leg and slices the ball into the bottom left, his keeper wrong footed and given no chance. 3 min: Ozil\u2019s in the thick of it already, one-twoing with Xhaka down the left, then earning a corner off Volkov. The set piece is worked to Mkhitaryan, just to the left of the box. His low cross is punched clear by Scherbitski. 2 min: A fast start for Arsenal, as Guendouzi slips a fine ball down the right wing for Lichtsteiner to chase. Lichtsteiner whips in a low cross, and it\u2019s met by Iwobi, who slams a first-time shot straight at Scherbitski. That\u2019s got the crowd going! We\u2019re off! BATE get the second leg underway, all attention on the returning Mesut Ozil. On that subject, here\u2019s K\u00e1ri Tulinius: \u201cThrough the years Unai Emery has reminded me of several co-workers I\u2019ve had through the years who were excellent at their jobs but weren\u2019t there to socialize and make friends. Perfectly pleasant but a bit distant. However, at Arsenal it\u2019s all about his personality, especially his connection with \u00d6zil, while his work is merely good. Even here, in the cup where he\u2019s had his greatest triumphs, thoughts turn immediately to how \u00d6zil will perform, rather than the prospect of a title.\u201d The teams are out! Arsenal are in their famous red shirts with white sleeves, while BATE wear their first-choice yellow. The Emirates is far from full, but fans keep streaming in, and those already here are doing their best to make some noise. We\u2019ll be off in a minute, but before it all gets going, here\u2019s a wild idea from mad professor Charles Antaki: \u201cIf the Arsenal backroom staff were up to it, they might conjure a hybrid Lichtsteiner/Maitland-Niles to be a decent full back - young, athletic, purposeful, but wise, single-minded and not above some enjoyable tactical fouling. On the other hand the creature might as easily come out as old, positionally dodgy, prone to giving the ball away and just generally pants. Alternatively they could push Carl Jenkinson onto the field and hope for the best.\u201d Unai Emery talks to BT Sport! \u201cGood afternoon! We need to come back at home, push from the first minute to the 90th, and to be competitive. But they have shown that they are competitive too, and strong, and will continue doing their defensive work. We need passion, and must be clear with our game plan. Ozil is going to play and I am sure he is going to play a good match. We need every player to play well, and make combinations in attack near the box.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say this is unlikely to become one of those Great European Nights for the ages. The pre-match atmosphere at the Emirates is somewhat subdued, though you can\u2019t really blame the fans, simply because they\u2019re not there, so many unable to make this preposterous kick-off time. Arsenal fans desirous of finding a popular scapegoat will be thrilled to hear that Chelsea can be blamed for this farce in its entirety: because they\u2019re playing in the Europa League in London tonight too, they get first dibs on the later kick-off time, on account of having a better Uefa ranking. Pennant watch. Quality ceremonial memorabilia, much as you\u2019d expect from a classy old institution like The Arsenal. Just a shame about the badge, really; they never should have got rid of the grand and gorgeous 1949 crest, Victoria Concordia Crescit, all that. Copyright schmopyright. Mesut \u00d6zil is back! He\u2019s one of only two changes to Arsenal\u2019s starting XI in Belarus last week. He replaces the suspended Alexandre Lacazette. Meanwhile Stephan Lichtsteiner takes the place of the poorly Ainsley Maitland-Niles. BATE make just one switch. Slobodan Simovi\u0107 replaces Alexander Hleb in midfield, the former Gunner dropping to the bench on his return to his old north London stomping ground. Arsenal: Cech, Lichtsteiner, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Mkhitaryan, Ozil, Iwobi, Aubameyang. Subs: Leno, Papastathopoulos, Ramsey, Torreira, Suarez, Kolasinac, Nketiah. BATE Borisov: Scherbitski, Rios, Volkov, Filipenko, Filipovic, Simovic, Dragun, Milic, Baha, Stasevich, Skavysh. Subs: Chichkan, Yablonskiy, Berezkin, Dubajic, Hleb, Nemriko, Moukam. Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain). Thursday evening, 5.55pm. It\u2019s no time to kick off a big football match, as irritated Arsenal fans who can\u2019t get to the stadium in time from work will tell you. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unacceptable and inconvenient,\u201d a spokesperson for the Arsenal Supporters\u2019 Trust told our national broadcaster. \u201cArsenal fans have to travel to the game after work from across London, the south-east and further afield. The result will be a huge number of empty seats and many fans having to pay for a ticket on their season tickets which they cannot use.\u201d Well done, Uefa! Well done, everyone! But here we are. Arsenal are a goal adrift in this Europa League round-of-32 tie, having lost embarrassingly at BATE Borisov in the first leg. It shouldn\u2019t be an irredeemable problem, given they beat the Belarusians 6-0 at the Emirates only last season. But they\u2019ll have to turn it around without Alexandre Lacazette, who got himself sent off in Belarus last week. Should BATE cling on and reach the last 16, they\u2019ll have gone further than they\u2019ve ever gone in Europe. But it\u2019s a big ask, given they\u2019re playing last season\u2019s semi-finalists, a team now managed by Europa League expert Unai Emery, a three-time winner with Sevilla. Arsenal had 70 percent possession in the first leg, so they\u2019ll be confident of digging themselves out of this hole. The last 16 awaits. It\u2019s on! Kick off: Everyone should, because scheduling a weekday match at 5.55pm is a rum do and no mistake.",

Consider a few recent cases specifically in the context of increasing tensions between the US, China and Russia: The US asked Canada to detain a top Chinese telecom executive for alleged sanctions violations. China retaliated by arresting a number of Canadian citizens on various charges. Russia arrested an American in apparent reprisal for a spying prosecution of a Russian in the US.

Everyone wrote us off in the tie, everyone thought it was a formality. The referee has taken the game away from us. We were so superior for the first period of the game. Our shape was excellent. I thought it was a foul on Jeremy [for the red card] ... and from there it was difficult but we kept going. The pride in that. I felt so privileged to be the coach.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cEventually it was a poor goal from our perspective and that\u2019s something one or two of our players have to learn.

You join us with Celtic on the verge of a historic achievement \u2026 or routine elimination from the Europa League. Having lost last week\u2019s home leg 2-0, Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team need to win handsomely in Spain, where they\u2019ve won exactly zero of their previous 15 matches. Coincidentally, 15 is also the number of times that Valencia have gone into the second leg of a European tie with a lead \u2013 and they have lost that lead exactly zero times. So yes, Celtic have a mighty challenge on their hands. </p> <p>But Rodgers says that if they can nick the first goal and cut out the elementary mistakes that caused last week\u2019s defeat, then something special could be on the cards. Those are two whopping big \u201cifs\u201d but this potential triumph wouldn\u2019t be worth getting excited about if Celtic were starting from an easy place. As things stand, this is a must-follow. At least for a while.</p> </div>   </div>",

It\u2019s a tough game and it becomes even tougher with that sending off.\u201d Hayes: \u201cWe knew what it meant to a lot of people who travelled out here. We put our bodies on the line and everyone tried their best. We were comfortable in the first half ... but the sending off changed the game for us. When your a man down it\u2019s more difficult to apply our plan and put pressure on the man on the ball.\u201d Celtic\u2019s European campaign ends in frustrating fashion. There were a lot of positives in their performances but they were undone by an avoidable red card for Toljan, a bad miss by Ajer and, in fairness, opponents who passed very niftily at times. 90+2 min: Gameiro mis-hits from eight yards. Then Bain bats the ball away as Parejo tries to head the rebound into the net. 90 min: Ajer does enough to complicate Gameiro\u2019s task as a cross is fizzed in from the right. The striker gets to it first but can\u2019t finish comfortably enough, shooting straight at Bain. 89 min: A glimmer of a chance for Christie after sloppiness by Valencia, but a hefty touch snuffs it out. 88 min: Valencia zip the ball around the Celtic box. Lovely interplay. Then Mina tries to bend a shot into the far corner from 15 yards, but doesn\u2019t bend it enough. 86 min: Johnston shows some nice skills down the left but two defenders converge on him to stop him from producing a cross. 84 min: Christie leans into Lato, who goes down in the box. That looks like a penalty but not to the referee. 82 min: Edouard wins a freekick wide on the left. Prime crossing territory. But Christie bogs it way beyond the far post. Shame, especially as he\u2019s generally played well today. 79 min: Leeds ins in a neat pass from the left. Guedes dummies it brilliantly and then spins into space to receive a return pass from Mina, who duly delivers. Guedes could shoot from a difficult angle but decides to play it back across goal, where he presumably expected Mina to have reached. But no, Mina was expecting Guedes to shoot, so the ball rolls to safety. 78 min: Good work by Edouard, who holds the ball up well and then brings in Hayes, who sends over a nice cross from the left. It\u2019s headed away but falls to Brown, who opens fire from 25 yards. Blocked. 77 min: It looks like being another one of those \u201cif only\u201d nights for Celtic. If only Toljan has not been sent off, and if only Ajer had not headed over the bar from five yards, they might have pulled off an improbable comeback here. But improbable has become nigh-on impossible now. Valencia substitution: Lee on, Wass off 74 min: Boyata diverts a shot by Mina out for a corner. Celtic substitution: Burke off, Johnston off. 72 min: Ajer romps forward from the back, all the way to the edge of the hoem area. Then he rolls the ball to Edouard, who unloads a shot from the left-hand corner of the box. It\u2019s blocked by a defender. It\u2019s a beautifully worked goal. Perjeo floated a diagonal pass to Wass, who came in behind Hayes at the far post and headed the ball cleverly back across goal, where Gameiro was on hand to turn it into the net from six yards. Simunovic was caught dozing by the striker\u2019s darting run. 69 min: A wonderful tackle by Boyata prevents Gameiro from firing off a shot from close range after a sharp move by Valencia! Valencia substitution: Gameiro on, Sobrino off 65 min: Celtic have shown something in the last few minutes. There\u2019s genuine defiance there and they\u2019ve won possession back several times with strong tackles before venturing forward with a int of menace. Valencia don\u2019t look quite so comfortable any more. Celtic substitution: Edouard on, Forrest off. 62 min: ... Christie curls in a beautiful delivery from the left. Ajer gets the run on his marker and has a free header from five yards! But he nods over! What an agonising miss for Celtic! 61 min: Forrest wins a freekick wide on the right. A good promising opportunity. The big lads come up from the back... 58 min: Hayes booked for nudging Mina to the ground from behind as he chased back. He had run forward to provide a passing option to Burke, who should have fed him quickly from the centre circle but instead dawdled on the ball. 57 min: Parejo pulls back Brown on half-way to abort a counter-attack. For reasons unknown and unacceptable, he escapes a yellow card. 56 min: Parejo floats a freekick from the left to the edge of the area, from where Wass unloads a fierce volley. Well held by Bain. 55 min: Diakhaby booked for raising his leg too high to pinch the ball before Forrest. 53 min: Celtic opened up again, Wass charging on to a canny pass by Sobrino and then aiming a low ball across the face of goal. Celtic turn it behind for a corner. They\u2019re clinging on ... to a two-goal aggregate deficit. Might as well throw on Sinclair and Edouard and go gung-ho, if you ask me. 51 min: Fine defending by Simunovic, who clears a Mina cross from right in front of his own goal after a careful and incisive buildup by Valencia. 50 min: Torres and Wass one-two their way down the right before Brown intervenes at the expense of a corner. Hayes heads the setpiece clear. 48 min: The second half has taken place entirely inside Celtic territory so far. Valencia are trying to pick their way through, and Soler very nearly succeeded, only to be foiled at the last by Boyata. 46 min: Valencia start the second half and immediately look to resume where they left off at the end of the second. Celtic get all 10 remaining players behind the ball and try to hang in there and look for chances to release the speedy Burke on the counter. A chance to regroup for Celtic. But, of course, they need to do more than that to get back into this tie with only 10 men. They were faring well until Toljan\u2019s dismissal, but since their wingback\u2019s second booking, they\u2019ve been teetering on the brink of a spanking. Two good saves from Bain enabled them to reach half-time still in the tie. But it\u2019s going to take something special for them to overturn the 2-0 aggregation scoreline in 45 minutes with 10 men. 45 min: Another quick-reflex, one-handed save by Bain, this time to beat away a 12-yard shot by Mina after Celtic were torn apart again. 45 min: Guedes slips a nice pass through to Torres, dashing in from the right. He turns past Simunovic and aims a low curler towards the far corner. But it doesn\u2019t bend enough, missing the target by a yard. 44 min: Celtic have a job on just to make it to half-time. Valencia are turning the screw ... 43 min: Bain adjusts his feet quickly to tip the ball over the bar after Parejo\u2019s 18-yard shot from a knockdown takes a deflection. It was headed in. Boyata clears the corner. 42 min: Valencia are trying to finish the tie off here and now. They\u2019re putting the 10 men under heavy pressure. Celtic clear a series of crosses before Soler lets fly from 20 yards. Wide. 40 min: A promising run by McGregor ends when Parejo slides in to ease the ball off him. 38 min: Brown lumbers over to the right-back area to curtail a run by Guedes. Well that\u2019s torn it for Celtic. Toljan gets his second yellow for bringing down Guedes, who was abut to latch on to a through-ball. It\u2019s not clear that Toljan did it deliberately - he may have simply fallen into the player, who lashed in on his blindside - but no one\u2019s complaining. 34 min: Simunovic plays his way out from the back with elegant style. Celtic move threateningly upfield. Forrest digs out a cross from the right-hand corner of the box. It bounces in front of Hayes, who takes a chest to control it with his chest and then, under pressure, slashes a shot into the sidenetting from 10 yards. 32 min: Burke robs the ball off Coquelin and sprints towards the box! But a gauche touch prevents him from getting off a shot and he has to turn around and tee up Forrester, whose blast from 16 yards is blocked. 30 min: A decent bout of probing by Celtic, passing with purpose in front of their hosts, who are very disciplined. Eventually Forrest whips over a fine cross from the right and Hayes, darting in from the let flank, jumps in to the back of Wass, conceding a freekick. 27 min: Fast attack down the let by Valencia. Lato pulls the ball back dangerously from the byline. Boyata clears. 26 min: Toljan gets the game\u2019s second booking, for tugging back an opponent after Celtic gifted possession away with an errant pass. 25 min: Coquelin, who has just come on, clutches his ankle after making a pass. Has he picked up an injury, too? The best way to find out is to run at him like billy-o. 23 min: You\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s just picked up the first booking of the match? It was for chopping down Guedes near half-way. Aye, it was Scott Brown. Valencia substitution: Coquelin on, Garay off. It seems that Garay did himself a mischief while blocking that shot by Burke and he can\u2019t continue. Coquelin comes on and goes to centreback,not his preferred positions. Something for celtic to exploit? 20 min: Guedes charges past Toljan down the left and lobs over a cross. A touch too long for the man coming in at the back post. 18 min: A pass from deep gives Burke a chance to race forward from half-way. Garay strains to keep pace with him ... and then blocks the youngster\u2019s shot when they reach the box. 16 min: Hayes marauds forward down the left again. This time Valencia stop him from getting in a cross but his rampaging positivity is proving quite a pain to the hosts, and the main source of hope for Celtic so far. 14 min: Valencia aren\u2019t going out of their way to attack: rather they\u2019re happy to protect their lead and wait to pounce on any mistakes by Celtic. And the first one duly arrives, as Boyata\u2019s slack pass from the back is intercepted. Luckily for him, Sobirno over-hit a cross from the right after scampering into the box. 12 min: The home fans get a sing-song going in an attempt to drown out the Celtic hordes. Similarly, the home team are trying to get on to the front foot after being penned back deep by Celtic for most of the game so far. But Celtic look compact and composed when out of possession, so far. 9 min: Hayes is having a stormer so far down the left. His latest run results in a corner. Christie\u2019s outswinging delivery is good. Ajer catches it on the volley from 10 yards. It rebounds back to him off a defender and this time he smashes his shot way wide. 7 min: Celtic continue to have most possession and are making Valencia work feverishly to close down any openings. 5 min: More good stuff by Celtic. They force Valencia backwards with some very tidy, purposeful passing. Toljan\u2019s eventual cross from the right comes to nothing but the visitors can take encouragement from a bright start. 3 min: Promising move by Celtic! Brown began it in his own half before Christie released Hayes down the left. Hayes flew into the box and banged in a dangerous low cross/shot. The keeper gets down to hold well. 2 min: Burke shows that \u201cSearing pace\u201d that Rodgers mentioned, hurtling past Diakhaby down the right. But he overran the ball, pulling it back towards the centre after it had crossed the byline. 1 min: We have kickoff! Celtic get the game going ... Valencia are wearing all white. Celtic are sporting their fluorescent lime green away kit with black patches: it\u2019s a mess, to be fair. The teams have arrived on the pitch, where they receive a lusty greeting from the spectators: there are plenty of empty seats but lots of noise, thanks notably to thousands of crooning away fans. Regarding his team selection, notably the back three, he explains: \u201c[Valencia] keep two strikers up even when they\u2019re defending and they have pace. So our [back] three give us a chance to control that. It also gives us bodies between the lines ... and still allows you width in the game to open them up ... yet compact when we haven\u2019t got the ball. Hopefully it\u2019ll work for us.\u201d He explains that Burke has been given the nod up front because of his \u201csearing pace\u201d so \u201cthat gives us an out ball, which is important ... and if we need to change it, we\u2019ve got quality on the bench.\u201d Valencia: Neto; Wass, Garay, Diakhaby, Lato; Torres, Soler, Parejo, Guedes; Sobrino, Mina Subs: Domenech, Gameiro, Cheryshev, Gaya, Lee, Coquelin, Cenetelles Celtic: Bain; Toljan, Boyata, Ajer, Simunovic, Hayes; Forrest, Brown, McGregor, Christie; Burke Subs: Gordon, Izaguirre, Sinclair, Edouard, Lustig, Weah, Johnston Referee: D Aytekin (Ger) Hello. You join us with Celtic on the verge of a historic achievement \u2026 or routine elimination from the Europa League. Having lost last week\u2019s home leg 2-0, Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team need to win handsomely in Spain, where they\u2019ve won exactly zero of their previous 15 matches. Coincidentally, 15 is also the number of times that Valencia have gone into the second leg of a European tie with a lead \u2013 and they have lost that lead exactly zero times. So yes, Celtic have a mighty challenge on their hands. But Rodgers says that if they can nick the first goal and cut out the elementary mistakes that caused last week\u2019s defeat, then something special could be on the cards. Those are two whopping big \u201cifs\u201d but this potential triumph wouldn\u2019t be worth getting excited about if Celtic were starting from an easy place. As things stand, this is a must-follow. At least for a while.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Jackson\u2019s estate is suing HBO over the network\u2019s plans to air a documentary alleging the singer sexually abused two young boys. The estate is claiming that by showing Leaving Neverland, HBO is violating a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. According to the suit, when HBO aired Michael Jackson in Concert in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour, the clause precluded them from disparaging the singer in future works. In a 53-page complaint, the four-hour, two-part documentary is referred to as \u201ca one-sided marathon of unvetted propaganda to shamelessly exploit an innocent man no longer here to defend himself\u201d. Leaving Neverland premiered at the Sundance film festival last month and revealed the testimonies of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who allege that Jackson sexually abused them when they were under the age of 10. \u201cWe can\u2019t change what happened to us,\u201d Robson, now 36, said after the first screening. \u201cThe feeling is what can we do with that now.\u201d The suit urges HBO to take part in a public arbitration process and claims that it could cost the company up to $100m in damages. \u201cHBO could have and should have ensured that Leaving Neverland was properly sourced, factchecked and a fair and balanced representation,\u201d the estate attorney Howard Weitzman told Deadline. The suit focuses on the HBO president, Richard Plepler, who was working as a senior vice-president of communications in 1992, claiming that he \u201cmust have known, or should have known, about HBO\u2019s contract with Jackson\u201d. In a statement, HBO has responded to the lawsuit, claiming that it will not affect their support of the documentary. \u201cDespite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cHBO will move forward with the airing of Leaving Neverland, the two-part documentary, on March 3rd and 4th. This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.\u201d Jackson\u2019s former Neverland maid Adrian McManus is also set to speak out against the singer in 60 Minutes this weekend. She claims she saw the singer engage in \u201ckissing\u201d and \u201cpetting\u201d with young boys and was threatened over coming forward. \u201cThere was a kind side to him, and yet there was a dark side,\u201d she said in a promo for the interview. \u201cThey told me if I ever came up on TV that they could hire a hitman to take me out, slice my neck, would never find my body.\u201d The director, Dan Reed, has spoken about the possibility of a follow-up. \u201cI believe there were many other victims,\u201d he said to Vice. \u201cWe wanted to focus on James and Wade, and their families, who had very long relationships with Jackson. I\u2019m sure there are others out there who will come out when the time is right for them. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Leaving Neverland is set to air on HBO and Channel 4 next month.",

It took just over three weeks for the TV star to be recast from victim to villain, as the tale of the alleged vicious homophobic and racist attack on him in the early morning hours of 29 January began to unravel. The turnaround appeared to reach its climax on Thursday morning when the actor was arrested in Chicago, and the city\u2019s police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, accused the 36-year-old of taking advantage \u201cof the pain and anger of racism to advance his career\u201d. According to Chicago police, Smollett orchestrated a hoax hate-crime attack on himself in which he claimed that two attackers \u2013 at Smollett\u2019s direction \u2013 punched him, called him racial and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and hung a noose around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m left hanging in my head and asking why,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWhy would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make a false accusation?\u201d Smollett had claimed the pair were supporters of Donald Trump, and that his anti-Trump stance had made him a target.

      "body": "<p>Theresa May is facing the most serious cabinet revolt of her premiership next week, with as many as 25 members of the government ready to vote for a Brexit delay unless she rules out \u201cno deal\u201d \u2013 in a move that will challenge her to sack them.</p> \n<p>Rebel Conservatives believe there are now enough MPs across the House of Commons to pass an amendment that would require May to extend article 50 rather than allow the UK to leave without a deal.</p> \n<p>At least four cabinet ministers, almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll are understood to be prepared to back the motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, due to be debated on Wednesday. A senior source close to those plotting the rebellion said there was no way the members of the government would resign voluntarily and May would have to sack them.</p> \n<p>The move comes with moderates emboldened by the formation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/the-independent-group\">the Independent Group</a>, which some see as providing leverage to push back against the influence of the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters.</p> \n<p>The cabinet ministers David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell told the prime minister in a private meeting earlier this week that she would have to delay Brexit if there was no Commons majority for her deal by 27 February.</p> \n<p>Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday, Mundell told an audience he would do \u201ceverything I can and whatever I deem necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit\u201d, and refused repeatedly to rule out resigning from the cabinet if necessary.</p> \n<p>May has already survived two rounds of resignations by the Brexit-supporting cabinet ministers David Davis, Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab, but a wave of sackings would plunge the government into crisis at a crucial time for the Brexit talks.</p> \n<p>Pro-Brexit MPs said the outcome of next week was unpredictable but, if it came to the vote, May would have to get rid of the rebellious ministers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5480f484-cbb1-44bf-a9b9-c2b8675db23d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8CA_KpErcls?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One cabinet source said: \u201cIt would be a huge mistake not to sack them. It would be effectively conceding we had lost control of the party.\u201d</p> \n<p>To avert a crisis, No 10 is racing to secure changes to May\u2019s withdrawal deal with the EU that will satisfy hardline Eurosceptics and the Democratic Unionist party, enabling parliament to approve it. Their central demand is the removal of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/15/what-is-the-brexit-backstop\">Irish backstop</a> from the text of the agreement because it could indefinitely bind the UK into a customs union.</p> \n<p>Downing Street sources said the prime minister ideally wanted to hold a parliamentary vote and win approval for her deal early next week, but sources conceded time was running out to pull off such a move.</p> \n<p>She is heading to a meeting of world leaders, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh at the weekend in a last-minute effort to break the deadlock. The key to the talks is whether they can find a solution to allow Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to change his legal advice that the backstop is indefinite. However, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told reporters in Brussels he was \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d about the progress of talks so far.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/starmer-pm-is-running-down-clock-so-mps-only-get-binary-choice\">Jeremy Corbyn inching closer to backing a second referendum</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf a no-deal would happen \u2013 and I can\u2019t exclude this \u2013 this would have terrible economic and social consequences, both in Britain and on the continent, and so my efforts orient in a way that the worst can be avoided,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>If May does not manage a breakthrough by Wednesday, several senior cabinet ministers are pushing her to give assurances from the dispatch box that she is so close to a withdrawal deal that there is no need to consider the possibility of Brexit without one any more. \u201cIf you think you can get a deal with the EU by early April, what\u2019s the point of crashing out on 29 March?\u201d said one source close to the rebels.</p> \n<p>However, that strategy risks infuriating the DUP and hardline Eurosceptics, many of whom favour a no-deal Brexit and would want to see the text of an agreement with the EU before removing that possibility.</p> \n<p>One option for May is to call a free vote, which is the solution favoured by the \u201cBrexit delivery group\u201d of 100 MPs from both the remain and leave wings of the party. They have warned her that many of their number are prepared to rebel unless she allows MPs to vote with their consciences.</p> \n<p>Three MPs in the ERG \u2013 Priti Patel, Maria Caulfield and Anne-Marie Trevelyan \u2013 wrote a joint article for the ConservativeHome website on Thursday, saying: \u201cNothing changes the fact that, as the prime minister herself has said, we need to see meaningful, legally-binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, removing the backstop.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe remain open-minded as to how this is achieved, but it must be a treaty-level clause that brings about substantive legal changes. It cannot simply re-emphasise the temporary nature of the backstop, because the attorney general has already said that it could \u2018endure indefinitely\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>One source close to a soft-Brexit minister said there would be \u201cfireworks\u201d either way as next week is the point at which May will have to throw her lot in with either them or the ERG.</p> \n<p>The soft-Brexit rebels are particularly buoyed by the idea that the power of the ERG was waning because they would no longer win a no-confidence motion against the prime minister, given that the new Independent Group MPs would be likely to abstain to avoid an election \u2013 and their price would be a second referendum.</p> \n<p>At the same time as ministers are threatening to resign, May is also facing the possibility of more MPs quitting the party, after Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/tory-mps-defect-independent-group-soubry-allen-wollaston\">joined the Independent Group </a>citing her Brexit policy and the destruction of the modernising wing of the party. With her working majority down to just eight, May called in two potential defectors \u2013 Phillip Lee, a former justice minister, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/justine-greening\">Justine Greening</a>, the former education secretary \u2013 to Downing Street in a bid to persuade them to stay.</p> \n<p>The prime minister also wrote back to the defectors saying she \u201cdid not accept the picture you paint of our party\u201d, arguing it was still a \u201cmoderate, open-hearted Conservative party in the one nation tradition\u201d.</p> \n<p>Greening said earlier that she would stay in the party \u201cfor the moment\u201d, while Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, also gave a sympathetic statement about the three defecting Conservatives. \u201cLosing three colleagues raises serious questions about our brand, our core mission and ownership of the very soul of our party which we must address,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have any ambitions of winning support beyond our base we must remain a centre right, inclusive, vibrant and progressive party.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is unlikely to quit, but said he would have to leave the party if the government implemented a no-deal Brexit. He told the Guardian \u201cthe numbers are there\u201d for May to be defeated on the Cooper-Letwin amendment unless she rules out a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Philip Hammond repeatedly refused to say whether or not he would resign as chancellor if May decided to pursue a no-deal Brexit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is facing the most serious cabinet revolt of her premiership next week, with as many as 25 members of the government ready to vote for a Brexit delay unless she rules out \u201cno deal\u201d \u2013 in a move that will challenge her to sack them. Rebel Conservatives believe there are now enough MPs across the House of Commons to pass an amendment that would require May to extend article 50 rather than allow the UK to leave without a deal. At least four cabinet ministers, almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll are understood to be prepared to back the motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, due to be debated on Wednesday. A senior source close to those plotting the rebellion said there was no way the members of the government would resign voluntarily and May would have to sack them. The move comes with moderates emboldened by the formation of the Independent Group, which some see as providing leverage to push back against the influence of the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters. The cabinet ministers David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell told the prime minister in a private meeting earlier this week that she would have to delay Brexit if there was no Commons majority for her deal by 27 February. Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday, Mundell told an audience he would do \u201ceverything I can and whatever I deem necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit\u201d, and refused repeatedly to rule out resigning from the cabinet if necessary. May has already survived two rounds of resignations by the Brexit-supporting cabinet ministers David Davis, Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab, but a wave of sackings would plunge the government into crisis at a crucial time for the Brexit talks. Pro-Brexit MPs said the outcome of next week was unpredictable but, if it came to the vote, May would have to get rid of the rebellious ministers. One cabinet source said: \u201cIt would be a huge mistake not to sack them. It would be effectively conceding we had lost control of the party.\u201d To avert a crisis, No 10 is racing to secure changes to May\u2019s withdrawal deal with the EU that will satisfy hardline Eurosceptics and the Democratic Unionist party, enabling parliament to approve it. Their central demand is the removal of the Irish backstop from the text of the agreement because it could indefinitely bind the UK into a customs union. Downing Street sources said the prime minister ideally wanted to hold a parliamentary vote and win approval for her deal early next week, but sources conceded time was running out to pull off such a move. She is heading to a meeting of world leaders, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh at the weekend in a last-minute effort to break the deadlock. The key to the talks is whether they can find a solution to allow Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to change his legal advice that the backstop is indefinite. However, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, told reporters in Brussels he was \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d about the progress of talks so far. \u201cIf a no-deal would happen \u2013 and I can\u2019t exclude this \u2013 this would have terrible economic and social consequences, both in Britain and on the continent, and so my efforts orient in a way that the worst can be avoided,\u201d he said. If May does not manage a breakthrough by Wednesday, several senior cabinet ministers are pushing her to give assurances from the dispatch box that she is so close to a withdrawal deal that there is no need to consider the possibility of Brexit without one any more. \u201cIf you think you can get a deal with the EU by early April, what\u2019s the point of crashing out on 29 March?\u201d said one source close to the rebels. However, that strategy risks infuriating the DUP and hardline Eurosceptics, many of whom favour a no-deal Brexit and would want to see the text of an agreement with the EU before removing that possibility. One option for May is to call a free vote, which is the solution favoured by the \u201cBrexit delivery group\u201d of 100 MPs from both the remain and leave wings of the party. They have warned her that many of their number are prepared to rebel unless she allows MPs to vote with their consciences. Three MPs in the ERG \u2013 Priti Patel, Maria Caulfield and Anne-Marie Trevelyan \u2013 wrote a joint article for the ConservativeHome website on Thursday, saying: \u201cNothing changes the fact that, as the prime minister herself has said, we need to see meaningful, legally-binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, removing the backstop. \u201cWe remain open-minded as to how this is achieved, but it must be a treaty-level clause that brings about substantive legal changes. It cannot simply re-emphasise the temporary nature of the backstop, because the attorney general has already said that it could \u2018endure indefinitely\u2019.\u201d One source close to a soft-Brexit minister said there would be \u201cfireworks\u201d either way as next week is the point at which May will have to throw her lot in with either them or the ERG. The soft-Brexit rebels are particularly buoyed by the idea that the power of the ERG was waning because they would no longer win a no-confidence motion against the prime minister, given that the new Independent Group MPs would be likely to abstain to avoid an election \u2013 and their price would be a second referendum. At the same time as ministers are threatening to resign, May is also facing the possibility of more MPs quitting the party, after Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen joined the Independent Group citing her Brexit policy and the destruction of the modernising wing of the party. With her working majority down to just eight, May called in two potential defectors \u2013 Phillip Lee, a former justice minister, and Justine Greening, the former education secretary \u2013 to Downing Street in a bid to persuade them to stay. The prime minister also wrote back to the defectors saying she \u201cdid not accept the picture you paint of our party\u201d, arguing it was still a \u201cmoderate, open-hearted Conservative party in the one nation tradition\u201d. Greening said earlier that she would stay in the party \u201cfor the moment\u201d, while Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, also gave a sympathetic statement about the three defecting Conservatives. \u201cLosing three colleagues raises serious questions about our brand, our core mission and ownership of the very soul of our party which we must address,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have any ambitions of winning support beyond our base we must remain a centre right, inclusive, vibrant and progressive party.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is unlikely to quit, but said he would have to leave the party if the government implemented a no-deal Brexit. He told the Guardian \u201cthe numbers are there\u201d for May to be defeated on the Cooper-Letwin amendment unless she rules out a no-deal Brexit. On Wednesday, Philip Hammond repeatedly refused to say whether or not he would resign as chancellor if May decided to pursue a no-deal Brexit.",

The Cardiff team of 1967\u201168 had a new half-back pairing, the indomitable Gareth Edwards and a recruit from Llanelli, Barry John, the magician\u2019s magician. Outside them were the likes of Frank Wilson, who laced his boots with mischief, Gerald Davies, then a centre, who needed so little space he could have thrown a party in a telephone box, Keri Jones, an Empire Games sprinter, and Richards, a ruthless finisher who remained detached in the midst of mayhem, a professional in an amateur game.</p> <p>For variation, Cardiff could call on PL Jones on the wing. He had the build of a prop but was somewhat quicker. \u201cHe ran like a rampaging elephant,\u201d recalled Richards. \u201cDefenders knew where he was going but could not do much about it: you would give him a wide berth on the stairs.

There was a time when Jonah Lomu took the game by storm when wings of Richards\u2019s type were in danger of becoming an endangered species as contact, rather than space, was targeted. Now it is the likes of Jonny May who have illuminated the Six Nations, all pace and deceit. Half the 32 tries (ignoring England\u2019s penalty try against France) this year have been scored by wings who have been in no danger of succumbing to exposure.</p> <p>\u201cI have a bias towards slippery, elusive runners,\u201d said Richards. \u201cI prefer the ones who avoid tackles rather than the bulldozers. There has been an emphasis on physicality rather than subtlety and finesse, but I suppose you utilise your assets to achieve the most effective results.

      "bodyText": "Interviewing Maurice Richards, the Wales wing who scored four tries against England in 1969, was a warming return to days long gone, when matches that were clotted with set-pieces and punch-ups were invariably interrupted by moments of brilliance that endure in the memory. Richards kick-started the golden era for Wales when they won the triple crown 50 years ago, but left for rugby league six months later. Others at that time went on to become world renowned while Richards was breaking records at Salford, but the game has seen few more accomplished wings: he had everything and more. Wales followed their Five Nations triumph in 1969 by touring New Zealand. They were well beaten in the two Tests and their host, together with the media there, were largely dismissive of them. \u201cDragons without a cause,\u201d was how the New Zealand second row Colin Meads described them. \u201cThe humblest club side would have held together better.\u201d Richards was the one Wales player who inspired awe, and not just because of the try he scored in the second Test when he turned the All Blacks full-back Fergie McCormick inside out and left him gaping at the sky before accelerating away from a clutch of defenders. In between the two Tests, he scored a hat-trick against Otago of such brilliance that even the New Zealand journalist TP McLean, who spent much of his time trading insults with his Wales rival JBG Thomas, was moved. For his first try, Richards \u201cchopped out Hunter (his opposite number), approached Mains (the full-back) and with a violently efficient sidestep beat him cold for a try. Three minutes later Richards was in the clear with 60 yards to go. He went. His third began with a loose kick into midfield and Richards with sizzling acceleration sped 25 yards for a try. He was sublime.\u201d It was easy to become hooked on rugby then. The Cardiff team of 1967\u201168 had a new half-back pairing, the indomitable Gareth Edwards and a recruit from Llanelli, Barry John, the magician\u2019s magician. Outside them were the likes of Frank Wilson, who laced his boots with mischief, Gerald Davies, then a centre, who needed so little space he could have thrown a party in a telephone box, Keri Jones, an Empire Games sprinter, and Richards, a ruthless finisher who remained detached in the midst of mayhem, a professional in an amateur game. For variation, Cardiff could call on PL Jones on the wing. He had the build of a prop but was somewhat quicker. \u201cHe ran like a rampaging elephant,\u201d recalled Richards. \u201cDefenders knew where he was going but could not do much about it: you would give him a wide berth on the stairs. There was so much talent in a club that was set apart from the rest and its demise in the regional era saddens me.\u201d Richards was a reluctant interviewee, not keen to disturb the past. There was a time when Jonah Lomu took the game by storm when wings of Richards\u2019s type were in danger of becoming an endangered species as contact, rather than space, was targeted. Now it is the likes of Jonny May who have illuminated the Six Nations, all pace and deceit. Half the 32 tries (ignoring England\u2019s penalty try against France) this year have been scored by wings who have been in no danger of succumbing to exposure. \u201cI have a bias towards slippery, elusive runners,\u201d said Richards. \u201cI prefer the ones who avoid tackles rather than the bulldozers. There has been an emphasis on physicality rather than subtlety and finesse, but I suppose you utilise your assets to achieve the most effective results. If you are lucky enough to have a David Watkins, Barry John, Phil Bennett or Shane Williams you don\u2019t want them to be taking crash-balls all over the field. \u201cI have felt sympathy for modern wings as they have seemed to only get a pass as a last resort: work rate in support, kick-chasing and cover defence are the bread and butter, and only occasionally rewarded. Jonny May has impressed me: he is in a team that has been dominating, but he took all his opportunities against France and was looking for more. I like watching George North but wish he received the ball more often, and while the game has changed in so many ways, someone with the football skills and vision of Gerald Davies would still be outstanding and have me on the edge of my seat.\u201d Richards made the point that, at a time when coaching was in its infancy, it was not just talent that marked out a player but strategic awareness. What has been notable about England this month is they have developed a gameplan that requires players to keep their heads up and use them. If teams rush up to counter their physical threat and defend the gainline, they kick the ball into space; if they hold back they put the ball through hands. It was not that long ago that England were playing Mike Brown on the wing, but now they have May, Jack Nowell and Joe Cokanasiga vying to start against Wales with Chris Ashton and Anthony Watson injured.

The fictional band were loosely modelled on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\" title=\"\">the Beatles</a>, and the show\u2019s timing was perfect, first airing shortly after the release of Revolver and Eleanor Rigby had indicated that the lovable moptops were growing away from their younger fans. A spin-off single from the series, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXpKiY2MXE\" title=\"\">Last Train to Clarksville</a>, went to No 1 in the US later that year. The Monkees\u2019 first, self-titled album did the same, and suddenly Rafelson and Schneider\u2019s \u201cprefab four\u201d became serious rivals to the Beatles, at least in terms of record sales.</p> <p>In 1967 the Monkees outsold everyone, including the Beatles.

Yet in 1968 the TV series was pulled after its second season saw declining viewing figures. An adventurous, satirical film, Head, was savaged by critics and flopped at the box office. Tork left the group at the end of the year.</p> <p>Born in Washington, Peter was the son of John Thorkelson, an economics professor, and his wife, Virginia (nee Straus). While at high school in Wisconsin, he was given a ukulele by the folk musician Tom Glazer. At Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, he managed to secure work as the college DJ as well as playing the guitar and ukulele in various folk ensembles. Having flunked out of college, he shortened his name to Tork and decided to move to Greenwich Village in 1962, where he would spend the next three years immersed in its folk scene.</p> <p>In New York, Tork initially sang humorous songs written by his brother Nick, and played for donations at venues such as the Playhouse Cafe, the Cyclops and the Dragon\u2019s Den. Progress was slow, but by February 1964 he was at Carnegie Hall as part of the New York City folk festival, sharing a stage with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Johnny Cash</a>, Phil Ochs and Mississippi John Hurt. He married his girlfriend, Jody Babb, that summer, but they had separated by the end of the year. Among various brief musical unions, he teamed up with Stephen Stills in 1964.</p> <p>After hitchhiking to Los Angeles in 1965, he answered a Raybert Productions advert in the Hollywood Reporter looking for \u201cFolk &amp; roll musicians-singers for acting roles in new TV series. Running parts for 4 insane boys, age 17-21.\u201d Four hundred hopefuls applied, including Stills, who turned it down but recommended his friend Tork to the producers, Rafelson and Schneider. At this point, Tork was washing dishes but, along with Jones, Nesmith and Dolenz, he passed the screen test for the Monkees in November 1965. The four became fast friends, and the penniless Tork stayed on the couch of the newly married Nesmith\u2019s compact apartment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22432adf7969edd9380ee393276e6ae9ebae825d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22432adf7969edd9380ee393276e6ae9ebae825d/0_169_3252_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Running parts for 4 insane boys\u2019: Peter Tork, second from right, on the set of The Monkees TV show in the late 60s, with, from left, Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Running parts for 4 insane boys\u2019: Peter Tork, second from right, on the set of The Monkees TV show in the late 60s, with, from left, Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially, the Monkees contributed little more than vocals to their records; the music was played by the cream of LA\u2019s session musicians.

Tork was by now famous in LA for throwing lavish, endless parties populated by naked starlets as well as musicians including David Crosby, Mama Cass and Jim Morrison.</p> <p>In December that year, tired of the pressure and the workload, Tork bought himself out of his Monkees contract for a reported $160,000, which left him penniless again. He sold his house to Stills and moved into a $25-a-month basement room in Crosby\u2019s house with his pregnant girlfriend, Reine Stewart, to whom he was later briefly married.

      "body": "<p>The Church of England has dropped a centuries-old requirement for all churches to hold weekly Sunday services.</p> <p>Its general synod, meeting in London this week, formally approved a change to canon law to relax the requirement for morning and evening prayer in every parish church every Sunday.</p> <p>The change, which will also apply to services of Holy Communion, will mainly affect parishes with small and declining congregations in rural areas.</p> <p>Most rural priests have multiple benefices, with some in charge of up to 20 churches, but were required to maintain regular services even if only a handful of worshippers turned up.</p> <p>The synod voted overwhelmingly in favour of of the change. Instead of Sunday services in \u201cevery parish church\u201d, the rule will now say \u201cmorning and evening prayer shall be said or sung in at least one church in each benefice\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cEach service shall be said or sung distinctly, reverently, and in an audible voice.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden, who leads a task group simplifying and modernising the rules governing daily church life, said the move was intended to bring canon law in line with practice.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment if you have 12 parishes you need a special dispensation [from the bishop] not to hold morning and evening prayers in every church,\u201d he said. The change would make \u201chonest people\u201d of clergy, who were already flouting the technicality of the law.</p> <p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t look after loads of parishes, but [canon] law doesn\u2019t recognise that reality.\u201d</p> <p>In 1960, only 17% of churches were in multi-parish groups, but by 2011 the proportion had swollen to 71%, clustered in rural areas, according to C of E data.</p> <p>Some dioceses covering rural areas where there are shortages of priests are looking at ways to increase the role of lay members in services.</p> <p>The legal change was unanimously supported by bishops and clergy. Among lay members of the synod, two people voted against it and one abstained. It will now be sent to the Queen for royal assent.</p> <p>A C of E spokesperson said: \u201cSunday worship continues to be central to the Church of England\u2019s ministry. The recent adaptation is designed to make it easier for multi-church parishes who rotate services between a group of churches.</p> <p>\u201cThis is often already the case in rural parishes where it is impractical to hold weekly services in every church. This reflects the movement over the past 200 years of people from the country to cities.</p> <p>\u201cThe Church of England now has a great variety of services throughout the week, with midweek services increasing in popularity.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England has dropped a centuries-old requirement for all churches to hold weekly Sunday services. Its general synod, meeting in London this week, formally approved a change to canon law to relax the requirement for morning and evening prayer in every parish church every Sunday. The change, which will also apply to services of Holy Communion, will mainly affect parishes with small and declining congregations in rural areas. Most rural priests have multiple benefices, with some in charge of up to 20 churches, but were required to maintain regular services even if only a handful of worshippers turned up. The synod voted overwhelmingly in favour of of the change. Instead of Sunday services in \u201cevery parish church\u201d, the rule will now say \u201cmorning and evening prayer shall be said or sung in at least one church in each benefice\u201d. It adds: \u201cEach service shall be said or sung distinctly, reverently, and in an audible voice.\u201d Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden, who leads a task group simplifying and modernising the rules governing daily church life, said the move was intended to bring canon law in line with practice. \u201cAt the moment if you have 12 parishes you need a special dispensation [from the bishop] not to hold morning and evening prayers in every church,\u201d he said. The change would make \u201chonest people\u201d of clergy, who were already flouting the technicality of the law. \u201cPeople can\u2019t look after loads of parishes, but [canon] law doesn\u2019t recognise that reality.\u201d In 1960, only 17% of churches were in multi-parish groups, but by 2011 the proportion had swollen to 71%, clustered in rural areas, according to C of E data. Some dioceses covering rural areas where there are shortages of priests are looking at ways to increase the role of lay members in services. The legal change was unanimously supported by bishops and clergy. Among lay members of the synod, two people voted against it and one abstained. It will now be sent to the Queen for royal assent. A C of E spokesperson said: \u201cSunday worship continues to be central to the Church of England\u2019s ministry. The recent adaptation is designed to make it easier for multi-church parishes who rotate services between a group of churches. \u201cThis is often already the case in rural parishes where it is impractical to hold weekly services in every church. This reflects the movement over the past 200 years of people from the country to cities. \u201cThe Church of England now has a great variety of services throughout the week, with midweek services increasing in popularity.\u201d",

Some of the screen\u2019s most disreputable characters are press agents, despite it being the profession best placed to improve its own image. In film and TV, PRs tend to be venal and corrupt at worst, damaged or ditzy at best. Robin, played by Anna Paquin in the new TV series Flack, is a classic screen publicist, a cynical schemer who can manipulate public opinion like a master, but whose private life is in freefall. Between cheating on her boyfriend and snorting coke, she spends her working hours salvaging the mangled reputations of her celebrity clients \u2013 arranging lavender marriages and teenage sex tapes without sweating too much over the moral implications. PR, she says, \u201cmakes the most of my natural talents: lying and drinking\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/11/anna-paquin-ive-had-some-horrific-experiences\">Anna Paquin: \u2018I\u2019ve had some horrific experiences\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hollywood didn\u2019t look far for its first PR villains. The dishonest studio press agent is a popular stock character in most films about movie-making \u2013 and right from the beginning their jobs were as much about covering up stars\u2019 bad behavior as they were about posting florid biographies to fan magazines. Matt Libby, who runs damage control on Norman Maine\u2019s drunken exploits in 1937\u2019s A Star is Born, is introduced as \u201cour demon press agent\u201d with \u201ca heart of gold, only harder\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, entertainment PRs are some of the nastiest in the movies. Fred MacMurray\u2019s lovestruck studio press agent in 1948\u2019s The Miracle of the Bells, who arranges a headline-grabbing memorial for his dead girlfriend, is an exception to the rule. The most famous movie publicist of all time is surely the ruthless Sidney Falco, \u201cfully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade\u201d, played by Tony Curtis in 1957\u2019s The Sweet Smell of Success \u2013 a film that Flack\u2019s Robin must surely have seen and studied. Falco\u2019s latter-day successor is Colin Farrell\u2019s Stuart Shepard in 2002\u2019s Phone Booth, the two-timing publicist cornered by a serial killer into a grisly mea culpa: \u201cI lie to newspapers and magazines who who sell my lies to more and more people.

You\u2019re more likely to see a screen PR procuring drugs for a contact than perfecting a press release. According to a<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532754xjprr1101_01\"> 1999 study by Karen Miller at the University of Georgia</a>, fictional PR falls into two categories. Sometimes it is a matter of complex strategy that cannot be understood by mere law-abiding mortals, the smoke and mirrors that Robin and Falco excel at. Alternatively, it\u2019s a breeze, a mere matter of having a drink with the right reporter or placing the right call. In 1954\u2019s The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Gregory Peck confesses that he knows nothing about public relations, only to be told: \u201cWho does? You\u2019ve got a clean shirt and you bathe every day. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p> <p>Both representations feed into the idea that publicity is fundamentally dishonest, and certainly not a \u201creal\u201d job, which means PR agents are twice as untrustworthy when they enter politics. In 1972\u2019s The Candidate, Peter Boyle\u2019s campaign adviser does such a good job at marketing a reluctant Robert Redford as a Democratic challenger that he creates a monster. As a TV pundit warns, the campaign is dominated by \u201csocko salesmanship with no moral considerations involved\u201d. It\u2019s just a short step from there to, say, the ruthless efficiency of Ryan Gosling\u2019s junior campaign manager in The Ides of March in 2011 and the gleeful lobbyists for tobacco, firearms and alcohol who nickname themselves the \u201cmerchants of death\u201d in the 2005 satire Thank You For Smoking.

Now that allegations of \u201cfake news\u201d fly back and forth across the White House press room, these shows seem to represent a faraway civilization.</p> <p>If you\u2019re thinking that most of those job titles aren\u2019t strictly in the realm of PR, that\u2019s almost the point. On screen, hype, spin, propaganda and marketing get muddled with each other and all kinds of other jobs, and a new breed of multitalented publicity professional has arisen: the fixer. Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington on the TV series Scandal, epitomizes the type. She and her posse of \u201cgladiators in suits\u201d have the capacity to make all the problems of the rich and sleazy in Washington DC go away \u2013 PR as a magic trick, but taken to extremes. See also Sandra Bullock as a political strategist shipped into Bolivia in 2015\u2019s Our Brand is Crisis and Jodie Foster in 2006\u2019s Inside Man, the fearsome power broker who is covering up a Manhattan banker\u2019s Nazi past. Although she works for B-list celebrities rather than leaders of corporations and countries, Robin follows in their footsteps, finding creative, often illegal solutions to her clients\u2019 problems \u2013 whether it\u2019s a comedian\u2019s transphobic standup set or a movie star\u2019s incriminating hard drive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eo9jvI5Ig0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5eo9jvI5Ig0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Not that Robin\u2019s friends and family know quite how low she\u2019ll stoop, or hard she works. Her brother-in-law admits that he thought she \u201cjust flounced around drinking white wine and air-kissing\u201d, showing that his idea of female PR agents is badly out of date. On screen at least, PR was once presented as a glamorous gig for a well-connected woman \u2013 such as Paula Prentiss, who is not shown doing any actual PR work in Man\u2019s Favorite Sport? in 1964 or her small-screen descendants Edina in Absolutely Fabulous and Samantha Jones in Sex and the City. Robin, however, practices the dark arts of extreme PR, Olivia Pope-style.</p> <p>As Miller writes, although they are often shown to be breathtakingly effective at their jobs, PRs are regularly presented as \u201cdespicable\u201d or morally lax. Throughout their screen history, PRs are seen drinking, smoking, snorting and screwing on the job, when they are not procuring drugs or escorts for clients in the line of work. Robin\u2019s vodka and cocaine habit recalls Jack Lemmon\u2019s portrayal of an alcoholic PR in Days of Wine and Roses (1962), except somehow she manages to keep her job, and her dishonesty at work bleeds damagingly into her relationship with her boyfriend.</p> <p>Every so often, a PR is shown doing good, as with the mental health campaign in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or that way that a corporate publicist rehabilitates a struggling superhero and helps to save a city in 2008\u2019s Hancock, but screen depictions of the job tend to disprove the idea that no publicity is bad publicity. More seriously, PR insiders regularly say the industry needs a makeover, and after the headlines made by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/05/bell-pottingersouth-africa-pr-firm\">Bell Pottinger scandal of 2017</a>, those <a href=\"https://www.holmesreport.com/latest/article/time-for-pr-to-embrace-its-own-purpose\">calls have increased</a>. Sounds like a job that Robin could really get her teeth into.</p> <ul> <li><p>Flack starts on Pop TV in the US and W in the UK on 21 February</p></li> <li><p>This piece was amended on 21 February 2019 to correct the name of CJ Cregg, the character in The West Wing.

See also Sandra Bullock as a political strategist shipped into Bolivia in 2015\u2019s Our Brand is Crisis and Jodie Foster in 2006\u2019s Inside Man, the fearsome power broker who is covering up a Manhattan banker\u2019s Nazi past. Although she works for B-list celebrities rather than leaders of corporations and countries, Robin follows in their footsteps, finding creative, often illegal solutions to her clients\u2019 problems \u2013 whether it\u2019s a comedian\u2019s transphobic standup set or a movie star\u2019s incriminating hard drive. Not that Robin\u2019s friends and family know quite how low she\u2019ll stoop, or hard she works. Her brother-in-law admits that he thought she \u201cjust flounced around drinking white wine and air-kissing\u201d, showing that his idea of female PR agents is badly out of date. On screen at least, PR was once presented as a glamorous gig for a well-connected woman \u2013 such as Paula Prentiss, who is not shown doing any actual PR work in Man\u2019s Favorite Sport? in 1964 or her small-screen descendants Edina in Absolutely Fabulous and Samantha Jones in Sex and the City. Robin, however, practices the dark arts of extreme PR, Olivia Pope-style. As Miller writes, although they are often shown to be breathtakingly effective at their jobs, PRs are regularly presented as \u201cdespicable\u201d or morally lax. Throughout their screen history, PRs are seen drinking, smoking, snorting and screwing on the job, when they are not procuring drugs or escorts for clients in the line of work. Robin\u2019s vodka and cocaine habit recalls Jack Lemmon\u2019s portrayal of an alcoholic PR in Days of Wine and Roses (1962), except somehow she manages to keep her job, and her dishonesty at work bleeds damagingly into her relationship with her boyfriend. Every so often, a PR is shown doing good, as with the mental health campaign in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or that way that a corporate publicist rehabilitates a struggling superhero and helps to save a city in 2008\u2019s Hancock, but screen depictions of the job tend to disprove the idea that no publicity is bad publicity. More seriously, PR insiders regularly say the industry needs a makeover, and after the headlines made by the Bell Pottinger scandal of 2017, those calls have increased. Sounds like a job that Robin could really get her teeth into. Flack starts on Pop TV in the US and W in the UK on 21 February This piece was amended on 21 February 2019 to correct the name of CJ Cregg, the character in The West Wing. We originally misspelled it as CJ Gregg.",

      "bodyText": "Defence company BAE Systems\u2019 share price fell sharply on Thursday after it warned that a German ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia, imposed after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, could scupper a multibillion-pound deal to sell Typhoon fighter jets. Alongside its annual results on Thursday, BAE Systems stressed that its business is \u201creliant on the approval of export licences by a number of governments in order to continue supplies to Saudi Arabia\u201d. The Gulf state accounted for around 14% of BAE\u2019s annual sales in 2018, and is seen as a key customer for the Typhoon. Germany is part of a four-country consortium that builds the Eurofighter Typhoon and its ban could threaten the future of lead partner BAE\u2019s pending \u00a310bn deal to sell 48 new jets to Saudi Arabia. BAE said Germany\u2019s arms export embargo could also threaten its maintenance and support contract with Saudi Arabia for the Typhoon, which currently brings in around \u00a32.5bn in annual revenue for the UK firm. \u201cCurrent German government position on export licensing may affect the group\u2019s ability to provide capability to Saudi Arabia, which may have a consequential impact on the group\u2019s financial performance and relationships,\u201d BAE warned. Shares in the company closed down nearly 8% at 465p, as investors took fright at the warning. Germany announced in November that it would no longer offer arms export licences to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Khashoggi. The UK has been critical over the dissident journalist\u2019s death, but has so far refused to take similar action. A Lords committee last week criticised the British government for being on \u201cthe wrong side of the law\u201d amid concerns that UK arms sold to Saudi Arabia were being used in the war in Yemen. BAE Systems, which is headquartered in London and Farnborough, said it was \u201cworking closely with the UK government to minimise the risk of any such occurrence and the impact it would have on financial performance, the supply chain and relationships\u201d. Germany this week rejected a plea by the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to restart arms sales to the Gulf state. In his letter, Hunt reportedly warned that Riyadh was seeking compensation from BAE over the German ban. At a joint press conference in Berlin with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, Hunt was told his plea for a resumption of arms sales made in a leaked letter had been rejected for the moment. Maas said any future decision would be \u201cdependent on developments in the Yemen conflict and whether what was agreed in the Stockholm peace talks are implemented\u201d. The two sides in the Yemen civil war met in Sweden last December to start a process of confidence building, including a limited ceasefire in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah. No date has been set for the resumption of the main talks and few expect a settlement for many months. BAE still expects higher profits in 2019, forecasting \u201cmid-single digit\u201d growth in earnings per share this year, according to latest earnings report. Underlying earnings per share were relatively flat last year at 42.9p compared with 42.1p for the previous 12 months.",

Describing the experience of his eyes adjusting to the darkness, Carter would later write: \u201cDetails of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues and gold \u2013 everywhere the glint of gold \u2026 I was struck dumb with amazement.\u201d When some of these treasures left Cairo for a 1972 exhibition at the British Museum, a record 1.6 million people visited, forming nightmarish queues. Treasures from the tomb were last in London in 2007 at what is now the O2. Money from that exhibition, which had around 50 fewer objects than will arrive this year, was used to safeguard Egypt\u2019s antiquities and monuments. Organisers say the 2020 show will differ from previous ones by focusing on the significance and meaning of the king\u2019s burial items. Philippa Adams, the director of the Saatchi Gallery, said: \u201cThe discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb is a timeless story known throughout the world, and this exhibition will present these important historical artefacts in a highly innovative way through immersive displays. We are thrilled and honoured to be hosting this culturally significant exhibition.\u201d The touring exhibition began in Los Angeles last year and is due to visit 10 cities across the world. \u2022 Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh is at the Saatchi Gallery from 2 November 2019 to 3 May 2020.",

They\u2019d watched the ascent of Jeremy Corbyn and begun wondering if their own membership was capable of delivering a shock to the system. Since then, they\u2019ve seen the emergence of a so-called \u201cpurple Momentum\u201d \u2013 an organised push by former Ukip voters rejoining and agitating for the deselection of Tory moderates \u2013 and the Eurosceptic right in parliament solidifying into an organised caucus capable of getting a Jacob Rees-Mogg figure on the list for the next leadership contest. And they have watched as disorientated Labour colleagues clung on and desperately tried to make it work, only to be eaten alive by a resurgent left. Evidently the three amigos don\u2019t intend to sit around waiting to meet the same fate. And if this leap off a cliff ends as so many previous attempts at new parties have ended, they\u2019re not so institutionalised that they couldn\u2019t find something useful to do outside parliament. Let\u2019s just hope the electorate, who in the event of some great centrist revolt failing would be left choosing between parties shorn of all their moderating influences, don\u2019t end up as the wreckage at the bottom of the canyon. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Peter Tork, the bassist for the Monkees, has died aged 77. Tork, who also sang on a number of the band\u2019s songs and played keyboards, had been diagnosed with a rare form of tongue cancer in 2009, though the cause of his death, which was confirmed by his sister, has not been announced. Born in Washington DC in 1942, Tork \u2013 whose real name was Peter Thorkelson \u2013 joined the Monkees when he was 24 after the quartet were brought together by US TV executives aiming to create a teenage guitar-pop sensation to match the Beatles. Tork was recommended to audition by Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and was already an accomplished musician in his own right, having played on the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960s. He said he was \u201cmortified\u201d when he turned up to an early Monkees studio date to be told that their band\u2019s album had already been recorded by session musicians. Tork\u2019s role in the band\u2019s TV adventures was as a goofy, dopey comic foil. He was with the band for six albums, the first four of which all went to No 1 in the US and Top Five in the UK. From their third album, Headquarters, onwards, he and his bandmates performed themselves \u2013 a shift often credited to Tork\u2019s influence \u2013 but he quit the band in 1968 following their their flop psychedelic opus Head. Less successful solo projects and bands followed, along with a short jail term for hashish possession in 1972. He made occasional guest appearances with the Monkees before reforming the band with Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz for a 20th-anniversary tour in 1986, and recording new material for the album Pool It! Michael Nesmith later also rejoined, and the reunited quartet released the album Justus in 1996. Tork, Jones and Dolenz reunited once more in 2011 for a 45th-anniversary tour. Nesmith rejoined following Jones\u2019s death in 2012, with the remaining members recording two further albums together, including the acclaimed Good Times!, which featured songs written by Noel Gallagher, Paul Weller, Weezer\u2019s Rivers Cuomo and Carole King, who tweeted: \u201cRIP Peter Tork\u201d. Tork also took occasional acting roles in TV shows including Boy Meets World, Wings and The King of Queens. Songwriter Dianne Warren was among others to pay tribute to Tork, tweeting: \u201cOh no RIP Peter Tork. Thank U for giving me your love beads (it was the 60s!) when I was a little girl.\u201d Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sad to hear about Peter Tork passing.

But in a fresh statement it softened its tone, saying that \u201cno one single event\u201d was to blame. \u201cHonda is on record as stating that its preferred scenario following Brexit is one that delivers frictionless trade, access to talent and regulatory alignment,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt is true that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 scenario would cause a number of challenges for our operations. However, no one single event has led to the proposal to cease production at Swindon. The decision is in response to unprecedented change in the global automotive industry and the need to deploy electrification technologies across our business.\u201d Multiple factors are understood to be behind the closure, including global market conditions, the shift to electric vehicles and a free-trade agreement with the EU that will allow Japanese carmakers to export cars tariff-free from 2027.",

The teenager remained impassive in the dock as the jury at Glasgow high court delivered its unanimous verdict after four hours of deliberation on Thursday afternoon, and following a two-week trial. Addressing the killer, the judge, Lord Matthews, said he had committed \u201csome of the wickedest, most evil crimes this court has ever heard in its long history of dealing with depravity\u201d. He added: \u201cI have no idea why you did this.

The minister is also undoubtedly correct to highlight the extent to which prisons are failing, but the current crisis will not be solved by abolishing short-term sentences alone. Since at least the 1940s, there have been numerous scientific studies unequivocally demonstrating that long-term prison sentences are extremely dangerous to human wellbeing. Long-term imprisonment, especially when it involves periods of solitary confinement, can lead to the deterioration of the body and the ruination of the mind. Prisons are soul-destroying pits of human misery that can lead to atrophy, stasis, trauma and suicidal thoughts and actions. The longer that people, either as prisoners or staff, spend within these toxic and hostile penal environments, the more likely they are to experience long-term harm. Long-term prisoners can become ghosts of their former selves and many find it extremely difficult to build sustainable lives and relationships on release.

The first was the effect of four acts of parliament (Crime and Disorder Act 1998; Criminal Justice Act 2003; Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008; and Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014), all of which increased the legal powers of recall.

Hatton was the deputy leader of one of only two councils that made a stand against these cuts. The fact that Liverpool council stood virtually alone in resisting Thatcher is also an indictment of the national leadership of the Labour party of the period. Neil Kinnock bears responsibility for failing to support Labour councils in defending their communities, just as he also failed to support the miners in 1984-85. As a Labour party member of over 40 years, I am confident that our current leader would not disown members of the Labour movement engaged in similar struggles.<br><strong>John Lynch</strong><br><em>Bramham, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 This week the political clocks turned back three decades, with Derek Hatton rejoining Labour, and Chuka Umunna, Ann Coffey et al leaving. In the 1980s, as a trade union officer and party activist, I saw on the ground the behaviour of the Militant Tendency and came to the view that it had no place in democratic politics. At the time the union movement helped to support Neil Kinnock in rescuing the party from oblivion, and change was driven forward by subsequent leaders, making Labour electable.</p> <p>We are now back to the 80s and disillusionment is setting in. Labour should be at least 10 points ahead in the polls; we are not. We should be growing as a party; we are not. We have no cohesive strategy to deal with the biggest issues facing the country.</p> <p>John McDonnell is right: we need a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/joan-ryan-eighth-labour-mp-quits-party-to-join-breakaway-independent-group\" title=\"\">mammoth listening exercise</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool was damaged not by Derek Hatton (The return of King Rat Derek Hatton is a new low for Labour, 20 February), but by the Thatcher government\u2019s politically motivated attack on the public services. Hatton was the deputy leader of one of only two councils that made a stand against these cuts. The fact that Liverpool council stood virtually alone in resisting Thatcher is also an indictment of the national leadership of the Labour party of the period. Neil Kinnock bears responsibility for failing to support Labour councils in defending their communities, just as he also failed to support the miners in 1984-85. As a Labour party member of over 40 years, I am confident that our current leader would not disown members of the Labour movement engaged in similar struggles. John Lynch Bramham, West Yorkshire \u2022 This week the political clocks turned back three decades, with Derek Hatton rejoining Labour, and Chuka Umunna, Ann Coffey et al leaving. In the 1980s, as a trade union officer and party activist, I saw on the ground the behaviour of the Militant Tendency and came to the view that it had no place in democratic politics. At the time the union movement helped to support Neil Kinnock in rescuing the party from oblivion, and change was driven forward by subsequent leaders, making Labour electable. We are now back to the 80s and disillusionment is setting in. Labour should be at least 10 points ahead in the polls; we are not. We should be growing as a party; we are not. We have no cohesive strategy to deal with the biggest issues facing the country. John McDonnell is right: we need a \u201cmammoth listening exercise\u201d. But the leadership needs to do more than just listen \u2013 we need action to recover the party from the current mess. Sadly, I see no sign of that happening. Andrew Miller Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston 1992-2015, and former official of ASTMS, then MSF 1977-1992 \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Japan was the most significant on a list of 27 EU trade agreements on which discussions about possible roll-over are ongoing released by the Department of International Trade today.</li> <li><strong>Theresa May has rejected criticism of the Conservative party by the three MPs who quit yesterday.</strong> In a written response to Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, the prime minister said the party was \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201copen-hearted\u201d.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6ed716e4b0cc09362e0b52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T16:53:50.798Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bim Afolami, the Tory MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, says he is to become the first male MP to use proxy voting while on paternity leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BimAfolami/status/1098522722018181120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In a few days time I&#39;ll be going on paternity leave to support my amazing wife who&#39;s having our third baby! \ud83d\udc76<br><br>I&#39;ll still be available to respond to constituents, and thanks to new reforms I&#39;ll also become the first dad on paternity leave to be able to vote by proxy! \ud83d\udc47 <a href=\"https://t.co/KvpK5vBy1N\">pic.twitter.com/KvpK5vBy1N</a></p>&mdash; Bim Afolami MP (@BimAfolami) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BimAfolami/status/1098522722018181120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 21, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c6ed546e4b0ac8d72de5884\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T16:50:15.014Z\">4.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM rejects defectors' criticisms</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prime minister has sent a response to the three MPs who announced yesterday that they are leaving the Conservative party.</p> <p>In a letter addressed \u201cDear Anna [Soubry], Sarah [Wollaston] and Heidi [Allen]\u201d she defends the government\u2019s record:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know you will not have come to your decision lightly, but I must say that I do not accept the picture you paint of our party. Indeed, in each of the areas you highlight, our record in government shows that we are the moderate, open-hearted Conservative Party in the One Nation tradition you speak of.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Brexit, she says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In my time in government and politics I have seen the consequences of people in power not giving a voice to those without one, or ignoring people when they speak. I believe we must not make that mistake by failing to deliver on the result of the referendum. I know that you disagree with equal passion and conviction and, like me, are motivated by what you consider to be right for the country. </p> <p>The UK\u2019s membership of the European Union has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy.

This would occur through a number of channels - disruptions to logistics, supply, trade, investment, migration and market confidence. Whilst the scale of the shock is uncertain, it has the potential to push the Scottish economy into recession, with a corresponding increase in unemployment. If prolonged, the shock could lead to significant structural change in the economy.</p> <p>Any shock is likely to have disproportionate sectoral, as well as, regional impacts. Sectors with high levels of exports to the EU, who are reliant on EU workers and free movement of labour, are part of integrated EU supply chains and/or are subject to EU regulatory and licencing requirements are likely to see the greatest impact. Other sectors would be exposed in the event of a wider economic slowdown.</p> <p>The agriculture, food and fishing sectors are among those who have a particularly high level of exposure under a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today and all your comments. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In the meantime here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main developments: Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should support Shamima Begum\u2019s return to Britain. Speaking in Brussels, the Labour leader described stripping the teenager who fled to Syria of her citizenship as a \u201cvery extreme manoeuvre\u201d. Corbyn called the danger of Britain leaving the EU without a deal \u201cvery serious\u201d. He said people in the EU were very worried about such a prospect. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator has questioned the usefulness of an extension to Article 50. After meeting Corbyn, Michel Barnier said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more time, we need decisions from the British parliament.\u201d The UK will not be able to roll over the European Union\u2019s trade deal with Japan in time for the scheduled date of Brexit on 29 March, the International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has confirmed. Japan was the most significant on a list of 27 EU trade agreements on which discussions about possible roll-over are ongoing released by the Department of International Trade today. Theresa May has rejected criticism of the Conservative party by the three MPs who quit yesterday. In a written response to Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, the prime minister said the party was \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201copen-hearted\u201d. Bim Afolami, the Tory MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, says he is to become the first male MP to use proxy voting while on paternity leave. The prime minister has sent a response to the three MPs who announced yesterday that they are leaving the Conservative party. In a letter addressed \u201cDear Anna [Soubry], Sarah [Wollaston] and Heidi [Allen]\u201d she defends the government\u2019s record: I know you will not have come to your decision lightly, but I must say that I do not accept the picture you paint of our party. Indeed, in each of the areas you highlight, our record in government shows that we are the moderate, open-hearted Conservative Party in the One Nation tradition you speak of. On Brexit, she says In my time in government and politics I have seen the consequences of people in power not giving a voice to those without one, or ignoring people when they speak. I believe we must not make that mistake by failing to deliver on the result of the referendum. I know that you disagree with equal passion and conviction and, like me, are motivated by what you consider to be right for the country. The UK\u2019s membership of the European Union has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy. I have sought to bring people back together. Like you, I was one of the 48% of people who voted to remain in the EU \u2013 but I believe very firmly that it is the duty of all of us in parliament, particularly those of us who voted to hold the referendum and promised to abide by its result, to deliver what the majority of people voted for. That is what the deal the government has negotiated will do \u2013 delivering on the result of the referendum while maintaining a close economic and security relationship with our European neighbours. She concludes: I was sorry to read, and do not accept, the parallel you draw with the way Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left have warped a once proud Labour Party and allowed the poison of antisemitism to go unchecked. I am determined that under my leadership the Conservative Party will always offer the decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve. I hope we can continue to work together on issues where we agree. The European Parliament\u2019s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said he had \u201copen and constructive\u201d talks with Jeremy Corbyn with a \u201cconsensus that [a] reckless no-deal should be off the table\u201d. Verhofstadt restated the European Parliament\u2019s plea for a \u201cbroad majority\u201d to be found for a deal at Westminster through a cross-party approach. He said MEPs were open to an \u201cupgraded\u201d political declaration as a way forward. In other news, the UK will not be able to roll over the European Union\u2019s trade deal with Japan in time for the scheduled date of Brexit on 29 March, the International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has confirmed. Japan was the most significant on a list of 27 EU trade agreements on which discussions about possible roll-over are ongoing released by the Department of International Trade (DIT). It also noted the EU\u2019s customs union agreement with Turkey, which covers 1.39% of UK trade, will not be transitioned on exit day. The UK has so far been able to finalise \u201ccontinuity agreements\u201d with seven of the 69 countries and regions with which the EU has trade deals - Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, eastern and southern Africa, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Fox said in a statement that mutual recognition agreements signed with the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand should ensure that businesses do not face additional bureaucracy after Brexit. The DIT said: While a number of these continuity agreements are likely to be concluded by exit day, it is the duty of government to produce a highly-cautious list of those that may not be in place in order that businesses and individuals ensure that they are prepared for every eventuality. It remains our priority to conclude trade continuity agreements with these countries by exit day or as soon as possible thereafter. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said the news about the Japan trade deal underlined the dangers of a no-deal break. He said: One of the great myths of Brexit was that we could instantly sign new trade deals whilst seamlessly rolling over the existing deals we already have with over 70 countries as a member of the EU. This is damaging myth which has proven to be false. Should no-deal materialise, this will cause serious problems for our economy. Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a supporter of the people\u2019s vote campaign, said: Brexiters promised that voting leave would mean a bonanza of new international trade deals that would make up for lost trade with the EU. Instead, Brexit is costing us the global trade deals we already have as EU members. Liam Fox is now finally admitting that his promise to roll over all existing EU trade deals in time for Brexit is going to be broken. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has expressed similar sentiments to Jeremy Corbyn, in an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World at One. She said: To arbitrarily remove her nationality raises a great many questions. It\u2019s not legal to render somebody stateless like that. Here is the Labour leader expressing concern over the government\u2019s approach to the Shamima Begum case. Jeremy Corbyn called for the British government to support Shamima Begum\u2019s return to Britain during his visit to Brussels. The Labour leader also expressed his concern over the ability of the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to revoke her citizenship. He said: She was born in Britain, she has that right to remain in Britain and obviously a lot of questions she has to answer but also some support that she needs. She obviously has, in my view, a right to return to Britain. On that return she must face a lot of questions about everything she\u2019s done. And at that point any action may or may not be taken. I think the idea of stripping somebody of their citizenship when they were born in Britain is a very extreme manoeuvre. Indeed I question the right of the home secretary to have these powers when the original law was brought in by Theresa May when she was home secretary. Euro MPs are confirming that the mood in Brussels is anything but positive with some choice words today. The prominent Greek MEP, Stelios Koulouglou, told the Guardian: Everyone in the [EU] negotiating team is completely fed up with May. They feel she doesn\u2019t have a clear plan, she changes constantly and instead of being serious, is playing cheap political games. Koulouglou, who represents Greece\u2019s governing leftist Syriza party, said the British prime minister\u2019s negotiating team now had \u201ca very, very bad reputation\u201d at what was seen as a particularly sensitive juncture in talks. The response when the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, was asked about the prospect of an extension to Article 50, sounds somewhat exasperated: We don\u2019t need more time, we need decisions from the British parliament. If this question was raised, the first reaction of the heads of state - whose unanimous approval is required - would be to say: \u2018What for? How much time?\u2019 He suggested that Brussels would be ready to make changes to the political declaration on the future UK/EU relationship if London wanted to make it \u201cmore ambitious\u201d, for instance by proposing a permanent customs union. There was \u201cno doubt\u201d that the EU27 would maintain their solidarity with the Republic of Ireland on the border issue, said Barnier. Jeremy Corbyn, who accused Theresa May of deliberately running down the clock in order to get her deal through, said that the prospect of an extension to Article 50 was a \u201ccomplex and difficult question to answer\u201d. Turning away from Brexit to one of the other big stories of the week \u2013 the decision to strip Shamima Begum of her citizenship. A couple of voices have emerged this lunchtime on what should happen to her. The Conservative chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, demands the use of the Treason Act of 1351 - which currently only applies to offences against the monarch \u2013 to prosecute Begum. He tells the BBC\u2019s Politics Live that he understands the home secretary\u2019s actions but believes that there\u2019s a problem with UK law which makes it difficult to prosecute this kind of case: She has clearly gone out to support a group that has sought to do violence, sought to murder people like us here in the UK. That\u2019s an extraordinary betrayal and we should be able to reflect that in law. The government\u2019s chief adviser on countering extremism, meanwhile, has focused on the danger that stripping her of her citizenship could help radical Islamists. Sara Khan said: The government has to recognise the unease felt by a wide range of people about decisions of this kind, not least those from minority communities with dual nationality. It has to build trust in its approach, because Islamist extremists will exploit alienation and grievance to turn people against their country. Meanwhile, Michel Barnier has told a French newspaper that Brexit talks remain at an \u201cimpasse\u201d, and repeated that Brussels will not consider reopening the withdrawal agreement or renegotiating the backstop. \u201cThe process is in an impasse at the moment. We are waiting for Theresa May to tell us how she sees things and what she wants,\u201d he tells La Croix. \u201cBut we are not going to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal treaty, we will not change the content of the Irish protocol which preserves peace in Ireland and the integrity of the single market. \u201cIt is rather for the UK, as guarantor of the Good Friday agreement, to respect the integrity of our single market and to bring us solutions.\u201d A bit more from Corbyn: \u201cThe threat of no deal is something that has deeply exercised people throughout the European Union. They are very worried about the consequences of it. \u201cThat was conveyed to us in no uncertain terms during the meetings. That is why we are determined to get no deal off the table.\u201d Corbyn says that during the meetings they discussed Labour\u2019s alternative proposals for a customs union. \u201cWe are strongly of the belief that these proposals are credible \u2013 and that has been confirmed by our meetings today \u2013 and that they could be negotiated,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is the prime minister is insisting on her deal, which has already been defeated very heavily in parliament, and running down the clock by trying to keep the threat of no-deal on the table with all the damage that does.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is speaking to reporters after holding talks with Michel Barnier. Accompanied by Labour frontbenchers Keir Starmer and Shami Chakrabarti, he says that the talks were \u201cuseful and informative\u201d. He calls the danger of Britain leaving the EU without a deal \u201cvery serious\u201d. Conservative MP Phillip Lee had been considered a possible Tory defector when he didn\u2019t answer calls from reporters \u2013 only for it to transpire that he had been at the cinema with his wife. Now Jess Elgot reports that he has met the prime minister: Lee, the chair of the pro-referendum Right To Vote campaign, met the prime minister in Downing Street on Thursday morning. Lee, who resigned as a justice minister over the party\u2019s Brexit policy, had been one of the MPs viewed as most likely to join the new Independent Group. Lee said he had decided not to quit but suggested his future movements would be governed by the response of the many ministers who have threatened to rebel next week to back an amendment to extend article 50 to avoid no deal. And here he is on his way out of Downing Street earlier. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has accused Theresa May of running down the clock in the Brexit talks with the EU. He said conversations with key EU officials confirmed his fears that May intends to wait until the last moment \u201cto put a binary choice to parliament: her deal versus no deal\u201d. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has warned a no-deal Brexit would damage the national interests and refused to rule out resigning should it come to pass. He said his job was to avoid that \u201cprecipice\u201d. Two senior Tory MPs have both said they would leave the Conservative party if there was a no-deal Brexit. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve and the former education secretary Justine Greening said they could join the three Conservative MPs who quit yesterday. Christopher Davies, the Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, has been charged over allegations he falsified two invoices in support of parliamentary expenses claim. He will appear in court on 22 March. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said the eight MPs who quit the party should seek re-election, describing it as \u201cthe decent and democratic thing for them to do\u201d. He also insisted he was committed to rooting out antisemitism. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said he is \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided, warning that such a scenario would be disastrous. In response, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said the EU remained committed to the UK leaving with a deal. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell has hinted wants article 50 to be extended if May is unable to win backing for her EU deal next week. He said he would do everything he could to prevent a no-deal Brexit and repeatedly repeatedly to rule out resigning from the cabinet if necessary. Polly Toynbee writes that it is difficult to see what the Independent Group can offer and how it can make a breakthrough without proportional representation. Once you remove Brexit, what\u2019s left? In these three breakaway women MPs, the Tory party has lost some of their best, most human faces who could yet be joined by others of their ilk \u2013 say, Nick Boles, Jo Johnson and Sam Gyimah. But it is not tribal to point out that nice Tories are still Tories, as Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston eagerly confirmed that in their departure. They both still think extreme austerity was necessary, and they backed it \u2013 yes, even the nice GP who saw its effect on her NHS. Can a new party blend Labour and Tory MPs and attract more than a smattering of the Labour voters it needs? Anyone can change their mind, anyone can be forgiven past errors, but these Tories haven\u2019t repented, [Anna] Soubry still praises her old party\u2019s \u201csound finance\u201d. What would be their economic policy? ... Without PR, voters are forced to hold their noses and vote against their most hated of the two old blocs. That breeds political cynicism and kills enthusiasm. The Independent Group, bouncing with optimism, may break all the old certainties: more likely the old certainties of first past the post will break them. Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman has responded to comments by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that he is \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided and warning that such a scenario would be disastrous (see 10.45am update). The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters: We have been making progress but there is clearly a lot of hard work still to do. But we absolutely do want to bring back the meaningful vote as soon as possible. Asked about Juncker\u2019s downbeat assessment, the spokesman insisted that yesterday\u2019s talks were \u201cconstructive\u201d, adding: It is still very much the position of the EU that they want the UK to leave with a deal. That means everyone working together with energy in order to secure the assurances that parliament needs. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, has hinted he does want article 50 to be extended if Theresa May is unable to win backing for her EU deal next week. Mundell told an audience in Edinburgh he would do \u201ceverything I can and whatever I deem necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit\u201d, and refused repeatedly to rule out resigning from the cabinet if necessary. He did not deny a report that he was one of four senior cabinet members, along with Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, who has told May she had to delay Brexit if there was no Commons majority for her deal next week. That implies he could support the bill being put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper next week which will require article 50 to be extended if May cannot win a majority for her deal: if he did vote against the government, he would almost certainly be sacked from the cabinet. He said: I don\u2019t comment on private conversations that I have had with the PM, but what I have said to her repeatedly and have said at the cabinet is that a no-deal Brexit is a very bad outcome for Scotland and the UK and we must do everything that we can to avoid that outcome. He insisted his preference is for the Commons to back the Brady amendment, once May had won clarification on the lifespan and legal status of the Irish backstop, and appeared to reject the proposal for a new referendum on backing May\u2019s deal or remaining in the EU. He said: I don\u2019t support the so-called people\u2019s vote. I\u2019m most certainly not leaving the Conservative party. The Conservative party remains a broad church. I\u2019m disappointed that colleagues have chosen to leave. Anna Soubry is a good friend of mine and she obviously feels very strongly on the Brexit issue. Asked whether he could quit the cabinet, he said: I don\u2019t think the soap opera psycho drama that grows up who\u2019s resigning who is not resigning really helpful to the debate. What I\u2019m interested in and always have been is the outcome, so what I\u2019m determined to do is to prevent a no deal Brexit happening because of the damage that would do in Scotland and the damage it\u2019s likely to do to the union. I will do everything I can and whatever I deem necessary to prevent a no deal Brexit coming about but I\u2019m not making wild suggestions or setting out strict parameters of what that may or may not be. The chair of the Labour party, Ian Lavery, has written a scathing criticism for the Guardian of the eight MPs who quit the party this week, saying that they, along with the Tory MPs who left their party, represent the few and not the many. Now that three Tories have joined the new \u201cindependent grouping\u201d, we should be under no illusions that this rightwing establishment tribute act\u2019s sole aim is to prevent a transformative Labour government at any cost... The era of big money corporate donors bankrolling politicians so they can preserve a system that rips off the many and works only for the super-rich is over. That is why this breakaway of a handful of MPs from both parties must be fought and rejected for what it is \u2013 a well-funded and coordinated effort to defend the huge power and privilege that the 1% enjoy. However, in the same article, Lavery does acknowledge genuine concerns about antisemitism. As party chair I recognise that antisemitism is a growing concern across our society and sadly within small pockets of our party. The abuse that Jewish MPs, and female Jewish MPs in particular, receive both online and in person is abhorrent. If Labour party members are found to be antisemitic they should be booted out of the party and they will be. Christopher Davies, the Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, has been charged over allegations that he falsified two invoices in support of parliamentary expenses claims. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: In November 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan police relating to an allegation that Christopher Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, falsified two invoices in support of parliamentary expenses claims. Following a review of the evidence, the CPS has today charged Mr Davies with two offences of making a false instrument and one offence of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. He will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 22 March. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, has been giving a speech on Brexit. Taking questions, he refused to deny that he had urged Theresa May to extend article 50. He would also not be pressed on whether he would leave the cabinet in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Scottish government today published its assessment of the implications for Scotland of a no-deal Brexit, assuming Britain leaves the EU on 29 March. It reads: It has the potential to generate a major dislocation to the Scottish economy. This would occur through a number of channels - disruptions to logistics, supply, trade, investment, migration and market confidence. Whilst the scale of the shock is uncertain, it has the potential to push the Scottish economy into recession, with a corresponding increase in unemployment. If prolonged, the shock could lead to significant structural change in the economy. Any shock is likely to have disproportionate sectoral, as well as, regional impacts. Sectors with high levels of exports to the EU, who are reliant on EU workers and free movement of labour, are part of integrated EU supply chains and/or are subject to EU regulatory and licencing requirements are likely to see the greatest impact. Other sectors would be exposed in the event of a wider economic slowdown. The agriculture, food and fishing sectors are among those who have a particularly high level of exposure under a no-deal Brexit. As employment in these sectors tends to be highest in more rural areas, such regions may be particularly exposed to Brexit. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said he is \u201cnot very optimistic\u201d that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided and warned of the negative consequences that it would bring. Juncker, who held talks with Theresa May on Wednesday in Brussels, said he had \u201cBrexit fatigue\u201d and regarded the issue as a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Speaking to the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels, he said: Brexit is deconstruction, it is not construction. Brexit is the past, it is not the future. We are trying to deliver our best efforts in order to have this Brexit being organised in a proper, civilised, well-thought-out way. But we are not there, because in the British parliament there is, every time they are voting, a majority against something, there is never a majority in favour of something. If a no-deal would happen \u2013 and I can\u2019t exclude this \u2013 this would have terrible economic and social consequences, both in Britain and on the continent, and so my efforts orient in a way that the worst can be avoided. But I am not very optimistic when it comes to this issue. Anna Soubry, who left the Conservative party yesterday, is hosting the mid-morning show on LBC, which began at 10am, standing in for regular host James O\u2019Brien, who is on holiday. She is asking people to ring in to answer the question as to whether she did the right thing in leaving the Conservative party. Soubry began the show by saying \u201csome stuff happened yesterday\u201d, describing what happened as \u201ca bit of a wrench, a bit emotional, a bit scary\u201d but she said it was more scary hosting a show on LBC. She said she had had thousands of emails supporting her move from constituents. The second caller, Neil, is very angry, he calls Soubry \u201cduplicitous\u201d and \u201ctwo-faced\u201d over her stance on Brexit and says: \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d He wants a byelection in her constituency. The next caller, Samina, is far more amenable, saying there are millions of people in the country who do not have a political home. Labour of course has had its own problems and Jeremy Corbyn has responded to the departure of eight of its MPs by demanding that they put themselves up for re-election. He said: These MPs now want to abandon the policies on which they were elected so the decent and democratic thing for them to do is to resign and put themselves up for election. And I want to make it absolutely clear, I regard the fight against antisemitism as an absolute priority and we are utterly determined to root out antisemitism from our party and our society. He described Labour as the \u201conly party with a deep-rooted history of combatting racism\u201d. This is how today\u2019s papers covered the Tory walkouts, with the rightwing papers particularly scathing of the trio: Hammond\u2019s comments are sure to cause more twitchiness inside Number 10. Heidi Allen, one of three Tory MPs who quit to join the Independent Group yesterday, told ITV\u2019s Peston last night that roughly a third of the party\u2019s MP \u2013 around 100 of her former colleagues \u2013 shared her frustrations at its direction. Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve have both place themselves firmly within that cohort. Good morning, this is Haroon Siddique sitting in for Andrew Sparrow. Stay tuned for all the day\u2019s political developments. If you want to get my attention, the best way is probably to tweet me. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, has warned of the harm a no-deal Brexit would cause and refused to say whether he would quit his post if such a scenario materialised. Hammond\u2019s equivocation came as the former attorney general Dominic Grieve and the former education secretary Justine Greening both said they would leave the Conservative party if there was a no-deal Brexit. In an interview with BBC One\u2019s Breakfast, Hammond was repeatedly asked whether he would quit the cabinet if Theresa May went for a no-deal Brexit. He replied: \u201cI will always do what I believe is in the best interests of the country.\u201d Asked if a no-deal Brexit would be in the UK\u2019s best interests, he said: No, definitely not. My job is to make sure that the government gets us a solution which does not take us to that no-deal precipice. I have been crystal-clear on this for the last two-and-a-half years. That is what I am working for all day, every day, and, so long as I believe I am able to influence that outcome and help to get us to a good outcome here, which will protect British jobs and British prosperity, that\u2019s what I will go on doing.",

      "bodyText": "Television drama is rarely reflective of reality. We immerse ourselves in shows whose characters find themselves in situations more sensational and stirring than our own lives, willingly suspending our disbelief for an episode or a season. The new ABC series The Heights, which premieres Friday night, offers something refreshing: a credible social drama that attempts to depict Australian life in its myriad forms. The 30-episode half-hour drama is more expansive than its commercial-TV counterparts, bridging the gulf that separates real life from the whitewashed worlds of Ramsay Street and Summer Bay. Shot in Perth and set in the fictional inner-city suburb of Arcadia Heights, the series \u2013 or at least its first four episodes, on which this review is based \u2013 challenges prescribed notions of what a soap opera should be: there\u2019s relationships and emotional drama aplenty, but also pointed interrogations of class and identity. Its characters live in or near Arcadia Towers, a social housing block holding firm amid its gentrifying surrounds. The action takes place in the building, its local hospital, its local school and its local pub \u2013 giving the writers the best of all TV worlds to work with. And although it shouldn\u2019t be, the diversity of the cast is impressive, accurately reflecting the heterogeneity of Australian life without resorting to tokenism. Bucking the trending for TV drama, in which individuals from non-European backgrounds, LGBTQI people and Australians with disabilities are chronically underrepresented, two-thirds of The Heights\u2019 core ensemble are from diverse (Indigenous, disability, culturally and linguistically diverse) backgrounds, and more than half the speaking roles are female. The writing team is also predominantly female, and includes three Indigenous writers and three culturally and linguistically diverse writers. But the show\u2019s stats \u2013 while impressive \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be taken as an end in themselves: in this case, at least, diversity makes for better, more believable TV. Perhaps that\u2019s because The Heights doesn\u2019t reduce characters\u2019 identities to their component parts. Teenager Sabine Rosso (Bridie McKim) has mild cerebral palsy, but this fact is just one facet of her life as a young woman grappling with incipient independence and life at a new school, while playing confidante to her single mother, emergency doctor Claudia (an excellent Roz Hammond). There\u2019s also credible storylines involving university student Sully (Koa Nuen), who works in his mother (Carina Hoang) Iris\u2019s grocery store, and his Iranian friend Ash Jafari (Phoenix Raei). Considerations have been made of even the smallest detail: in one scene, ex-cop Pav (Marcus Graham) and his kids, who are not Asian, eat takeaway at the beach with chopsticks. Australia is large; its people contain multitudes. The Heights is worlds apart from Neighbours and Home and Away; it took both soaps three decades to write in storylines with gay characters last year, and excepting short-lived stints featuring token ethnic families (the Lims on Ramsay Street in the early 90s, for example, who were accused of eating a resident\u2019s missing dog) the White Australia Policy might as well still be in place in their universe. Episodes of The Heights are punctuated with wry one-liners and genuine warmth, particularly between parents and their children. Vietnamese store-owner Iris has a touch of The Family Law humour about her, issuing blunt missives that are endearingly familiar to children of Asian parents. \u201cIt was just an idea,\u201d says Sully to his mother, after she rejects a suggestion of his. \u201cSo was communism,\u201d Iris whips back. For a culturally diverse series, it feels a little on the nose to feature an apparently alcoholic Irish character who repeatedly laments the local pub\u2019s closure \u2013 and there\u2019s cliche to be found in the chronically overworked corporate lawyer, Leonie (Shari Sebbens), who keeps interrupting conversations with family to compulsively answer her ringing phone. The soap \u2013 and it is a soap, with early storylines replete with an abandoned baby, a disputed will and an absconding daughter \u2013 is not perfect, but its ambition outshines its flaws. The Heights doesn\u2019t baulk at addressing class issues \u2013 but in a manner not as overtly comedic but no less tongue-in-cheek than fellow ABC series Upper Middle Bogan. \u201cOur house prices would go up 20% if those towers weren\u2019t there,\u201d a relatively affluent character says to Leonie, adding when she senses she may have caused offence: \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has handed $21.5m to a healthcare provider to treat asylum seekers on Manus Island for 10 months without finalising a proper contract. It comes despite damning allegations of inadequate care and links to a former deputy prime minister of Papua New Guinea previously found guilty of misconduct for his handling of public funds. Pacific International Hospital (PIH), the operator of the Port Moresby hospital, was chosen to deliver healthcare services at a clinic on Manus from May last year, after the previous provider, International Health and Medical Services, departed the island. The Department of Home Affairs chose PIH in a limited tender process, similar to that used in the Paladin and Canstruct cases. Guardian Australia has confirmed with the department that it has still not finalised a contract with PIH almost 10 months later, despite having already paid the company $21.5m. The department has instead relied on a series of letters of intent to engage PIH. \u201cFor probity reasons, the department cannot provide further details until contractual arrangements are finalised and the details are made public on AusTender,\u201d the department said. Delays in finalising deals with contractors were raised in a damning 2017 audit report about the department\u2019s handling of offshore processing centre contracts. PIH is chaired by former PNG deputy prime minister, Sir Moi Avei, who was in 2007 found guilty of misconduct in office for the way he handled public funds. However, there is no suggestion that he is misusing Australian funds or any funds related to PIH, or that he is not fit to act as a director or chairman. Serious concerns have also been raised about PIH\u2019s expertise and treatment standards, both by asylum seekers still on Manus and during a 2016 coronial inquest into the death of Hamid Kehazaei. PIH\u2019s Port Moresby hospital was found sorely lacking in its treatment of Kehazaei, who died in 2014 from a treatable leg infection. An inquest into his death heard PIH staff had failed to comprehend that Kehazaei was critically ill and dying, leaving him unattended even as the life-saving machines he was attached to were sounding alarms. A Queensland coroner found PIH lacked \u201cnecessary clinical skills\u201d, provided \u201cinadequate\u201d care, and was far too slow in treating Kehazaei. It found Kehazaei had \u201crequired urgent and aggressive resuscitation with intubation, ventilation, intravenous fluids and broadspectrum antibiotics\u201d, none of which he received. \u201cI conclude that if Mr Khazaei had been intubated immediately on arrival at the PIH and provided with adequate ventilation support, in addition to intravenous fluids and antibiotics, it is likely that he would have survived,\u201d the coroner found. Guardian Australia has also heard further complaints from those currently on Manus about substandard care from the PIH clinic at the East Lorengau refugee transit centre (ELRTC). Among the numerous allegations received by Guardian Australia are accusations of people being refused admission, even as nurses and Paladin security guards advocated for the patient at the door, and of refusals to transfer people to Port Moresby even with medical referrals. Other allegations include denial of simple pain relief, distribution of expired medication, poor standards of care, and broken or missing equipment and medication. There are repeated reports of the clinic being closed at random hours of the day, despite having daytime and after-hours staff. Journalist and refugee, Behrouz Boochani, said he believed PIH was making significant amounts of money from Australia, but did little with it. \u201cI think Paladin is much better than PIH. Paladin is here, there is someone,\u201d he said. \u201cPaladin is there to write our name and show our ID and they give us our food. At least they do this. \u201cI think PIH is worse than Paladin.\u201d \u201cWhat is happening on the ground is very different. They make big money, but they do nothing.\u201d Patients requiring further care are transferred to Port Moresby for treatment at Pacific International Hospital, but this is also subject to consistent complaints, including long delays before they are seen by doctors. Refugees have reported a growing mental health crisis, with dozens of acts of self harm and suicide attempts. The transit centre clinic in Lorengau employs 13 health care professionals including three medical officers, three nurses, one paramedic, an after-hours GP and one after-hours nurse. The five mental health workers include just one psychiatrist. In Port Moresby PIH has five health care professionals and three mental health professionals, but no psychiatrist. The PIH chairman, Avei, was deputy prime minister from 2004 to 2006, before being suspended pending the misconduct probe. In 2007, Avei was found guilty of misconduct over his handling of public funds. Avei was given 250,000 kina (AU$100,000) in district support grants from the PNG government, and deposited the money into an account titled \u201cMoi Avei\u2019s Discretionary Funds\u201d. He was found guilty of failing to ensure the grants went to the rural infrastructure projects to which they was allocated. Avei has served on the boards of a range of large companies in PNG, including Bougainville Copper Limited, Kumul Petroleum Holdings, OK Tedi Mining, and PNG Water Limited. PIH declined to comment when approached by Guardian Australia. PIH\u2019s current letter of intent with the Australian government expires next week, according to tender records. IHMS\u2019s contract to provide care inside the detention centre expired in October 2017, in line with the centre\u2019s scheduled closure, but was extended by the PNG government. In statements at the time, IHMS reported it would continue to provide care from the ELRTC clinic from November, and it eventually left Manus at the end of April 2018. Senate estimates in late May (pdf) heard PIH had been engaged under a letter of intent to deliver \u201clike for like\u201d services, comparative to IHMS.",

There are \u201cfewer people employed full time now as a percentage of the labour force than there were in 2013\u201d, he will say, 68.6% down from 69.7%. Some 1.8m want a job or want more work due to \u201crecord under-employment\u201d of 1.1m people, he says. \u201cThe party of private enterprise would have people believe that we\u2019ve seen rapid jobs growth in the private sector because of their superior economic competence. \u201cBut actually, a disproportionate component of job creations have been in public or publicly funded industries.\u201d Bowen cites the fact that more than 570,000 jobs were created in public-funded industries such as health, education and public administration. The National Disability Insurance Scheme \u2013 a \u201cLabor initiative\u201d \u2013 is expected to add 163,000 jobs, he says. \u201cWhile we were doing better than most other advanced economies during and in the aftermath of the [global financial crisis], we\u2019ve now got an unemployment rate inferior to comparable nations like the UK, US and New Zealand.\u201d Bowen said the government\u2019s promise of 1.25m jobs over five years \u201cfar from being ambitious\u201d is \u201cactually just keeping in line with historic trends\u201d, if growth stays at the historical average rate of 1.9%. On wages, Bowen notes that then-treasurer Scott Morrison predicted 18 months ago that \u201cconsumers will start to see their real wages growing in line with productivity again\u201d but Bowen says \u201cthis has not happened\u201d. \u201cThey have had to downgrade their wages growth forecasts in every one of their budgets and they will have to again in April.\u201d Bowen said real wages as measured by the real value of compensation of employees per hour increased by just more than 1% over the last five years, compared with a 9% increase from 2008 to 2013. Between 2013 and 2017 Australia ranked 27th of 35 countries for wage growth in the OECD, with wage growth less than half the average, he says. \u201cSo over the tenure of this government we\u2019ve gone from doing better than most to doing worse than most.\u201d On Thursday the minister for jobs Kelly O\u2019Dwyer sad that full-time employment was at a record high of 8,743,100 after growing by 236,100 over the year.",

The Independent Group extemporising philosophically on roundtable debate shows. There\u2019s enough unnecessary, inexplicable, depressing nonsense on television to be dealing with these days without getting worked up about VAR. So hats off to Pep Guardiola for shrugging his shoulders last night and declaring himself \u201ca big fan\u201d of the much-maligned, pernickety officiating system which has only tarnished three Big Cup knockout matches and one World Cup final so far. \u201cI trust VAR!\u201d he trilled with the magnanimity one can only afford when your team has dodged a bullet and it might be best to keep your powder dry so you can properly kick off when the video ref awards Real Madrid a preposterous last-minute penalty in the next round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/21/var-drama-schalke-manchester-city-debates-enhanced-experience\">VAR brings drama \u2013 it enhanced the Champions League at Schalke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last night, Manchester City were struggling to find a new way to capitulate in European competition. They had been leading at Schalke and bossing the game, so VAR gave them a little nudge in the right direction, penalising Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi for a clear and obvious subjective transgression, then Fernandinho for an unequivocal something or other that you could interpret any number of ways. <br><br>Fortunately for City, the genius of Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/schalke-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">turned it around for them at the death</a>, allowing Pep to give the oft-criticised hair-splitting regulatory process his blessing. \u201cI have arguments sometimes but not this time, they are both penalties,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/20/pep-guardiola-manchester-citys-win-schalke-champions-league-var\">he chirped</a>, with the studied generosity of a man who is keeping his counsel so he can lose the place completely when VAR disallows City\u2019s injury-time equaliser against Real Madrid for a marginal and not totally obvious offside toenail.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s favourite pedantic remote officiating tool also stuck its neb into the Atl\u00e9ti-Juve tie. \u00c1lvaro Morata had a goal ruled out for winning a physical duel with Giorgio Chiellini, a push so brazenly egregious it took a couple of minutes for everyone to decide it might be a foul, probably, sort of. Fortunately for Atl\u00e9tico, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez scored one that actually stood not long after, even if everyone still had to pause for a few seconds to check it was going to get a tick from teacher. As fans of cricket, rugby and NFL will attest, this sort of nonsense usually ruins the spontaneous joy of celebration, so it was nice to see Diego Simeone bucking that trend. He refused to wait for permission, instead reacting in the moment and immediately turning towards the stand, cupping his trouser arrangement in delight. \u201cI did it to show our fans that we have cojones,\u201d he later explained, of the only action last night that really was worth watching over and again.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Scott Murray from 5.55pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Arsenal 2-1 BATE (2-2 agg), while Paul Doyle will be on hand for Valencia 4-0 Celtic (6-0 agg) and Nick Ames from 8pm for Chelsea 3-1 Malm\u00f6 (5-2 agg)</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/feb/21/cristiano-ronaldo-champions-league-atletico-juventus-five-zero\">\u201cI\u2019ve won five [Big Cups] and these guys zero!\u201d</a> \u2013 Him, a grown-up, storms past Madrid hacks in the post-match mixed zone after Juventus\u2019s Big Cup defeat to Atl\u00e9tico with steam billowing out of his lug-holes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51467352e5f4a67b1b4f6e71c1eb204eaff7b290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51467352e5f4a67b1b4f6e71c1eb204eaff7b290/107_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> <p>Get your ears around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/feb/21/champions-league-angry-ronaldo-football-weekly-extra\">Football Weekly Extraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cRE: Brendan Mackinney (and presumably 1,056 others from 1980s Nottinghamshire) - thanks for helping me win my bet with a coworker, who insisted Forest fans would bring up the [Big Cup] win\u201d \u2013 Sean Mansfield.</p> <p>\u201cOn the subject of taking people to football, many years ago I took my mum to see Brighton at the Goldstone.

Old Trafford has no idea how to make a Big Noise either, and where in London is it as loud and consistent?\u201d \u2013 Peter Hehir.</p> <p>\u201cMany years ago when Portsmouth were in the big league my Pompey loving boyfriend took me, a lifelong Saints fan to the ever fragrant Fratton ground. They duly beat Bolton 2-0 and I escaped with my life. We are married now but never speak of this. On a slightly different point I avoid the waste of \u00a350 a pop to watch millionaires faffing about and attend non league games at roughly a Fiver a go, and have a hell of a time.

      "bodyText": "TURN ON, TUNE IN, DROP OUT The punditry career of Robbie Savage. The reboot of Magnum PI. The Independent Group extemporising philosophically on roundtable debate shows. There\u2019s enough unnecessary, inexplicable, depressing nonsense on television to be dealing with these days without getting worked up about VAR. So hats off to Pep Guardiola for shrugging his shoulders last night and declaring himself \u201ca big fan\u201d of the much-maligned, pernickety officiating system which has only tarnished three Big Cup knockout matches and one World Cup final so far. \u201cI trust VAR!\u201d he trilled with the magnanimity one can only afford when your team has dodged a bullet and it might be best to keep your powder dry so you can properly kick off when the video ref awards Real Madrid a preposterous last-minute penalty in the next round. Last night, Manchester City were struggling to find a new way to capitulate in European competition. They had been leading at Schalke and bossing the game, so VAR gave them a little nudge in the right direction, penalising Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi for a clear and obvious subjective transgression, then Fernandinho for an unequivocal something or other that you could interpret any number of ways. Fortunately for City, the genius of Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling turned it around for them at the death, allowing Pep to give the oft-criticised hair-splitting regulatory process his blessing. \u201cI have arguments sometimes but not this time, they are both penalties,\u201d he chirped, with the studied generosity of a man who is keeping his counsel so he can lose the place completely when VAR disallows City\u2019s injury-time equaliser against Real Madrid for a marginal and not totally obvious offside toenail. Everyone\u2019s favourite pedantic remote officiating tool also stuck its neb into the Atl\u00e9ti-Juve tie. \u00c1lvaro Morata had a goal ruled out for winning a physical duel with Giorgio Chiellini, a push so brazenly egregious it took a couple of minutes for everyone to decide it might be a foul, probably, sort of. Fortunately for Atl\u00e9tico, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez scored one that actually stood not long after, even if everyone still had to pause for a few seconds to check it was going to get a tick from teacher. As fans of cricket, rugby and NFL will attest, this sort of nonsense usually ruins the spontaneous joy of celebration, so it was nice to see Diego Simeone bucking that trend. He refused to wait for permission, instead reacting in the moment and immediately turning towards the stand, cupping his trouser arrangement in delight. \u201cI did it to show our fans that we have cojones,\u201d he later explained, of the only action last night that really was worth watching over and again. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray from 5.55pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Arsenal 2-1 BATE (2-2 agg), while Paul Doyle will be on hand for Valencia 4-0 Celtic (6-0 agg) and Nick Ames from 8pm for Chelsea 3-1 Malm\u00f6 (5-2 agg). QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ve won five [Big Cups] and these guys zero!\u201d \u2013 Him, a grown-up, storms past Madrid hacks in the post-match mixed zone after Juventus\u2019s Big Cup defeat to Atl\u00e9tico with steam billowing out of his lug-holes. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Get your ears around Football Weekly Extraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRE: Brendan Mackinney (and presumably 1,056 others from 1980s Nottinghamshire) - thanks for helping me win my bet with a coworker, who insisted Forest fans would bring up the [Big Cup] win\u201d \u2013 Sean Mansfield. \u201cOn the subject of taking people to football, many years ago I took my mum to see Brighton at the Goldstone. About 10 minutes into the second half she piped up, with her cut glass accent echoing around the North Stand, \u201cJonathan, they\u2019re going the other way now!\u201d. To be fair, it wasn\u2019t always obvious in those days which direction Brighton were going - down, being the obvious answer\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Foulkes. \u201cLiverpool and their studio cheerleaders are always banging on about Anfield being the noisiest, most passionate crowd in the business. So why was it that the Bayern end was making all the noise, right through the match. While I am at it, the Schalke crowd was fantastic from start to the final whistle, despite their collapse to Manchester City. Far more noise, more variety, better drum beats and more \u2026support. Old Trafford has no idea how to make a Big Noise either, and where in London is it as loud and consistent?\u201d \u2013 Peter Hehir. \u201cMany years ago when Portsmouth were in the big league my Pompey loving boyfriend took me, a lifelong Saints fan to the ever fragrant Fratton ground.

Plenty more prizes to come. BITS AND BOBS Millwall have been charged by the FA after clips emerged of some fans appearing to sing racist songs during their FA Cup game against Everton. A Manchester City fan is in critical condition in hospital after an alleged assault following their win over Schalke on Wednesday. Kilmarnock manager Steve Clarke was resolutely unchuffed after being on the receiving end of sectarian abuse during his side\u2019s 5-0 defeat to Rangers. \u201cThey are not allowed to call my assistant [Alex Dyer] a black b but they can call me a Fenian bastard.

The disgraced former mogul was prompted to make a statement this week by a Gwyneth Paltrow profile in Variety. In this, the Shakespeare in Love star had recalled of that movie\u2019s casting: \u201cHarvey wanted Ben Affleck to take over and play Shakespeare. I said: \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that. You have to have an English person.\u2019\u201d The role of Shakespeare was played by Joseph Fiennes, while Affleck did a scenery-chewing turn as a self-centred actor.</p> <p>Still, did you ever hear the like? Weinstein certainly never heard the like. \u201cGwyneth Paltrow is an excellent actor and a fantastic person, who does so well when on the right project,\u201d he said in a statement via his publicist. \u201cThe only other contenders for the role of Will Shakespeare were Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke, no one else. Ben Affleck did a terrific job as Ned Alleyn, which is the role he was considered for.\u201d</p> <p>Mmmm. Quite a lot to unpack there, considering Paltrow\u2019s interview also reiterated the allegations of sexual misconduct she had previously levelled at Weinstein. Those, he declines to correct. He does, however, take the time to praise her as \u201ca fantastic person\u201d. If, like me, you have not been accused of sexual misconduct by any of the fantastic persons in your life, then this might seem a slightly strange thing to say. But perhaps Weinstein currently has two categories for women. They are: \u201cWomen who have accused me of sexual misconduct or much worse who are mad\u201d, and \u201cWomen who have accused me of sexual misconduct or much worse but who I totally think can be brought back round in due course\u201d. Optimistically, he seems to place Paltrow in the latter category.</p> <p>However, the main takeout from his statement is how well Harvey\u2019s rehab seems to have gone. God has granted him the serenity to accept the things he can\u2019t change, and the courage to change the things he can. So he accepts that everyone thinks he\u2019s a total sex case, but he will do everything in his power to change the perception that he would ever \u2013 and I mean ever \u2013 cast BEN AFFLECK as a LEADING MAN. You can say a lot of stuff about Weinstein, but you don\u2019t get to say that.</p>",

I am petrified he may not win this.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced [Junior] will win, because James DeGale has pedigree in terms of being [an Olympic] gold medallist, twice a world champion. It\u2019s real. I respect the man\u2019s abilities. Junior has it \u2013 but who turns up on the night?</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be strange to the audience but my son looks at the physical aspect of this person, the crowd \u2013 the physical game. And from a physical point of view, I don\u2019t think there is anyone who can actually stand with him. But it isn\u2019t just physical \u2013 it\u2019s also spiritual. This is where Junior lacks that blessing. It\u2019s the only thing that allowed me to win so many championship fights and allowed me to put up with the bigotry of the media, the keyboard warriors, the critics. I\u2019ve endured it all because, spiritually, I am buoyant, alive. I\u2019ve never come down to that level but I don\u2019t know whether he has that.\u201d</p> <p>The fighters, whose supposed mutual animus was diluted by rolling banter, meet at the O2 Arena in London for the vacant IBO super-middleweight title in a bout both say will either end or extend their careers.</p> <p>DeGale, who turned 33 three weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/10/james-degale-caleb-truax-fight-report\" title=\"\">lost his IBF 12st belt</a> to the lightly regarded American Caleb Truax in 2017 before winning the rematch and stopping the obscure Colombian underachiever Fidel Monterrosa Mu\u00f1oz in three rounds in an eight-rounder last September.</p> <p>He waved away Eubank Sr\u2019s praise and doubts to train his pre-fight ire at 29-year-old Junior, who has lost twice: to Billy Joe Saunders, who returns to the ring next month, when he challenges Shefat Isufi for the WBO\u2019s vacant version of the same title, and George Groves, who has retired.</p> <p>DeGale, whose experience should give him an edge, described Eubank as a, \u201cdeluded moron\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s all dawned on him \u2013 he\u2019s finished. I promise you, he will get a schooling.\u201d Addressing his opponent directly, he said, \u201cI am going to come out and give it to you properly. You can\u2019t box, Chris.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the biggest fight of his career, retirement time.

We have covered all bases, that is why I am so confident. If he runs we have a game plan, if he stands and plants his feet, we have a plan.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The trouble with boxing is that the real thing is invariably preceded by faux outrage and empty rhetoric, but it was nonetheless a minor jolt to hear Chris Eubank admit he was \u201cpetrified\u201d about the outcome of his son\u2019s career-defining fight against James DeGale on Saturday night. Senior (or \u201cEnglish\u201d, to use his preferred handle) was the master of surprises in his fighting days and did not disappoint in his role as father and sometime adviser to Eubank Jr when he declared: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a 50-50 fight. I am petrified he may not win this.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced [Junior] will win, because James DeGale has pedigree in terms of being [an Olympic] gold medallist, twice a world champion. It\u2019s real. I respect the man\u2019s abilities. Junior has it \u2013 but who turns up on the night? \u201cThis is going to be strange to the audience but my son looks at the physical aspect of this person, the crowd \u2013 the physical game. And from a physical point of view, I don\u2019t think there is anyone who can actually stand with him. But it isn\u2019t just physical \u2013 it\u2019s also spiritual. This is where Junior lacks that blessing. It\u2019s the only thing that allowed me to win so many championship fights and allowed me to put up with the bigotry of the media, the keyboard warriors, the critics. I\u2019ve endured it all because, spiritually, I am buoyant, alive. I\u2019ve never come down to that level but I don\u2019t know whether he has that.\u201d The fighters, whose supposed mutual animus was diluted by rolling banter, meet at the O2 Arena in London for the vacant IBO super-middleweight title in a bout both say will either end or extend their careers. DeGale, who turned 33 three weeks ago, lost his IBF 12st belt to the lightly regarded American Caleb Truax in 2017 before winning the rematch and stopping the obscure Colombian underachiever Fidel Monterrosa Mu\u00f1oz in three rounds in an eight-rounder last September. He waved away Eubank Sr\u2019s praise and doubts to train his pre-fight ire at 29-year-old Junior, who has lost twice: to Billy Joe Saunders, who returns to the ring next month, when he challenges Shefat Isufi for the WBO\u2019s vacant version of the same title, and George Groves, who has retired. DeGale, whose experience should give him an edge, described Eubank as a, \u201cdeluded moron\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s all dawned on him \u2013 he\u2019s finished. I promise you, he will get a schooling.\u201d Addressing his opponent directly, he said, \u201cI am going to come out and give it to you properly. You can\u2019t box, Chris.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the biggest fight of his career, retirement time. Whoever loses this is done.\u201d Eubank, less voluble than his father, replied\u201d \u201cWe are both on the edge and at a stage where we can\u2019t lose.\u201d Having persuaded his father to take a back seat in his career while retaining the corner smarts of Ronnie Davies, Eubank brings with him this time the experienced trainer Nate Vasquez, a former outstanding amateur who works in Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Las Vegas gym and has been with Eubank constantly in a long preparation. The American was brutal with Eubank when they began, telling him: \u201cYour defence is shit, your footwork\u2019s horrible and you\u2019ve got a lot to work on.\u201d Eubank, who invited Vasquez to move in with him, said: \u201cFor the first time in my career we are focusing on strategy and game plan in a tailored boxing camp, preparing me for a slick southpaw. We have covered all bases, that is why I am so confident. If he runs we have a game plan, if he stands and plants his feet, we have a plan.\u201d",

A clip of some Millwall fans singing a song which appeared to include discriminatory language emerged after the game, and as such the club have been charged under the rule that covers misconduct in the stands and places the responsibility on clubs to control their support. An FA spokesperson said: \u201cIt is alleged the club failed to ensure its spectators conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using abusive and/or insulting words, which included a reference to race and/or ethnic origin.\u201d Millwall have said they will issue life bans to any supporter found guilty of abuse but the chief executive, Steve Kavanagh, has claimed it is not a problem confined to his club\u2019s supporters. \u201cIf you think you can come to Millwall and chant racism, no you can\u2019t.

The FA has fined J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u00a345,000 after the Liverpool manager accepted a charge of making comments about a referee. After the 1-1 draw at West Ham this month, Klopp questioned whether Kevin Friend\u2019s decision-making had been affected by the mistake of allowing an offside goal by Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 to stand. The FA said the comments \u201cquestioned the integrity of the match referee and/or implied bias\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It was the end of summer when Yola \u2013 or Yolanda Quartey, as she was then \u2013 fell behind on her rent. Her flatmate got sick and had to move out; Yola was 21, a young singer still finding her feet in London\u2019s cut-throat music industry. When her landlord required her to leave, she was confident she would find someone to stay with until she landed her next job. \u201cI knew it was going to be fine,\u201d she says, shrugging her shoulders. \u201cIf I could just hold on a teeny bit longer.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t fine, though. The friends and colleagues she called were all very sorry, but taking her in wasn\u2019t convenient. \u201cThe rejections were all very gentle, very reasonable, but ultimately I was on my own,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I ran out of credit on my phone, so I couldn\u2019t call anyone.\u201d Yola spent the next few nights sleeping on the streets.</p> <p>More than a decade later, the ebullient singer-songwriter is releasing her debut album, Walk Through Fire, at the age of 35.

      "bodyText": "It was the end of summer when Yola \u2013 or Yolanda Quartey, as she was then \u2013 fell behind on her rent. Her flatmate got sick and had to move out; Yola was 21, a young singer still finding her feet in London\u2019s cut-throat music industry. When her landlord required her to leave, she was confident she would find someone to stay with until she landed her next job. \u201cI knew it was going to be fine,\u201d she says, shrugging her shoulders. \u201cIf I could just hold on a teeny bit longer.\u201d It wasn\u2019t fine, though. The friends and colleagues she called were all very sorry, but taking her in wasn\u2019t convenient. \u201cThe rejections were all very gentle, very reasonable, but ultimately I was on my own,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I ran out of credit on my phone, so I couldn\u2019t call anyone.\u201d Yola spent the next few nights sleeping on the streets. More than a decade later, the ebullient singer-songwriter is releasing her debut album, Walk Through Fire, at the age of 35. She shrugs off her spell of homelessness with characteristic good humour. \u201cThere\u2019s a bush in Hoxton Square, and I made a big old hole in it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was begging for food in my artsy harem pants and people were saying: \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 And I was saying: \u2018It all went wrong, my friends suck.\u2019\u201d Yola\u2019s personality fills the room, just as it fills her record \u2013 a buffet of country-soul and break-up songs, backed with fiddle, mandolin, Wurlitzer and more, and produced by Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys on his own Easy Eye label. It isn\u2019t just the big, blunt end of Yola\u2019s powerhouse voice that impresses \u2013 although that gets an immediate outing in the chorus of the opening track, Faraway Look.

The foreign affairs committee of the Belgian parliament this week voted in favour of a resolution urging the German federal government to put an immediate stop to the payments and publish a full list of those receiving them. \u201cThe receipt of pensions for collaborating with one of the most murderous regimes in history is in clear contradiction to the work of remembrance and for peace constituted in the European project,\u201d states the resolution, which was passed unanimously. The document said nearly 30 people in Belgium are still receiving the payments under a decree by Adolf Hitler granting the same nationality and pension rights as German citizens to foreigners, including Waffen-SS volunteers, from Nazi-occupied territories who pledged \u201callegiance, fidelity, loyalty and obedience\u201d to the F\u00fchrer. German authorities have \u201cconsistently refused to communicate the list of pension recipients to their Belgian counterparts, citing legal concerns around the protection of privacy\u201d, according to le Soir newspaper. The resolution\u2019s authors, five MPs from French-speaking parties, said the monthly payments were made by individual German states and the names of the recipients were known to the German embassy in Brussels. Responding to the claims, the Germany labour ministry said 18 people in Belgium were receiving war pensions but \u201cthere are no former members of the Waffen-SS\u201d among them. It did not name the pensioners or say on what grounds they were entitled to the payments. Authorities in Belgium were not aware of the pensioners\u2019 identities, the Belgian MPs (Olivier Maingain, Stephane Crusni\u00e8re, V\u00e9ronique Caprasse and Daniel Senesael) said, adding that the situation was \u201cthe same in the UK, where former SS people also receive payments directly from the German l\u00e4nder [states] without the amounts being taxed or communicated to the British authorities\u201d. The German embassy in London said it did not have any information about the Belgian allegations. The Belgian state broadcaster, RTBF, said similar payments were also being made in Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. In the Netherlands, historian Cees Kleijn has said war criminals may be among 34 former Nazi collaborators receiving German government pensions, according to the state broadcaster NOS. Citing the work of a Belgian researcher specialising in the second world war, Alvin de Coninck, RTBF said the payments range from \u20ac435 to \u20ac1,275 a month, depending on the length of time the recipients \u2013 among a total of 80,000 Belgians convicted of various forms of wartime collaboration \u2013 had spent in prison after the war. By contrast, Belgian survivors among the 12 million foreigners from 20 countries who were enrolled in Nazi Germany\u2019s forced labour schemes receive \u20ac50. \u201cThis pension shows that Belgian collaborators with the Nazi regime are considered to be like any other kind of worker,\u201d the MPs said, \u201ceven if they were convicted of actively participating in the war\u201d, creating a \u201cmorally problematic\u201d situation. The pension payments have continued because Hitler\u2019s 1941 decree was not repealed by the postwar Potsdam Conference of July 1945, at which Britain, the US and the Soviet Union established Germany\u2019s postwar order, deciding on its demilitarisation, dismantling, democratisation and denazification. German payments to wartime collaborators have been a source of concern in Belgium since their existence was first uncovered by a Socialist deputy in 1997.

In 2017, at the request of Remembrance, Germany\u2019s then ambassador, R\u00fcdiger L\u00fcdekring, told a hearing of the Belgian parliament that as a representative of the federal government he was was unable to give any precise information because the relevant details were held by Germany\u2019s 16 l\u00e4nder. A Belgian parliamentary commission visited Berlin last year to discuss the issue with their German counterparts. The MPs established that a majority of 27 Belgian wartime collaborators still receiving German pensions were being paid by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Belgian media reported. The present German ambassador to Belgium, Martin Kotthaus, told a Flemish-language news site last year that an investigation was under way to establish what exact role the remaining recipients of the pensions had played during the war. But despite what the leftwing German MP Ulla Jelpke called a \u201cwholly unacceptable situation\u201d, a German historian, Martin G\u00f6llnitz, of Johannes Gutenberg university in Mainz, said he doubted the problem would be resolved in the near future. German privacy laws would not permit a case-by-case study of the pension recipients, while the German social security system was not subject to eventual criminal law proceedings, G\u00f6llnitz said.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick summary: The flash eurozone PMIs for February suggested the bloc\u2019s economy is close to stagnation, held back by a contracting manufacturing sector The FTSE 100 has been the worst performer compared with its European peers, and is currently down 67 points or 0.9% at 7,161 Centrica is topping the FTSE\u2019s loser board today, with shares hitting a 16-year low after the parent company of British Gas reported a sharp fall in customers and warned profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap There was a big upside surprise in the UK public finances figures for January, which showed a record monthly surplus of \u00a314.9bn, in a gift to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his spring statement on 13 March US weekly jobless claims fell last week, but there was disappointing data on durable goods, which indicated a slowdown in the amount being spent by firms Meanwhile the US flash PMI\u2019s for February showed that growth in services ticked up, offsetting slowing growth in manufacturing Wall Street opened lower, and losses have since widened On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again tomorrow. AM Some more upbeat US data just out, as a pick-up in services growth in February offset slowing growth in the manufacturing sector. Here are the headline numbers in the IHS Markit PMIs, where anything above 50 signals growth: Services: 56.2 in Feb (54.2 in Jan) Manufacturing: 53.7 in Feb (54.9 in Jan) Combined: 55.8 in Feb (54.4 in Jan) Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, provides some context for the numbers: February data provides a positive signal for first quarter economic growth, with US businesses reporting the fastest output expansion since the middle of 2018. Service sector firms led the way, supported by solid improvements in business and consumer spending. Private sector payroll numbers increased to the greatest extent for five months, which adds to hopes that robust domestic demand will act as a growth tailwind over the near-term. Historical comparisons suggest the latest survey data are indicative of an underlying economic growth rate of around 2.5% annualised, although the PMI is designed to monitor private sector companies so the impact of the government shutdown may not be fully captured. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street and US markets edged lower, reflecting some disappointing economic data: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 25,918 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,779 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 7,475 Investors are digesting some gloomier US economic data, after new orders for key, American-made capital goods fell unexpectedly in December. The figures suggested business spending on machinery and metals is slowing, with orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft down 0.7%, following a 1% fall in January. Andrew Hunter, senior US Economist at Capital Economics sums it up nicely: The December durables goods data suggest that equipment investment growth slowed further in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain weak for most of this year. As we await the opening bell on Wall Street - with US markets expected to open roughly flat - it\u2019s time for a recap of how it\u2019s looking across Europe. The FTSE is the biggest faller, off 62 points or 0.9%: FTSE 100: -0.9% at 7,166 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 11,419 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,192 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 20,255 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,194 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 370 There were 216,000 new jobless claims in the US last week, down from 239,000 the week before and fewer than the 229,000 predicted by economists. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has been speaking at the Glasgow School of Art: Purplebricks, the largest online estate agent, is having a very bad day. Rob Davies reports: Shares plunged 40% after the company slashed its revenue forecasts and announced the surprise departure of both its US and UK bosses. The company blamed slower than expected growth in its fledgling US business and \u201cheadwinds\u201d in Australia, as it said revenue for the year was unlikely to exceed \u00a3140m compared with an earlier forecast of up to \u00a3175m. The revenue prediction had already been downgraded once, at the time of its disappointing half-year results, from \u00a3185m. Shares dropped by 40% after the news but later staged a partial recovery. However they were still down 28%, at 118p, cutting the company\u2019s market value by \u00a3140m. The fall is bad news for Woodford Investment Management, led by the City investment guru Neil Woodford, which is the largest shareholder in the company, with a stake of about 27%. Purplebricks\u2019 founder and global chief executive, Michael Bruce, is to take control of the US business with immediate effect, as its US chief executive, Eric Eckardt, leaves the business. No reason was given for his departure but revenues in the US grew less rapidly than the company had hoped, after a lacklustre response to a marketing drive that finished in January. The UK chief executive, Lee Wainwright, is also leaving. The company said this was for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility says there is still \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d about the full-year borrowing figure, despite there only being two months to go before the end of the fiscal year. Self-assessments might be weaker in February, for example, because more people paid on time, the OBR says in its monthly commentary on the latest figures. The fall in borrowing so far in 2018-19 has been somewhat greater than that in our October forecast for the full year, thanks primarily to stronger receipts growth. This reflects the effect of stronger earnings growth on PAYE and NICs receipts and, given the payment lags, stronger growth in self-assessment (SA) liabilities in 2017-18. Despite there being only two months of the fiscal year remaining, there is still significant uncertainty over the full-year figure \u2013 which itself will inevitably be revised over time. Some SA receipts will be collected in February, so the picture for this year is incomplete. HMRC administrative data for early February suggest that some of the strength in January reflected more people paying on time, so the picture for January and February together could be less strong than for January alone. Things might be looking up for Phillip Hammond in terms of the public finances, but a report published overnight by a thinktank claims government austerity policies since 2010 have left UK households \u00a3300m a month worse off. Here is our full story on those better than expected UK public finances figures: The pound is a fraction lower against the euro and the dollar following earlier gains. Sterling is off 0.1% against both currencies at \u20ac1.1494 and $1.3036. It appears that comments made by an unnamed government source are weighing on sentiment. Reuters brings this report: It does not feel like Britain will have secured the changes it needs to its exit deal with Brussels by next week, a British government source said on Thursday. Prime Minister Theresa May will hold bilateral meetings with European Union leaders at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Egypt at the weekend, but the source said she was not expected to return from that with a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d on a revised deal. If May does not bring a revised deal back to parliament for a vote by Feb. 27, lawmakers will be given the opportunity to debate and vote on the next steps, and some have said they will seek to wrestle control of the process from the government. Economists say the latest figures suggest the chancellor should comfortably undershoot the full-year borrowing target of \u00a325.5bn, with little sign so far of a Brexit impact on the public finances: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC: So far the public finances seem to have been largely immune to the adverse effects of Brexit-related uncertainty, because this has mostly affected business investment. More tax-rich areas of economic activity, notably earnings from employment and consumer spending, have held up better over the past ten months. The budget deficit for 2018/19 as a whole now looks set to come in some way below the OBR\u2019s October budget forecast of \u00a325.2 billion, giving the chancellor some potential additional fiscal room for manoeuvre going into his Spring Statement next month. This could allow him to offer more support to the economy in the short term depending on how the Brexit negotiations progress over the next few weeks. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics: The last public finances figures released before the Spring Statement put the government on track to undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast of borrowing of \u00a325.5bn in the 2018-19 financial year. If a Brexit deal is secured, we think that a pickup in economic growth in 2019 will increase the size of that headroom. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the chancellor should have plenty of scope to support growth, and if needed to the chancellor would sacrifice his fiscal rules for the economy. January is traditionally a surplus month for the public coffers because of the flow of income tax receipts, but this year was the strongest January since records began in 1993. Income Tax and capital gains tax receipts were \u00a321.4bn in Jan, \u00a33.1bn more than last Jan. It puts Britain\u2019s public finances on a stronger footing than at this point last year, with borrowing in the financial year so far at \u00a321.2bn, compared with \u00a339.7bn a year earlier. The forecasts for borrowing are due to be updated by the Office for Budget Responsibility (the treasury\u2019s independent forecaster) in the spring statement next month. Its current forecast is for full year borrowing (in the fiscal year ending March 2019) of \u00a325.5bn, which the treasury is now expected to undershoot. Breaking: Good news for Philip Hammond, after public finances hit a record monthly surplus of \u00a314.9bn in January thanks to strong income tax receipts. It easily beat City expectations of a \u00a310.05bn surplus, and compared with borrowing of \u00a33bn in December according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figure comes just ahead of the chancellor\u2019s spring statement on 13 March. More soon... Data just out shows the eurozone economy was almost at a standstill in February. The \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys from IHS Markit suggest the region\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted unexpectedly this month - and for the first time in more than five years - while the services sector grew at a faster than expected rate. Taking the two together, business activity edged up over the month. Here are the headline figures for February, where anything above 50 signals growth: Flash manufacturing PMI: 49.2 (50.5 in January) Flash services PMI: 52.3 (51.2 in January) Flash eurozone composite: 51.4 (51.0 in January) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the surveys suggests the eurozone economy is on course to grow by just 0.1% in the first quarter. The Eurozone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The flash PMI lifted only slightly higher during the month, continuing to indicate one of the weakest rates of expansion since 2014. The survey data suggest that GDP may struggle to rise by much more than 0.1% in the first quarter. The weakness is being led by manufacturing, which has now entered its first downturn since mid- 2013. With factory order books deteriorating at an increased rate, the rate of contraction in the goods- producing sector will likely worsen in coming months. At the other end of the table, Barclays is the biggest FTSE riser this morning after a pledge to return more money to investors. Shares are up 3.3% at 166p after the promise by chief executive Jes Staley, as he attempts to fend off the attentions of the activist investor Edward Bramson. Profits for 2018 were flat after litigation and conduct charges of \u00a32.2bn, while the bank also took a \u00a3150m charge to cover economic uncertainty over Brexit. Read our full story here: Shares in Centrica are down 11% this morning at 122p after the parent company of British Gas gave a very gloomy outlook for the year ahead. Profits rose in 2018 but the company lost 742,000 accounts and said profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap imposed by the regulator, Ofgem. Centrica said in its annual results statement: We have been very clear that we do not believe a price cap is a sustainable solution for the market, and is likely to have unintended consequences for customers and competition. The company has a target cashflow of \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32.3bn and met that in 2018. But Iain Conn, chief executive, warned the target would be challenging to meet this year. Julie Palmer, partner at restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, says it\u2019s a tough time for energy firms: Yes, the profits are up, but with price caps being pinned on suppliers and the precarious nature of the energy industry any expansion within the sector is a nervy and tentative process. Our \u2018red flag alert\u2019 has shown a contraction in the market with more than 3,000 utilities providers in significant financial distress \u2013 a number that increased 2% in the lead up to the Christmas period. And some smaller providers such as Utilitywise have already gone into administration in 2019. Most European markets are mainly higher this morning, following a more optimistic mood in Asia and on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 is the exception, down 25 points. More on that soon. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,202 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 11,437 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,200 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: flat at 20,307 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% 9,220 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 372 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.

      "body": "<p>These are not good times for those of us suffering from anxiety. Every day merely confirms what we have already suspected: there is no one in government who has a clue about what is going on, and Brexit policy is being made up on an hour-by-hour basis.</p> <p>On Wednesday evening, Theresa May made yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/no-breakthrough-for-may-after-constructive-brexit-talks-in-brussels\">trip to Brussels</a> in which she insisted that progress was being made. She and Jean-Claude Juncker were now on first-name terms, and she had narrowed down her backstop demands to three possibilities that the EU would be unable to meet.</p> <p>Her post-summit briefing was positively upbeat. Juncker appeared to have attended an entirely different meeting. His assessment was that a catastrophic no-deal was becoming increasingly likely. And for the record, he had never called the prime minister Theresa.</p> <p>It has now become a physical impossibility for Philip Hammond to smile. His facial muscles have long since atrophied and his only expression is a rictus Munch-like scream of despair. But on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/hammond-uk-china-relations-not-made-simpler-by-williamson\">even gloomier than usual</a>, his monotone barely rising above a whisper.</p> <p>Everything was really, really bad, he mumbled. He did not want a no-deal but he had to admit that was now a real possibility, as the government did not have a clear plan of how to break the deadlock. If anyone else had any bright ideas, he was all ears.</p> <p>John Humphrys reminded him several times that he was the chancellor and the country was looking to him to provide solutions, but Hammond just deadbatted everything. The prime minister was a void \u2013 an avatar at best \u2013 and he had all but given up. Something might turn up, but if it didn\u2019t then something else would happen. Something worse. The man who only a year ago was describing himself as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/13/hammond-tries-full-on-tigger-but-finds-eeyore-a-better-fit\">positively Tiggerish</a>\u201d now sounded as if he was starring in his own hostage video.</p> <p>The fatalism only got worse. There were 36 days until Brexit. Tomorrow there would be 35 days until Brexit. And the day after, 34. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. He couldn\u2019t even say what he would do if there were to be a no-deal Brexit or even if he would choose to remain in post. He was beyond rational thought. Beyond decision-making. It was as much as he could do just to get out of bed in the mornings. Imagine what it was like going to cabinet and having to deal with halfwits like Gavin Williamson in the flesh. The rest was silence.</p> <p>Michael Gove was on rather more bullish form at environment, food and rural affairs questions in the Commons. Which was just as terrifying in its own way, because Gove\u2019s confidence is invariably misplaced. The more he insists he has everything under control, the more you know it is time to panic. His answer to Brexit was the no-nonsense approach of talking up the value of rationing by promoting his planned wartime cookbook, complete with recipes for rotting vegetables and unconventional cuts of meat. The working title for the book was Tripe.</p> <p>This caused some consternation for the Tory Giles Watling, who is under the impression there is a huge black market in dog and moggy meat. Watling has explored the nation\u2019s underbelly and concluded that everyone is secretly hacking their pets to death and eating them. He even spotted someone in the big cat enclosure at Whipsnade Zoo, taking a quick bite out of a sleeping lion\u2019s thigh. </p> <p>The environment secretary offered only token reassurance. At times of national crisis, every pet should be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Far better to die a free cockapoo than live a second longer as a slave of the EU.</p> <p>He was rather more equivocal about what would happen to other foodstuffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Basically there were two possibilities. Either he would impose tariffs on all food coming into the country, which would be great for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/what-are-brexit-contingency-plans-for-retailers-and-farmers\">British famers</a> but would send hundreds of thousands of others scuttling off to food banks as prices soared. Which would be great for food-bank workers. Or there would be no tariffs, in which case British agriculture was screwed. But then we could always build some houses on the empty fields. So it was all fine.</p> <p>Gove looked up triumphantly. He is one of the few ministers still capable of presenting a lose-lose situation as a win-win. His denial of reality is near total. It\u2019s just the rest of us who are suffering.</p>",

      "bodyText": "These are not good times for those of us suffering from anxiety. Every day merely confirms what we have already suspected: there is no one in government who has a clue about what is going on, and Brexit policy is being made up on an hour-by-hour basis. On Wednesday evening, Theresa May made yet another trip to Brussels in which she insisted that progress was being made. She and Jean-Claude Juncker were now on first-name terms, and she had narrowed down her backstop demands to three possibilities that the EU would be unable to meet. Her post-summit briefing was positively upbeat. Juncker appeared to have attended an entirely different meeting. His assessment was that a catastrophic no-deal was becoming increasingly likely. And for the record, he had never called the prime minister Theresa. It has now become a physical impossibility for Philip Hammond to smile. His facial muscles have long since atrophied and his only expression is a rictus Munch-like scream of despair. But on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he was even gloomier than usual, his monotone barely rising above a whisper. Everything was really, really bad, he mumbled. He did not want a no-deal but he had to admit that was now a real possibility, as the government did not have a clear plan of how to break the deadlock. If anyone else had any bright ideas, he was all ears. John Humphrys reminded him several times that he was the chancellor and the country was looking to him to provide solutions, but Hammond just deadbatted everything. The prime minister was a void \u2013 an avatar at best \u2013 and he had all but given up. Something might turn up, but if it didn\u2019t then something else would happen. Something worse. The man who only a year ago was describing himself as \u201cpositively Tiggerish\u201d now sounded as if he was starring in his own hostage video. The fatalism only got worse. There were 36 days until Brexit. Tomorrow there would be 35 days until Brexit. And the day after, 34. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. He couldn\u2019t even say what he would do if there were to be a no-deal Brexit or even if he would choose to remain in post. He was beyond rational thought. Beyond decision-making. It was as much as he could do just to get out of bed in the mornings. Imagine what it was like going to cabinet and having to deal with halfwits like Gavin Williamson in the flesh. The rest was silence. Michael Gove was on rather more bullish form at environment, food and rural affairs questions in the Commons. Which was just as terrifying in its own way, because Gove\u2019s confidence is invariably misplaced. The more he insists he has everything under control, the more you know it is time to panic. His answer to Brexit was the no-nonsense approach of talking up the value of rationing by promoting his planned wartime cookbook, complete with recipes for rotting vegetables and unconventional cuts of meat. The working title for the book was Tripe. This caused some consternation for the Tory Giles Watling, who is under the impression there is a huge black market in dog and moggy meat. Watling has explored the nation\u2019s underbelly and concluded that everyone is secretly hacking their pets to death and eating them. He even spotted someone in the big cat enclosure at Whipsnade Zoo, taking a quick bite out of a sleeping lion\u2019s thigh. The environment secretary offered only token reassurance. At times of national crisis, every pet should be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Far better to die a free cockapoo than live a second longer as a slave of the EU. He was rather more equivocal about what would happen to other foodstuffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Basically there were two possibilities. Either he would impose tariffs on all food coming into the country, which would be great for British famers but would send hundreds of thousands of others scuttling off to food banks as prices soared. Which would be great for food-bank workers. Or there would be no tariffs, in which case British agriculture was screwed. But then we could always build some houses on the empty fields. So it was all fine. Gove looked up triumphantly. He is one of the few ministers still capable of presenting a lose-lose situation as a win-win. His denial of reality is near total. It\u2019s just the rest of us who are suffering.",

      "bodyText": "It is a very long way from Ghana\u2019s Ada Foah to Hillsong church on Newcastle\u2019s Westgate Road \u2013 and not merely in miles. Christian Atsu has made that transformative journey, swapping an existence as one of 10 children whose late father eked out a living fishing and farming on the junction of the Volta River and the Atlantic Ocean, for a new life on Tyneside. Almost everything has altered but one constant remains: the Newcastle winger\u2019s Christian faith. Church was a central part of Atsu\u2019s childhood and worship at Hillsong, a short walk from St James\u2019 Park, binds the Ghana international to his new habitat. \u201cI\u2019m very happy at Hillsong and very happy in Newcastle,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball changed my life completely; sometimes what\u2019s happened seems like a miracle but it\u2019s enabled me to help my community and my family. \u201cMy faith is the most important thing in my life. I know I\u2019m one of the lucky people God has blessed. I\u2019m very lucky and privileged to be in this position. I had nothing and now I\u2019ve got too much so I have to give something back.\u201d If Atsu\u2019s wing play and subtle left foot can sometimes constitute a slightly underrated element of Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team, he is an undoubted star across his home continent. After winning the player of the tournament and goal of the tournament awards at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, he is someone people from Cairo to Cape Town take notice of and this prominence helps promote Arms Around the Child, the charity that counts him as a key ambassador. Based in Ghana, South Africa and India, it provides homes, protection, education and support for children who have been orphaned, abused, affected by HIV/Aids, trafficked, sold or live in child-headed households. \u201cI donate often, so they can buy food and stuff,\u201d says Atsu, who vividly remembers sharing a cramped bedroom with his mother, twin sister \u2013 now a nurse \u2013 and four other siblings. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re building a school in Ghana. About 300 children will attend, I want everyone to have the chance of education.\u201d He himself benefited from an excellent schooling provided by Feyenoord\u2019s African academy in Accra and possesses the poise and articulacy to prove it. \u201cI survived but I don\u2019t forget,\u201d reflects the 27-year-old whose education equipped him for the culture shock of moving to Porto as a teenager before a switch to Chelsea, where Atsu became one of the club\u2019s sometimes almost invisible \u201cloan army\u201d. He signed for Newcastle without playing a first-team game for his former club \u2013 although he was borrowed by Vitesse Arnhem, Everton, Bournemouth and M\u00e1laga. \u201cI don\u2019t regret going to Chelsea \u2013 it was a privilege to be their player,\u201d he says, firmly. \u201cAnd, eventually, it led me to Newcastle.\u201d Atsu, his wife and their two small sons enjoy life in the city with its easy access to Northumberland\u2019s magnificent, sandy beaches \u2013 the only downside being that the temperatures tend to be considerably cooler than those on the palm-fringed equivalents he grew up alongside in Ada Foah. \u201cWow, wow, wow,\u201d he says, eyes widening, when told about past Sunderland teams being made to swim in the North Sea.

We\u2019ve always been very difficult to break down but Miguel will give us something different.\u201d Atsu will be somewhere different this summer when he is scheduled to head for Egypt and the Africa Cup of Nations. \u201cOne of my best times in football was Equatorial Guinea 2015,\u201d he says. \u201cThrough that tournament a lot of people in Africa now recognise me.\u201d Much as he is looking forward to boarding Ghana\u2019s flight to Cairo, the anticipation is tempered by the knowledge that Egypt\u2019s once strong Coptic Christian population is shrinking in the face of hostility and, sometimes, terrorist attacks from Islamic extremists. \u201cSome people are misinterpreting the Qu\u2019ran,\u201d Atsu says. \u201cAll religions have the same idea about loving your neighbour but what\u2019s happening shows why it\u2019s so important to educate our children properly. We have to teach them that everyone has to stick together and be one community.\u201d By way of emphasising that point he has recently been responsible for reuniting several impoverished families in Ghana after paying thousands of pounds in fines to release prisoners accused of petty offences. The 62-year-old grandmother and her daughter freed after being jailed for stealing one pound\u2019s worth of corn in order to feed their family is typical of the type of cases resolved, discreetly, by the winger. Atsu may have \u201csurvived\u201d and escaped but, all along that winding road from Ada Foah to Hillsong, there has never been a single moment when he forgot those he left back at home.",

She added: \u201cWe\u2019re about creating something better that is bang smack in the centre ground of British politics that people out there, I am convinced, we are convinced, want.\u201d Wollaston told the Today programme: \u201cI know that there are many colleagues on my side who will be watching carefully and expecting Theresa May to be certain that she is not going to take us out on a no-deal Brexit.\u201d She added: \u201cCertainly I think that a third of the cabinet, I\u2019m pretty clear, would walk if they were looking at a no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve changed from the one nation values we stood on. We feel the party is drifting to the right,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI would say the Tory party is destroying itself.\u201d The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, speaking on the Today programme, said he was saddened by the departure of the three MPs. \u201cThe Conservative party is and always has been and must remain a very broad church,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand their concerns but I hope that over time they will feel able to rejoin the party and help to maintain it and that broad church, that coalition of views, that has been so successful over so many decades.\u201d He denied that the party had been take over by the hardline Eurosceptics, the European Research Group (ERG). \u201cThe ERG is a relatively small hardcore within the parliamentary party, and a wider group of members of parliament who are sympathetic to some of the objectives of the ERG recognise that, within this broad church that is the Conservative party, compromises are necessary,\u201d said Hammond. The resignations were announced shortly before prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday and the group took their new seats on the opposition benches during the debate. The developments mean May\u2019s small working majority has been reduced to eight. At a press conference on Wednesday, Wollaston pointed out that after the prime minister lost the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by an unprecedented margin of 230 votes last month, she promised to seek a cross-party solution \u2013 but the first group she consulted was the ERG. Asked if she had heard from May, Greening said she hadn\u2019t despite asking \u201con multiple occasions\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A man has admitted spraying racist graffiti on the door of a flat days after the residents moved in.</p> <p>Appearing at Manchester magistrates court on Thursday, Vaughan Dowd pleaded guilty to charges of criminal damage and racially aggravated criminal damage. He was remanded in custody for his own protection.</p> <p>Dowd, 54, wearing jeans and a brown jumper and shirt, spoke only to confirm his name and details and to plead guilty to the offence in Salford on 8 February.</p> <p>The court heard Dowd, of Salford, painted the slur on the front door of the home of Jackson Yamba, 38, originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, five days after he moved from a neighbouring block to the same block where the defendant lived, in Irlams o\u2019 th\u2019 Height in Salford.</p> <p>After seeing the graffiti as they were leaving the flat, Yamba said his 10-year-old son, David, became tearful. Yamba said the attack had left him fearful and angry.</p> <p>The district judge, Mark Hadfield, said the sentencing powers of the magistrates court were insufficient to deal with the case and he ordered Dowd be dealt with at Manchester crown court at a later date. <br><br>The court heard the victim saw \u201cno blacks\u201d painted on his front door in white paint as he was leaving for work on the morning of 8 February. The same graffiti was also daubed on an internal communal door and the entry door to the block of flats where he lives.</p> <p>Ann Deakin, prosecuting, said inquiries were made by police and through CCTV records and building access records. Deakin said the CCTV showed Dowd covering his face to carry out the attack before returning to the flats with his face uncovered.</p> <p>In a victim impact statement, Yamba said: \u201cThis incident has left me feeling very angry. The idea someone has the audacity to attack my front door of my home address and target me in this way has affected me in a lasting way.

      "bodyText": "A man has admitted spraying racist graffiti on the door of a flat days after the residents moved in. Appearing at Manchester magistrates court on Thursday, Vaughan Dowd pleaded guilty to charges of criminal damage and racially aggravated criminal damage. He was remanded in custody for his own protection. Dowd, 54, wearing jeans and a brown jumper and shirt, spoke only to confirm his name and details and to plead guilty to the offence in Salford on 8 February. The court heard Dowd, of Salford, painted the slur on the front door of the home of Jackson Yamba, 38, originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, five days after he moved from a neighbouring block to the same block where the defendant lived, in Irlams o\u2019 th\u2019 Height in Salford. After seeing the graffiti as they were leaving the flat, Yamba said his 10-year-old son, David, became tearful. Yamba said the attack had left him fearful and angry. The district judge, Mark Hadfield, said the sentencing powers of the magistrates court were insufficient to deal with the case and he ordered Dowd be dealt with at Manchester crown court at a later date. The court heard the victim saw \u201cno blacks\u201d painted on his front door in white paint as he was leaving for work on the morning of 8 February. The same graffiti was also daubed on an internal communal door and the entry door to the block of flats where he lives. Ann Deakin, prosecuting, said inquiries were made by police and through CCTV records and building access records. Deakin said the CCTV showed Dowd covering his face to carry out the attack before returning to the flats with his face uncovered. In a victim impact statement, Yamba said: \u201cThis incident has left me feeling very angry. The idea someone has the audacity to attack my front door of my home address and target me in this way has affected me in a lasting way. I\u2019m now constantly on edge and worried about every little noise outside and it has affected my ability to sleep.\u201d Hadfield said the attack was clearly premeditated and deliberate and this should be considered in sentencing. \u201cHe deliberately targeted the flat \u2026 and caused serious distress to two people, one of whom we now know is a child,\u201d he said. \u201cIt clearly appears to be planned [as the graffiti] was daubed on three doors. I think this takes it to a very high level of sentencing.\u201d Hadfield told him: \u201cI\u2019m satisfied a remand in custody is necessary for your own protection.\u201d Deakin said a possible bail address in south Manchester for Dowd was inappropriate because of the \u201cethnic diversity\u201d of the area, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a clear risk to the defendant\u2019s safety. Greater Manchester Police has received complaints from America \u2013 that\u2019s how far it\u2019s gone viral about the victims being abused in this way.\u201d Dowd\u2019s defence lawyer, Lorna Wincote, argued he should be entitled to \u201csmall credit\u201d owing to a lack of previous convictions and similar conduct. She said there were no issues around alcohol or substance misuse, but said underlying mental health problems could have motivated the attack.

Delays to legislation were blamed by fuel poverty campaigners for the fall, which coincided with households being hit by energy price hikes. Just 2,557 boilers were installed in the last three months of 2018, 97% below the same period in 2013, the year the government\u2019s Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme was launched. Insulation of lofts and walls has also plummeted under ECO, which enables electricity and gas suppliers to use energy bill levies to upgrade the efficiency of homes, including those in fuel poverty. There were 6,461 installations in the last three months of 2018, down 98% on the same period in 2010, according to government figures published on Thursday. Fuel poverty charity National Energy Action said the government was allowing a \u201cchronic public health crisis\u201d due to the link between cold homes and early deaths. Adam Scorer, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cDespite knowing energy efficiency saves money, carbon and lives, the number of insulation measures and boilers installed is falling off a cliff and very little support will have reached those most in need this winter.\u201d Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, which is holding an inquiry into energy efficiency, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s statistics underline the cold reality that the current rate of energy efficiency improvements is far too slow.\u201d The NEA said the crash in installs had happened because the government had created regulatory risk for firms by failing to pass legislation and issue guidance in time for the ECO\u2019s scheme\u2019s latest stage, which started in October.

      "body": "<p>John Haynes, who has died aged 80, created a publishing empire out of the enormous success of the car workshop manuals that bore his name. In all, 200m have been sold since 1966, covering the maintenance and repair of more than 1,000 different models.</p> <p>His formula was simple: dismantle and rebuild a car, illustrate with clear black and white pictures and diagrams, then describe the process in detail, in a language that the lay person can understand. With the familiar yellow and red logo, impressive cut-away drawings, fault diagnosis and step-by-step approach to every possible task \u2013 be it changing a bulb or dismantling and rebuilding a complete engine \u2013 the Haynes manuals captured the DIY ethos of the 1960s, 70s and 80s: a more self-reliant time, when maintaining the family saloon was still a bastion of male pride and the vehicles most people drove were simple, logical and analogue.</p> <p>Today, when few modern cars invite the attentions of the home mechanic and most people would struggle to find the dipstick, sales of Haynes manuals have been in decline. But it is an indication of how embedded the brand remains in the national psyche that it has been able to parody itself with manuals on the workings of The Man, The Woman, nuclear submarines and even a practical guide to sex. You can still buy a \u201creal\u201d Haynes manual, though, and since the founder\u2019s retirement in 2010 his successors in the family-run business have fought back with digital technology that brings the concept up to date, using online downloadable workshop manuals.</p> <p>Haynes was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to Violette (nee d\u2019Henezel), a nurse, and Harold, a tea plantation manager. In 1950 the family returned to the UK, where, with his brother David, John attended Sutton Valence school near Maidstone in Kent.

      "bodyText": "John Haynes, who has died aged 80, created a publishing empire out of the enormous success of the car workshop manuals that bore his name. In all, 200m have been sold since 1966, covering the maintenance and repair of more than 1,000 different models. His formula was simple: dismantle and rebuild a car, illustrate with clear black and white pictures and diagrams, then describe the process in detail, in a language that the lay person can understand. With the familiar yellow and red logo, impressive cut-away drawings, fault diagnosis and step-by-step approach to every possible task \u2013 be it changing a bulb or dismantling and rebuilding a complete engine \u2013 the Haynes manuals captured the DIY ethos of the 1960s, 70s and 80s: a more self-reliant time, when maintaining the family saloon was still a bastion of male pride and the vehicles most people drove were simple, logical and analogue. Today, when few modern cars invite the attentions of the home mechanic and most people would struggle to find the dipstick, sales of Haynes manuals have been in decline. But it is an indication of how embedded the brand remains in the national psyche that it has been able to parody itself with manuals on the workings of The Man, The Woman, nuclear submarines and even a practical guide to sex. You can still buy a \u201creal\u201d Haynes manual, though, and since the founder\u2019s retirement in 2010 his successors in the family-run business have fought back with digital technology that brings the concept up to date, using online downloadable workshop manuals. Haynes was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to Violette (nee d\u2019Henezel), a nurse, and Harold, a tea plantation manager. In 1950 the family returned to the UK, where, with his brother David, John attended Sutton Valence school near Maidstone in Kent. There John persuaded his headmaster to allow him to miss his rugby lessons so that he could rebuild his \u00a315 Austin 7 saloon into one of the lightweight 750 \u201cspecials\u201d that were many a young man\u2019s fancy in impecunious times. Not only did the 17-year-old sell the finished car at a profit; he decided he would write a booklet about the project. Drawing all the illustrations himself, he ran off 250 copies on a stencil duplicator; Building a 750 Special sold out in 10 days at five shillings a copy. In the late 50s Haynes did his national service in the RAF, and later joined the air force for a further period, receiving a good grounding in business and logistical skills and finding time to race his Elva Courier car.

      "body": "<h2><strong>20. Sadako vs Kayako (2016)</strong></h2> \n<p>Monster movie crossovers are usually a sign of a moribund franchise, but this Ring v Grudge combo is livelier than you would expect. A psychic decides the only way to save a doomed schoolgirl from Sadako\u2019s curse is to introduce another curse into the mix \u2013 and get the two to duke it out. Needless to say, things don\u2019t go as planned.</p> \n<h2><strong>19. One Missed Call (2003)</strong></h2> \n<p>Students get voice mails predicting their own violent deaths \u2013 which duly come to pass, although not without some black humour and a spooky vintage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrKkGeY0jXs\" title=\"\">ringtone</a>. Director Takashi Miike plays by the J-horror rules, more or less, but it all flies off the rails in a bonkers final act.</p> \n<h2><strong>18. Versus (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>Yakuza hitmen bury the corpses of their victims in a place called the Forest of Resurrection. Big mistake. It\u2019s gangsters v zombies in Ryuhei Kitamura\u2019s barking mad, low-budget brew of ninja action, wacky camerawork and some of the most OTT acting ever seen outside a Nicolas Cage film. It also has zombies with guns.</p> \n<h2><strong>17. Monsterz (2014)</strong></h2> \n<p>A mind-controlling sociopath embarks on a battle of wits with the one man he can\u2019t control, using bystanders as disposable pawns. Hideo Nakata\u2019s remake of the Korean paranormal psychothriller Haunters (2010) is darker than the original and benefits from a lovely <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezg3x4nuVfg\" title=\"\">Kenji Kawai score</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa299c8993e37a4a71f005553d61da78145225b6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa299c8993e37a4a71f005553d61da78145225b6/0_117_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Club \u2026 \u2018Not for the squeamish.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suicide Club \u2026 \u2018Not for the squeamish.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>16. Suicide Club (2001)</strong></h2> \n<p>Few opening scenes are more startling than that of Sion Sono\u2019s surreal shocker, in which 54 schoolgirls cheerfully link hands and throw themselves under an oncoming train. A wave of suicides turns out to be not entirely unconnected to a mysterious website, deviant glam rockers and long strips of human skin. Not for the squeamish.</p> \n<h2><strong>15. Marebito (2004)</strong></h2> \n<p>Between Grudge films, Takashi Shimizu directed this bizarre low-budget, semi-experimental plunge into HP Lovecraft territory. An obsessive cameraman (played by Shinya Tsukamoto of Tetsuo fame) explores a vast netherworld underneath Tokyo, in which he finds a mute naked woman with vampiric tendencies and brings her to the surface to live in his flat. As you do.</p> \n<h2><strong>14. Retribution (2006)</strong></h2> \n<p>K\u00f4ji Yakusho plays a detective whose investigation into a series of murders is thrown off course when all the evidence points back at him. No Sadako-style ghosts in white for director Kiyoshi Kurosawa; the ghost here wears red, with Kurosawa giving a virtual tutorial in how to conjure a mounting sense of terror out of little more than focus and camera placement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"086c40d6e09231512da88ff1b20c432c9d6dea28\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/086c40d6e09231512da88ff1b20c432c9d6dea28/248_0_7280_4370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Death Note.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Death Note.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>13. Death Note (2006)</strong></h2> \n<p>Forget the naff Netflix remake and stick to the manga anime series or this live action version directed by Shusuke Kaneko. A precocious student finds a notebook with the power to kill whoever\u2019s name is written inside, and starts using it to rid the world of criminals, watched by a 10ft-tall cartoon demon. But, as the body count mounts, the vigilante crusade becomes increasingly morally compromised.</p> \n<h2><strong>12. Helter Skelter (2012)</strong></h2> \n<p>The former fashion photographer Mika Ninagawa directed this dazzling manga-based parable about a celebrity \u201cit\u201d girl who undergoes extensive cosmetic surgery to stay on top of the teen idol game, only to sink into a delirium of sex, drugs and spiteful behaviour as unsightly post-op side-effects kick in, and a rival threatens to steal her crown.</p> \n<h2><strong>11. Bilocation (2013)</strong></h2> \n<p>Mari Asato\u2019s creepy psychothriller wrings a droll twist on the usual doppelganger movie tropes. A struggling artist discovers she has a malevolent alter ego, and joins a group formed to help people cope with their own increasingly menacing doubles. Asato once worked as an apprentice photographer under Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and it shows.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Tag (2015)</strong></h2> \n<p>Sion Sono tops even his own Suicide Club with the opening to this quasi-feminist horror movie. A schoolgirl called Mitsuko finds herself the sole survivor after a gust of wind bloodily bisects everyone else in the bus she is on. From then on, it\u2019s nonstop WTF action as Mitsuko faces deadly peril in a bewildering succession of different dimensions and identities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"945f8a9546ef4814f879773bd71cd0b671391b0c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/945f8a9546ef4814f879773bd71cd0b671391b0c/0_53_6696_4019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cure \u2026 \u2018Uniquely disturbing.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cure \u2026 \u2018Uniquely disturbing.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>9. Cure (1997)</strong></h2> \n<p>Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s first collaboration with his <em>acteur f\u00e9tiche</em>, K\u00f4ji Yakusho, delves into the nature of evil in a psychothriller with a uniquely disturbing ambience. A detective investigates a series of murders with different killers, but each of the victims has an X carved into their neck. The closer our man gets to the truth, the more messed-up he becomes.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. Confessions (2010)</strong></h2> \n<p>A high school teacher describes, to an initially inattentive class, her elaborate plan to avenge the death of her small daughter, whom she claims was killed by two of the pupils. Tetsuya Nakashima\u2019s enthralling psychodrama is an aesthetic treat full of twists and shocks. It is also an extremely cruel fable, which takes no prisoners.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"650870033e10a42715b3839978868b7711f50d1c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650870033e10a42715b3839978868b7711f50d1c/0_109_3335_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uzumaki \u2026 \u2018Few weirder films.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uzumaki \u2026 \u2018Few weirder films.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>7. Uzumaki (2000)</strong></h2> \n<p>There may be scarier films, but few are weirder than Akihiro Higuchi\u2019s one-off freak show, adapted from one of Junji Ito\u2019s horror manga masterpieces. A schoolgirl called Kirie notices the inhabitants of her small town are becoming increasingly obsessed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9U4JqO5hxo\" title=\"\">spiral shapes</a>. Soon, the spirals take over in a truly discomfiting blend of surrealism and body horror.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Dark Water (2002)</strong></h2> \n<p>Like Ring, this was adapted from a novel by Koji Suzuki and directed by Hideo Nakata. A young divorcee and her small daughter move into a flat with a sinister stain on the ceiling. The stain starts to leak. And aaggghhh, the scene with the bath! A terrifying, but emotionally resonant, ghost story grounded by a social realist setting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf4d657b6f2cf00aff7f0a600189e9dd2ee6e7ee\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf4d657b6f2cf00aff7f0a600189e9dd2ee6e7ee/0_106_3145_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grudge \u2026 \u2018Oh god, the bedclothes.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grudge \u2026 \u2018Oh god, the bedclothes.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lions Gate</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5. Grudge (2002)</strong></h2> \n<p>In Takashi Shimizu\u2019s remake of his own straight-to-video hit, an assortment of doomed social workers, relatives and cops go trooping into a house haunted by the spectral tag team of \u201cscary broad with long black hair\u201d and \u201cmiaow boy\u201d. Horrible things happen. It\u2019s little more than a series of scary set-pieces strung together, but it hits the spot \u2013 especially the scene with, oh God, the bedclothes.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)</strong></h2> \n<p>A salaryman gradually morphs into a walking pile of scrap metal with a big power drill in place of a penis. Shinya Tsukamoto\u2019s Tetsuo trilogy is not strictly J-horror, but the film-maker\u2019s idiosyncratic brand of expressionist stop-motion cyberpunk coincided with the genre\u2019s move away from 1980s Guinea-Pig-type sadistic misogyny into fun stuff you can watch without barfing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbf4714005e1016fbc05ed4d4e88f91c0bea1413\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbf4714005e1016fbc05ed4d4e88f91c0bea1413/0_28_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audition \u2026 \u2018Gruelling.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audition \u2026 \u2018Gruelling.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. Audition (1999)</strong></h2> \n<p>Heartwarming romcom about a lonely widower who searches for a soulmate by setting up a series of \u2026 No, just kidding. He and the audience get more than they bargained for in Takashi Miike\u2019s masterly critique of traditional Japanese attitudes to femininity, which climaxes with a final half-hour so gruelling it makes even hardened gorehounds wince. And, oh boy, that scene with the bag.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeeHWuA4gaQ\" title=\"\">Kairo</a> (2001)</strong></h2> \n<p>Kiyoshi Kurosawa reimagines the ghost story for the computer age, in a phenomenally creepy story about suicides on a university campus, internet-spawned alienation and characters who fade away, leaving nothing but shadowy outlines on walls. It\u2019s not easy getting a handle on the plot, although this just makes it all the creepier. It is also known as Pulse (not to be confused with the poor US remake).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTtz7g2tiuI\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oTtz7g2tiuI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ring \u2026 \u2018Masterclass in tightening the narrative screws.\u2019\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1. Ring (1998)</strong></h2> \n<p>Gore Verbinksi\u2019s Hollywood remake has its moments, but for chills that burrow all the way into your bone-marrow, there\u2019s nothing quite like Hideo Nakata\u2019s original about the cursed VHS tape that condemns anyone who watches it to a horrible death seven days later. It may not have been the first J-horror movie (it wasn\u2019t even the first adaptation of K\u00f4ji Suzuki\u2019s novel), but it was the first to make an impact in the west, and has been spawning remakes, sequels and copycats ever since. Twenty years since the film\u2019s release, the fusion of folklore, urban myth and modern technology holds up nicely, although anyone addicted to rapid-fire editing may now find the pace a bit stately.

      "bodyText": "20. Sadako vs Kayako (2016) Monster movie crossovers are usually a sign of a moribund franchise, but this Ring v Grudge combo is livelier than you would expect. A psychic decides the only way to save a doomed schoolgirl from Sadako\u2019s curse is to introduce another curse into the mix \u2013 and get the two to duke it out. Needless to say, things don\u2019t go as planned. 19. One Missed Call (2003) Students get voice mails predicting their own violent deaths \u2013 which duly come to pass, although not without some black humour and a spooky vintage ringtone. Director Takashi Miike plays by the J-horror rules, more or less, but it all flies off the rails in a bonkers final act. 18. Versus (2000) Yakuza hitmen bury the corpses of their victims in a place called the Forest of Resurrection. Big mistake. It\u2019s gangsters v zombies in Ryuhei Kitamura\u2019s barking mad, low-budget brew of ninja action, wacky camerawork and some of the most OTT acting ever seen outside a Nicolas Cage film. It also has zombies with guns. 17. Monsterz (2014) A mind-controlling sociopath embarks on a battle of wits with the one man he can\u2019t control, using bystanders as disposable pawns. Hideo Nakata\u2019s remake of the Korean paranormal psychothriller Haunters (2010) is darker than the original and benefits from a lovely Kenji Kawai score. 16. Suicide Club (2001) Few opening scenes are more startling than that of Sion Sono\u2019s surreal shocker, in which 54 schoolgirls cheerfully link hands and throw themselves under an oncoming train. A wave of suicides turns out to be not entirely unconnected to a mysterious website, deviant glam rockers and long strips of human skin. Not for the squeamish. 15. Marebito (2004) Between Grudge films, Takashi Shimizu directed this bizarre low-budget, semi-experimental plunge into HP Lovecraft territory. An obsessive cameraman (played by Shinya Tsukamoto of Tetsuo fame) explores a vast netherworld underneath Tokyo, in which he finds a mute naked woman with vampiric tendencies and brings her to the surface to live in his flat. As you do. 14. Retribution (2006) K\u00f4ji Yakusho plays a detective whose investigation into a series of murders is thrown off course when all the evidence points back at him. No Sadako-style ghosts in white for director Kiyoshi Kurosawa; the ghost here wears red, with Kurosawa giving a virtual tutorial in how to conjure a mounting sense of terror out of little more than focus and camera placement. 13. Death Note (2006) Forget the naff Netflix remake and stick to the manga anime series or this live action version directed by Shusuke Kaneko. A precocious student finds a notebook with the power to kill whoever\u2019s name is written inside, and starts using it to rid the world of criminals, watched by a 10ft-tall cartoon demon. But, as the body count mounts, the vigilante crusade becomes increasingly morally compromised. 12. Helter Skelter (2012) The former fashion photographer Mika Ninagawa directed this dazzling manga-based parable about a celebrity \u201cit\u201d girl who undergoes extensive cosmetic surgery to stay on top of the teen idol game, only to sink into a delirium of sex, drugs and spiteful behaviour as unsightly post-op side-effects kick in, and a rival threatens to steal her crown. 11. Bilocation (2013) Mari Asato\u2019s creepy psychothriller wrings a droll twist on the usual doppelganger movie tropes. A struggling artist discovers she has a malevolent alter ego, and joins a group formed to help people cope with their own increasingly menacing doubles. Asato once worked as an apprentice photographer under Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and it shows. 10. Tag (2015) Sion Sono tops even his own Suicide Club with the opening to this quasi-feminist horror movie. A schoolgirl called Mitsuko finds herself the sole survivor after a gust of wind bloodily bisects everyone else in the bus she is on. From then on, it\u2019s nonstop WTF action as Mitsuko faces deadly peril in a bewildering succession of different dimensions and identities. 9. Cure (1997) Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s first collaboration with his acteur f\u00e9tiche, K\u00f4ji Yakusho, delves into the nature of evil in a psychothriller with a uniquely disturbing ambience. A detective investigates a series of murders with different killers, but each of the victims has an X carved into their neck. The closer our man gets to the truth, the more messed-up he becomes. 8. Confessions (2010) A high school teacher describes, to an initially inattentive class, her elaborate plan to avenge the death of her small daughter, whom she claims was killed by two of the pupils. Tetsuya Nakashima\u2019s enthralling psychodrama is an aesthetic treat full of twists and shocks. It is also an extremely cruel fable, which takes no prisoners. 7. Uzumaki (2000) There may be scarier films, but few are weirder than Akihiro Higuchi\u2019s one-off freak show, adapted from one of Junji Ito\u2019s horror manga masterpieces. A schoolgirl called Kirie notices the inhabitants of her small town are becoming increasingly obsessed by spiral shapes. Soon, the spirals take over in a truly discomfiting blend of surrealism and body horror. 6. Dark Water (2002) Like Ring, this was adapted from a novel by Koji Suzuki and directed by Hideo Nakata. A young divorcee and her small daughter move into a flat with a sinister stain on the ceiling. The stain starts to leak. And aaggghhh, the scene with the bath! A terrifying, but emotionally resonant, ghost story grounded by a social realist setting. 5. Grudge (2002) In Takashi Shimizu\u2019s remake of his own straight-to-video hit, an assortment of doomed social workers, relatives and cops go trooping into a house haunted by the spectral tag team of \u201cscary broad with long black hair\u201d and \u201cmiaow boy\u201d. Horrible things happen. It\u2019s little more than a series of scary set-pieces strung together, but it hits the spot \u2013 especially the scene with, oh God, the bedclothes. 4. Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989) A salaryman gradually morphs into a walking pile of scrap metal with a big power drill in place of a penis. Shinya Tsukamoto\u2019s Tetsuo trilogy is not strictly J-horror, but the film-maker\u2019s idiosyncratic brand of expressionist stop-motion cyberpunk coincided with the genre\u2019s move away from 1980s Guinea-Pig-type sadistic misogyny into fun stuff you can watch without barfing. 3. Audition (1999) Heartwarming romcom about a lonely widower who searches for a soulmate by setting up a series of \u2026 No, just kidding. He and the audience get more than they bargained for in Takashi Miike\u2019s masterly critique of traditional Japanese attitudes to femininity, which climaxes with a final half-hour so gruelling it makes even hardened gorehounds wince. And, oh boy, that scene with the bag. 2. Kairo (2001) Kiyoshi Kurosawa reimagines the ghost story for the computer age, in a phenomenally creepy story about suicides on a university campus, internet-spawned alienation and characters who fade away, leaving nothing but shadowy outlines on walls. It\u2019s not easy getting a handle on the plot, although this just makes it all the creepier. It is also known as Pulse (not to be confused with the poor US remake). 1. Ring (1998) Gore Verbinksi\u2019s Hollywood remake has its moments, but for chills that burrow all the way into your bone-marrow, there\u2019s nothing quite like Hideo Nakata\u2019s original about the cursed VHS tape that condemns anyone who watches it to a horrible death seven days later. It may not have been the first J-horror movie (it wasn\u2019t even the first adaptation of K\u00f4ji Suzuki\u2019s novel), but it was the first to make an impact in the west, and has been spawning remakes, sequels and copycats ever since. Twenty years since the film\u2019s release, the fusion of folklore, urban myth and modern technology holds up nicely, although anyone addicted to rapid-fire editing may now find the pace a bit stately. But Nakata gives a masterclass in tightening the narrative screws and there\u2019s no arguing with that \u201cthey think it\u2019s all over\u201d ending, still one of horror\u2019s most hair-raising moments. \u2022A restored version of Ring is released in UK cinemas on 1 March.",

In a brief statement that gave no details as to how the determination was reached, Pompeo said Muthana has no \u201clegal basis\u201d to claim American citizenship. \u201cShe does not have any legal basis, no valid US passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cWe continue to strongly advise all US citizens not to travel to Syria.\u201d Donald Trump claimed credit for the move, tweeting: \u201cI have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\u201d In the UK, there has been debate over whether Shamima Begum, a teenager who travelled from east London to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015, should be allowed to return. She is expected to be have her UK citizenship revoked, a controversial move she has described as \u201ckind of heart-breaking\u201d. Muthana, who was captured by Kurdish forces after fleeing the last pocket of land controlled by Islamic State, has said she \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d travelling to Syria four years ago to join the terror group and has pleaded to be allowed to return to her family in Alabama. Speaking from al-Hawl refugee camp in northern Syria, Muthana, who was once one of Isis\u2019s most prominent online agitators, said she had been brainwashed and had misunderstood her faith when she aligned herself with Isis. A state department spokesperson on Wednesday echoed Pompeo\u2019s remarks and said Muthana was not born a US citizen and has never been a US citizen. Hassan Shibly, an attorney for the woman\u2019s family, said the administration\u2019s position is based on a \u201ccomplicated\u201d interpretation of the law involving her father. \u201cThey\u2019re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Shibly told The Associated Press. Hoda Muthana was born in 1994 in Hackensack, New Jersey, the lawyer said. Muthana was born to parents from Yemen who became naturalized American citizens, according to the Counter Extremism Project at George Washington University. Most people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship but there are exceptions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to U.S. law and is not automatically considered a U.S. citizen at birth. Pompeo\u2019s statement on Muthana \u2013 one of the few Americans among the hundreds of Europeans to have joined the ranks of the Islamic State group in Syria \u2013 is at stark odds with his calls on other countries to bring back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals. In late 2014, shortly after moving to Syria, Muthana posted on Twitter a picture of four women who appeared to torch their Western passports, including an American one. She went on to write vivid calls over social media to kill Americans, glorifying the extremist group that for a time ruled vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. But with the Islamic State group down to its last stretch of land, Muthana said she had renounced extremism and wanted to return home. Muthana, who has been detained by US-allied Kurdish fighters, said that she had been brainwashed online and was ashamed of her past support for the militants. She was married three times and has a toddler son.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the UK\u2019s largest online estate agent, Purplebricks, plunged 40% after the company slashed its revenue forecasts and announced the surprise departure of both its US and UK bosses. The company blamed slower than expected growth in its fledgling US business and \u201cheadwinds\u201d in Australia, as it said revenue for the year was unlikely to exceed \u00a3140m compared with an earlier forecast of up to \u00a3175m. The revenue prediction had already been downgraded once, at the time of its disappointing half-year results, from \u00a3185m. Last year\u2019s revenues were \u00a393.7m, which yielded an operating loss of \u00a319.6m. The combined \u00a345m downgrade to this year\u2019s full-year sales forecasts is significant given that Australia and the US, the two divisions it said were struggling, only reported revenues of \u00a312.5m combined in the first half of the year. Shares dropped by 40% after the news but later staged a partial recovery. However they were still down 28%, at 118p, cutting the company\u2019s market value by \u00a3140m. The fall is bad news for Woodford Investment Management, led by the City investment guru Neil Woodford, which is the largest shareholder in the company, with a stake of about 27%. Purplebricks\u2019 founder and global chief executive, Michael Bruce, is to take control of the US business with immediate effect, as its US chief executive, Eric Eckardt, leaves the business. No reason was given for his departure but revenues in the US grew less rapidly than the company had hoped, after a lacklustre response to a marketing drive that finished in January. The UK chief executive, Lee Wainwright, is also leaving. The company said this was for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. Purplebricks said the housing market in Britain, by far its largest business, was \u201cchallenging\u201d but Bruce said the UK division was in good shape. \u201cThe UK is leading the way with continued profitable growth and a strategy to deliver greater success,\u201d he said. However, analysts at Investec said predicted UK sales growth of 15%-20% was disappointing compared with their own prediction of 27%, although they said this was mitigated by the likelihood the company would retain double-digit profit margins and a 75% share of the online market. Bruce said: \u201cThe board remains confident of the long-term growth potential of the business and the opportunity to deliver substantial value for shareholders.\u201d Purplebricks was involved in a bitter row with City analysts at Jefferies last year, after the stockbroker questioned the company\u2019s claims that it sold more than three-quarters of homes listed on its website.",

      "body": "<p>The novelist Joan Silber, a critical favourite in her native US, is almost unknown over here. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lorrie-moore\" title=\"\">Lorrie Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters\" title=\"\">Sarah Waters</a> are fans, and her eighth book of fiction, <em>Improvement</em>, arrives with two major awards and a Washington Post plaudit calling her \u201cour country\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-munro\" title=\"\">Alice Munro</a>\u201d. That\u2019s already quite a lot to live up to.</p> <p><em>Improvement</em> is a patchwork novel, quiet in its voice, ambitious in its design. Starting and ending with the story of Reyna, a single mother in Harlem, and her eccentric aunt Kiki, who\u2019s returned to New York after many years in Turkey, it daisychains several related narratives into a rich and surprising whole. Bound by their mutual affection, Kiki worries about her niece\u2019s latest man, Boyd, who\u2019s on probation following a jail term. Involved in a cross-state tax scam selling cigarettes, Boyd asks a favour of Reyna \u2013 he needs a driver, and as she\u2019s white is less subject to suspicion; what she decides will reverberate throughout the book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"472c42a68be1b004e87129df5aee023cbe68f267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/472c42a68be1b004e87129df5aee023cbe68f267/168_173_1143_1428/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Silber \u2013 a critical favourite in the US.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Silber \u2013 a critical favourite in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shari Diamond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This baton-passing narrative might be offputting to some: Reyna and Kiki have been fascinatingly set up only to be put on hold while another character takes centre stage. Yet such is Silber\u2019s expertise that it requires no more than a paragraph, or even a couple of sentences, to involve us in the next one, and the next. A jilted young woman goes through heartache and emerges on the other side. A truck driver recovering from a traffic accident takes stock of a life torn between his wife and his ex. Kiki reappears in a mid-section flashback to the late 1970s, when as a Turkish farmer\u2019s wife she once hosted a trio of Germans seeking shelter. Silber\u2019s superb handling of time \u2013 that Alice Munro tribute isn\u2019t wide of the mark \u2013 draws the disparate lives into a unity, and makes this compressed novel feel mysteriously capacious.</p> <p>Its principal theme is the need to make amends. In one passage a woman tells her terrible mother that she wasn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d. The mother is astonished: \u201cWas that what she wanted, those words? You\u2019d think she could have made a better job of it then. But people often wanted payment for what they\u2019d only wished they\u2019d done.\u201d If \u201cAtonement\u201d hadn\u2019t already been taken, it would have given the book a better title \u2013 the only improvement it needs.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Improvement </em>is published by Allen &amp; Unwin (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "The novelist Joan Silber, a critical favourite in her native US, is almost unknown over here. Lorrie Moore and Sarah Waters are fans, and her eighth book of fiction, Improvement, arrives with two major awards and a Washington Post plaudit calling her \u201cour country\u2019s own Alice Munro\u201d. That\u2019s already quite a lot to live up to. Improvement is a patchwork novel, quiet in its voice, ambitious in its design. Starting and ending with the story of Reyna, a single mother in Harlem, and her eccentric aunt Kiki, who\u2019s returned to New York after many years in Turkey, it daisychains several related narratives into a rich and surprising whole. Bound by their mutual affection, Kiki worries about her niece\u2019s latest man, Boyd, who\u2019s on probation following a jail term. Involved in a cross-state tax scam selling cigarettes, Boyd asks a favour of Reyna \u2013 he needs a driver, and as she\u2019s white is less subject to suspicion; what she decides will reverberate throughout the book. This baton-passing narrative might be offputting to some: Reyna and Kiki have been fascinatingly set up only to be put on hold while another character takes centre stage. Yet such is Silber\u2019s expertise that it requires no more than a paragraph, or even a couple of sentences, to involve us in the next one, and the next. A jilted young woman goes through heartache and emerges on the other side. A truck driver recovering from a traffic accident takes stock of a life torn between his wife and his ex. Kiki reappears in a mid-section flashback to the late 1970s, when as a Turkish farmer\u2019s wife she once hosted a trio of Germans seeking shelter. Silber\u2019s superb handling of time \u2013 that Alice Munro tribute isn\u2019t wide of the mark \u2013 draws the disparate lives into a unity, and makes this compressed novel feel mysteriously capacious. Its principal theme is the need to make amends. In one passage a woman tells her terrible mother that she wasn\u2019t \u201cthat bad\u201d. The mother is astonished: \u201cWas that what she wanted, those words? You\u2019d think she could have made a better job of it then. But people often wanted payment for what they\u2019d only wished they\u2019d done.\u201d If \u201cAtonement\u201d hadn\u2019t already been taken, it would have given the book a better title \u2013 the only improvement it needs. \u2022 Improvement is published by Allen &amp; Unwin (\u00a314.99).

When he was first hired for the Fen Court project by Generali Real Estate, in 2006, he proposed a tower of a similar height to the Walkie Talkie.

      "bodyText": "Britain has recorded the biggest-ever monthly surplus in public finances since the early 1990s, putting the government on a strong footing in the run-up to Brexit, now less than 40 days away. In a rare piece of positive economic news for Philip Hammond as he prepares for his spring statement next month, income from taxes outstripped public spending by \u00a314.9bn, the biggest January surplus since records began in 1993. Although January is typically a surplus month for the exchequer because of seasonal trends in the payment of taxes, the Office for National Statistics said last month\u2019s surplus was \u00a35.5bn larger than a year ago. Income and capital gains tax receipts increased by 14%, twice the average growth rate earlier in the year. Combined, the income from self-assessed income taxes and capital gains tax receipts was \u00a321.4bn, the highest in January since comparable records began in 2000. The data comes after several disappointing months for the chancellor, as borrowing came in worse than forecast. Government borrowing for the first 10 months of the financial year has, however, fallen almost by half, as tax receipts have been much stronger than expected. The exchequer has borrowed about \u00a321.2bn this year so far, \u00a318.5bn lower than at the same point a year ago, and the lowest since the 10 months to January 2001. The latest update means the government could be on track to reduce the deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and tax income \u2013 close to its target of \u00a325.5bn set by the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is 39% less than in 2017-18. However, Hammond has been told he needs to raise spending in order to meet Theresa May\u2019s pledge to bring austerity to an end after almost a decade of cuts to benefits and public services under the Conservatives. The chancellor has promised to hold about \u00a315bn of spending firepower in reserve to safeguard the economy from a damaging no-deal Brexit scenario. Sluggish economic growth since the start of the year, as Brexit uncertainty bites and the global economy slows, could also drag on the public finances. Changes to the way student loans are accounted for by the ONS will also undermine the public finances, when the alterations are made in September. The shake-up, to count loans as part-spending and part-financial asset, could create a black hole in the public finances worth as much as \u00a312bn. Martin Wheatcroft, an adviser on public finances to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cWill the Chancellor take the politically tough decision to raise taxes to increase funding for public services, borrow more to provide an economic stimulus, or will austerity have to continue for even longer?\u201d",

Here is a successful (Oscar-winning) woman playing the most powerful hero in the Marvel universe, according to studio chief Kevin Feige. In fact, her alter ego, Carol Danvers, might just be tough enough to take down Thanos himself in the forthcoming Avengers: Endgame. This, to the average \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d advocate, is a concept of irredeemable outlandishness. For Danvers is a slender, sylph-like female in a natty 80s-inspired suit, while Thanos is a great, hulking, purple, musclebound male. Never mind that both are completely fictional with superpowers, the problem here is that (gritted teeth, bulging forehead vein) GIRLS WILL NEVER BE STRONGER THAN BOYS. OK?

In a filing to federal court in Maryland, prosecutors said Hasson kept a spreadsheet of his intended targets, which included Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, as well as several journalists from CNN and MSNBC. Jussie Smollett charged with filing false report Jussie Smollett, the Empire star who claimed he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in Chicago, has been charged with a felony for allegedly filing a false police report. Smollett, who is black and gay, said two masked men attacked him, yelling Trump slogans and racial and homophobic slurs, beat him and left him with a noose around his neck in the small hours of 29 January. If found guilty, he could face up to three years in prison. His lawyers said they intend to mount an aggressive defence. Screen presence. The producers of Empire, in which Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, say they have no intention of writing his character out of the show. Climate change to blame for underreported crises Climate change was the main culprit in the majority of underreported humanitarian crises around the world in 2018, according to a new analysis of more than a million online news stories. The report, commissioned by Care International, found that food crises affecting entire populations in poor countries such as Ethiopia, Haiti and Madagascar barely broke into the headlines. Vulnerable poor. Sven Harmeling of Care International said the media must not turn a blind eye: \u201cNot only are the people who live in the world\u2019s poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change, but they are also the least equipped to address its increasing impacts.\u201d Trump bars Isis recruit from returning to Alabama Donald Trump has ordered the state department to block Hoda Muthana, an Alabama woman who joined Islamic State in 2015 but now says she \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d the decision, from returning to the US. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said on Wednesday that Muthana, formerly one of Isis\u2019s most prominent online agitators, was \u201cnot a US citizen\u201d. The 24-year-old is currently at the al-Hawl refugee camp in Syria, close to the last remaining scrap of Isis-held territory. British recruit. Shamima Begum, a 19-year-old British woman who also joined Isis in 2015, has been controversially stripped of her UK citizenship by the Home Office, which claims the fact Begum\u2019s parents are of Bangladeshi heritage means she can apply for citizenship of that country. Bangladesh says she is not a Bangladeshi citizen and there is \u201cno question\u201d of her being allowed in.

Thousands of public school teachers in Oakland joined the wave of teachers\u2019 strikes across the US by walking out on Thursday, demanding better resources and higher pay in a city where their salaries rarely stretch far enough to live. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has struck a deal with two fringe Jewish-nationalist parties, offering them cabinet positions in a future government if they join his Likud party in a rightwing bloc ahead of April\u2019s parliamentary elections. A member of a species of tortoise feared extinct for more than a century has been found alive in a remote part of the Gal\u00e1pagos islands. The female is thought to be more than 100 years old. Must-reads A family\u2019s conversation about race and bigotry, illustrated In her new humorous, heartfelt graphic memoir, Good Talk, Mira Jacobs depicts a series of tricky conversations with her mixed-race son about race, bigotry and systemic oppression. In this excerpt, he asks, \u201cAre we racist?\u201d Anti-vaxxers in the delivery ward As a paediatrician in the newborn nursery at a high-risk delivery centre, Rachel Pearson meets an increasing number of parents who refuse vaccinations for their newborns. How blunt should she be about the potential dangers of their decision? Will fame save 21 Savage from deportation? The British-born rapper 21 Savage spent just nine days in custody after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His lawyer says he\u2019s \u201cemblematic\u201d of other detainees, but unlike most, he may be saved from deportation by his celebrity, as Francisco Navas reports. US cities face pollution rise after China\u2019s ban on recyclables China recently banned the import of items intended for recycling, which means the onus for disposing of recyclable rubbish falls to the US, where in some places up to half is now being burned in incinerators. Oliver Milman reports from Chester City, Pennsylvania. Opinion Joseph Ratzinger\u2019s papacy was engulfed by the scandal over sexual abuse in the Catholic church. This weekend his successor, Pope Francis, aims to address the issue with a summit at the Vatican. It is a test of his credibility, argues Catherine Pepinster. It may well suit Francis and his advisers to be perceived as taking firm and drastic action ... But Catholics will want to see the Vatican owning up to a cover-up. Sport Manchester City came from behind to beat Schalke 3-2 in the dying minutes of their Champions League last-16 clash at the Veltins Arena, but City coach Pep Guardiola said afterwards that his team were \u201cnot ready to fight\u201d for the European title.

I did get rid of it \u2026 thought of burning it but imagined a vision of some kind of devil in the flames, so consigned to a cardboard box and then the dump.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3058189\">tribord</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cWhen it got to the bit where he inserts a tube into a woman\u2019s vagina and then runs a rodent up it I found myself suddenly inexplicably weeping.

I was going through a divorce, living in a friend\u2019s part converted garage which had no insulation or heating. It was the dead of winter, minus 15 outside, during the big freeze we had in early 2010.</p> <p>I began to get really sick, I was freezing cold but kept spiking a fever. I ended up admitted to hospital with pneumonia and cyanosis but throughout this period I was reading America Psycho. At some points I didn\u2019t know if I was reading the book or hallucinating it.

There were eight bunks arranged over two cells and approximately 20-plus other blokes. That was horrific. True story.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4534564\">notinamillion</a></strong></p> <p>\u201c<strong>The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks</strong>. I had to read it a sentence at a time and then put it down in between each one as it was so unbelievably shocking.

And while I recognised it was bleak, shocking and desperately sad, I got through it breezily enough. Tried rereading as a parent and lasted until the cat met the truck and the neighbour made a suggestion about the crazy cemetery deep in the spooky woods \u2026 But I just couldn\u2019t bear to revisit the trauma that I knew King was about to inflict upon that poor family.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1751463\">RobP</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cI find most of King\u2019s works harder to read now that I\u2019m a parent, but the one that got to me the most was when I recently read <strong>The Shining</strong>. The moment of clarity that Jack has in the midst of his (madness? possession?), enough to tell his son that he loves him, and to run - I finished the book feeling overwhelmingly sad.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12095168\">TheIcewoman</a></strong></p> <p>\u201c<strong><a href=\"https://www.macsbacks.com/book/9781501143861\">Gerald\u2019s Game</a></strong> is the only book that I\u2019ve put down, thrown in the recycling bin, taken the bin to the recycling center and buried at the bottom of the collection dumpster.

After a while, the endless descriptions of human faces being mangled proved deadening. I was no longer shocked by the grotesque imagery. It was this that I found truly disturbing. It showed that under the correct circumstances, humans could lose (some) empathy, and this didn\u2019t require one to agree with the ideology behind those circumstances.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13598262\">cubit271</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2019/feb/12/the-most-disturbing-books-weve-ever-read-with-alice-clark-platts-podcast\">The most disturbing books we've ever read, with Alice Clark-Platts \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c<strong>On the Beach by Nevil Shute</strong>, about a spreading radioactive cloud, is the most disturbing thing I have ever read.

Either way, that story had some indescribable effect. I don\u2019t often go swimming now. The book\u2019s now in storage and for the good of society will remain locked away for all time, Raiders of the Lost Ark-style. Yuk.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14517294\">HotToffee</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cI find Haruki Murakami generally quite a humane and uplifting writer, but there is one story a character tells in<strong> The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</strong> where someone is tortured for information, and it is the single most upsetting thing I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve read some grisly stuff, such as <strong>American Psycho, The Wasp Factory, Blood Meridian</strong> \u2013 but that one scene trumps all others because the character recounting it also sounds so wounded by what they\u2019ve seen, and because much of the book surrounding it is thoughtful and charming.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18223101\">Thorn Davis</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cAll of Hubert Selby Jr\u2019s output is hard going, but for sheer bleakness, <strong>Last Exit to Brooklyn</strong> comes out top (or should that be bottom?) Why I read it a second time, I\u2019ll never know. The film introduces a happy ending where there isn\u2019t one in the book, if memory serves - Tra La La survives the gang rape/torture.

I started off thinking \u2018what\u2019s all the fuss?\u2019 and then the depravity went off the chart. Removed it from the house (couldn\u2019t bear to throw it away so took it to the charity shop, which in hindsight wasn\u2019t the best plan) and haven\u2019t been able to watch a horror film since.

I read it when I was 13. After only a few chapters, Regan\u2019s behaviour disturbed me enough that I became terrified, not just of the contents but of the book itself, so I buried it under a pile of other books in my bedroom. The next day I hid the book in the garden shed. Yet even then I sensed its supernatural powers would reach me. So the following day I cycled some distance from home and threw it in a bin \u2026 I\u2019m over 60 and have never returned to the novel nor will I.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10160967\">ID2765618</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cThe late, great, criminally underappreciated Shirley Jackson\u2019s early novel <strong>The Road Through the Wall </strong>upset me more than anything else she wrote. It moves slowly, in Jackson\u2019s careful, unadorned prose, through depictions of dull suburban conformism, alienation, and petty sin behind closed doors to a most distressing and violent climax.

Nowhere is it plainer than in the heartrending chase and killing of an old, blind, sperm whale, barely able to swim for lack of a fin, as he labours along, trailing his younger, faster pod, until the merciless whalers plunge their barbs into his exhausted body \u2026 It still shocks, even now. Every time I read that passage, I will him to dive, to escape, and my heart sinks as he coughs blood and rolls over. Every time.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10418843\">Brian Trevelyan</a></strong></p> <p>\u201c<strong>Exoskeleton by Shane Stadler</strong> makes the torture in Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four seem like a stroll in the park on a sunny afternoon.

I found it both morally and intellectually offensive; morally offensive for the things it says about victimisation, mental illness, and suicide, intellectually offensive for being asked to believe the shoddy, contrived plot and world building.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2919655\">sarahcl</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cThe closing scene of <strong>The Grapes of Wrath</strong> had me shaking and screaming to myself \u2026 The lead into it was so well-written it lowered me gradually into dread of what was coming.

      "bodyText": "Last week we asked you to share the books that have most shocked or disturbed you \u2013 and boy, you guys responded with a passion. Over the 1,200 comments, the winning book \u2013 if that\u2019s the right word \u2013 was: American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis: \u2018I found myself suddenly inexplicably weeping\u2019 \u201cI read American Psycho all the way through but nearly fainted reading one of the scenes. I did get rid of it \u2026 thought of burning it but imagined a vision of some kind of devil in the flames, so consigned to a cardboard box and then the dump.\u201d tribord \u201cWhen it got to the bit where he inserts a tube into a woman\u2019s vagina and then runs a rodent up it I found myself suddenly inexplicably weeping. That was 20 years ago and I haven\u2019t reread it since, so don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react now.\u201d noush \u201cI read it during a particularly low period in my life. I was going through a divorce, living in a friend\u2019s part converted garage which had no insulation or heating. It was the dead of winter, minus 15 outside, during the big freeze we had in early 2010. I began to get really sick, I was freezing cold but kept spiking a fever. I ended up admitted to hospital with pneumonia and cyanosis but throughout this period I was reading America Psycho. At some points I didn\u2019t know if I was reading the book or hallucinating it. It was utterly surreal and yet \u2026 brilliant. Read that book when you\u2019re dying \u2013 it\u2019s really good.\u201d Campagnolo The authors you suggested most often were John Fowles, Iain Banks and Stephen King \u201cI read The Collector by John Fowles whilst remanded for four days in an Israeli police station. There were eight bunks arranged over two cells and approximately 20-plus other blokes. That was horrific. True story.\u201d notinamillion \u201cThe Wasp Factory by Iain Banks. I had to read it a sentence at a time and then put it down in between each one as it was so unbelievably shocking. I still remember the feeling of breathlessness 20 years later.\u201d Leonie Drury \u201cI read Pet Sematary as a teen in the midst of a horror jag. And while I recognised it was bleak, shocking and desperately sad, I got through it breezily enough. Tried rereading as a parent and lasted until the cat met the truck and the neighbour made a suggestion about the crazy cemetery deep in the spooky woods \u2026 But I just couldn\u2019t bear to revisit the trauma that I knew King was about to inflict upon that poor family.\u201d RobP \u201cI find most of King\u2019s works harder to read now that I\u2019m a parent, but the one that got to me the most was when I recently read The Shining. The moment of clarity that Jack has in the midst of his (madness? possession?), enough to tell his son that he loves him, and to run - I finished the book feeling overwhelmingly sad.\u201d TheIcewoman \u201cGerald\u2019s Game is the only book that I\u2019ve put down, thrown in the recycling bin, taken the bin to the recycling center and buried at the bottom of the collection dumpster. I was fine until I got to the degloving.\u201d Hyphenman \u2018Simultaneously heartbreaking and terrifying\u2019: dystopian fiction \u201cThe Road scene where the main protagonist follows a troupe that includes a pregnant women \u2013 then the follow-up where he describes them roasting the newborn baby on a spit. I can\u2019t think of a more shocking excerpt from anything I\u2019ve read. I had to put it down for a couple of days before I could start again.\u201d happyjs \u201cOuter Dark by Cormac McCarthy, where a character bites into a deformed baby\u2019s throat \u2026 pretty shocking and high-calibre writing from a southern gothic master. The Road\u2019s basement scene is also one of the scariest things I\u2019ve read and also seen in the film.\u201d PeppyOoze \u201cCrash by JG Ballard. After a while, the endless descriptions of human faces being mangled proved deadening. I was no longer shocked by the grotesque imagery. It was this that I found truly disturbing. It showed that under the correct circumstances, humans could lose (some) empathy, and this didn\u2019t require one to agree with the ideology behind those circumstances.\u201d cubit271 \u201cOn the Beach by Nevil Shute, about a spreading radioactive cloud, is the most disturbing thing I have ever read. It really unsettled me for a long time and even now I can\u2019t properly think about it or look at the cover.\u201d ID8664073 \u201cWhen the Wind Blows by Raymond Briggs. Simultaneously heartbreaking and terrifying. I read this when I was about 10 \u2013 I can recall working out what direction London was and then making sure I slept with my back to it in case of a nuclear blast.\u201d natstar7777 \u2018I fainted on the train\u2019: Guts and gore. \u201cSo hard to get through Guts by Chuck Palahniuk. Sent a copy of that to a workmate who I\u2019d been exchanging \u2018edgy\u2019 fiction with \u2026 he politely asked me to never ever send him anything like that again.\u201d BadThingsHappen \u201cI\u2019ve never been quite sure whether it was the fact I was coming off a 72-hour work week and succumbing to a viral infection or because I was reading Guts that I fainted on the train home several years ago. Either way, that story had some indescribable effect. I don\u2019t often go swimming now. The book\u2019s now in storage and for the good of society will remain locked away for all time, Raiders of the Lost Ark-style. Yuk.\u201d HotToffee \u201cI find Haruki Murakami generally quite a humane and uplifting writer, but there is one story a character tells in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle where someone is tortured for information, and it is the single most upsetting thing I\u2019ve ever read. I\u2019ve read some grisly stuff, such as American Psycho, The Wasp Factory, Blood Meridian \u2013 but that one scene trumps all others because the character recounting it also sounds so wounded by what they\u2019ve seen, and because much of the book surrounding it is thoughtful and charming.\u201d Thorn Davis \u201cAll of Hubert Selby Jr\u2019s output is hard going, but for sheer bleakness, Last Exit to Brooklyn comes out top (or should that be bottom?) Why I read it a second time, I\u2019ll never know. The film introduces a happy ending where there isn\u2019t one in the book, if memory serves - Tra La La survives the gang rape/torture. Some happy ending. Bleakbleakbleak.\u201d musicforpleasure \u201cThe most unsettling book I\u2019ve ever read has to be The Room by Hubert Selby Jr. Spent most of the book wishing it\u2019d be over soon. Apparently the author himself was unable to read the book for another 20 years after writing it!\u201d EastOfMacondo \u201cDespite being a sick-lit fan for quite some time, I had to force myself to the end of De Sade\u2019s 120 Days of Sodom. I started off thinking \u2018what\u2019s all the fuss?\u2019 and then the depravity went off the chart. Removed it from the house (couldn\u2019t bear to throw it away so took it to the charity shop, which in hindsight wasn\u2019t the best plan) and haven\u2019t been able to watch a horror film since. Still on the sick-lit, though, and haven\u2019t yet found something that has disturbed me to that level.\u201d Joanne Thompson \u2018No novel has ever unsettled me more\u2019: the most haunting fiction \u201cJames Dickey\u2019s Deliverance. The Hillbilly rape scene. All the more shocking because it is described with such distanced, cold objectivity. I remember the first time I read it and my blood running cold. Having seen the Boorman film several times I thought I\u2019d be OK with it. I was wrong. Horrifying and masterful writing.\u201d Kemster \u201cBetsy Reavley\u2019s Beneath a Watery Moon is the only book I\u2019ve ever physically destroyed \u2013 violence pornography at its sickest and most graphic. Dreadful.\u201d grumpyoldgirl \u201cAM Homes\u2019s novel The End of Alice, depicting the epistolary relationship between a teenage girl and an older jailed man, takes elements of Alice in Wonderland, turns them on their head, and sends the reader down the darkest of rabbit holes. Searingly intelligent and horrifying, but never exploitative, no novel has ever unsettled me more.\u201d Brad \u201cDJ Aural\u201d Latendresse \u201cThe Exorcist by William Blatty. I read it when I was 13. After only a few chapters, Regan\u2019s behaviour disturbed me enough that I became terrified, not just of the contents but of the book itself, so I buried it under a pile of other books in my bedroom. The next day I hid the book in the garden shed. Yet even then I sensed its supernatural powers would reach me. So the following day I cycled some distance from home and threw it in a bin \u2026 I\u2019m over 60 and have never returned to the novel nor will I.\u201d ID2765618 \u201cThe late, great, criminally underappreciated Shirley Jackson\u2019s early novel The Road Through the Wall upset me more than anything else she wrote. It moves slowly, in Jackson\u2019s careful, unadorned prose, through depictions of dull suburban conformism, alienation, and petty sin behind closed doors to a most distressing and violent climax. Highly recommended.\u201d fantod \u201cHouse of Leaves by Mark Danielewski got right under my skin for weeks and weeks, although I\u2019d really be pushed to explain why. The message on the dedication page \u2013 \u2018This is not for you\u2019 \u2013 still makes me feel a bit odd.\u201d unclestinky \u201cMoby-Dick. Drama and allegory aplenty but amid it, the vile realities of the whaling industry. Nowhere is it plainer than in the heartrending chase and killing of an old, blind, sperm whale, barely able to swim for lack of a fin, as he labours along, trailing his younger, faster pod, until the merciless whalers plunge their barbs into his exhausted body \u2026 It still shocks, even now. Every time I read that passage, I will him to dive, to escape, and my heart sinks as he coughs blood and rolls over.

After reading it you think: \u201cDo I really know what is going on in this world?\u201d gavernism \u201cA Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara is the worst book I have ever read. I found it both morally and intellectually offensive; morally offensive for the things it says about victimisation, mental illness, and suicide, intellectually offensive for being asked to believe the shoddy, contrived plot and world building.\u201d sarahcl \u201cThe closing scene of The Grapes of Wrath had me shaking and screaming to myself \u2026 The lead into it was so well-written it lowered me gradually into dread of what was coming. If you turned straight to the end it probably wouldn\u2019t have the same effect.\u201d jogi \u2018This book destroyed me for weeks\u2019: non-fiction and novels about real history \u201cSurely the most shocking and disturbing books are non-fiction. For me, that would include Primo Levi\u2019s devastating Holocaust memoir If This Is a Man, Ishmael Beah\u2019s Memoirs of a Child Soldier, and Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag Archipelago. Nothing is as disturbing as the personal testimony of those who have experienced the worst that humans can do to each other.\u201d fmoreau \u201cThe Rape of Nanjing by Iris Chang is still unfinished on my bookshelf. It is a well researched book that details the Japanese atrocities in Nanjing during the Sino-Japanese war but it is difficult to face the detailed descriptions of their inhumanity to fellow human beings and I had to put it aside. Maybe I will steel myself to finish it one day.\u201d lwb48_zh \u201cBury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown. The accounts of the wanton cruelty of the US government toward the various native tribes is practically unbearable to read. Especially shocking was to realise how recently such savage behaviour was condoned and performed.\u201d Pensum \u201cGita Sereny\u2019s Into That Darkness. The story of Franz Stangl, a perfectly ordinary man who becomes the commander of the death camp at Treblinka. An examination not just of the banality of evil but just how easy it is to get sucked in.\u201d SmokyBarnable \u201cMartin Amis\u2019s Time\u2019s Arrow. The horror of the Holocaust, made freshly horrifying with a new dose of absurdity and head-slapping stupidity. This book destroyed me for weeks; it\u2019s upsetting just writing a couple of sentences about it.\u201d tomimber \u201cThe Kindly Ones by Jonathan Littell was hard work to read simply because it was so graphic and disturbing and will remain as one of my most thought-provoking books of war and its awful effects.\u201d Booksareme \u201cSolzhenitsyn\u2019s One Day in the Life Of Ivan Denisovich stuck with me.

Ejiofor has exercised a little creative licence here and upped the narrative stakes, by making this turbine vital for pumping otherwise inaccessible well water for the drought-stricken village\u2019s crops, and in doing so battling against his father\u2019s angry realisation that his kid has done what he could not. But Ejiofor\u2019s creative interventions are entirely justified. They speak to the larger ideas \u2013 the pain and confrontation involved in trying something radically new.</p> <p>Ejiofor himself plays Trywell, a man consumed with fear that he will be found wanting as a father and farmer; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9357186/\" title=\"\">Maxwell Simba</a> plays his smart, observant son William. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0563740/\" title=\"\">A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga</a> is Trywell\u2019s wife Agnes.</p> <p>The village is plunged into poverty and hunger.

In the midst of all this, William has a natural aptitude for technology, and with just a school library book called Using Energy, he realises that he can save his village.</p> <p>Simba shows a maturity in his performance to match Ejiofor\u2019s. This absorbing story is shot with athletically strong light and colour by cinematographer <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005836/\" title=\"\">Dick Pope</a> and the performances are intelligent and forthright.

Ejiofor has exercised a little creative licence here and upped the narrative stakes, by making this turbine vital for pumping otherwise inaccessible well water for the drought-stricken village\u2019s crops, and in doing so battling against his father\u2019s angry realisation that his kid has done what he could not. But Ejiofor\u2019s creative interventions are entirely justified. They speak to the larger ideas \u2013 the pain and confrontation involved in trying something radically new. Ejiofor himself plays Trywell, a man consumed with fear that he will be found wanting as a father and farmer; Maxwell Simba plays his smart, observant son William. A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga is Trywell\u2019s wife Agnes. The village is plunged into poverty and hunger. Exploitative, predatory landowners make derisory buy-out offers to families like William\u2019s; government politicians are cynical, violent and corrupt. In the midst of all this, William has a natural aptitude for technology, and with just a school library book called Using Energy, he realises that he can save his village. Simba shows a maturity in his performance to match Ejiofor\u2019s. This absorbing story is shot with athletically strong light and colour by cinematographer Dick Pope and the performances are intelligent and forthright. When those turbine blades turned, I felt like cheering.",

      "body": "<p>Eating is so last season; these days all the cool kids fast. Fasting diets have rocketed in popularity over the last few years, garnering a number of high-profile fans. Like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, who<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1089261299073048581\"> tweeted</a> last month that he had \u201cbeen playing with fasting for some time\u201d. Dorsey explained that he does \u201ca 22 hour fast daily (dinner only), and recently did a 3 day water fast\u201d. The billionaire added that the biggest thing he had noticed after depriving himself of food was \u201chow much time slows down. The day feels so much longer when not broken up by breakfast/lunch/dinner. Any one [sic] else have this experience?\u201d</p> <p>I have! I\u2019ve had lots of experience with the various side effects of fasting because I did it a ton as a teenager: it was called \u201canorexia\u201d. And it wasn\u2019t fun. It wrecked my health and took me years to recover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any eating behaviors that involve restriction or rigid rules is concerning</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Allison Chase</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fasting, of course, is not synonymous with anorexia. Nor is it necessarily problematic. However, as<a href=\"https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/recovery-centers/austin/our-team\"> Dr Allison Chase</a>, an eating disorder specialist, tells me over email, \u201cany eating behaviors that involve restriction or rigid rules is concerning\u201d and can be a precursor to diagnosable eating disorders.</p> <p>Also concerning is the way these behaviors are glamorized,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/04/silicon-valley-ceo-fasting-trend-diet-is-it-safe\"> particularly in Silicon Valley</a>, where a number of high-profile tech execs extol the transformative power of extreme fasting. Meanwhile the compulsive measuring behaviors associated with eating disorders, including obsessively tracking your calorie intake and exercise,<strong> </strong>have been normalized by fitness tracking apps and the Silicon Valley ethos that constant self-examination leads to self-improvement.</p> <p>Starving yourself and constructing rigid rules and rituals around when and how you eat is generally seen as a problem when it\u2019s teenage girls doing it; when tech bros do it, it\u2019s treated very differently. Indeed, in many ways it feels like Silicon Valley is inadvertently rebranding eating disorders.</p> <h2><strong>Do you even fast, bro?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s worth slowing down and defining \u201cfasting\u201d. As Dr Valter Longo, who is director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, and something of a rock star among the fasting community, explains to me over the phone, the word \u201cfasting\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s about as instructive as talking about \u201ceating\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Longo notes that there are four distinct approaches to fasting, \u201cwhich all have benefits and limitations\u201d. The first is alternate-day fasting. The second method is often known as the 5:2 diet and involves eating normally five days a week followed by two days where you only eat around 500 calories. Then there is time-restricted feeding, where you fast 12-18 hours a day and consume all your calories within a narrow eating window. Finally there is the Fasting Mimicking Diet\u2122, which is Longo\u2019s brainchild. This involves eating a low-calorie diet that follows a very specific carbohydrate/protein/carbs ration for five days a month, a few times a year. The specially formulated diet costs $225 a pop and, <a href=\"https://prolonfmd.com/fasting-mimicking-diet/\">according to the website</a>, \u201cprovides scientifically researched micro- and macro-nutrients in precise quantities and combinations that nourish you, but are not recognized as food by your body and therefore mimics a fasting state!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fasting 12-13 hours a day is safe but things get more complicated when you fast 16-18 hours</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Valter Longo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Longo believes that fasting, in general, can be highly beneficial. He likens it to a \u201creset\u201d mode on your body that helps eliminate damaged cells and replace them with newly regenerated ones. Various studies, he notes, have shown that \u201cfasting is as good as chemotherapy\u201d in treating cancer and there is growing evidence that fasting can help with longevity by lowering markers of aging such as cholesterol and blood pressure. (While <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27557543\">a few</a> <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/103972/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/\">studies on</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4252\">mice suggest</a> fasting may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy there remains a lot more research to be done and fasting should not be considered an alternative to chemotherapy.)</p> <p>However, while there is exciting research about the efficacy of fasting, there are also some studies that show it can have negative effects. Longo stresses that it\u2019s always important to put safety first and warns against being too extreme. For example, he says: \u201cThere is very little doubt that fasting 12-13 hours a day is safe but things get a little more complicated when you fast 16-18 hours.\u201d Clinical studies have shown this sort of extended fasting can have positive effects on metabolism but also a number of negative results, such as an increase in gallstones.</p> <p>Longo unambiguously advises against the sort of extreme three-day water-only fasts that Dorsey said he was playing with, and that seem particularly popular in Silicon Valley. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer cavemen we\u2019re not equipped to be doing extreme water-only fasting diets,\u201d Longo stresses. \u201cYour blood pressure can go very low. It\u2019s very dangerous stuff.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hacking your body</strong></h2> <p>Silicon Valley\u2019s obsession with extreme fasting overlaps with a trend for what is often termed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/21/extreme-biohacking-tech-guru-who-spent-250000-trying-to-live-for-ever-serge-faguet\">biohacking</a>\u201d; the idea that your body is a system that can be quantified and optimized.</p> <p>Geoffrey Woo, the 30-year-old CEO of Hvmn, a \u201chuman enhancement\u201d company, is an enthusiastic proponent of biohacking and grew interested in fasting as a form of self-improvement. \u201cThe way I think about consumption, you\u2019re taking inputs into your digestive system for survival and optimizing for performance outcomes,\u201d he explains to me. \u201cFasting is a deliberate thoughtful pause in consuming anything except water. A lack of input is still a signal.\u201d</p> <p>Woo and his colleagues started off by doing 60-hour fasts and measuring the effects of these on their body in minute detail. \u201cWhen I do aggressive experiments I have an implant that tracks glucose continuously for a couple weeks,\u201d Woo says, and \u201cI may do quarterly blood panels for things like lipids and C-reactive proteins\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/29/flat-tummy-instagram-women-appetite-suppressant-lollipops\">How Flat Tummy Co gamed Instagram to sell women the unattainable ideal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having experimented with fasting for a while, Woo now has a regular routine: he does an 18-hour fast daily, and does a 24- or 36-hour fast one to two days a week. \u201cI know it can come across robotic and complicated,\u201d he acknowledges, \u201cbut eating three meals a day could also come across as complicated if you\u2019re not used to it.\u201d Woo also acknowledges that there may be a risk with fasting going too far but says \u201cthere\u2019s a risk element with any behavior\u201d. There\u2019s even a risk element with the current western diet, he says, which he thinks \u201cshould be considered disordered eating\u201d. He notes that one-third of Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic and there are soaring obesity rates. \u201cThat\u2019s the most compelling data on what\u2019s disordered or not.\u201d</p> <p>Justin Rezvani, a 30-year-old tech entrepreneur based in LA has similar views. He started getting into fasting a year ago; he had just sold his social media business for a lot of money but was overweight and unhappy with his life. Like Woo, he took a systematic approach to changing his life. Every week he does a \u201cfive-day water-only fasting protocol\u201d and uses a variety of machines, including a glucose-tracking implant, to measure his metabolic markers. He has lost 60lbs from fasting and believes it has improved every aspect of his life.</p> <h2><strong>Innovation or anorexia 2.0?</strong></h2> <p>Dr Tiffany Brown, a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego Eating Disorders Center, told me over the phone that it can be difficult to make generalizations about when fasting behaviors and self-monitoring start to cross a line and become a problem. However, even if fasting diets may work for some individuals, Brown is worried about the extent to which it is treated as a \u201ctrend\u201d and framed in a largely positive light.</p> <p>The fact that we\u2019re not all immediately describing Silicon Valley-style extreme fasting as a form of anorexia also says a lot about the gender dynamics around food and eating disorders. Anorexia is still very much associated with women and Brown notes that \u201cpeople still have a difficult time recognizing similar behavior in men as problematic\u201d. In her work with the <a href=\"https://namedinc.org/\">National Association for Males with Eating Disorders</a> Brown has met a number of men who said their friends, family and even medical providers, haven\u2019t recognized their behavior as problematic, even when they look physically malnourished.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dr Tiffany Brown is worried about the extent to which it is treated as a \u2018trend\u2019 and framed in a largely positive light</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t to say that women don\u2019t fast: a<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/opi/surveys/results#/survey/c6480431-375b-11e8-8a11-c5d608466ac5/question/182547d9-375e-11e8-8aaa-cfadb0ba4fab/gender\"> recent YouGov study</a> found that 62% of men and 60% of women say they have fasted, up from 56% of men and 55% of women who said they had fasted in 2016. However, the most vocal proponents of the fasting movement seem to be men. Silicon Valley has also developed a pseudo-intellectual vocabulary that distances it from dieting\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d connotation. Tech types don\u2019t diet, you see, they undertake \u201cfasting protocols\u201d. They don\u2019t count calories, they quantify a range of metabolic markers with complex expensive scientific equipment. They don\u2019t lose weight, they \u201coptimize\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Eating is so last season; these days all the cool kids fast. Fasting diets have rocketed in popularity over the last few years, garnering a number of high-profile fans. Like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, who tweeted last month that he had \u201cbeen playing with fasting for some time\u201d. Dorsey explained that he does \u201ca 22 hour fast daily (dinner only), and recently did a 3 day water fast\u201d. The billionaire added that the biggest thing he had noticed after depriving himself of food was \u201chow much time slows down. The day feels so much longer when not broken up by breakfast/lunch/dinner. Any one [sic] else have this experience?\u201d I have! I\u2019ve had lots of experience with the various side effects of fasting because I did it a ton as a teenager: it was called \u201canorexia\u201d. And it wasn\u2019t fun. It wrecked my health and took me years to recover. Fasting, of course, is not synonymous with anorexia. Nor is it necessarily problematic. However, as Dr Allison Chase, an eating disorder specialist, tells me over email, \u201cany eating behaviors that involve restriction or rigid rules is concerning\u201d and can be a precursor to diagnosable eating disorders. Also concerning is the way these behaviors are glamorized, particularly in Silicon Valley, where a number of high-profile tech execs extol the transformative power of extreme fasting. Meanwhile the compulsive measuring behaviors associated with eating disorders, including obsessively tracking your calorie intake and exercise, have been normalized by fitness tracking apps and the Silicon Valley ethos that constant self-examination leads to self-improvement. Starving yourself and constructing rigid rules and rituals around when and how you eat is generally seen as a problem when it\u2019s teenage girls doing it; when tech bros do it, it\u2019s treated very differently. Indeed, in many ways it feels like Silicon Valley is inadvertently rebranding eating disorders. Do you even fast, bro? It\u2019s worth slowing down and defining \u201cfasting\u201d. As Dr Valter Longo, who is director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, and something of a rock star among the fasting community, explains to me over the phone, the word \u201cfasting\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s about as instructive as talking about \u201ceating\u201d, he says. Longo notes that there are four distinct approaches to fasting, \u201cwhich all have benefits and limitations\u201d. The first is alternate-day fasting. The second method is often known as the 5:2 diet and involves eating normally five days a week followed by two days where you only eat around 500 calories. Then there is time-restricted feeding, where you fast 12-18 hours a day and consume all your calories within a narrow eating window. Finally there is the Fasting Mimicking Diet\u2122, which is Longo\u2019s brainchild. This involves eating a low-calorie diet that follows a very specific carbohydrate/protein/carbs ration for five days a month, a few times a year. The specially formulated diet costs $225 a pop and, according to the website, \u201cprovides scientifically researched micro- and macro-nutrients in precise quantities and combinations that nourish you, but are not recognized as food by your body and therefore mimics a fasting state!\u201d Longo believes that fasting, in general, can be highly beneficial. He likens it to a \u201creset\u201d mode on your body that helps eliminate damaged cells and replace them with newly regenerated ones. Various studies, he notes, have shown that \u201cfasting is as good as chemotherapy\u201d in treating cancer and there is growing evidence that fasting can help with longevity by lowering markers of aging such as cholesterol and blood pressure. (While a few studies on mice suggest fasting may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy there remains a lot more research to be done and fasting should not be considered an alternative to chemotherapy.) However, while there is exciting research about the efficacy of fasting, there are also some studies that show it can have negative effects. Longo stresses that it\u2019s always important to put safety first and warns against being too extreme. For example, he says: \u201cThere is very little doubt that fasting 12-13 hours a day is safe but things get a little more complicated when you fast 16-18 hours.\u201d Clinical studies have shown this sort of extended fasting can have positive effects on metabolism but also a number of negative results, such as an increase in gallstones. Longo unambiguously advises against the sort of extreme three-day water-only fasts that Dorsey said he was playing with, and that seem particularly popular in Silicon Valley. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer cavemen we\u2019re not equipped to be doing extreme water-only fasting diets,\u201d Longo stresses. \u201cYour blood pressure can go very low. It\u2019s very dangerous stuff.\u201d Hacking your body Silicon Valley\u2019s obsession with extreme fasting overlaps with a trend for what is often termed \u201cbiohacking\u201d; the idea that your body is a system that can be quantified and optimized. Geoffrey Woo, the 30-year-old CEO of Hvmn, a \u201chuman enhancement\u201d company, is an enthusiastic proponent of biohacking and grew interested in fasting as a form of self-improvement. \u201cThe way I think about consumption, you\u2019re taking inputs into your digestive system for survival and optimizing for performance outcomes,\u201d he explains to me. \u201cFasting is a deliberate thoughtful pause in consuming anything except water. A lack of input is still a signal.\u201d Woo and his colleagues started off by doing 60-hour fasts and measuring the effects of these on their body in minute detail. \u201cWhen I do aggressive experiments I have an implant that tracks glucose continuously for a couple weeks,\u201d Woo says, and \u201cI may do quarterly blood panels for things like lipids and C-reactive proteins\u201d. Having experimented with fasting for a while, Woo now has a regular routine: he does an 18-hour fast daily, and does a 24- or 36-hour fast one to two days a week. \u201cI know it can come across robotic and complicated,\u201d he acknowledges, \u201cbut eating three meals a day could also come across as complicated if you\u2019re not used to it.\u201d Woo also acknowledges that there may be a risk with fasting going too far but says \u201cthere\u2019s a risk element with any behavior\u201d. There\u2019s even a risk element with the current western diet, he says, which he thinks \u201cshould be considered disordered eating\u201d. He notes that one-third of Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic and there are soaring obesity rates. \u201cThat\u2019s the most compelling data on what\u2019s disordered or not.\u201d Justin Rezvani, a 30-year-old tech entrepreneur based in LA has similar views. He started getting into fasting a year ago; he had just sold his social media business for a lot of money but was overweight and unhappy with his life. Like Woo, he took a systematic approach to changing his life. Every week he does a \u201cfive-day water-only fasting protocol\u201d and uses a variety of machines, including a glucose-tracking implant, to measure his metabolic markers. He has lost 60lbs from fasting and believes it has improved every aspect of his life. Innovation or anorexia 2.0? Dr Tiffany Brown, a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego Eating Disorders Center, told me over the phone that it can be difficult to make generalizations about when fasting behaviors and self-monitoring start to cross a line and become a problem. However, even if fasting diets may work for some individuals, Brown is worried about the extent to which it is treated as a \u201ctrend\u201d and framed in a largely positive light. The fact that we\u2019re not all immediately describing Silicon Valley-style extreme fasting as a form of anorexia also says a lot about the gender dynamics around food and eating disorders. Anorexia is still very much associated with women and Brown notes that \u201cpeople still have a difficult time recognizing similar behavior in men as problematic\u201d. In her work with the National Association for Males with Eating Disorders Brown has met a number of men who said their friends, family and even medical providers, haven\u2019t recognized their behavior as problematic, even when they look physically malnourished. This isn\u2019t to say that women don\u2019t fast: a recent YouGov study found that 62% of men and 60% of women say they have fasted, up from 56% of men and 55% of women who said they had fasted in 2016. However, the most vocal proponents of the fasting movement seem to be men. Silicon Valley has also developed a pseudo-intellectual vocabulary that distances it from dieting\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d connotation. Tech types don\u2019t diet, you see, they undertake \u201cfasting protocols\u201d. They don\u2019t count calories, they quantify a range of metabolic markers with complex expensive scientific equipment. They don\u2019t lose weight, they \u201coptimize\u201d. Rather than focusing on weight loss as a goal, they seem more likely to talk about improving their physical and mental performance. Of course, drastically cutting calories in pursuit of a clear mind is not any safer than fasting in pursuit of a small waist. You can rebrand disordered eating, but you can\u2019t remove its dangers. Longo worries that the \u201cincrease in irrational exuberance\u201d around fasting in Silicon Valley may get gravely out of control, particularly with high-profile influencers like Dorsey publicly musing about potentially dangerous fasting experiments. \u201cThere needs to be more accountability,\u201d Longo stresses. \u201cOr this will all end up with lawsuits.\u201d In the US, the National Eating Disorders Association helpline number is 1-800-931-2237.

      "bodyText": "The owner of British Gas, Centrica, lost about three-quarters of a million customers last year and warned it will take a \u00a3300m hit from the government\u2019s price cap on energy bills. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest energy company dropped more than 10% after the company lowered its cashflow outlook for 2019, leading investors to fear Centrica\u2019s dividend could be cut. Iain Conn, the chief executive, said the group faced a \u201chuge number of headwinds\u201d, including the price cap, reduced gasfield production and several of its nuclear power plants being offline. The company lost 742,000 of its 25 million household energy customers last year, although the figure is about half the losses in 2017. While the group\u2019s profits were up 12% in 2018 to \u00a31.39bn, its home energy unit profits fell 18% to \u00a3668m. Conn said customer numbers had remained stable in 2019 so far. He was strongly critical of the cap, which he said had been set at a level that was stopping companies investing. \u201cThe problem is it\u2019s temporary and it doesn\u2019t fix the market. We think it\u2019s the wrong intervention but obviously it\u2019s here and we\u2019ll live with it,\u201d he said. Even with energy regulator, Ofgem, lifting the cap in April, Centrica said it would lose \u00a3300m this year because of the measure. The firm has launched a legal challenge against a one-off \u00a370m portion of that \u00a3300m total. Centrica plans to cut and sell its way out of what it called a \u201cchallenging external backdrop\u201d. The firm has already cut 7,700 jobs since 2015 and plans to cut another 1,500-2,000 this year. On Thursday it announced a further \u00a3500m of cuts beyond 2019. However, the firm refused to lay out the impact on jobs because it said overheads were falling as customers moved to managing their accounts online rather than on the phone. An earlier \u00a3500m cut resulted in the loss of more than 4,000 jobs. The company said it had sold Clockwork, the US home services arm it bought in 2010, for \u00a3230m, which Conn called a \u201cgood deal\u201d. Centrica is also trying to sell its 20% stake in the UK\u2019s eight nuclear power plants but would only say the sale was progressing as planned. \u201cWe\u2019ve had expressions of interest from a number of parties,\u201d Conn said. The firm\u2019s difficulties in home energy supply, nuclear power and gas production led to it revising down its outlook for adjusted operating cashflow to \u00a31.8bn-2bn, below a previous target of \u00a32.1bn-2.3bn for 2018-2020. Conn said no decision had been made on dividends for shareholders. \u201cThe cash flow target is under some pressure and therefore people could conclude the dividend is under pressure \u2026 [but] I do not think you should automatically conclude there is a dividend cut coming.\u201d However, analysts said they would not be surprised if a dividend cut was imminent. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe dividend is starting to creak. It\u2019s been held at 12p this year but Centrica is increasingly relying on cost-cutting and disposals to prop up the payment.

You can learn about the theories, about the principles of pain and symptom control, but that\u2019s only a small element of the real experience.</p> <p>The first person I saw die was an elderly man who had no family able to visit him in hospital. I was a student nurse and knew I would see death in my career. I had no idea of the impact it would have on me, however.</p> <p>John had been struggling for weeks. His heart was failing and the healthcare team was keeping him comfortable and alleviating his symptoms. He had stopped speaking a number of days before but was still awake at times, and his smile when we spoke to him was beautiful. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/15/gp-sued-missing-devastating-diagnosis-sorry\">I'm a GP being sued for missing your devastating diagnosis. I'm so sorry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I came on to the ward one morning, the night staff said he had deteriorated overnight and had hours left to live. A trained nurse and I gave him a bedbath, shaved him and changed his sheets. And then I sat with him. </p> <p>For the next six hours I held his hand and talked to him. I held a cold cloth to his forehead. The doctor came in regularly and asked if he needed more pain relief but he seemed restful most of the time. He only occasionally opened his eyes to smile at me.</p> <p>Early in the afternoon the nurse came back in and we washed his face and combed his hair. As she was just about to leave the room, she stroked his hair and said: \u201cOh John, just let go.\u201d Minutes later, he did. </p> <p>There were physical things about death that I hadn\u2019t expected. After the doctor had confirmed his death, the nurse and I prepared his body for the mortuary. I remember touching him and finding it jarring that he was still warm. I found it strange that I was now wearing gloves to touch him, whereas only minutes before that would have seemed unthinkable.</p> <p>That night I didn\u2019t want to go back to my student flat where I would have been alone. I drove the 20 miles to my family home and spent the night with my parents.</p> <p>It has been 20 years since John\u2019s death, and I have seen many changes in my role and the roles of my colleagues. As a qualified nurse in today\u2019s NHS it is difficult to imagine being able to spend six hours with only one patient, and I was lucky to have had this experience, even as a student. </p> <p>A dying patient is always a priority and one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the compassion and care offered to them and their families. I have seen staff go far beyond the expectations of their jobs to ensure that a patient has as good a death as possible. Wondering if you could have made a family\u2019s experience any better, if you could have done more, are thoughts that keep medical professionals awake at night. Death isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve become totally used to \u2013 I\u2019ve developed ways to cope with it, seek support from others and develop the right degree of detachment. If I didn\u2019t, it would be impossible to do my job.</p> <p>It\u2019s a privilege to be with someone in their final moments. I\u2019ll never forget John. I can still see his face; I remember his dignity, his beautiful smile, and I\u2019m grateful to him. My first death wasn\u2019t dramatic or gory. I have seen more deaths than I can count since that first experience. I remember some of the other faces, but none quite as vividly as John\u2019s. He, and the professionals who were caring for him, taught me that there is such a thing as a good death.</p> <p>It matters how we treat those who are dying. And it matters how we treat their families. Even if family members can\u2019t be there, they want to know that their loved one was at peace and that they weren\u2019t alone. Having now had personal experience of death, I know that families may not remember our name but they will remember the experience, and the things we said to them.</p> <p>There are few things in my job which are more important.</p> <p><em>Names and details had been changed to protect confidentiality</em></p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/series/blood-sweat-and-tears\">Blood, sweat and tears series</a> about experiences in healthcare, read our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jul/14/healthcare-workers-tell-us-about-memorable-experience\">guidelines</a> and get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Our teachers tried teaching us about death during nursing training, but it\u2019s impossible to prepare for your first experience of it. You can learn about the theories, about the principles of pain and symptom control, but that\u2019s only a small element of the real experience. The first person I saw die was an elderly man who had no family able to visit him in hospital. I was a student nurse and knew I would see death in my career. I had no idea of the impact it would have on me, however. John had been struggling for weeks. His heart was failing and the healthcare team was keeping him comfortable and alleviating his symptoms. He had stopped speaking a number of days before but was still awake at times, and his smile when we spoke to him was beautiful. When I came on to the ward one morning, the night staff said he had deteriorated overnight and had hours left to live. A trained nurse and I gave him a bedbath, shaved him and changed his sheets. And then I sat with him. For the next six hours I held his hand and talked to him. I held a cold cloth to his forehead. The doctor came in regularly and asked if he needed more pain relief but he seemed restful most of the time. He only occasionally opened his eyes to smile at me. Early in the afternoon the nurse came back in and we washed his face and combed his hair. As she was just about to leave the room, she stroked his hair and said: \u201cOh John, just let go.\u201d Minutes later, he did. There were physical things about death that I hadn\u2019t expected. After the doctor had confirmed his death, the nurse and I prepared his body for the mortuary. I remember touching him and finding it jarring that he was still warm. I found it strange that I was now wearing gloves to touch him, whereas only minutes before that would have seemed unthinkable. That night I didn\u2019t want to go back to my student flat where I would have been alone. I drove the 20 miles to my family home and spent the night with my parents. It has been 20 years since John\u2019s death, and I have seen many changes in my role and the roles of my colleagues. As a qualified nurse in today\u2019s NHS it is difficult to imagine being able to spend six hours with only one patient, and I was lucky to have had this experience, even as a student. A dying patient is always a priority and one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the compassion and care offered to them and their families. I have seen staff go far beyond the expectations of their jobs to ensure that a patient has as good a death as possible. Wondering if you could have made a family\u2019s experience any better, if you could have done more, are thoughts that keep medical professionals awake at night. Death isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve become totally used to \u2013 I\u2019ve developed ways to cope with it, seek support from others and develop the right degree of detachment. If I didn\u2019t, it would be impossible to do my job. It\u2019s a privilege to be with someone in their final moments. I\u2019ll never forget John. I can still see his face; I remember his dignity, his beautiful smile, and I\u2019m grateful to him. My first death wasn\u2019t dramatic or gory. I have seen more deaths than I can count since that first experience. I remember some of the other faces, but none quite as vividly as John\u2019s. He, and the professionals who were caring for him, taught me that there is such a thing as a good death. It matters how we treat those who are dying. And it matters how we treat their families. Even if family members can\u2019t be there, they want to know that their loved one was at peace and that they weren\u2019t alone. Having now had personal experience of death, I know that families may not remember our name but they will remember the experience, and the things we said to them. There are few things in my job which are more important.

      "bodyText": "It took me a while to get round to watching Bohemian Rhapsody. After all, I\u2019d read the reviews. Our own Steve Rose said that the story \u201cskirts dangerously close to Spinal Tap territory\u201d \u2013 only without the laughs. AO Scott in the New York Times wrote that \u201cthe film seems engineered to be as unmemorable as possible, with the exception of the prosthetic teeth worn by Rami Malek.\u201d And there was the film\u2019s moralising stance on Freddie Mercury\u2019s sexuality. As Alexis Petridis put it: \u201cIt seems to view the fact that he was gay as little short of a tragedy.\u201d Then the film was unleashed on an unsuspecting public \u2013 and became a smash hit. At time of writing, it has taken $844m (\u00a3645.5m, twice as much as A Star Is Born), astonishingly making it the highest grossing drama ever. My mum and dad went to see it and thought it was brilliant. A friend with usually impeccable taste also told me it was a hoot. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it really homophobic?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, but even that didn\u2019t entirely detract from his, or his boyfriend\u2019s, viewing pleasure. So did the critics \u2013 but not the Academy \u2013 get it horribly wrong? Er, no. Like the song from which it takes its name, Bohemian Rhapsody is basically terrible, but in a bombastically entertaining way. One element deserves unequivocal praise \u2013 Rami Malek, who as Mercury manages to act his leotard off through the most outlandish fake choppers since Christopher Lee played Dracula (\u201cI have four extra incisors,\u201d he informs Queen, after they\u2019ve hooted \u201cNot with those teeth!\u201d at his request to join them as their singer).

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m lost on an industrial estate in Acton, west London, looking for Russell Maliphant. There\u2019s an anonymous door, behind it a dusty workshop, then another door. I push through to find a dark, cocoon-like studio with the hushed atmosphere of intense creation. The bodies of five dancers are blurred by ripples of light projected over them. Maliphant sits in front, monk-like in his focus.</p> <p>The seamless spirals of the movement are instantly recognisable as the serious, soft-spoken choreographer\u2019s work. His mesmerising pieces, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/16/sylvie-guillem-russell-maliphant-how-we-made-push\">Push</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/29/russell-maliphant-sadlers-wells\">AfterLight</a>, have won many prizes \u2013 Maliphant picked up the best independent company trophy at this month\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.criticscircle.org.uk/the-dance-awards/\">National Dance awards</a> \u2013 but his presence in the dance world is not as loud as some of Britain\u2019s other major players.</p> <p>However, this year, Maliphant has a rush of projects coming to the stage and screen: Silent Lines, the piece being created in this Acton studio with video artist <a href=\"http://www.panagiotistomaras.com/\">Panagiotis Tomaras</a>; The Thread, with Greek composer Vangelis; a piece for Lyon Opera Ballet; a film of A Christmas Carol; and plans to dance again with his wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/06/dana-fouras-russell-maliphant-conceal-reveal\">Dana Fouras</a>, after the success of a duet they performed last year. Plus, a raft of new dancers and a new status as company in residence at DanceEast, Ipswich. But Maliphant is bemused by the suggestion he might be having a creative renaissance. \u201cNo, I just keep chipping away all the time,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35ce064a1f6d204b2698485174cc11518bf012d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ce064a1f6d204b2698485174cc11518bf012d7/200_179_4362_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Thread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A strong communal experience\u2019 \u2026 The Thread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Bournias</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Key to understanding Maliphant\u2019s style is that it\u2019s all about flow. Having originally trained at the <a href=\"https://www.royalballetschool.org.uk/\">Royal Ballet School</a>, Maliphant studied <a href=\"https://www.rolfinguk.co.uk/\">Rolfing</a>, which focuses on manipulating the body\u2019s connective tissue, or fascia, through massage. His choreography now falls somewhere between dance and bodywork \u2013 the umbrella term for practices like yoga, pilates and the Alexander technique \u2013 and you won\u2019t find another choreographer who can talk in such detail about anatomy. It\u2019s part of Maliphant\u2019s quest for a certain quality of movement. \u201cI think the body moves well when there is freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cFreedom around the joints, freedom of articulation, space within the body; movement travelling through the body like a sound wave passing through the air.\u201d The result is dance as a pure energetic force, like watching a river run or a waterfall.</p> <p>Abstraction is what Maliphant is known for (\u201cI would rather do a Jackson Pollock than try and paint a scene\u201d) but he\u2019s had his head turned recently by the idea of narrative. First, when working on last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/25/rudolph-nureyev-ballet-triumph-tragedy\">documentary Nureyev</a>, and now, by the forthcoming film <a href=\"http://film.britishcouncil.org/a-christmas-carol1\">A Christmas Carol</a>, where the story is told in dance, with voiceover by a cast including Andy Serkis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan\">Carey Mulligan</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s all dance,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat they do on stage you\u2019re not going to see in a Christmas Carol play. Some of the visuals, with the lighting, take things out of the ordinary \u2026 I actually really enjoyed putting my mind to the possibilities of those characters, how they might be represented in movement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ee1ee9f57a042d3a71be8a71348f6207d59c27f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ee1ee9f57a042d3a71be8a71348f6207d59c27f/0_14_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I just keep chipping away\u2019 \u2026 Russell Maliphant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I just keep chipping away\u2019 \u2026 Russell Maliphant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panayiotis Sinnos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maliphant admits it\u2019s the last thing you would expect him to do, but he enjoyed being pushed into new territory. \u201cIt can be beneficial to be thrown in the deep end,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are things I did at the beginning of my career that I would be much too afraid to do now, and that\u2019s terrible. Like making a piece in a week. If someone said to me now, you\u2019ve got a week to make a 15-minute piece, I\u2019d say, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t shirk a challenge though. For example: The Thread, which blends traditional Greek and contemporary dance, with music by film composer Vangelis and costumes by fashion designer Mary Katrantzou. When asked to create the show, Maliphant\u2019s knowledge of Greek dance was minimal \u2013 \u201climited to Zorba the Greek\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s since had a crash course. \u201cThe stepping patterns \u2013 of which there are infinite amounts \u2013 are a lot harder than they look,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very social dance. When you have your arms wrapped around each other in a circle, it\u2019s a strong communal experience.\u201d</p> <p>Vangelis, in his 70s and not very mobile, was unable to go to rehearsals, so Maliphant would take videos of the dancers to him at his apartment. \u201cIt was a very satisfying experience,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very knowledgeable about music, all music.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m lost on an industrial estate in Acton, west London, looking for Russell Maliphant. There\u2019s an anonymous door, behind it a dusty workshop, then another door. I push through to find a dark, cocoon-like studio with the hushed atmosphere of intense creation. The bodies of five dancers are blurred by ripples of light projected over them. Maliphant sits in front, monk-like in his focus. The seamless spirals of the movement are instantly recognisable as the serious, soft-spoken choreographer\u2019s work. His mesmerising pieces, including Push and AfterLight, have won many prizes \u2013 Maliphant picked up the best independent company trophy at this month\u2019s National Dance awards \u2013 but his presence in the dance world is not as loud as some of Britain\u2019s other major players. However, this year, Maliphant has a rush of projects coming to the stage and screen: Silent Lines, the piece being created in this Acton studio with video artist Panagiotis Tomaras; The Thread, with Greek composer Vangelis; a piece for Lyon Opera Ballet; a film of A Christmas Carol; and plans to dance again with his wife, Dana Fouras, after the success of a duet they performed last year. Plus, a raft of new dancers and a new status as company in residence at DanceEast, Ipswich. But Maliphant is bemused by the suggestion he might be having a creative renaissance. \u201cNo, I just keep chipping away all the time,\u201d he says. Key to understanding Maliphant\u2019s style is that it\u2019s all about flow. Having originally trained at the Royal Ballet School, Maliphant studied Rolfing, which focuses on manipulating the body\u2019s connective tissue, or fascia, through massage. His choreography now falls somewhere between dance and bodywork \u2013 the umbrella term for practices like yoga, pilates and the Alexander technique \u2013 and you won\u2019t find another choreographer who can talk in such detail about anatomy. It\u2019s part of Maliphant\u2019s quest for a certain quality of movement. \u201cI think the body moves well when there is freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cFreedom around the joints, freedom of articulation, space within the body; movement travelling through the body like a sound wave passing through the air.\u201d The result is dance as a pure energetic force, like watching a river run or a waterfall. Abstraction is what Maliphant is known for (\u201cI would rather do a Jackson Pollock than try and paint a scene\u201d) but he\u2019s had his head turned recently by the idea of narrative. First, when working on last year\u2019s documentary Nureyev, and now, by the forthcoming film A Christmas Carol, where the story is told in dance, with voiceover by a cast including Andy Serkis and Carey Mulligan. \u201cIt\u2019s all dance,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat they do on stage you\u2019re not going to see in a Christmas Carol play. Some of the visuals, with the lighting, take things out of the ordinary \u2026 I actually really enjoyed putting my mind to the possibilities of those characters, how they might be represented in movement.\u201d Maliphant admits it\u2019s the last thing you would expect him to do, but he enjoyed being pushed into new territory. \u201cIt can be beneficial to be thrown in the deep end,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are things I did at the beginning of my career that I would be much too afraid to do now, and that\u2019s terrible. Like making a piece in a week. If someone said to me now, you\u2019ve got a week to make a 15-minute piece, I\u2019d say, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d He doesn\u2019t shirk a challenge though. For example: The Thread, which blends traditional Greek and contemporary dance, with music by film composer Vangelis and costumes by fashion designer Mary Katrantzou. When asked to create the show, Maliphant\u2019s knowledge of Greek dance was minimal \u2013 \u201climited to Zorba the Greek\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s since had a crash course. \u201cThe stepping patterns \u2013 of which there are infinite amounts \u2013 are a lot harder than they look,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very social dance. When you have your arms wrapped around each other in a circle, it\u2019s a strong communal experience.\u201d Vangelis, in his 70s and not very mobile, was unable to go to rehearsals, so Maliphant would take videos of the dancers to him at his apartment. \u201cIt was a very satisfying experience,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very knowledgeable about music, all music. And I love what he\u2019s done with the Greek music, taking traditional instrumentation or phrases and manipulating them. The energy and dynamics of some of the traditional music is incredible,\u201d says Maliphant. \u201cAlmost like techno in its repetition and driving energy. It\u2019s very surprising,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Chariots of Fire.\u201d At 57, Maliphant himself is still dancing, and has made works for other older dancers, including 55-year-old Italian prima ballerina Alessandra Ferri, who recently admitted she can\u2019t jump any more. Maliphant sees no disadvantage. \u201cThere is a special language in everyone\u2019s idiosyncrasies,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know the way you can spot someone\u2019s walk a mile off, you know who it is even if you can\u2019t see their face? I like to notice that and work with it.\u201d Maliphant has had his own problems with injuries \u2013 four knee surgeries and a plate in his left leg that sets off security alarms at airports. Is his holistic approach to the body the reason he\u2019s still able to dance? \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m lucky or stubborn, or disciplined or opportunistic,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m just happy to keep going. Every morning I have the pleasure to dance with people who are inspiring, and you know,\u201d he says, with typical understatement, \u201cIt\u2019s a nice thing to do.\u201d The Thread is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 15-17 March. Silent Lines is at DanceEast, Ipswich, 5-6 April. Then touring.",

In his email, Carstensen said in early 2017, Burnes had allegedly told him that \u201chis long-term friend Mr Hockey\u201d had been frustrated with his travel arrangements because they were \u201cunprofessional\u201d and had \u201climited hours of operations\u201d. Carstensen said he emailed Hockey via his government email address, telling him Burnes had told him to meet the ambassador. Afterwards, he returned to Australia and debriefed Burnes. \u201cI advised him that the embassy business would have to go to tender but there was a [sic] excellent opportunity to get that business, especially that wanted [sic] and to hub the Americas travel out of Washington as discussed,\u201d Carstensen wrote. \u201cAt the time Helloworld was looking at buying a corporate business in the USA, one based in the Washington area. I told Mr Hockey this.\u201d Carstensen emailed Hockey when he returned to Australia and gave him corporate travel options \u201cin detail\u201d. \u201cI assume these details could have been used at a basis of the tender requirements if a tender came up,\u201d he wrote. When he advised the WoAG travel team that he met Hockey, \u201cthe feedback from the WoAG travel team was that they were uncomfortable with the meeting\u201d. \u201cI decided then that I would not follow up with Mr Hockey. I was advised later in a conversation that \u2018people\u2019 in Dfat were uncomfortable that Mr Hockey met me and that he was a shareholder of Helloworld,\u201d Carstensen wrote. \u201cIf I remember correctly I did not know at the time of the meeting in Washington that he was a shareholder.\u201d In 2014, Cormann announced QBT as the new whole-of-government travel manager for the next four years, with responsibility for $2.1bn worth of travel expected over that period. In his statement, Cormann said QBT Pty Ltd was awarded the contract after a competitive tendering process conducted by the Department of Finance. He said replacing the current panel arrangement with a single provider would reduce the cost of administration, but it caused controversy at the time over the potential loss of travel credits already accrued by government. Birmingham defended the decision, saying QBT was first appointed under the previous Labor government. \u201cThey won a contract renewal under us, but first a contract under the previous government,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cIt went through a proper public procurement process, handled by the public servants who run these processes, and they managed to win the contract again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>He may not be the most reviled man in US sports just yet, but Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer seems hell-bent on earning the title. The 28-year-old has been irritating opponents, fans and even his own teammates for years, which makes it all the more amusing that the most recent headlines he\u2019s made have involved him complaining about his own well-deserved bad reputation.</p> <p>Few can quibble with Bauer\u2019s production on the field: he\u2019s an All-Star starting pitcher who went 12-2 last year for the Indians with a 2.21 ERA. He also likes to portray himself as an iconoclastic rebel, <a href=\"https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/02/19/trevor-bauer-is-brutally-honest-sometimes-just-brutal/\">the last honest man</a>. \u201cI\u2019m good at two things in this world,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/02/19/trevor-bauer-cleveland-indians-training-tools-twitter-controversy-cy-young\">he said</a> in a recent Sports Illustrated profile, \u201cthrowing baseballs and pissing people off.\u201d The story also goes into detail about his unconventional training methods, which include pumping electricity into his brain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/21/zion-shoe-duke-north-carolina-nike\">Zion Williamson felled by faulty Nike as North Carolina blasts top-ranked Duke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As one would imagine, given said methods alone, Bauer has increasingly found himself at odds with those within baseball, most recently with his own team. Last week, he emerged victorious from his salary arbitration hearing with the Indians with a chip on his shoulder. \u201cThey spent the last 10 minutes of the case trying a character assassination,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/indians-trevor-bauer-wins-arbitration-hearing-says-it-turned-into-character-assassination/\">told the media</a> after being awarded the $13m his side was seeking. \u201cThe intent behind it, that I would characterize, was to demean my character.\u201d</p> <p>If that were true, they would have plenty of ammunition. After all, Bauer is most (in)famous for the time he risked Cleveland\u2019s playoff chances in the 2016 American League Championship Series after injuring his pitching hand while <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/trevor-bauer-drone-injury-finger-tweet-trade-rumors-indians-photo-mlb\">playing with a drone</a>. He had to leave Game 3 start after his stitches came apart in the first inning, although he was later healthy enough to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/cubs-indians-world-series-game-two\">pitch admirably</a> in a Game 2 loss to the Chicago Cubs in that year\u2019s World Series.</p> <p>That incident probably didn\u2019t help Bauer\u2019s reputation as a poor teammate, something which dates back to his time with the Arizona. Diamondbacks catcher Miguel Montero <a href=\"http://arizonasports.com/story/26803/montero-on-trevor-bauer-he-never-wanted-to-listen/\">said</a> that Bauer rubbed people the wrong way and his <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/sports/articles/20121020honeymoon-has-ended-arizona-diamondbacks-kirk-gibson.html\">conflicts with management</a> eventually factored into his trade to Cleveland. After he left Arizona, Bauer <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/14/trevor-bauer-diss-track-miguel-montero-consummate-4sight/1919365/\">released a (thankfully deleted) rap song</a> attacking the organization. Besides the Diamondback, he\u2019s also ramped up a personal feud with the Houston Astros, whom he has <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/trevor-bauer-astros-engage-in-twitter-spat/c-274727868\">accused of cheating</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s unlikely that these incidents were the Indians\u2019 main \u201ccharacter\u201d concerns regarding their ace. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/1096090418327052288\">ESPN\u2019s Buster Olney</a>, the biggest sticking point for the Indians was Bauer\u2019s use of social media, which has come into sharp focus over the last few months for all the wrong reasons. To get a sense of how he conducts himself, it\u2019s helpful to know that his Twitter handle is the all-so-self-aware @BauerOutage. He has earned plenty of attention thanks to his skepticism about <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2017/02/10/trevor-bauer-flipped-out-on-twitter-again-defending-donald-trump-and-denying-humans-role-in-climate-change\">climate change</a>, his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baueroutage/status/1081973126408351746?lang=en\">bigoted jokes</a> and the occasional <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/trevor-bauer-had-a-rough-start-and-then-went-on-a-twitt-1819311300\">blocking spree</a>.</p> <p>Bauer, of course, has the right to present the worst version of himself online \u2013 something he has in common with many Americans. It\u2019s quite another thing to go on a <a href=\"https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/01/09/indians-mlb-need-to-take-trevor-bauers-harassing-tweets-seriously/\">targeted harassment campaign</a>, which is exactly what Bauer did last month when a female Astros fan had the audacity to call him \u201cmy new least favorite in all of sports\u201d. Bauer claimed the fan\u2019s comments were tantamount to bullying, and sent a nonstop barrage of messages to her for <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/trevor-bauer-has-been-harassing-a-woman-for-more-than-a-1831545503\">over a day</a>, all while exposing her to a healthy percentage of his 134,000 followers. Some of them also joined in the dogpile, eventually forcing the fan offline.</p> <p>In total, Bauer tagged the user <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/01/09/indians-trevor-bauer-college-student-twitter-exchange-harassment\">over 80 times</a> in his subsequent tweets. If this all seems familiar, it\u2019s because It\u2019s the standard operating procedure of a particularly single-minded Twitter troll, albeit one with the follower count of a high-profile pro athlete. Because of his actions, the affair escalated from a rude exchange into something that bordered on cyberstalking of his part. When it became serious enough that it attracted news coverage, Bauer leveled criticism at the media for not saying anything to his face.

      "bodyText": "He may not be the most reviled man in US sports just yet, but Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer seems hell-bent on earning the title. The 28-year-old has been irritating opponents, fans and even his own teammates for years, which makes it all the more amusing that the most recent headlines he\u2019s made have involved him complaining about his own well-deserved bad reputation. Few can quibble with Bauer\u2019s production on the field: he\u2019s an All-Star starting pitcher who went 12-2 last year for the Indians with a 2.21 ERA. He also likes to portray himself as an iconoclastic rebel, the last honest man. \u201cI\u2019m good at two things in this world,\u201d he said in a recent Sports Illustrated profile, \u201cthrowing baseballs and pissing people off.\u201d The story also goes into detail about his unconventional training methods, which include pumping electricity into his brain. As one would imagine, given said methods alone, Bauer has increasingly found himself at odds with those within baseball, most recently with his own team. Last week, he emerged victorious from his salary arbitration hearing with the Indians with a chip on his shoulder. \u201cThey spent the last 10 minutes of the case trying a character assassination,\u201d he told the media after being awarded the $13m his side was seeking. \u201cThe intent behind it, that I would characterize, was to demean my character.\u201d If that were true, they would have plenty of ammunition. After all, Bauer is most (in)famous for the time he risked Cleveland\u2019s playoff chances in the 2016 American League Championship Series after injuring his pitching hand while playing with a drone. He had to leave Game 3 start after his stitches came apart in the first inning, although he was later healthy enough to pitch admirably in a Game 2 loss to the Chicago Cubs in that year\u2019s World Series. That incident probably didn\u2019t help Bauer\u2019s reputation as a poor teammate, something which dates back to his time with the Arizona. Diamondbacks catcher Miguel Montero said that Bauer rubbed people the wrong way and his conflicts with management eventually factored into his trade to Cleveland. After he left Arizona, Bauer released a (thankfully deleted) rap song attacking the organization. Besides the Diamondback, he\u2019s also ramped up a personal feud with the Houston Astros, whom he has accused of cheating. It\u2019s unlikely that these incidents were the Indians\u2019 main \u201ccharacter\u201d concerns regarding their ace. According to ESPN\u2019s Buster Olney, the biggest sticking point for the Indians was Bauer\u2019s use of social media, which has come into sharp focus over the last few months for all the wrong reasons. To get a sense of how he conducts himself, it\u2019s helpful to know that his Twitter handle is the all-so-self-aware @BauerOutage. He has earned plenty of attention thanks to his skepticism about climate change, his bigoted jokes and the occasional blocking spree. Bauer, of course, has the right to present the worst version of himself online \u2013 something he has in common with many Americans. It\u2019s quite another thing to go on a targeted harassment campaign, which is exactly what Bauer did last month when a female Astros fan had the audacity to call him \u201cmy new least favorite in all of sports\u201d. Bauer claimed the fan\u2019s comments were tantamount to bullying, and sent a nonstop barrage of messages to her for over a day, all while exposing her to a healthy percentage of his 134,000 followers. Some of them also joined in the dogpile, eventually forcing the fan offline. In total, Bauer tagged the user over 80 times in his subsequent tweets. If this all seems familiar, it\u2019s because It\u2019s the standard operating procedure of a particularly single-minded Twitter troll, albeit one with the follower count of a high-profile pro athlete. Because of his actions, the affair escalated from a rude exchange into something that bordered on cyberstalking of his part. When it became serious enough that it attracted news coverage, Bauer leveled criticism at the media for not saying anything to his face. When some of those reporters did attempt to bring up his social media meltdown in person, he, of course, promptly scampered off. #BeBest, indeed. After almost certainly being chastised by the Indians behind closed doors, Bauer released something which vaguely resembled an apology in structure (if not necessarily content) along with a promise that he would try to use Twitter more responsibly in the future. The team apparently declined to punish him, but kept it in their back pocket and attempted to bring it up as a reason to pay him less money next season. If this is indeed what happened, it\u2019s not surprising that the independent arbitrator wasn\u2019t entirely sold on the Indians\u2019 position in the matter. Let us make no mistake here, however: by no means is Bauer the victim here.

I think it\u2019s the best way to grow.\u201d The designer has hit his stride recently. Last June, for his men\u2019s spring/summer 19 collection, he had his audience balance on precarious rubber exercise balls in a cavernous late 50s brutalist car park. I tell him it was a hoot. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to recreate a sort of potential gym and the balls were to underline the idea of movement.\u201d This left-of-centre, playful thought process has ensured Risso\u2019s Marni has had bite, with menswear coming out of womenswear\u2019s shadow and offering a strong fashion viewpoint that appeals to those beyond the established arty Marni man and courts new customers.</p> <p>His take on sportswear this season, then, was never going to be about quad stretches and treadmills. Having discovered images of 30s athletes, Risso says, \u201cI was attracted by the sense of elegance that many of the sports of that time had \u2013 tennis suits or cricket suits or baseball \u2013 and I wanted to mix it up all together.\u201d Cue grungy colourful sporty layers with swingy cropped sweat pants, loose printed pieces featuring bodies created by German artist <a href=\"http://showstudio.com/contributor/florian_hetz\" title=\"\">Florian Hetz</a> and American painter <a href=\"https://betsypodlach.com/\" title=\"\">Betsy Podlach</a> or oversized bomber jackets featuring the likes of 90s rave daisies spliced with utilitarian brown nylon. Put together, it all felt a bit wonky \u2013 a perspective enhanced, of course, by sitting on an exercise ball. \u201cI do like men more messed up than uptight,\u201d Risso says of the underlying grunginess in his menswear. \u201cOne of the things I think I do is introduce elements that are unsettling. But that\u2019s where I get excited.\u201d</p> <p>Working with casting directors <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/midlandagency/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Walter Pearce and Rachel Chandler</a>, Risso is keen to make his work for Marni feel diverse. He has used older models in previous shows, while for this men\u2019s runway he wanted a mix of body types: \u201cLovingly imperfect characters, rounded bodies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/egon-schiele\" title=\"\">Egon Schiele</a> bodies.\u201d He used a similar mix of models and characters in his women\u2019s spring/summer 19 show, and the autumn/winter 18 ad campaign featured real families in Nevada. \u201cMaybe a few seasons ago we had more traditional castings, but I definitely don\u2019t want to go back there. There is more of a strength in these characters.\u201d Meanwhile, on fashion\u2019s buzz topic of gender fluidity, also evident in his work, he notes: \u201cWomen are buying the men\u2019s and vice versa.

The idea of bodies and flesh was central to the clothes. Risso and his team researched sculpture and statues across the ages, collaging images they painted on with their fingers to create the surfaces of skirts or sundresses that look like collectible art pieces.</p> <p>Risso\u2019s unconventional beginnings \u2013 he was born on a boat in 1982, and learned to count with fish on the deck \u2013 clearly shaped this free-spirited point of view. After five years at sea, he and his parents moved on to dry land, settling in conservative Genoa with an extended family of stepsiblings and grandparents. His hippy father, a lover of pink and diamond buttons, is a big source of inspiration. As a child Risso would cut up his siblings\u2019 clothes to make his own pieces, a habit that led to him being referred to by his family as \u201cthe virus of the wardrobe\u201d.

      "bodyText": "During my interview with Marni creative director Francesco Risso, there is a fabulous moment when I ask him to tell me a secret. He pauses, looks skyward, then settles into his fuzzily upholstered bamboo chair. \u201cI used to wear two pairs of pants [trousers], one on top of the other, when I was young because I was shy of my skinniness,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt was quite awkward to go around with two pairs of pants on, I can tell you.\u201d This personal childhood nugget \u2013 there are others, such as a memory of him skiing in double denim \u2013 goes some way to illustrating the designer\u2019s early connections to clothing, while underlining the kind of wondrous awkwardness so associated with the Marni label. Wearing a bathrobe-esque monochrome checked coat, wide jeans, two shirts layered one over the other and a pair of square-toed loafers, Risso, 36, certainly looks the part. He has been at the Italian label\u2019s helm since October 2016. Asked to describe himself in three words, the designer offers \u201cdishevelled, miaow, nerd\u201d. (He doesn\u2019t have a cat, but he\u2019s fascinated by them.) His office in Milan offers more of a clue to the inner workings of his brain. It features walls of thick-painted coloured stripes with one wall entirely pinned with images, including an actual vintage teddy bear, a shot of David Bowie smoking and another of the stylist Lotta Volkova. It\u2019s like a physical Instagram feed. Risso\u2019s actual Insta handle is A Slice Of Bambi, a reference to the nickname his partner, fellow designer Lawrence Steele, gave him. It, too, features a miscellany: computer consoles, cute critters and classical sculpture are on equal footing. Welcome to the new era at Marni.

According to US Soccer\u2019s own financial disclosures, the senior women\u2019s team brought in more revenue than the men\u2019s team over the last three years. That\u2019s partially due to the women winning the World Cup in 2015, which resulted in <a href=\"https://www.soccerwire.com/news/nt/uswnt/u-s-soccer-releases-annual-budget-figures-reveals-uswnt-as-cash-cow/\">a windfall for US Soccer</a> (the TV audience for the final was the largest for a soccer game \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/07/06/usa-japan-womens-world-cup-tv-ratings-record\">in US history</a>). But it\u2019s also due to the men failing to qualify for last year\u2019s World Cup, which cost the federation millions in prize money and lower revenues from friendlies.

Meanwhile, the U-20 and U-23 men\u2019s teams \u2013 the purview of Ramos and Herzog \u2013 don\u2019t bring in revenue for the federation: those teams don\u2019t host friendlies that make money, and they don\u2019t compete for prize money in tournaments.</p> \n<p>For US Soccer, which is still the subject of an unresolved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/31/us-womens-soccer-team-accuses-federation-wage-discrimination\">wage discrimination complaint from women\u2019s national team players</a>, the jarring salary breakdown among coaches represents another series of decisions that have required course-correction. Late last year, the federation reviewed Ellis\u2019 salary and decided to give her a six-figure raise that will not be disclosed until next year\u2019s tax filings, US Soccer tells the Guardian. That raise, the federation says, will put Ellis\u2019 salary well above what Ramos and Herzog earned in the latest filing. It wasn\u2019t a raise triggered by bonuses in her contract, and it wasn\u2019t part of a contract extension \u2013 the federation just felt it was the right thing to do.</p> \n<p>But Ellis earned less than Herzog and Klinsmann for years, from at least 2015 until her pay raise last year, and it\u2019s worth considering how the disparity happened in the first place \u2013 and why it could happen again. From the federation\u2019s standpoint, it made sense to pay average men\u2019s coaches more than a World Cup-winning women\u2019s coach for one primary reason: market value. The market dictates what a coach should be paid, the argument goes. Klinsmann and Herzog could conceivably have gone to another federation and earned similar salaries to what US Soccer paid them. Ellis, meanwhile, is believed to be the highest-paid women\u2019s coach in the world: it\u2019s unlikely she could make more elsewhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/12/usa-womens-soccer-team-world-cup-qualifying\">How the US prepared for the Women's World Cup by ripping everything up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed, the market conditions for coaches of women\u2019s teams are grim across all sports compared to their counterparts on men\u2019s team.

      "body": "<p>While working on his new album This Land, the genre-defying musical multi-hyphenate Gary Clark Jr had an uncomfortable confrontation with a neighbor. With his wife, Nicole Trunfio, and their toddlers, Zion and Gia, Clark had recently bought a 50-acre ranch near Austin, Texas, where he grew up. To say nothing of his status as a volcanic live performer, he had already won a Grammy, played with the Stones, strummed at the White House, and released two ambitious full-lengths, 2012\u2019s Blak and Blu and 2015\u2019s The Story of Sonny Boy Slim. But, as he <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gary-clark-jr-new-album-racism-donald-glover-789997/\">revealed</a> to Rolling Stone earlier this month, Clark\u2019s neighbor insisted he didn\u2019t live there and asked who <em>really</em> owned the property. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017,\u201d he told the Guardian \u201cand I\u2019m being confronted with racism in front of my own house.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/20/american-soul-train-don-cornelius\">'An ad for blackness': how Soul Train made America do the Hustle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The encounter led to the rap-rock thumper This Land, which also happens to be the lead single and name of Clark\u2019s new album, a defiant, energetic and sonically unclassifiable pastiche of blues, rock, R&amp;B and hip-hop. The 34 year-old spoke to us about addressing the Trump era, unburdening himself of anger, and the pride and pressure of being a torchbearer for 21st-century blues.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve called the lead single This Land the most important song you\u2019ve ever written. What was the process like of addressing racism and the current state of the union in music?</strong></p> <p>The process was, one, being black in the south, and two, it was right around 2016 and it reflected what the climate was, what the culture was, what was in the news, both for black people and anybody else who feels discriminated against. There was a situation that I had, which wasn\u2019t a big deal but it was kind of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I found it frustrating and sad and I just decided to go write a song about it. I had the music to it already. It\u2019s an adaptation of Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land is Your Land. \u201cThis land is mine\u201d was the only lyric I had over it and we just kind of played.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KgNaRQ_J-c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9KgNaRQ_J-c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>It\u2019s bold to put your own spin on a song that\u2019s so associated with a very specific, wistful form of patriotism.</strong></p> <p>I remember singing that song as a kid. I love the song and I love what it stands for, but I unfortunately don\u2019t think we can all sing that song as a nation unified. I just wanted to let it be known: this land is your land, but it\u2019s mine too, and we all, as Americans, as citizens of this country, should all have an equal shot.</p> <p><strong>On this new record, you showcase a really wide array of sounds: blues, reggae, R&amp;B and hip-hop.

Is that something you\u2019re trying to get out from under?</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. I\u2019m a guitar player at the end of the day, but I do other things as well. I\u2019m playing other instruments, I\u2019m singing and I\u2019m writing songs. I\u2019m trying to be an artist, so [\u201cGuitar God\u201d] isn\u2019t the right representation. Sometimes I wake up and I play drums and I\u2019ll just be a drummer out there. But because of the guitar you get put in this pigeonhole of blues Americana and I\u2019m ready to express more than that. Growing up I would perform in blues clubs, but I would always be playing something else, whether it was jazz or country or reggae. Quincy Jones has been talking about breaking down the idea of genre for a long time with his music. And the contribution that Quincy has put into this world: that guy has done everything, composing with Sinatra, he brought us Thriller. I want to be on that same wavelength.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019</strong><strong>ve been associated with a kind of nostalgia for the heyday of the blues and rock\u2019n\u2019roll.

Do you </strong><strong> consider yourself a modern-day torchbearer for the blues?</strong></p> <p>Everybody that I\u2019ve come across, people that have inspired and mentored me, have always supported me pushing the music forward. The blues are relevant, you know? It\u2019s not some throwback, something you check out in a museum. It\u2019s alive and well and it\u2019s not going anywhere. It\u2019s going to be in modern music and I don\u2019t know any other way. Sometimes I do feel like a torchbearer for modern blues and I\u2019m actually proud of that, you know? People like Jimmie Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, for them to bring my name up in a positive light, it means more to me than what a lot of other people say and feel. When I played Crossroads Festival in 2010, I walked across the stage for the finale and BB King grabbed my hand and looked at me and just kind of nodded, smiled at me. It was kind of like a welcome. I\u2019m not going to lie: I got teary-eyed. I was like: \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s heavy. Get it together, there\u2019s 30,000 people watching.

      "bodyText": "While working on his new album This Land, the genre-defying musical multi-hyphenate Gary Clark Jr had an uncomfortable confrontation with a neighbor. With his wife, Nicole Trunfio, and their toddlers, Zion and Gia, Clark had recently bought a 50-acre ranch near Austin, Texas, where he grew up. To say nothing of his status as a volcanic live performer, he had already won a Grammy, played with the Stones, strummed at the White House, and released two ambitious full-lengths, 2012\u2019s Blak and Blu and 2015\u2019s The Story of Sonny Boy Slim. But, as he revealed to Rolling Stone earlier this month, Clark\u2019s neighbor insisted he didn\u2019t live there and asked who really owned the property. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017,\u201d he told the Guardian \u201cand I\u2019m being confronted with racism in front of my own house.\u201d The encounter led to the rap-rock thumper This Land, which also happens to be the lead single and name of Clark\u2019s new album, a defiant, energetic and sonically unclassifiable pastiche of blues, rock, R&amp;B and hip-hop. The 34 year-old spoke to us about addressing the Trump era, unburdening himself of anger, and the pride and pressure of being a torchbearer for 21st-century blues. You\u2019ve called the lead single This Land the most important song you\u2019ve ever written. What was the process like of addressing racism and the current state of the union in music? The process was, one, being black in the south, and two, it was right around 2016 and it reflected what the climate was, what the culture was, what was in the news, both for black people and anybody else who feels discriminated against. There was a situation that I had, which wasn\u2019t a big deal but it was kind of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I found it frustrating and sad and I just decided to go write a song about it. I had the music to it already. It\u2019s an adaptation of Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land is Your Land. \u201cThis land is mine\u201d was the only lyric I had over it and we just kind of played. It\u2019s bold to put your own spin on a song that\u2019s so associated with a very specific, wistful form of patriotism. I remember singing that song as a kid. I love the song and I love what it stands for, but I unfortunately don\u2019t think we can all sing that song as a nation unified. I just wanted to let it be known: this land is your land, but it\u2019s mine too, and we all, as Americans, as citizens of this country, should all have an equal shot. On this new record, you showcase a really wide array of sounds: blues, reggae, R&amp;B and hip-hop. You\u2019ve talked about your admiration for Prince, how he was a world-class guitarist but wasn\u2019t typecast as a \u201cGuitar God\u201d.

As so often in crime novels, they tended to be outsiders in some way, or struggling with their own past trauma. For her seventh book, she has created something rather different: a pin-sharp portrait of privilege, recounted not by a world-weary, wisecracking detective but by a crime victim who is also a suspect.</p> <p>Twentysomething Toby has led a charmed life: popular at school; rich, supportive parents; sweet, adoring girlfriend. He bagged his first job doing PR for an art gallery \u2013 fortunately, the boss \u201chad taken a chance on grass-green me when the other woman at the final interview had had years of experience\u201d. Worrying has always seemed \u201clike a laughable waste of time and energy\u201d; after all, he\u2019s never had anything to worry about. And then an overconfident bit of trickery at work is followed by a brutal attack in his own home, and the old Toby is gone for ever, replaced by a nervy, jittery wreck with a limp and a slur who gets lost in the middle of sentences.</p> <p>As well as the fear and the \u201croiling fury\u201d, he\u2019s left with \u201ca depth and breadth of loss that I had never imagined\u201d. French writes excellently about damage, both physical and mental, and the accommodations that need to be made when life takes a wrong turning. Toby is not the only one with changed horizons; his uncle Hugo has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and Toby goes to stay with him in the family pile known as the Ivy House, where as a teenager he spent summers with his cousins Leon and Susanna. Hugo deteriorates while Toby struggles to recover; the house becomes a haven for them both, even if \u201cmy own ghost was everywhere \u2026 agile and golden and invulnerable\u201d.</p> <p>We are a third of the way through before the grisly discovery in the Ivy House garden that sets the book\u2019s central mystery in motion and brings the police to Toby\u2019s door for the second time. \u201cInside, what, five months? You\u2019re burglarised, you\u2019re nearly killed and a skeleton turns up in your back garden? What are the odds?\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, with infinite cunning, French teases out the connections. The old Toby would have faced down the cops with patrician charm; the new one doubts himself, his past, his memories. The attack has left him with \u201choles in my mind, blind spots shimmering nastily like migraine aura\u201d. He\u2019s taking Xanax for the anxiety, he\u2019s certainly an unreliable narrator \u2013 as are we all. As the book unfolds he is forced to confront the blind spots that were there before the burglary: how the blessings of birth and class and gender have insulated him all his life, from teenage bullying, from toxic masculinity, from social oppression. \u201cOh you,\u201d says Susanna, almost fondly. \u201cAnything you feel bad about just falls straight out of your head.\u201d</p> <p>Though both the reader and Toby are tripped up at every turn as he searches for what he might have forgotten, some of the best passages follow not the excavation of the mystery but the awful development of Hugo\u2019s illness. French ranges effortlessly from pub banter to moral argument to visionary intensity, with the present tense erupting into the narrative \u2013 \u201cmy feet thumping on the ground, my breath loud in my ears. Waves of birds lifting from the trees\u201d \u2013 just as the past erupts into the present day. Hugo is a genealogist: his own investigations have been transformed by modern DNA techniques, and a subplot highlights the shocks in store for people investigating their family trees who discover that they are literally not who they thought themselves to be.</p> <p>Throughout, there\u2019s a bittersweet appreciation of the fragile beauty of the world, from \u201cthe sunlight bringing the battered wood of the table alive with an impossible holy glow\u201d to the garden that sheltered childhood memories as well as a timebomb waiting to be unearthed. The novel is saturated with yearning, for vanished and vanishing worlds, as Hugo goes down into the darkness and Toby faces up to the scale of his loss. That what he is mourning was in part a chimera created by privilege \u2013 \u201cnot everyone gets to live in the same world as you\u201d \u2013 is just one layer in the book\u2019s overlapping ironies.</p> <p>So the novel works brilliantly as a twisty pageturner, but it is far deeper and more nuanced than that. French\u2019s theme throughout is the bruised relationship between the world and the self: whether our personalities are remade by trauma, or revealed; what is concealed by privilege, and what is exposed. As Hugo says, \u201cone gets into the habit of being oneself. It takes some great upheaval to crack that shell and force us to discover what else might be underneath.\u201d That \u201cgreat upheaval\u201d is the modus operandi of the best crime fiction, and this book confirms French as its brightest contemporary star.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Wych Elm</em> is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).

He\u2019s taking Xanax for the anxiety, he\u2019s certainly an unreliable narrator \u2013 as are we all. As the book unfolds he is forced to confront the blind spots that were there before the burglary: how the blessings of birth and class and gender have insulated him all his life, from teenage bullying, from toxic masculinity, from social oppression. \u201cOh you,\u201d says Susanna, almost fondly. \u201cAnything you feel bad about just falls straight out of your head.\u201d Though both the reader and Toby are tripped up at every turn as he searches for what he might have forgotten, some of the best passages follow not the excavation of the mystery but the awful development of Hugo\u2019s illness. French ranges effortlessly from pub banter to moral argument to visionary intensity, with the present tense erupting into the narrative \u2013 \u201cmy feet thumping on the ground, my breath loud in my ears. Waves of birds lifting from the trees\u201d \u2013 just as the past erupts into the present day. Hugo is a genealogist: his own investigations have been transformed by modern DNA techniques, and a subplot highlights the shocks in store for people investigating their family trees who discover that they are literally not who they thought themselves to be. Throughout, there\u2019s a bittersweet appreciation of the fragile beauty of the world, from \u201cthe sunlight bringing the battered wood of the table alive with an impossible holy glow\u201d to the garden that sheltered childhood memories as well as a timebomb waiting to be unearthed. The novel is saturated with yearning, for vanished and vanishing worlds, as Hugo goes down into the darkness and Toby faces up to the scale of his loss. That what he is mourning was in part a chimera created by privilege \u2013 \u201cnot everyone gets to live in the same world as you\u201d \u2013 is just one layer in the book\u2019s overlapping ironies. So the novel works brilliantly as a twisty pageturner, but it is far deeper and more nuanced than that. French\u2019s theme throughout is the bruised relationship between the world and the self: whether our personalities are remade by trauma, or revealed; what is concealed by privilege, and what is exposed. As Hugo says, \u201cone gets into the habit of being oneself. It takes some great upheaval to crack that shell and force us to discover what else might be underneath.\u201d That \u201cgreat upheaval\u201d is the modus operandi of the best crime fiction, and this book confirms French as its brightest contemporary star. \u2022 The Wych Elm is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).

The Rumour Mill didn\u2019t get where it is today believing faintly preposterous Spanish speculation that Luis Su\u00e1rez could end up at Manchester United when he\u2019s drummed out of Barcelona this summer, but it\u2019s a bit of gossip that\u2019s doing the rounds in Spain, so it would be a gross dereliction of our duty to spread scurrilous transfer tittle-tattle if we didn\u2019t mention it here. Meanwhile in France, Lille manager Christophe Galtier is resigned to losing his best player this summer but has ramped up the pressure on Arsenal, who are interested in signing Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. \u201cHe has to go to a Champions League club,\u201d he said, of the winger who has scored 16 goals this season. \u201cIn my opinion, he does not need an intermediate step to go as high as possible.\u201d And finally, Billy Sharp is in prolific form and can\u2019t stop scoring goals for Sheffield United as they seek a return to the Premier League after a 22-year absence. The 33-year-old is to be rewarded for his efforts with a new two-and-a-half year deal the club are hoping to have signed, sealed and delivered today, ahead of their crunch match against West Brom this weekend.",

      "bodyText": "I have a TV set for streaming videos from my NAS, but I have given up on the BBC, and I never watch ITV, Channel 4 and certainly not 5. What exactly do I need to do to stop paying a TV Licence fee? Is unplugging my aerial enough? Steve In the old world of analogue broadcasting, this was an easy question. \u201cWatching TV\u201d just meant feeding a broadcast signal to a box containing a TV tuner and a cathode ray tube. If you did that in the UK then you needed a TV licence. In today\u2019s digital world, however, you may need a TV licence if your only device is a smartphone. TVs and aerials are still common, but internet streaming means they are no longer required for watching television. The new licensing rules therefore cover not just TVs but PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, games consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation, streaming devices from Roku, Amazon and others, set-top boxes and personal video recorders (PVRs). All of this is explained on TV Licensing\u2019s multilingual website. Live TV The basic rule is that you must have a TV licence if you watch, record or otherwise consume live television. It doesn\u2019t matter which television stations you watch, or how you watch them. You still have to buy a licence if you only watch live streams from Mongolia\u2019s Eagle TV channel. The definition of \u201clive\u201d is flexible because there can be delays in transmission, and many set-top boxes and PVRs let you pause or save TV programmes. Indeed, recording, capturing and storing live TV also counts as watching live television. You can\u2019t get out of paying for a licence by recording programmes and watching them later. Briefly, if you start streaming a TV programme just before it ends, you need a licence. If you start streaming it just after it has ended, you don\u2019t need a licence. As mentioned above, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of device you use to watch live television, or how you collect and process the signal. You\u2019re still watching live TV if you get the feed from an aerial, a cable network, a satellite dish, a wifi hotspot or any other internet server. This includes watching live fights on Sky Sports Box Office, NHL ice hockey games from Canada, ATP tennis on Amazon Prime and so on, even though you will be paying separately to watch them. Logically, it must also include any live television feeds on Facebook or Twitter. You\u2019re still watching live TV if you view the feed on a TV set, a computer monitor, on a smartphone, tablet or laptop, on a VR headset or projected on to a wall. It doesn\u2019t matter. I hope this alerts anyone who thought they were within the law because they watched TV programmes on their smartphones or via a Roku stick in the back of a monitor. Stored programmes Conversely, with one exception, you don\u2019t need a TV licence if you only watch stored programmes, which are played \u201con demand\u201d rather than streamed or broadcast live. For example, you don\u2019t need a TV licence to watch movies and TV programmes on DVD or Blu-ray, or streamed from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Now TV, YouTube and similar services \u2026 unless they stream live TV. You don\u2019t need a TV licence to watch programmes on catch-up TV services, with the exception of the BBC\u2019s iPlayer. You can watch anything stored on services such as ITV Hub, All 4 and My5, as long as you don\u2019t watch live TV. These services are, after all, paid for by advertising.

Introduced by New Labour, but accelerated dramatically by the coalition government, these assessments have falsely pushed disabled and severely ill people off benefits, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/19/benefits-mental-health-city-hackney-mind-vulnerable\" title=\"\">even towards suicide</a>. A decade after one of the great modern social policy disasters first began, two particularly harrowing stories have hit the headlines. One was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/12/man-wins-fit-for-work-appeal-seven-months-after-his-death\" title=\"\">case of 52-year-old Jeff Hayward</a>, who won his \u201cfit for work\u201d appeal \u2013 seven months after his death. Hayward, who struggled to walk due to a debilitating skin condition, had to spend the last 18 months of his life fighting to get his benefits back. He died of a heart attack.</p> <p>A few days earlier, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/04/dwp-apologise-for-telling-seriously-ill-man-to-find-a-job\" title=\"\">Department for Work and Pensions was forced to apologise</a> after telling 64-year-old Stephen Smith to find work, despite the fact that he can barely walk, struggles to breathe and uses a colostomy bag to go to the toilet. At one point, Smith weighed only 38kg (6st), with the Liverpool Echo publishing a now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imajsaclaimant/status/1097166871613394945?s=21\" title=\"\">viral photo of him emaciated in a hospital bed.</a></p> <p>It is hard to get the image of Smith\u2019s skeletal frame out of your mind once you see it, his protruding bones more akin to a prisoner of war. But then, it takes plenty for a benefit claimant to make the papers nowadays. It is the law of fading attention: stories must get darker, illnesses more painful, deaths more disturbing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d51b40c01a98179321220b116150186684098b8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51b40c01a98179321220b116150186684098b8e/0_33_797_996/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Hayward, who won his fit-for-work appeal seven months after his death\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Hayward, who won his fit-for-work appeal seven months after his death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Hayward</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet still, nothing is done about it. The cold reality is there is no motivation for ministers to address the \u201cfit-for-work\u201d scandal, and little faith that the current cohort at Westminster is up to the job.</p> <p>What is this alternative? Last week, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, <a href=\"https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/mps-hear-of-ways-to-save-benefit-claimants-from-harm-or-even-death/\" title=\"\">held a meeting with disability campaigners</a> to discuss solutions to the fit-for-work tests and other social security reforms and cuts. This non-Brexit business must continue with growing urgency.</p> <p>In the short-term, we urgently need to utilise measures that will reduce the damage being caused, such as creating more advocacy groups to accompany disabled people to benefit assessments and appeals, and lobbying cash-strapped councils to protect the emergency \u201cwelfare\u201d funds designed to help people in financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/14/local-welfare-schemes-in-england-on-brink-of-collapse-survey-finds\" title=\"\">but being cut across the country</a>. This will not be easy given demands on strained local budgets, but it is a necessity.</p> <p>In the long-term, the only commonsense move is to scrap the work capability assessments that decide whether or not someone is fit to work.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s become practically a cliche of current politics to lament the way Brexit has pushed all other tasks off the agenda: leaving pressing issues like homelessness, climate change and social care to fester. What is rarely acknowledged, however, is that this is hardly a new phenomenon. While the European question has undeniably derailed Britain\u2019s domestic agenda, the political class lost sight of the key social and economic issues of our times long ago. Few things make this clearer than \u201cfit-for-work tests\u201d, the linchpin of the austerity era\u2019s pernicious \u201cwelfare reforms\u201d. Introduced by New Labour, but accelerated dramatically by the coalition government, these assessments have falsely pushed disabled and severely ill people off benefits, and even towards suicide. A decade after one of the great modern social policy disasters first began, two particularly harrowing stories have hit the headlines. One was the case of 52-year-old Jeff Hayward, who won his \u201cfit for work\u201d appeal \u2013 seven months after his death. Hayward, who struggled to walk due to a debilitating skin condition, had to spend the last 18 months of his life fighting to get his benefits back. He died of a heart attack. A few days earlier, the Department for Work and Pensions was forced to apologise after telling 64-year-old Stephen Smith to find work, despite the fact that he can barely walk, struggles to breathe and uses a colostomy bag to go to the toilet. At one point, Smith weighed only 38kg (6st), with the Liverpool Echo publishing a now viral photo of him emaciated in a hospital bed. It is hard to get the image of Smith\u2019s skeletal frame out of your mind once you see it, his protruding bones more akin to a prisoner of war. But then, it takes plenty for a benefit claimant to make the papers nowadays. It is the law of fading attention: stories must get darker, illnesses more painful, deaths more disturbing. And yet still, nothing is done about it. The cold reality is there is no motivation for ministers to address the \u201cfit-for-work\u201d scandal, and little faith that the current cohort at Westminster is up to the job. What is this alternative? Last week, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, held a meeting with disability campaigners to discuss solutions to the fit-for-work tests and other social security reforms and cuts. This non-Brexit business must continue with growing urgency. In the short-term, we urgently need to utilise measures that will reduce the damage being caused, such as creating more advocacy groups to accompany disabled people to benefit assessments and appeals, and lobbying cash-strapped councils to protect the emergency \u201cwelfare\u201d funds designed to help people in financial crisis but being cut across the country. This will not be easy given demands on strained local budgets, but it is a necessity. In the long-term, the only commonsense move is to scrap the work capability assessments that decide whether or not someone is fit to work. Similarly, we must end the use of private companies in assessments, which are currently inexplicably held in higher regard than a disabled person\u2019s own medical team. It is a warped social security system that is based on the principle of cutting the \u201cwelfare bill\u201d rather than helping citizens in times of need. This is in part because it is factually inaccurate that such polices save money \u2013 spending on out-of-work sickness benefits rose by \u00a33bn above anticipated levels during the coalition years alone. Moreover, it reinforces the idea that people who are too ill to work are not fellow human beings who are suffering, but in fact leeches on the public purse. Addressing this myth requires winning over the public by shifting the \u201cscrounger v striver\u201d narrative that still plagues much discussion of \u201cwelfare\u201d. This task should not be insurmountable considering polls last year showed a softening attitude towards benefit claimants among the public, as well as a growing concern that disabled people are being deprived of their rightful support. Yet, there is a risk that the public are becoming numbed to hardships caused by welfare reforms, particularly at a time when our attention is forced elsewhere. Above anything, as politics becomes ever more frantic, they need to be kept in the public consciousness. There is a sneering attitude in some quarters that this is small fry compared with Brexit, but the welfare state is hardly an insignificant matter, not least to those whose wellbeing depends on it.

The fact that the high-powered couple sent a video message would have been news enough (they entirely ignored the recent Grammy awards).

The presence of a branded microfibre makeup removal cloth, easily identifiable to many women, made the display about a woman\u2019s worth not being tied to her appearance appear inextricable from the market forces that sell women the messages that sustain a culture of insecurity.

      "bodyText": "The Brits moment most likely to dominate today\u2019s tabloid coverage was Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s acceptance speech for best international group as the Carters. The fact that the high-powered couple sent a video message would have been news enough (they entirely ignored the recent Grammy awards). That they accepted the award standing before a portrait of Meghan Markle in traditional royal dress, mirroring the videos they made in the Louvre for their collaborative Everything Is Love album, was even more remarkable. They made no reference to Markle or the painting in their brief speech, but it\u2019s no stretch to interpret the display as a show of support for the Duchess of Sussex, who has faced increasingly hostile coverage from the tabloids, particularly in the later stages of her pregnancy. For the music industry, remarks made by the 1975 \u2013 the Manchester band named best British group and keepers of the best British album \u2013 would make the biggest impact. It was bracing to hear frontman Matty Healy pull a piece of paper from his pocket and read a quote about how \u201cmale misogynist acts are examined for nuance and examined as traits of difficult artists while women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don\u2019t understand art\u201d, not least because, well, I wrote those words in an article about being degraded by a male musician in 2015, and quoted them in a piece about the allegations made against Ryan Adams last week. Setting aside the fact that hearing a pop star mention your name during an awards ceremony is fairly discombobulating, hearing a leading male rock artist decry the systems that have historically buoyed their career while pointing out the double standards that women face \u2013 in front of the music industry that sustains those dynamics \u2013 felt remarkable. These iconoclastic displays put the night\u2019s other putatively political action in stark contrast: Jess Glynne\u2019s earnest performance of her song Thursday \u2013 in which she along with 70 influencers and models removed their makeup on stage \u2013 felt try-hard. The presence of a branded microfibre makeup removal cloth, easily identifiable to many women, made the display about a woman\u2019s worth not being tied to her appearance appear inextricable from the market forces that sell women the messages that sustain a culture of insecurity. (I give it a few hours before a press release for the cloth appears in my inbox.) These were the banner moments in a ceremony largely devoid of drama, bar host Jack Whitehall\u2019s admirable attempts to goad the assembled stars into outraged reactions and spilled gossip. There had been little furore leading up to this year\u2019s Brit awards, which \u2013 like the Grammys \u2013 seems to dwindle in relevance every year despite overdue attempts at progress. A 2018 report suggested that the UK was losing its knack for producing global pop superstars: tellingly, last night Ed Sheeran won the global success award (for sheer commercial might) for a second year running, unrivalled by insurgents. Last night\u2019s superstar winners in the three international categories \u2013 Ariana Grande as best female, the Carters best group, Drake best male \u2013 showed up the insularity of the Brits and much of British pop. Bombastic balladeer Tom Walker (British breakthrough) and endearing troubadour George Ezra (British male) hew to established templates that don\u2019t translate internationally. That said, it seemed odd that it had taken Calvin Harris, a British pop superstar, so long to win his first Brits. After 14 unsuccessful nominations, his double win felt long overdue given the Brits\u2019 propensity for rewarding commercial success. Last night he took home best producer, and British single for One Kiss with Dua Lipa \u2013 deserving victories, but ones that posed questions about women\u2019s roles in contemporary pop. Unlike last year, when artists wore white rose pins in support of the Time\u2019s Up movement and Stormzy triumphed over Ed Sheeran in major categories, the 2019 Brits made no clear correctives regarding diversity. BAME artists remained underrepresented, receiving fewer than half as many nominations and wins as white artists. The gender divide was less stark, but there are now questions to grapple with beyond the basic fact of representation \u2013 namely the extent to which women get to author their own work. A BBC report published this week showed the decline of hit songs credited solely to female artists. Harris and Lipa encouragingly shared top billing and songwriting credit on their winning single One Kiss (though she thanked him for letting her appear), but many of the night\u2019s nominated songs found female artists billed as featured artists to male producers \u2013 as well as primarily male production and songwriting teams. \u201cAs women, we get moulded in to something that we don\u2019t necessarily want to be,\u201d singer Mabel told the BBC.

      "body": "<p>Some years ago a well-placed German Catholic priest sent me a long letter denouncing a network of gay clergy supposedly centred around Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s private secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/16/georg-ganswein-pope-papal-secretary\" title=\"\">Archbishop Georg G\u00e4nswein</a>. In official Catholic teaching it is not a sin to be gay, although the inclination is \u201can objective moral disorder\u201d; but it is sinful to act on this inclination. How sinful depends on your confessor. The result is that gay clergy are officially innocent until guilty but in gossip guilty until proven innocent \u2013 which of course they never quite can be. Most of the men cited were identified only by their initials, and the sender himself hoped to remain anonymous. But with patience and the help of friends, I worked out who all the initials belonged to and tracked the author to his cathedral. He denied everything and expressed surprise that a reputable newspaper should be interested in such gossip. I will not easily forget his smirk as he said this.</p> <p>It was a glimpse of the poisonous world that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, himself gay, has spent five years researching for this book. In this place of make-believe, guilt and constant innuendo the prelates live in a tension between the dreadful fear of being outed and the loneliness of not being recognised for who and what they are. So they out each other instead, compulsively. Martel\u2019s rule of thumb is that the most publicly homophobic prelates are those most likely to be homosexually inclined themselves; the only ones who feel they can afford to be sympathetic to gay people are celibate straight people, who do exist in the Vatican. Martel quotes the estimate of the pope\u2019s former chief Latinist that up to 80% of the Vatican staff could be gay even if obviously most of them are buttoned up. The real figure is unknowable but 80% is not entirely incredible. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Pope\u2019s former chief Latinist estimates that about 80% of the\u00a0Vatican staff could be gay</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the most impressive, and saddening, parts of Martel\u2019s research is his exploration of the world of migrant sex workers in Rome. Elsewhere in Europe there are fewer gay sex workers on the streets, he says, but in Rome they still thrive, in part because of the concentration of priests, who seek out migrants for the anonymity their encounters offer. The sex workers tell him that their priestly clientele divide into two classes: the lordly ones, who treat them like dirt and pay very badly, and the younger ones, tortured by tenderness, who fall in love with them and are carefully cultivated for their money.</p> <p>That this is all predicated on lies and denial is in part because the Vatican is a gerontocracy, still run by men who grew up when the priesthood was almost the only career open to a homosexual youth in Europe or the US and priestly celibacy offered a sanctified escape from what would otherwise have been a crippling shame. But the price of this compromise was paid in uncountable twisted lives.</p> <p>A more subtle and less scandalous theme in Martel\u2019s book is the way in which gay men who grew up before the sexual revolution understood their own nature. If the only way to be good and gay was to remain entirely celibate, then the only possible approach to sex was to sublimate it. This intellectualisation carried over, disastrously, into the celibate clergy\u2019s instructions to the married laity on birth control.</p> <p>Although he distinguishes sharply between homosexuality and paedophilia, Martel believes that life in the closet predisposes priests to cover up for each other. All institutions operate on loyalty and fear of scandal, but beyond those factors the Catholic church is full of men who feel neuralgic, he claims, about guilty secrets. Such men need not consciously conspire against the public; they just have an instinctive knowledge that the public need never know.</p> <p>The most obvious complaint against Martel is that he can\u2019t prove much of what he alleges. He claims to have recordings of most of his interviews: one certainly wants to hear the moment when a prominent conservative cardinal\u2019s assistant refers to him as \u201c<em>elle</em>\u201d. But such recordings couldn\u2019t for obvious reasons be published. Many of his most vivid informants are veiled in anonymity: one cardinal is referred to by the nickname of a famous prostitute, and so on. Perhaps this is inevitable. The gay and honest Dominican father James Allison once said that the Vatican is \u201ca honeycomb of closets\u201d where everyone\u2019s secrets are known, but only to a few. Nonetheless, the flaw in this book that will disappoint most readers is that it has no index. You\u2019ll simply have to read it all the way through.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the Closet of the Vatican: Power, Homosexuality, Hypocrisy by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, translated by Shaun Whiteside, is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a325).

      "bodyText": "Some years ago a well-placed German Catholic priest sent me a long letter denouncing a network of gay clergy supposedly centred around Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s private secretary, Archbishop Georg G\u00e4nswein. In official Catholic teaching it is not a sin to be gay, although the inclination is \u201can objective moral disorder\u201d; but it is sinful to act on this inclination. How sinful depends on your confessor. The result is that gay clergy are officially innocent until guilty but in gossip guilty until proven innocent \u2013 which of course they never quite can be. Most of the men cited were identified only by their initials, and the sender himself hoped to remain anonymous. But with patience and the help of friends, I worked out who all the initials belonged to and tracked the author to his cathedral. He denied everything and expressed surprise that a reputable newspaper should be interested in such gossip. I will not easily forget his smirk as he said this. It was a glimpse of the poisonous world that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, himself gay, has spent five years researching for this book. In this place of make-believe, guilt and constant innuendo the prelates live in a tension between the dreadful fear of being outed and the loneliness of not being recognised for who and what they are. So they out each other instead, compulsively. Martel\u2019s rule of thumb is that the most publicly homophobic prelates are those most likely to be homosexually inclined themselves; the only ones who feel they can afford to be sympathetic to gay people are celibate straight people, who do exist in the Vatican. Martel quotes the estimate of the pope\u2019s former chief Latinist that up to 80% of the Vatican staff could be gay even if obviously most of them are buttoned up. The real figure is unknowable but 80% is not entirely incredible. One of the most impressive, and saddening, parts of Martel\u2019s research is his exploration of the world of migrant sex workers in Rome. Elsewhere in Europe there are fewer gay sex workers on the streets, he says, but in Rome they still thrive, in part because of the concentration of priests, who seek out migrants for the anonymity their encounters offer. The sex workers tell him that their priestly clientele divide into two classes: the lordly ones, who treat them like dirt and pay very badly, and the younger ones, tortured by tenderness, who fall in love with them and are carefully cultivated for their money. That this is all predicated on lies and denial is in part because the Vatican is a gerontocracy, still run by men who grew up when the priesthood was almost the only career open to a homosexual youth in Europe or the US and priestly celibacy offered a sanctified escape from what would otherwise have been a crippling shame. But the price of this compromise was paid in uncountable twisted lives. A more subtle and less scandalous theme in Martel\u2019s book is the way in which gay men who grew up before the sexual revolution understood their own nature. If the only way to be good and gay was to remain entirely celibate, then the only possible approach to sex was to sublimate it. This intellectualisation carried over, disastrously, into the celibate clergy\u2019s instructions to the married laity on birth control. Although he distinguishes sharply between homosexuality and paedophilia, Martel believes that life in the closet predisposes priests to cover up for each other. All institutions operate on loyalty and fear of scandal, but beyond those factors the Catholic church is full of men who feel neuralgic, he claims, about guilty secrets. Such men need not consciously conspire against the public; they just have an instinctive knowledge that the public need never know. The most obvious complaint against Martel is that he can\u2019t prove much of what he alleges. He claims to have recordings of most of his interviews: one certainly wants to hear the moment when a prominent conservative cardinal\u2019s assistant refers to him as \u201celle\u201d. But such recordings couldn\u2019t for obvious reasons be published. Many of his most vivid informants are veiled in anonymity: one cardinal is referred to by the nickname of a famous prostitute, and so on. Perhaps this is inevitable. The gay and honest Dominican father James Allison once said that the Vatican is \u201ca honeycomb of closets\u201d where everyone\u2019s secrets are known, but only to a few. Nonetheless, the flaw in this book that will disappoint most readers is that it has no index. You\u2019ll simply have to read it all the way through. \u2022 In the Closet of the Vatican: Power, Homosexuality, Hypocrisy by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, translated by Shaun Whiteside, is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a325).

This should inform the development of early warning signals and crisis intervention plans.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Rec 2: \u201cAddress gaps in water quality monitoring (dissolved oxygen, temperature, algae) at high risk sites across the basin.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Rec 4: \u201cSupport emerging initiatives within the basin to remove barriers to fish movement, especially in locations with high stratification potential and locations that act as refuges during low flow events.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Rec 5: Continue short-term efforts to prevent further fish deaths through use of aerators and other technologies as well as fish translocations, noting these are short-term emergency measures and may not prevent additional fish death events if adverse conditions arise again.\u2019</p> \n  <p>Rec 9: \u201cProgress implementation of the northern basin toolkit measures, prioritising those that would support native fish population\u2019s recovery (eg fish passage).</p> \n  <p>Rec 16: \u201cIntroduce real-time monitoring of diversions in the Barwon-Darling to ensure protection of managed connectivity events.\u201d (IE, protect environmental flows from harvest.)</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:30:51.664Z\">at 5.30am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e3387e4b0cc09362e0487\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:18:20.888Z\">5.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It would be no mistake that<strong> Julie Bishop</strong> is wearing white as she made this statement.</p> \n  <p>Her speech made it clear she wants a woman to replace her.

I have valued her judgment, appreciated her insight and admired the tireless way she has served the party, the parliament and Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOn behalf of the government and the Liberal party, I thank Julie for her great service to Australia for nearly two decades.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJulie was deputy leader of the Liberal party from 2007 to 2018 and played a critical role in our election to government in 2013.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs the first woman to be deputy leader of the Liberal party and the first woman to be Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie\u2019s place in the Liberal party pantheon and in the history of the Howard government and this government is secure.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are many achievements from her time as foreign minister in which Julie can be proud: the New Colombo Plan, the establishment of the Dfat innovationXchange and strengthening Australia\u2019s relations throughout the Pacific.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHowever, I believe her greatest achievement was her work in the days after flight MH17 was brutally felled. Julie\u2019s judgment, determination and energy helped secure a United Nations security council resolution that ensured Australia and its partners could repatriate the victims of that terrible crime. Australia has not forgotten those terrible days and still waits for the perpetrators of that crime to be brought to justice.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJulie was one of Australia\u2019s truly great foreign ministers. In the Liberal party she will take her place alongside the greatest foreign ministers of our history: Casey, Hasluck and Downer.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJulie is enormously popular with party members across Australia and for more than a decade, in addition to her travels as foreign minister, Julie has hit the highways and byways of our country in support of our members and candidates.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOn behalf of the party and the government, I wish Julie well in the next chapter of her life.

I will leave the seat of Curtin in very good shape, indeed, a winning position for the Liberal party. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I first contested the seat in 1998, I won the election with a primary vote of 44.6%. At the last election, my seventh election, my primary vote was 65.6%. Within, essentially, the same electoral boundary. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWith a two-party preferred vote of 71%, with an experienced campaign team and campaign funds already in place, I am confident that a Liberal candidate will have every opportunity to win the support of the people of Curtin. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt has been an immense honour to be the longest-serving member for Curtin. And also to be the deputy leader of the Liberal party. The first female to hold the role for 11 years, over half my entire political career. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I am also proud of the fact that I am the first woman to contest the leadership ballot of the Liberal party in its 75-year history. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt has also been an immense honour to serve in cabinet, first as the minister for education, science and training and women\u2019s issues, and then as the minister for foreign affairs. Australia\u2019s first female foreign minister. And I am so very proud that my successor, senator<strong> Marise Payne</strong>, will be, and is, the second female foreign minister of Australia. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMy five years as foreign minister were a particular privilege being able to represent Australia on the world stage. We should be so proud of our reputation and the high regard in which we are held as a nation. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd open liberal democracy, committed to freedoms and the rule of law, and democratic institutions, and open, highly competitive export-oriented market economy, entering out 28th consecutive year of uninterrupted economic growth, a world record, with a lifestyle and standard of living that is unparalleled. I thank and acknowledge the prime ministers in whose cabinets I served: J<strong>ohn Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI thank the Liberal party of Australia, my division of Curtin, the state division, my colleagues, past and present in this place, and the Liberal party members across Australia and living overseas everywhere, for the remarkable opportunity they have afforded me to be a member of the House of Representatives since 1998. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have been blessed to have worked with some outstanding political and ministerial staff, who shared my passion for my political and policy endeavours, and I thank them, particularly <strong>Murray Hansen</strong>, my closest adviser for 14 years. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI thank my, beautiful supportive family, my siblings, and <strong>David Panton</strong> and his family. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I say to my many close and trusted friends: I look forward to seeing a more of you. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAs I said in this place, in my first speech in November 1998, I was brought up to believe that entering public office should be one of the highest callings and that being able to direct your energies and abilities to the betterment of your state or your country was one of the greatest contributions you could make. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd that I had always had an intense conviction that an individual can make a difference to the life of the times. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat remains my view. I also set out a goal in that speech, to represent the people of Curtin with all the vigour and courage and ability that I had to offer, with honesty, decency, and above all, to put their interests above my own. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMr Speaker, I will leave this place positive about the future, proud of the service that I have been able to give to my electric of Curtin, my beloved Liberal party, the state of Western Australia, and my country.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:48:01.245Z\">at 5.48am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e3118e4b00307e95a75ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:07:25.433Z\">5.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Julie Bishop:</strong></p> \n  <p>During the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to closely consider the future of the coalition government, and the pending general election. </p> \n  <p>I have closely observed Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and the Liberal National team in the Parliament, in Question Time, in the party room, in press conferences, and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>And it is evident that the policy platform that we will take to the next election is crystallising based on the very firm foundations of our unrelenting focus on prudent management of our national finances, so that we can afford the services that Australians need. In returning the budget to surplus. In paying down debt. In lowering taxes. In backing enterprise. And job creation. And growing the economy for the benefit of all Australians. </p> \n  <p>And, Mr Speaker, Australians will remember that in 2007 the Labor Party promised to deliver responsible budgets. Yet in government, they trashed the national finances through wasteful and reckless spending. Labor also promised to maintain strong border protection, yet in government, they presided over one of the greatest policy failures in a generation when they weakened those border protection laws. Mr Speaker, during the last two weeks it has become evidence that Labor has learned nothing from its past failings, and is doomed to repeat these failings should it be re-elected. It is thus my view that the Liberal National coalition will win the next election...</p> \n  <p>And that the government will be returned to office because it is focusing on the matter to the Australian people. </p> \n  <p><strong>And on that basis, I have reconsidered my position as the Member for Curtin. I have been contacted by a number of talented, indeed extraordinary, people, including women, who have indicated to me that should I not reconsidered the seat of Curtin, they would seek preselection from the Curtin division of the Liberal Party for that seat. Accordingly, I will not re-contest the seat of Curtin at the next election. And I will work hard in the meantime to assist a new Liberal candidates to win the seat. </strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T10:23:54.566Z\">at 10.23am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e30b4e4b0ac8d72de51f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:02:39.688Z\">5.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has just announced about a million administrative appeals tribunal appointments, including former senator <strong>Stephen Parry.</strong> </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:47:45.275Z\">at 5.47am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e3059e4b00307e95a75ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T05:01:02.517Z\">5.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scott Morrison:</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think it is important to mark the speech that we have just heard from the member for Curtin, simply to acknowledge her tremendous service to our country, her tremendous service to her community, tremendous service to the party, the Liberal party. </p> \n  <p>\u201cJulie is a Liberal through and through and she has always held fast to those important liberal principles. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe share many things in common \u2013 not just thinking that <strong>Tina Arena </strong>is the best female singer in the country \u2013 but apart from that, Mr Speaker, her passion that she has always brought to her role, the dignity and grace that she has demonstrated in every single role she has held.

I left the company officially in August last year. I was group general manager of QBT (and APX, New Zealand\u2019s equivalent of QBT). I ran that business when QBT won the WoAG travel tender. This was before the merger of AOT and Helloworld in around 2015/6.</p> \n   <p>After that merger I reported directly to <strong>Andrew Burnes </strong>who was the major shareholder and CEO of the new group. The AOT WoAG hotel corporate business was put under my control just before I left the business and I was involved with last year\u2019s AOT tender WoAG strategy meetings but none of the meeting with WoAG.</p> \n   <p><strong>Early 2017 Andrew Burnes advised me that his long-term friend Mr Hockey was frustrated that his travel arrangements were unprofessional and with limited hours of operations. I could understand this would be a frustration in that position.</strong></p> \n   <p>Mr Burnes told me that he was going to arrange a meeting with Mr Hockey and me at some point in the first half of 2017.</p> \n   <p>As we had the Dfat contract via the Australian WoAG deed I assumed that there could be an extension done to cover all Australian embassies worldwide. I found out later that they weren\u2019t covered in any way in the deed.</p> \n   <p>My relationship with the Department of Finances WoAG travel team has always been professional, transparent, trusting and friendly but with proper governance processes in place that were never crossed. They are hardworking, honest and extremely dedicated to ensure that the Australian taxpayer gets full value for money. QBT provided excellent travel services to the Australian federal government.</p> \n   <p>Around the date of 23 April 2017 I was in Europe on personal leave and some business and was planning to fly directly home to Melbourne when I was contacted by Mr Burnes via email/SMS and voice call to tell me he had arranged a meeting with Mr Hockey and I had to fly home via Washington to meet with him.</p> \n   <p>I asked Mr Burnes how could this be done so quickly. He verbally advised me, \u2018Hockey owes me.\u2019 I found that \u2018owes me\u2019 comment strange in the circumstances, but it\u2019s not an unusual term from Mr Burnes when talking about his business relationships. I knew Mr Burnes and Mrs Burnes have had a long-term friendship with Mr Hockey and his family.</p> \n   <p>As all my emails and meeting notes were handed back to Helloworld on my departure from the business I haven\u2019t got all the exact times or dates, but from memory which does serve me well.</p> \n   <p><strong>I emailed Mr Hockey directly via his government email address saying that Mr Burnes has told me he [Mr Hockey] was ready to see me in Washington.</strong> Mr Hockey\u2019s assistant contacted me and arranged a meeting on at 10.30am on 26 April in the Australian embassy in Washington.</p> \n   <p>Ambassador Hockey, a Mr McPhillips and a Mr Richards were in attendance.</p> \n   <p><strong>We spoke for about an hour and was provided with Mr Hockey\u2019s travel frustrations, which I totally understood.</strong></p> \n   <p>After the meeting I left without any further communication until I returned to Australia and debriefed Mr Burnes on the meeting.</p> \n   <p><strong>I advised him that the embassy business would have to go to tender but there was a excellent opportunity to get that business, especially that wanted [sic] and to hub the America\u2019s travel out of Washington as discussed.</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>At the time Helloworld was looking at buying a corporate business in the USA, one based in the Washington area. I told Mr Hockey this.</strong></p> \n   <p>On my return I emailed Mr Hockey directly to his embassy email address <strong>and gave him the corporate travel options in detail. I </strong><strong>assume these details could have been used at a basis of the tender requirements if a tender came up.</strong></p> \n   <p>I sent a copy of that email to Mr Burnes. I also advised WoAG Travel I met Mr Hockey.</p> \n   <p><strong>The feedback from the WoAG Travel team was that they were uncomfortable with the meeting.</strong> I decided then that I would not follow up with Mr Hockey.</p> \n   <p><strong>I was advised later in a conversation that \u2018people\u2019 in Dfat were uncomfortable that Mr Hockey met me and that he was a shareholder of Helloworld.</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>If I remember correctly I did not know at the time of the meeting in Washington that he was a shareholder.</strong></p> \n   <p>Yours sincerely</p> \n   <p>Russell Carstensen</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T03:35:10.376Z\">at 3.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e1740e4b0cc09362e03d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T03:13:24.700Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labor has opened question time with the evidence in Senate estimates about Helloworld, specifically about \u201cHockey owes me\u201d.<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says he refers to the statement the company made to the ASX. </p> \n  <p>He says Hockey did not discuss the tender with the company.

However, I do not believe that evidence has been presented to demonstrate that the member for Goldstein\u2019s actions have prevented the committee in a fundamental way from continuing to fulfil its basic responsibilities in relation to its inquiry work.

The particular matters I would mention include:</p> \n   <p>\u2022 having a private website \u2018authorised by\u2019, and with the badging of, the chair of the committee, which appeared to solicit submissions and attendees at public hearings from just one perspective; and</p> \n   <p>\u2022 apparently arranging for a public hearing of the committee to coincide with the meeting of a group with an active interest in the committee\u2019s inquiry, including with the possible intention to engage in protest activity at the hearing.</p> \n   <p>As members would be aware, it is quite properly the role of the committee secretariat to seek submissions to inquiries and make arrangements for public hearings on behalf of a committee, and committee members and other interested parties should be able to expect that these arrangements will be made without influence or interference. </p> \n   <p>Inevitably political views influence some of the inquiries that committees conduct, but this shouldn\u2019t mean that committees would not approach their task open to the evidence which may be presented and with clear and proper processes. In this case, although I am satisfied there has been the potential for interference with evidence given to the committee, I have not been provided with material to demonstrate any interference has unduly prevented the committee from performing its work. If there is such evidence, for example from members of the committee itself, I would be happy to consider the matter further.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T02:26:13.483Z\">at 2.26am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6e040ee4b00307e95a74a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T01:51:15.058Z\">1.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KKeneally/status/1098399603618066432\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Labor supports drought relief and would fund it. <br>Labor does not support stealing from Infrastructure Australia &amp; the Building Australia Fund to fund drought relief, which is what the Libs &amp; Nats are doing.

However, he provided the summary.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe focus of the government now is cleaning up Labor\u2019s mess,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are currently considering options to address this issue \u2013 both legislative and non-legislative.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI can assure everyone that the focus of the government is making sure we do everything we can to keep Australia\u2019s borders safe.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T01:52:55.949Z\">at 1.52am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c6dfd90e4b00307e95a747f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisa-martin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-21T01:24:20.045Z\">1.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia\u2019s embassy in China has been denied access to the Chinese province of Xinjiang amid a security crackdown on Uighur people and claims of human rights abuses.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAccess has not been granted,\u201d a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official, <strong>Graham Fletcher, </strong>said.</p> \n  <p>The department told a Senate estimates hearing that the last time embassy staff visited was June 2016.

In light of recent misleading media coverage that has called this into question, we felt strongly it was important to state our position, experience and values clearly on behalf of the company.</p> \n   <p>As always our number one priority is the safety, security and wellbeing of all of our staff, the communities in which we operate and the people in our care.</p> \n   <p> We will not be making any further comment.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It includes this:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> This statement clarifies our relationship with High Risk Security Group (Asia-Pacific) Unipessoal Lda and its related Australian entity HRSG Australasia Pty Ltd (ABN 83 614 059 577) of Level 2, 128-134 Crown Street, Wollongong NSW 2500 (High Risk Group Companies). Neither business is owned, managed or controlled in any way by Paladin, its owners or Directors. We understand there is some confusion in the media around these unrelated entities and any potential bad debts and failed contracts that may be attributed to them.</p> \n   <p>We further clarify that High Risk Security Group Pty Ltd (ABN 64 144 000 573) is the original name of Paladin Group Pty Ltd, recently changed to Paladin Aus Pty Ltd (Paladin Aus). Notwithstanding the similarities in names, we can confirm that there was some discussion in 2009 about Paladin Aus and the High Risk Group Companies pursuing work together. This did not eventuate, and the entities are and always have been completely separate. In fact, Paladin has operated in competition to HRSG in Timor Leste under Sentinel Unipessoal Lda since 2015.</p> \n   <p>Further, we take this opportunity to advise that Paladin Aus Pty Ltd has no service delivery contracts in Australia and as such had been registered at a private residential address. This address has now been changed to a serviced office in Canberra.</p> \n   <p>We absolutely support the stated position of the Speaker of the PNG Parliament and Acting Governor General of PNG, the Honourable <strong>Job Pomat</strong> MP in his claims that he is not a party to any business by Paladin, its subcontractors (including Peren Investments Limited) and partners (including Pomwan Paladin Security Limited). We recognise the Speaker as a man of absolute integrity, a leader of his people and a respected clan leader in Manus Province.

There is a Newspoll next Monday, if I am not mistaken. And a lot of space for all it to play out. This is not the end of the week the government would have wanted. Plus, China seems to be causing all sorts of issues in the background. It\u2019s not over, is what I am saying. But my ability to take in another moment of this day, is. Make sure you check back with Guardian Australia for all the updates to these and every other story which pops up between now and 2 April. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Gabrielle Chan and everyone else on the Guardian\u2019s brains trust, along with me, will keep plugging away in between blogs, as usual. A very big thank you to everyone for dragging my caffeine-fuelled, eye-twitching shell across the line after what was a pretty insane start back to parliament. Even by the standards of the 45th. And as always, a massive thank you to everyone who followed along with us, today, and the past few days. You are the reason we all keep chugging along. But go take a break, have a breath, catch up on any movie missing from your pop culture repertoire. We\u2019ll all be back here before you know it. And very shortly after that, the election campaign will (officially) begin in earnest. And you know you\u2019ll need all your wits about you for that. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Sportsbet has wasted no time in opening its latest book: Julie Bishop\u2019s next job $3.50 Diplomat $6.00 Next governor general $14 Sky News TV host $26 Sunrise show host $26 Today show host $41 Breakfast radio host $51 West Coast Eagles chief executive $101 Sportsbet brand ambassador $501 Travel agent Julia Banks has given her take on the Julie Bishop announcement: \u201cAustralia wanted Julie Bishop to be our first woman Liberal prime minister and for me, and many Australians, particularly Australian women, this is a very sad day.\u201d Reuters has just filed this report: Customs at China\u2019s northern Dalian port has banned imports of Australian coal and will cap overall coal imports for 2019 through its harbors at 12m tonnes, an official at Dalian Port Group said on Thursday. The indefinite ban on imports from top supplier Australia, effective since the start of February, comes as major ports elsewhere in China prolong clearing times for Australian coal to at least 40 days. Coal is Australia\u2019s biggest export earner and the Australian dollar tumbled on the news, falling more than 1% to as low at $0.7086 AUD=D3. Quelle all of the surprise. ALL of it. And the House is done. Until 2 April. Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has been reading the interim independent report released by the government this afternoon on the Menindee Lakes fish kill. The report says the panel found no evidence a risk assessment was done at weir 32 before the fish kill, despite \u201ca likely blue-green algal event being identified in the WaterNSW Lower Darling operations plan over the 15 months prior to the fish death events occurring\u201d. The panel has made 20 recommendations, including that there be an investigation to identify sites where mass deaths of fish might occur in future. But Burke has suggested there is not enough focus in the report on the long-term problems in the country\u2019s largest river system. \u201cI\u2019m working through the report and the recommendations but on the face of it none of them involve more water, which is pretty important for fish,\u201d he said. Penny Wong has informed the Dfat estimates she does not intend to return to Helloworld, which releases many of the officials sitting in the back of the committee room. It sort of disappeared in the midst of, well, the giant wheelie bin that this day became, but the Law Council has responded to Peter Dutton\u2019s announcement of attempting to ban foreign fighters from returning. While matters of national security and protecting Australians from terrorism are of utmost importance, the federal parliament must ensure responses are proportional, constitutional and take into account Australia\u2019s international obligations. The introduction of temporary exclusion orders (TEOs) could have the effect of rendering an Australian unable to legally enter Australia \u2013 or indeed any other country if they are not a citizen of another country and hence have no right to enter another country \u2013 while the order is in place. As a result, these laws may be inconsistent with Australia\u2019s international obligations. It is the Law Council\u2019s view the government\u2019s proposed introduction of TEOs must be carefully considered and not rushed through the parliament. So much warmth Dfat offical Amanda Gorely approached the table to answer questions at Senate estimates about the US exiting the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, asks if she had ever asked her questions before because she looks nervous. The treaty bans the US and Russia from developing a certain ballistic and cruise missiles. America has cited Russia\u2019s non-compliance for the decision. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not a good development,\u201d Gorely said. The House has adjourned. We have been here for just seven days. SEVEN DAYS. It\u2019s been one of the longest years of my life. Mathias Cormann is not happy. He has just released this statement accusing Bill Shorten and Jim Chalmers of \u201cgrossly inaccurate assertions\u201d: \u201cUnder parliamentary privilege, Bill Shorten and Jim Chalmers made a number of grossly inaccurate assertions in relation to previous tender decisions on whole-of-government travel arrangements, which would otherwise be defamatory. \u201cIn relation to the 2014 decision to appoint QBT Pty Ltd as the new whole-of-government travel management services provider for a period of four years: \u201cFirstly, this was not a decision by me as minister or by the government. It was a procurement decision, which like all other procurement decisions in my portfolio made during my period as finance minister, was the result of an independent competitive tender process. \u201cSecondly, and more importantly, QBT/Helloworld back then was actually competing with Mr Andrew Burnes and the AOT business he was then the CEO of. \u201cIn fact, AOT participated in that tender and was unsuccessful. \u201cIn contrast, AOT and Mr Burnes were first awarded the whole-of-government accommodation program management services contract back in 2012 \u2013 that is during Labor\u2019s last period in government. \u201cIt is this contract, which was renewed in 2017 as a result of another independent tender process. \u201cWhile both the 2012 and 2014 contracts were appropriately subject to independent competitive tender processes, under the flawed Shorten/Chalmers Labor logic in the House of Representatives today \u2013 it was Labor which decided to give a contract to a Liberal donor, whereas the Liberal-National government awarded the 2014 contract Labor is criticising now to his competitor. \u201cASX records show that AOT only merged with Helloworld/QBT in early 2016, well after the independent tender decision made by the finance department back in 2014, which Mr Shorten and Mr Chalmers referenced in their inaccurate and baseless attack today. \u201cMr Shorten and Mr Chalmers could have and should have reviewed that material ASX announcement before launching such an unsubstantiated parliamentary attack. \u201cMr Shorten and Mr Chalmers should apologise for their baseless and inaccurate smear, which the most basic and rudimentary research would have exposed as such. \u201cFinally, given the hours of evidence I provided in Senate estimates earlier this week, both Mr Shorten and Mr Chalmers know (or at least should know), that I did not seek or obtain free travel. \u201cThe travel was never paid for by Helloworld as wrongly asserted by Labor as part of an increasingly desperate attempt to smear. It was booked with Helloworld, I supplied my credit card to pay for it at the time of making the booking, when the payment was not processed as the result of an administrative error on behalf of the company it remained listed as an outstanding debt, which was paid immediately when I was first notified that payment had not been processed.\u201d On his trade portfolio, Simon Birmingham says he is \u201cworking towards\u201d having the Indonesian free-trade-agreement, which was de-railed by the Jerusalem embassy debate, signed before the election. Patricia Karvelas: You say this is a disgruntled ex-staff member. Is it worth investigating whether he\u2019s a whistleblower and alleging something that is truthful? Simon Birmingham: Whistleblowering what? PK: Well, he\u2019s whistleblowing ... SB: What\u2019s the allegation you\u2019re making? PK: OK, I will share it with you. He got a quicker meeting as a result of Hockey owing him something. SB: How do you determine a quicker meeting? PK: Well, that\u2019s what he said. He said he secured a quicker meeting. SB: Our ambassadors meet with people all the time. PK: You don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything worth investigating here? SB: I don\u2019t see there is any allegation of impropriety. In fact, all of the evidence all week from every public servant and official about any procurement issues is that the letter of the law and the book in terms of policy process was followed every step of the way, completely detached from any political process. Simon Birmingham is speaking to the ABC and was asked about the email from Russell Carstensen, which set off a series of political bombs this afternoon: We have a disgruntled former employee of a business. It\u2019s not unusual for heads to meet with Australian business agents or representatives. It happens all the time. It would be happening in different countries at present. \u201cRegardless, there\u2019s nothing to suggest there is any impropriety. Yes the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a travel contract.\u201d Given the record of the government in appointing people from a Coalition background to the administrative appeals tribunal, I\u2019ve had a quick look at the background of the 35 new appointees. Among them we have: former Senate president Stephen Parry (Liberal); former Western Australian Legislative Assembly member Joe Frances (Liberal); former federal MP Bob Baldwin (Liberal). I\u2019m still waiting for the attorney general\u2019s office to furnish me with the full biographies of the appointees, but it looks like they have also appointed (or else they share a name with): Former Nationals MP De-Anne Kelly Former chief of staff to Jeff Kennett, John Griffin Former South Australian house of assembly Liberal MP Steven Griffiths The former speaker of WA parliament Michael Sutherland (Liberal) Former adviser to Alexander Downer Phoebe Dunn There\u2019s also a Jane Bell, who shares the name of someone contesting the Liberal preselection for Higgins. But lest you think appointments are a purely partisan exercise, it looks like the government has also appointed former Labor MP David Cox. You may remember that earlier in the week we posted about Barry O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s comments in agriculture estimates, where he said: \u201cHere\u2019s my question: there\u2019s a bigger chance of us having a biosecurity breach by us having a bloody old Chinaman who brings in his favourite sausage down the front of his undies.\u201d Well, the ABC reports he has been given a slap down by the prime minister: Today Mr Morrison posted on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, praising Chinese-Australians for their \u201cprofound influence\u201d and calling on Australians to \u201cunite as one to defend our hard-won, harmonious and free society\u201d. \u201cThe remarks made by senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan do not represent my views, nor do they represent the views of the Liberal and National parties\u2019 Coalition government. \u201cFor more than 200 years, Chinese immigrants have worked hard to contribute new ideas, helped shape Australia\u2019s identity and made outstanding contributions to the prosperity of Australian society.\u201d Some money for Australia\u2019s new $2bn infrastructure development bank for the Pacific is likely to be siphoned from the aid program. A Senate estimates hearing was told the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific would be made up of $500m in grants and $1.5bn to be funded from the federal budget. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the initiative last year as part of Australia\u2019s \u201cPacific step up\u201d, while visiting Port Moresby for the Apec leaders summit. The hearing was told the foreign affairs and trade department has not received any extra money to cover the $500m. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, wanted to know if cash from the aid budget would be diverted. \u201cThat is currently being considered by government and will be announced on budget night as part of the 2019-20 budget,\u201d a Dfat official, Paul Wood, said. Asked what areas of the aid budget had been excluded for cuts, Dfat\u2019s secretary, Frances Adamson, said nothing was being ruled out. \u201cWe are open-minded about the choices the government may want to make,\u201d she said. The aid program has been hit with more than $11bn in funding cuts since 2013 when the Coalition came to power. And because it is that sort of day, the government has released the independent assessment of fish deaths interim report. Insert trash bag emojis here. From the government release: The interim report is published on the MDBA website. Provisional findings: Page 43: \u201cThe fish deaths in the lower Darling were preceded and affected by exceptional climatic conditions, unparalleled in the observed climate record. \u201cRunoff responses to rainfall in the northern basin appear to have been more severely reduced during recent drought when compared to previous droughts, compounding the impacts on long-term water availability. \u201c2017-18 flows on the Darling river at Bourke and Wilcannia were the lowest observed at those points over the last 20 years.\u201d Page 44: \u201cHot conditions resulted in significant algal blooms in Lake Pamamaroo, the weir pools of the Menindee main weir and weir 32. \u201cContinued hot conditions, combined with low flow, caused the weir pools to stratify. High fish numbers and algal biomass became concentrated in the epilimnion (surface water) and hypoxic or anoxic conditions developed in the hypolimnion (bottom waters). \u201cSudden reductions in air temperature and increased wind associated with storms caused water in the weir pools to suddenly de-stratify, resulting in low oxygen water throughout the water column and no escape for the fish. This was the primary cause of the fish deaths.\u201d Provisional recommendations: Page 45: Rec 1: \u201cUndertake a risk assessment to identify parts of the basin most at risk of fish death events. This should inform the development of early warning signals and crisis intervention plans.\u201d Rec 2: \u201cAddress gaps in water quality monitoring (dissolved oxygen, temperature, algae) at high risk sites across the basin.\u201d Rec 4: \u201cSupport emerging initiatives within the basin to remove barriers to fish movement, especially in locations with high stratification potential and locations that act as refuges during low flow events.\u201d Rec 5: Continue short-term efforts to prevent further fish deaths through use of aerators and other technologies as well as fish translocations, noting these are short-term emergency measures and may not prevent additional fish death events if adverse conditions arise again.\u2019 Rec 9: \u201cProgress implementation of the northern basin toolkit measures, prioritising those that would support native fish population\u2019s recovery (eg fish passage). Rec 16: \u201cIntroduce real-time monitoring of diversions in the Barwon-Darling to ensure protection of managed connectivity events.\u201d (IE, protect environmental flows from harvest.) It would be no mistake that Julie Bishop is wearing white as she made this statement. Her speech made it clear she wants a woman to replace her. It was filled with her accomplishments as the first woman to fill certain positions. White stands out very solidly against the blue and black suits of her many, many male colleagues. And white, of course, is the colour of the suffragette movement. There is no way it was a coincidence. The official statement from Scott Morrison on Julie Bishop\u2019s retirement: \u201cJulie Bishop is a giant of the Liberal party and she has been a groundbreaker for women in public life. \u201cJulie has been a good friend. I have valued her judgment, appreciated her insight and admired the tireless way she has served the party, the parliament and Australia. \u201cOn behalf of the government and the Liberal party, I thank Julie for her great service to Australia for nearly two decades. \u201cJulie was deputy leader of the Liberal party from 2007 to 2018 and played a critical role in our election to government in 2013. \u201cAs the first woman to be deputy leader of the Liberal party and the first woman to be Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie\u2019s place in the Liberal party pantheon and in the history of the Howard government and this government is secure. \u201cThere are many achievements from her time as foreign minister in which Julie can be proud: the New Colombo Plan, the establishment of the Dfat innovationXchange and strengthening Australia\u2019s relations throughout the Pacific. \u201cHowever, I believe her greatest achievement was her work in the days after flight MH17 was brutally felled. Julie\u2019s judgment, determination and energy helped secure a United Nations security council resolution that ensured Australia and its partners could repatriate the victims of that terrible crime. Australia has not forgotten those terrible days and still waits for the perpetrators of that crime to be brought to justice. \u201cJulie was one of Australia\u2019s truly great foreign ministers. In the Liberal party she will take her place alongside the greatest foreign ministers of our history: Casey, Hasluck and Downer. \u201cJulie is enormously popular with party members across Australia and for more than a decade, in addition to her travels as foreign minister, Julie has hit the highways and byways of our country in support of our members and candidates. \u201cOn behalf of the party and the government, I wish Julie well in the next chapter of her life. I have no doubt it will be a roaring success.\u201d Julie Bishop continued, in what became an impromptu valedictory speech: \u201cIt is time for a new member to take my place. I will leave the seat of Curtin in very good shape, indeed, a winning position for the Liberal party. \u201cWhen I first contested the seat in 1998, I won the election with a primary vote of 44.6%. At the last election, my seventh election, my primary vote was 65.6%. Within, essentially, the same electoral boundary. \u201cWith a two-party preferred vote of 71%, with an experienced campaign team and campaign funds already in place, I am confident that a Liberal candidate will have every opportunity to win the support of the people of Curtin. \u201cIt has been an immense honour to be the longest-serving member for Curtin. And also to be the deputy leader of the Liberal party. The first female to hold the role for 11 years, over half my entire political career. \u201cAnd I am also proud of the fact that I am the first woman to contest the leadership ballot of the Liberal party in its 75-year history. \u201cIt has also been an immense honour to serve in cabinet, first as the minister for education, science and training and women\u2019s issues, and then as the minister for foreign affairs. Australia\u2019s first female foreign minister. And I am so very proud that my successor, senator Marise Payne, will be, and is, the second female foreign minister of Australia. \u201cMy five years as foreign minister were a particular privilege being able to represent Australia on the world stage. We should be so proud of our reputation and the high regard in which we are held as a nation. \u201cAnd open liberal democracy, committed to freedoms and the rule of law, and democratic institutions, and open, highly competitive export-oriented market economy, entering out 28th consecutive year of uninterrupted economic growth, a world record, with a lifestyle and standard of living that is unparalleled. I thank and acknowledge the prime ministers in whose cabinets I served: John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull. \u201cI thank the Liberal party of Australia, my division of Curtin, the state division, my colleagues, past and present in this place, and the Liberal party members across Australia and living overseas everywhere, for the remarkable opportunity they have afforded me to be a member of the House of Representatives since 1998. \u201cI have been blessed to have worked with some outstanding political and ministerial staff, who shared my passion for my political and policy endeavours, and I thank them, particularly Murray Hansen, my closest adviser for 14 years. \u201cI thank my, beautiful supportive family, my siblings, and David Panton and his family. \u201cAnd I say to my many close and trusted friends: I look forward to seeing a more of you. \u201cAs I said in this place, in my first speech in November 1998, I was brought up to believe that entering public office should be one of the highest callings and that being able to direct your energies and abilities to the betterment of your state or your country was one of the greatest contributions you could make. \u201cAnd that I had always had an intense conviction that an individual can make a difference to the life of the times. \u201cThat remains my view. I also set out a goal in that speech, to represent the people of Curtin with all the vigour and courage and ability that I had to offer, with honesty, decency, and above all, to put their interests above my own. \u201cMr Speaker, I will leave this place positive about the future, proud of the service that I have been able to give to my electric of Curtin, my beloved Liberal party, the state of Western Australia, and my country.\u201d Julie Bishop: During the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to closely consider the future of the coalition government, and the pending general election. I have closely observed Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Liberal National team in the Parliament, in Question Time, in the party room, in press conferences, and elsewhere. And it is evident that the policy platform that we will take to the next election is crystallising based on the very firm foundations of our unrelenting focus on prudent management of our national finances, so that we can afford the services that Australians need. In returning the budget to surplus. In paying down debt. In lowering taxes. In backing enterprise. And job creation. And growing the economy for the benefit of all Australians. And, Mr Speaker, Australians will remember that in 2007 the Labor Party promised to deliver responsible budgets. Yet in government, they trashed the national finances through wasteful and reckless spending. Labor also promised to maintain strong border protection, yet in government, they presided over one of the greatest policy failures in a generation when they weakened those border protection laws. Mr Speaker, during the last two weeks it has become evidence that Labor has learned nothing from its past failings, and is doomed to repeat these failings should it be re-elected. It is thus my view that the Liberal National coalition will win the next election... And that the government will be returned to office because it is focusing on the matter to the Australian people. And on that basis, I have reconsidered my position as the Member for Curtin. I have been contacted by a number of talented, indeed extraordinary, people, including women, who have indicated to me that should I not reconsidered the seat of Curtin, they would seek preselection from the Curtin division of the Liberal Party for that seat. Accordingly, I will not re-contest the seat of Curtin at the next election. And I will work hard in the meantime to assist a new Liberal candidates to win the seat. The government has just announced about a million administrative appeals tribunal appointments, including former senator Stephen Parry. Scott Morrison: \u201cI think it is important to mark the speech that we have just heard from the member for Curtin, simply to acknowledge her tremendous service to our country, her tremendous service to her community, tremendous service to the party, the Liberal party. \u201cJulie is a Liberal through and through and she has always held fast to those important liberal principles. \u201cWe share many things in common \u2013 not just thinking that Tina Arena is the best female singer in the country \u2013 but apart from that, Mr Speaker, her passion that she has always brought to her role, the dignity and grace that she has demonstrated in every single role she has held. She is an incredibly classy individual as we remarked in our own party room ... \u201cWhen my favourite verses relate to the phrase that says \u2018Well done good and faithful servant\u2019 and that is a phrase that I think very much speaks to the service from the member for Curtin. \u201cHer successor will have big shoes to fill and we know that Julie has the best shoes! They will take some filling and I have no doubt that the person who fills the shoes as the member for Curtin, that the former member for Curtin will be there to support them all the way.\u201d In Senate estimates Marise Payne played tribute to Bishop\u2019s efforts as foreign affairs minister in the past five years and praised her \u201cleadership and drive\u201d contributing to Australia\u2019s high standing in the world. The committee chair, James McGrath, joked Bishop had never had the \u201chappy burden\u201d of fronting Senate estimates. Bill Shorten also responds. He says Julie Bishop and his wife, Chloe, were always very good friends and mentions she should be considered for roles in public service, away from politics. I am sure she will not be short of offers, but as she contemplates public service I think we need to do better at former prime ministers and public ministers. ... In all my dealings and watching her, I think about a time when as foreign minister MH17 was shot out of the skies, and this terrible tragedy and murder that it was. I just remember about the flight MH17 the morning we gathered here in the chamber to learn about the news; 38 Australian lives stolen, but a lot of that fell to her, the calm and composure and kindness that I saw firsthand and she would show up for the families and it was real. It was authentic. The grief and bewilderment. I remember the service in Melbourne at St Patrick\u2019s and she was, she really was, a leader. But I also saw her steely determination in international forums to pursue justice and she was very strong. On that regard, if any of us were ever to be privileged to be in the position she was in, dealing with the Russians and other people, I hope that any of us would show the same strength she showed and she did and that is to her credit. She did Australia proud that day and in those weeks. I wish Julie and David well in everything that is ahead and I feel that the Liberal party can have nothing but good regard for her because she has been a faithful servant to the Liberal party and she has done everything she should for that party. Congratulations to the member for Curtin.\u201d In response to Julie Bishop\u2019s announcement, Scott Morrison says he is reminded of the verse (one of his favourites, he says), \u201c\u2018Well done good and faithful servant,\u2019 and that is a phrase that I think very much speaks to the service from the the member for Curtin too. \u201cHer successor will have big shoes to fill and we know that Julie has the best shoes! They will take some filling and I have no doubt that the person who fills those shoes as the member for Curtin, that the former member for Curtin will be there to support them all the way.\u201d Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, has tried to get to the bottom of how Free TV Australia came to be approached by the federal government to provide Australian content to the Pacific region. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced in January a $17.1m partnership to beam 1,000 hours of Australian TV content to Pacific island countries. There\u2019s speculation Nine Network\u2019s popular Married At First Sight could be broadcast as part of Australia\u2019s soft diplomacy effort. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials confirmed the idea didn\u2019t come from any reviews under way. A department official, Kathy Klugman, said the idea was generated at ministerial level. Wong expressed surprise at the decision given that commercial television networks said they had no existing partnerships in the Pacific and hadn\u2019t asked for the money. A testy exchange between Wong and the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, followed. Payne defended the government\u2019s \u201cPacific step up\u201d and said sports content from commercial networks was of particular interest to Pacific audiences. \u201cYou might be derogatory, but we think we can extend and further enhance contacts into the Pacific using more than just one route,\u201d she said. \u201cThe narrow focus you appear to be articulating is not the narrow focus of this government.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be condescending,\u201d Wong responded. Wong likened the decision to the $443.8m funding granted to the Great Barrier Reef foundation. The hearing was told there had been no tender process. Wong said the government\u2019s ideological bias against the ABC had resulted in it being excluded. But Payne rejected that claim saying the ABC had existing broadcasting in Pacific and she had enormous respect for the two public broadcasters. \u201cI will leave this place positive about the future, proud of the service I have been able to give to my electorate of Curtin, my beloved Liberal party, my state of Western Australia, and my country.\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer is up there for the first hug and Julie Bishop exits stage left. Literally. She just walked out. Jane Prentice and Nola Marino were very close behind her. It is being pointed out to me by people in the chamber that Christian Porter, who was very strongly rumoured to want the (very safe) seat of Curtin, is not in the chamber to hear this. She points out that she was the first woman to contest the leadership ballot in the party\u2019s 75-year history. Julie Bishop says she has been contacted by a number of people, including a number of impressive women, interested in taking her place, if she chose not to recontest. Julie Bishop says she has spent the past few weeks to \u201cclosely observe\u201d the future of the government. And she has closely observed Scott Morrison. And that the policy platform has crystallised. But then she makes it clear that it is about growing the economy. And that the platform is a good one. She goes through a list of Labor\u2019s \u201cpolicy failures\u201d when it was last in government. And that Labor has learned \u201cnothing\u201d from its past failings and will repeat them, if elected. She says that it is her view the government will be elected in the next election. \u201cAnd it is on that basis I have reconsidered my position\u201d for the next election. So, she is out. \u201cI will not recontest the seat of Curtin at the next election.\u201d And we are still in the chamber for Julie Bishop\u2019s expected retirement announcement. You can watch Penny Wong dropping her Helloworld bombshell here, courtesy of our video team. Ayes - 65 Noes - 69 Just a musing. A bishop can move as far as it wants in chess, as long as it\u2019s diagonally. I mean, there really aren\u2019t that many women MPs in the Liberal party to choose from in the first place. And certainly not that many left which would qualify for \u201cbig\u201d. If you are picking up what I am putting down. And meanwhile... Jim Chalmers, who has been asking the questions in the House today, predicts Joe Hockey will go. That animates the government benches. There is much bristling. Chalmers leans over the dispatch box and points at Scott Morrison: \u201cI\u2019m saying you should sack him sunshine.\u201d Chalmers says Morrison first stole Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s job, and now he\u2019s \u201cstealing his jokes\u201d. If you are just tuning in, and this makes absolutely no sense at all, see my post a couple of minutes ago: Morrison was using Turnbull\u2019s attack lines against Bill Shorten. The vote on the suspension is happening now. I can only see Andrew Wilkie and Adam Bandt of the crossbenchers. They are voting with Labor. The division has been called in the House. Scott Morrison winds up his contribution this way. Labor can\u2019t be trusted to make Australia stronger. They will only make Australia weaker. Scott Morrison declares Labor is \u201chopelessly divided\u201d on the issues Australians care about. The government has been attempting to make that line stick throughout question time. Hopelessly divided. Government MPs are back in the chamber to hear the prime minister battle out the suspension. But they aren\u2019t very animated. This isn\u2019t the note that the parliamentary week was supposed to end on. Scott Morrison has risen to respond to the suspension. The prime minister responds in kind. This is a leader of the Labor party who has been sucking up around the Melbourne elite all of his life as he sought to climb up the greasy pole, over one body and another, as he\u2019s sought to destroy them all as members opposite know only too well.\u201d There is a ghost of Malcolm Turnbull in the chamber. These were the former prime minister\u2019s lines. Bill Shorten at the dispatch box: \u201cI start this speech with the following words: Hockey owes me. That tells you everything you need to know about this government. Somebody owes a Liberal donor, so they get a meeting. A Liberal minister owes their mates who run a small private foundation, so they get $500m. A Liberal minister owes a chum who gets a juicy contract. The Liberals owe the big banks big time, so they vote against a royal commission 26 times. \u201cThis is a Liberal government of their donors, by the donors, for the donors.\u201d This language is lethal in the current political climate, should that fact not be obvious to folks listening on at home. One set of rules for politicians, another rule for everyone else. The prime minister is preparing his speech, conversing periodically with Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. Penny Wong asks if either Frances Adamson or Daniel Sloper are aware of any concerns within Dfat or the commonwealth more generally about Joe Hockey\u2019s actions. They answer no. And ... here\u2019s the suspension of the standing orders. Bill Shorten opens with a broader travel question. The Speaker, Tony Smith, advises the deputy prime minister to \u201cstop bellowing\u201d so the question might be heard. Shorten asks: \u201cIn the last financial year, this government spent more than $600 million of taxpayer money on travel. Can the prime minister confirm that minister Cormann abolished the government travel panel, made it compulsory for all government travel to be booked through Helloworld companies, and moved a senior public servant because Helloworld thought he was driving too hard a bargain. Why hasn\u2019t the prime minister recalled ambassador Hockey and sacked minister Cormann?\u201d The prime minister doesn\u2019t take the question. Labor points out this failure to respond is a bit, well ... naff. Smith says that\u2019s procedure folks, let\u2019s keep moving. Christopher Pyne says Hockey hasn\u2019t been recalled because he is \u201cdoing a darn good job\u201d. And just further to Murph\u2019s posts about what Frances Adamson said during estimates about the Helloworld stuff, it included this quote: There are whole range of things you have raised today I think we need to think about and we need to provide answers to you. I\u2019m not in a position now to say that in all respects those actions have met the standards.\u201d I have just been reminded that a little earlier Dfat said Joe Hockey was on a flight. I hope it has wifi! Penny Wong takes over. \u201cJust to be specific,\u201d she says. No one moves and everyone stays silent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just meant I was going to specific questions. What did you think I said,\u201d she asks. \u201cJust stay there,\u201d a Dfat official answered. \u201cNo one moved, senator.\u201d And for the record, Christian Porter has just issued this statement: In an interview this morning I was asked about reports concerning travel company QBT and I indicated that they had not been successful in a tender for government travel. Clearly, I had conflated recent publicity concerning AOT and its success in securing a whole-of-government travel contract with a separate Dfat contract. I am advised that the Dfat contract has not been settled.\u201d Jim Chalmers asks, back in question time: has anyone declared an interest with Helloworld with the prime minister this week? He wonders whether there might be a rush to update the pecuniary interest register once parliament rises? The prime minister takes that one. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any,\u201d Scott Morrison says, noting if there are new declarations they will be made in the normal way. He says he will update the House \u201cif there is anything further to add\u201d. Kimberley Kitching has taken over questioning in Dfat estimates. She is asking whether Dfat knows whether Joe Hockey has hosted the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, as after the change of government SA moved it\u2019s government travel to Helloworld. The question is taken on notice. Kitching also points out that Helloworld\u2019s motto is \u201cWe have the right people in the right places\u201d, with a very Kitching smile. Labor is back with comments from the attorney general, Christian Porter, in one of his thousands of interviews this morning. Porter suggested the tender in question was complete. That isn\u2019t right, it\u2019s ongoing. (I confess I missed this when Porter said it.) Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers wonders if the government has been following the progress of a tender which is supposed to be conducted at arm\u2019s length? Porter says he made a mistake: \u201cIt was just an error. I have no knowledge about the contract.\u201d And it must be remembered that the Helloworld story started with Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age reporting on Mathias Cormann having \u201cno idea\u201d he hadn\u2019t been charged for his family\u2019s flights to Singapore. That led to Cormann admitting that he booked at least three trips directly from the Liberal party treasurer, donor and Helloworld boss, Andrew Burne. And, just a few days later, here we are. It\u2019s just before 11pm in Washington. I can\u2019t imagine Joe Hockey is getting much rest though. Marise Payne has just \u201cclarified\u201d that the attorney general, Christian Porter, got the answer wrong when he said he understood the travel tender process involving Helloworld had finished. In the midst of this, Jason Wood has released this report. From the release: A parliamentary inquiry has found evidence of loopholes in migration law which enable electronic travel authority (ETA) (subclass 601) visa holders to exploit Australia\u2019s immigration system and unscrupulous individuals providing unregistered immigration advice, unlawful registered migration agents and education agents are exploiting visa applicants. Mr Wood said the committee has heard that a percentage of Malaysian nationals are using travel visas as a gateway to circumvent Australia\u2019s immigration system and enter and stay in Australia and obtain work by applying for a protection visa. \u2018This represents an orchestrated scam that provides protection visa applicants the right to work in Australia until their claims are finalised,\u2019 Mr Wood said. \u2018This process has taken up to eight years in some cases and has cost the Australian taxpayer over $46 million in the last three years.\u2019 The report recommends fast-tracking the process for electronic travel authority (ETA) (subclass 601) visa holders who have lodged a protection visa application. Chair of the joint standing committee on migration, Jason Wood MP, stated that evidence from the inquiry also found that some individuals have been left substantially out of pocket after being exploited by either unregistered or registered migration agents or education agents. \u2018While the majority of registered migration agents and education agents are diligent, knowledgeable, hardworking and competent and provide outstanding service, there are individuals in these industries that take advantage of vulnerable consumers,\u2019 Mr Wood said. \u2018Victims of unscrupulous and unlawful migration or education agents are left with very few options for taking action and are unable to seek recompense. The relevant authorities face multiple challenges in detecting, deterring, disrupting, investigating and prosecuting cases.\u2019 The final report of the inquiry into the regulation of migration agents, tabled in the House of Representatives today recommends establishing an immigration assistance complaints commissioner with broad regulatory powers over the migration and education agent industry. The full report can be found on the committee\u2019s website: www.aph.gov.au/mig Labor tracks back to the evidence from Frances Adamson, the secretary of Dfat, pointing out that her endorsement of Joe Hockey\u2019s behaviour was not unqualified during this morning\u2019s appearance. (That\u2019s correct, it wasn\u2019t.) Scott Morrison again declines to answer. Christopher Pyne repeats what he said earlier about proper process in relation to \u201cHollow World\u201d, which prompts an eruption of laughter on the other side. The Dfat committee is now discussing China. Labor is back with Helloworld. Why did the prime minister withhold the critical fact yesterday that Hockey attended the meeting in person to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel arrangements? Christopher Pyne has a point of order: this question is in breach of the standing orders. Speaker Tony Smith says he respectfully disagrees with this opinion. He calls the leader of the House on behalf of the prime minister. Scott Morrison has not answered one of these questions. Not one. They have all been directed to the prime minister. Pyne says: \u201cAs has been pointed out yesterday, and as I pointed out again today, the Australian embassy staff meeting with QBT on 26 April 2017, which is the meeting in question, was not in relation to the tender process.\u201d So the question isn\u2019t answered. Labor is persisting with Helloworld, and the evidence given by Dfat officials this morning. Can the prime minister confirm officials were unaware before the meeting that Joe Hockey had a major shareholding in Helloworld, and not told about the conflict of interest until after the meeting? Christopher Pyne hides behind the secretary of Dfat, Frances Adamson. \u201cMr Speaker, I can confirm that the secretary of Dfat said the actions Mr Hockey undertook in declaring his conflict of interest are entirely appropriate.\u201d The committee has moved on to Rex Patrick asking Dfat questions about Julian Assange. I\u2019ll spare you the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, because I\u2019m reasonably confident you don\u2019t need to know. Labor is back with Hockey: can the prime minister confirm Hockey set up a meeting with a company he has shareholding in (worth over a million) because, in the words of the Helloworld boss, the ambassador \u201cowes him\u201d. A sharp reflection follows from Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Jim Chalmers, on Hockey\u2019s professionalism. Christopher Pyne says Joe Hockey is a \u201cgreat Australian\u201d. We are back to the bottom drawer, and Labor waiting until its \u201cpolitical fortunes dipped\u201d before springing this story out of the bottom drawer. \u201cThe Australian people are not stupid,\u201d Pyne notes. \u201cThey can sort their way through the Canberra bubble.\u201d There\u2019s a flourish on Labor being weak on border protection. Also worth noting \u2013 Christian Porter this morning was asked about the travel tender while chatting to the ABC Breakfast show. He answered: Well I understand that they were unsuccessful in that tender.\u201d Dfat, as part of estimates, has confirmed the tender process is ongoing and is only known to a small number of officials within the department. The second question from Labor is very tight. What is the prime minister\u2019s response to \u201cHockey owes me\u201d? The leader of the House, Christopher Pyne, answers the question, not Scott Morrison. There is some confusion from the Speaker about why Pyne is answering. Pyne, as he does, ploughs on. \u201cThe Labor party is trying to smear Joe Hockey,\u201d Pyne says. Pyne says Hockey has \u201cnothing to do with the outcome of the decision-making process in the tender, which is actually ongoing. It has not been completed with, and the decision-maker is the Dfat chief financial officer. Pyne says Labor is clutching at straws. There\u2019s an observation about over-egging the omelette. At this point the Speaker suggests he is being \u201cirrelevant to the question\u201d. For those who couldn\u2019t see it on the tweet, here is the text of the email Penny Wong was just reading from: My name is Russell Carstensen. I\u2019ve been advised by a friend that my name was mentioned in the Senate\u2019s estimate committee today. I\u2019ve just have had a chance to watch the committee and I felt that the context of my meeting with ambassador Hockey needed clarification. I\u2019m no longer working for Helloworld nor have any financial or investment connection with Helloworld. I left the company officially in August last year. I was group general manager of QBT (and APX, New Zealand\u2019s equivalent of QBT). I ran that business when QBT won the WoAG travel tender. This was before the merger of AOT and Helloworld in around 2015/6. After that merger I reported directly to Andrew Burnes who was the major shareholder and CEO of the new group. The AOT WoAG hotel corporate business was put under my control just before I left the business and I was involved with last year\u2019s AOT tender WoAG strategy meetings but none of the meeting with WoAG. Early 2017 Andrew Burnes advised me that his long-term friend Mr Hockey was frustrated that his travel arrangements were unprofessional and with limited hours of operations. I could understand this would be a frustration in that position. Mr Burnes told me that he was going to arrange a meeting with Mr Hockey and me at some point in the first half of 2017. As we had the Dfat contract via the Australian WoAG deed I assumed that there could be an extension done to cover all Australian embassies worldwide. I found out later that they weren\u2019t covered in any way in the deed. My relationship with the Department of Finances WoAG travel team has always been professional, transparent, trusting and friendly but with proper governance processes in place that were never crossed. They are hardworking, honest and extremely dedicated to ensure that the Australian taxpayer gets full value for money. QBT provided excellent travel services to the Australian federal government. Around the date of 23 April 2017 I was in Europe on personal leave and some business and was planning to fly directly home to Melbourne when I was contacted by Mr Burnes via email/SMS and voice call to tell me he had arranged a meeting with Mr Hockey and I had to fly home via Washington to meet with him. I asked Mr Burnes how could this be done so quickly. He verbally advised me, \u2018Hockey owes me.\u2019 I found that \u2018owes me\u2019 comment strange in the circumstances, but it\u2019s not an unusual term from Mr Burnes when talking about his business relationships. I knew Mr Burnes and Mrs Burnes have had a long-term friendship with Mr Hockey and his family. As all my emails and meeting notes were handed back to Helloworld on my departure from the business I haven\u2019t got all the exact times or dates, but from memory which does serve me well. I emailed Mr Hockey directly via his government email address saying that Mr Burnes has told me he [Mr Hockey] was ready to see me in Washington. Mr Hockey\u2019s assistant contacted me and arranged a meeting on at 10.30am on 26 April in the Australian embassy in Washington. Ambassador Hockey, a Mr McPhillips and a Mr Richards were in attendance. We spoke for about an hour and was provided with Mr Hockey\u2019s travel frustrations, which I totally understood. After the meeting I left without any further communication until I returned to Australia and debriefed Mr Burnes on the meeting. I advised him that the embassy business would have to go to tender but there was a excellent opportunity to get that business, especially that wanted [sic] and to hub the America\u2019s travel out of Washington as discussed. At the time Helloworld was looking at buying a corporate business in the USA, one based in the Washington area. I told Mr Hockey this. On my return I emailed Mr Hockey directly to his embassy email address and gave him the corporate travel options in detail. I assume these details could have been used at a basis of the tender requirements if a tender came up. I sent a copy of that email to Mr Burnes. I also advised WoAG Travel I met Mr Hockey. The feedback from the WoAG Travel team was that they were uncomfortable with the meeting. I decided then that I would not follow up with Mr Hockey. I was advised later in a conversation that \u2018people\u2019 in Dfat were uncomfortable that Mr Hockey met me and that he was a shareholder of Helloworld. If I remember correctly I did not know at the time of the meeting in Washington that he was a shareholder. Yours sincerely Russell Carstensen Labor has opened question time with the evidence in Senate estimates about Helloworld, specifically about \u201cHockey owes me\u201d. Scott Morrison says he refers to the statement the company made to the ASX. He says Hockey did not discuss the tender with the company. We are then back to the bubble and the preoccupations of the Canberra bubble, and the bottom drawer. Labor has had this story in its bottom drawer for ages, the prime minister says, so why only bring this up now? Then we are on to Labor\u2019s general arrogance. \u201cHockey owes me\u201d is left to hang, friendless, in the air. \u201cHockey owes me. \u201cI find that \u2018owes me\u2019 comment strange in the circumstances,\u201d Penny Wong says to break the silence. It continues. \u201cStill all good?\u201d Wong asks wryly, her eyebrow at peak arch. \u201cNo comment from the minister?\u201d More silence. \u201cWell senator, you are reading an email from a third party\u201d Marise Payne starts. \u201cYeah,\u201d Wong says. Who claims that a meeting which was a pitch meeting and I will put to you a reasonable descriptor, given both this email and the emails Dfat has now provided, a pitch email from a company in which the ambassador has a financial interest, arranged at short notice by a bloke who claims the ambassador owes him. Does anybody consider that to be a problem? I suspect the Australian people do, but does anybody at the table consider that to be a problem?\u201d Payne responds. \u201cSenator, the language that you are using is, as I have said, as I tried to say, is contained in an email from a third party, which we have no opportunity to verify with those about who it is written. So you, I presume, will continue to read it into the record and we are in the position of not being able to seek a response on any of the assertions contained [and is made] in these emails. It does put the department and senior officials at a disadvantage.\u201d Russell Carstensen no longer works for Helloworld. Penny Wong has receipts. And she is not afraid to deploy them. She has just read out from an email from Russell Carstensen. Joe Hockey has not seen this email. \u201cMr Carstensen says he was in Europe on the 23rd of April on personal leave and was going to go straight from Europe to Melbourne, where he lives, apparently, when he was contacted by Mr Burnes by email and sms and voice call, \u2018to tell me he had arranged a meeting with Mr Hockey and I had to fly home via Washington to meet with him\u2019. \u201cI asked Mr Burnes how this could be done so quickly and he verbally advised, \u2018Hockey owes me.\u2019 There is silence in response to this. Beats and beats of silence. Right, Penny Wong is back in Dfat estimates. There are emails. So we are going to cover the next hour a little differently. Murph is going into the chamber and cover question time for me, and I am going to stay and cover the committee. It is almost question time. Hello world, this is me ... Gai Brodtmann says she decided to leave politics to give her \u201cheart and soul\u201d to her family and friends. Her mother turned 80 and some friends died recently, too young, and she said it has given her perspective on what is really important in life. She has dedicated a lot of her speech to her staff, colleagues, friends and family, including her husband, Nine\u2019s political editor, Chris Uhlmann, who is watching from the press gallery, thanking them for their support. Gai Brodtmann picks up on a common theme which has run through the valedictories lately no matter what side: people have lost trust in the democratic institutions and politicians. She says not enough attention is placed on the behaviour of parliamentarians. She says the contest doesn\u2019t have to be personal, and it doesn\u2019t need to be \u201ca bloodsport\u201d. She asks that in her final days the contest focuses on policy, not personality. It gets a round of applause from the public gallery. Gai Brodtmann is delivering her valedictory speech to the chamber. She was first elected to the seat of Canberra (to be known as Bean after the next election) in 2010, but announced in August she planned to retire from parliament at the next poll for personal reasons. Peter Dutton has introduced legislation to stop foreign fighters, mostly to address the issue of those people who left Australia to fight in Syria for the Islamic State. From his release: The home affairs minister said temporary exclusion orders, announced with the prime minister on 22 November 2018, recognise the need to control the return and re-entry of foreign fighters and other Australians of counter-terrorism interest. \u201cIt is vital for our national security that we deal with Australians who travelled to the conflict zone in Iraq and Syria as far from our shores as possible. \u201cAustralians who are involved in supporting terrorism, and who may have fought with terrorists in Syria or Iraq, pose a significant threat, especially since the military collapse of [Isis]. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing temporary exclusion orders which would prevent Australians involved in terrorism overseas from legally returning to Australia for up to two years. \u201cThe ... orders allow law enforcement and national security agencies to delay, and then monitor and control the return to our community of these people.\u201d The orders, based on the UK regime of the same name, can prevent a person from obtaining an Australian passport. Under the legislation, the minister can make an order on a person if they suspect on reasonable grounds that the order would prevent a terrorist act, support for a terrorist act, training with a terrorist organisation or support for a terrorist organisation. A person subject to an order can only return legally to Australia through a return permit issued by the minister, for example, for deportation to Australia by a foreign country. \u201cThe return permit can specify the conditions under which the person returns to Australia, such as date of return, specific flights and security arrangements, to further manage any potential threat,\u201d he said. Tony Smith\u2019s statement to the House on Tim Wilson has been published on the live minutes. You can find the whole thing here but these paragraphs sum it up: I appreciate the concerns that may have been raised by the actions of the member for Goldstein and the actions could be seen to have caused damage to the committee\u2019s reputation and the reputation of the House committee system more generally. However, I do not believe that evidence has been presented to demonstrate that the member for Goldstein\u2019s actions have prevented the committee in a fundamental way from continuing to fulfil its basic responsibilities in relation to its inquiry work. I therefore do not propose to give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the committee of privileges and members\u2019 interests. As I have noted, while I do not believe the actions of the member for Goldstein meet the test set out in section 4 of the Privileges Act, I believe his actions have not always conformed with what I see as the conventions usually observed by chairs of House committees and the practice of House committees. The particular matters I would mention include: \u2022 having a private website \u2018authorised by\u2019, and with the badging of, the chair of the committee, which appeared to solicit submissions and attendees at public hearings from just one perspective; and \u2022 apparently arranging for a public hearing of the committee to coincide with the meeting of a group with an active interest in the committee\u2019s inquiry, including with the possible intention to engage in protest activity at the hearing. As members would be aware, it is quite properly the role of the committee secretariat to seek submissions to inquiries and make arrangements for public hearings on behalf of a committee, and committee members and other interested parties should be able to expect that these arrangements will be made without influence or interference. Inevitably political views influence some of the inquiries that committees conduct, but this shouldn\u2019t mean that committees would not approach their task open to the evidence which may be presented and with clear and proper processes. In this case, although I am satisfied there has been the potential for interference with evidence given to the committee, I have not been provided with material to demonstrate any interference has unduly prevented the committee from performing its work. If there is such evidence, for example from members of the committee itself, I would be happy to consider the matter further. Meanwhile Department of Social Services staff have been asked some tricky questions about a new report into the cashless debit card that was released today by the minister, Paul Fletcher. Fletcher suggested this morning that the University of Adelaide report had shown positive \u201cobservable impacts\u201d on alcohol and drug misuse, child welfare, crime and domestic violence. \u201cResearchers got out on the ground in the Goldfields in Western Australia and spoke directly to stakeholder groups and card users,\u201d he said. \u201cThey asked people structured questions about school attendance, financial stress and management of money, alcohol and drug use and health and wellbeing.\u201d But the Greens senator Rachel Siewert has questioned its value, saying the report had asked people their perceptions of changes in the community rather than measuring outcomes. Bureaucrats stressed the report was independent but were forced to confirm the department had essentially approved the methodology used in the report, which cost $550,000. Researchers interviewed 66 stakeholders and 64 of a total of 2,995 card users. Evidence around the effectiveness of the card \u2013 which quarantines a person\u2019s income support for use on staples \u2013 is already a point of contention. A previous study cited by the government to laud the scheme was strongly criticised by the auditor general. The card was recently expanded to cover the Hinkler electorate in north Queensland. Cutting to the chase in all of that, it seems that not every clause in the medical evacuation bill does link to existing provisions in the Migration Act. That seems to be it. It may or may not be valid. This is what the AG is saying the government legal advice says, but because we haven\u2019t seen the whole advice we have no idea if there were any caveats. And, as we learnt last week, caveats to legal advice (like, I don\u2019t know, ultimately the parliament can decide whether or not it cared about the constitutionality) can be important. And there are about 1,200 people who have been transferred to the mainland for medical treatment and just 282 have been sent back, and that was before 2015. Since then, the overwhelming majority have stayed and are the subject of legal challenges, suggesting that the law as it already stands can be legally challenged. And one more \u201cand\u201d: the bill hasn\u2019t received royal assent yet. Which means it is not technically even the law. This is how the government said it worked before the medical evacuation bill: How did the return of medical transferees work before medevac? Before the medevac laws passed, the minister had a discretionary power to transfer a person to Australia for medical reasons, or for some other temporary purpose. o This power is set out in section 198B of the Migration Act 1958. Once in Australia, the person is held in immigration detention. o This power is in sections 189 and 196 of the Migration Act. Once it is no longer necessary for a person to be in Australia, the Migration Act provides the minister with the power to remove the person from Australia (under sections 198 of the Migration Act) or to take them to Nauru or Papua New Guinea (in sections 198AH and 198AD). The requirement to return a person to a regional processing country and the power to achieve this are contained in section 198AD. But the power to return a person to a regional processing country under section 198AD only applies to the specific categories of \u201ctransitory person\u201d set out in section 198AH. The categories of \u201ctransitory person\u201d set out in section 198AH do not include a person transferred under Labor\u2019s new medevac section 198C. Section 198(1A) also makes clear that an officer must remove a person from Australia if: o they were transferred to Australia for a temporary purpose under the discretionary power in s 198B of the Migration Act; and o the person no longer needs to be in Australia for that purpose. Again, section 198(1A) simply does not apply to people transferred under Labor\u2019s new medevac provisions. And that summary of the legal advice: AGS advice: problems with the return of transferees The laws passed by Labor and the Greens add a new provision, section 198C to the Migration Act. That provision requires the transfer of a person to Australia if two doctors agree. It is a separate regime to the existing discretionary transfer power in section 198B. There is an existing, specific and comprehensive regime for the return of a person to a regional processing country where they were brought to Australia under the minister\u2019s existing discretionary power in section 198B. Labor\u2019s new mandatory transfer regime \u2013 section 198C \u2013 does not link to the existing provisions in the act (198AD and 198AH) that give the minister the power to return transferees to Manus and Nauru. The government has not yet identified any other power in the Migration Act allowing the return of medevac transferees to Nauru or Manus. It is exploring all legislative and non-legislative options to fix this problem. Christian Porter\u2019s office has released the summarised legal advice on the medical evacuation bill. From the AG\u2019s release: \u201cLabor\u2019s rushed border security legislation now means that there may be no power to return people to Manus or Nauru once they have arrived in Australia. \u201cThis is what happens when Bill Shorten and Labor play politics with national security and border protection. \u201cThe Australian government solicitor\u2019s office has advised that Labor\u2019s amendment fails to include, or link to, sections of the Migration Act which provide the legal authority to return people brought to Australia under Labor\u2019s bill once they have completed medical assessment or treatment. \u201cThis means anyone brought to Australia could remain in indefinite detention on Christmas Island. \u201cLabor\u2019s bill specifically requires anyone brought from Manus and Nauru to be held in immigration detention. This means even those outside of detention on Manus and Nauru who are brought to Australia under Labor\u2019s bill would be required, under Labor\u2019s law to be held in detention indefinitely. \u201cThis is the direct consequence of Labor\u2019s politicised and rushed legislation which passed through the House last week with the support of the Greens and crossbenchers.\u201d The Attorney-General said it would not be appropriate to release the AGS advice. However, he provided the summary. \u201cThe focus of the government now is cleaning up Labor\u2019s mess,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are currently considering options to address this issue \u2013 both legislative and non-legislative. \u201cI can assure everyone that the focus of the government is making sure we do everything we can to keep Australia\u2019s borders safe.\u201d Australia\u2019s embassy in China has been denied access to the Chinese province of Xinjiang amid a security crackdown on Uighur people and claims of human rights abuses. \u201cAccess has not been granted,\u201d a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official, Graham Fletcher, said. The department told a Senate estimates hearing that the last time embassy staff visited was June 2016. The Guardian reported last week 17 Australian residents are believed to be under house arrest, or detained in secretive \u201cre-education\u201d centres. Fletcher was unable to confirm the figures. He said the department was aware of cases of people who had not been in contact with their family members in Australia. \u201cWe don\u2019t know of any Australian residents who have been detained,\u201d he said. \u201cAs part of China\u2019s program of what it regards as dealing with a serious extremism problem in Xinjiang, it seems to be discouraging contact between residents of Xinjiang and relatives abroad.\u201d He said the department is therefore not confident a loss of contact means people are in detention. Fletcher maintained Australia had discussed granting independent media access to the province with the Chinese embassy in Canberra and had made representations to Beijing over the situation in Xinjiang. Mike Bowers caught this interaction, which followed Tony Smith\u2019s announcement that he would not be referring Tim Wilson to the privileges committee. It\u2019s labour force figure day \u2013 unemployment remained steady at 5.1%. The social services department is providing an update on the national redress scheme for people who have experienced institutional child sexual abuse. It says there have been 2,728 applications and 51 payments so far. No applications have been rejected. It has been estimated 60,000 survivors could be eligible. The average payment was $79,000. Fewer than 10 payments were between $100,000 and $150,000, and 34 were between $50,000 and $100,000. For payments up to $50,000 the figure was 14. The department secretary, Kathryn Campbell, told senator Derryn Hinch the department was sending letters today to institutions that had not signed up to the scheme. There are two kinds of people following this Helloworld stuff right now. Those who have The Saddle Club theme song stuck in their head. And those who do not. Hello world, this is me ... Cathy McGowan has entered amendments to the government\u2019s future drought fund bill. She tells us that while she supported the spirit of the bill, she doesn\u2019t believe it quite got there in actuality: \u201cI feel the bill was rushed out to meet the drought summit timeline. It\u2019s loosely drafted and does not represent good governance. \u201cThe amendments I move today will ensure that the operation of this fund is more transparent, the minister is accountable to the parliament for expenditure, and good governance and proper process are followed. \u201cThe amendments pick up the concerns raised by the scrutiny of bills committee, by the Senate committee inquiry into the bill, and include improvements suggested by the National Farmers Federation.\u201d And a bit more from Penny Wong\u2019s questioning of Daniel Sloper: Penny Wong: Oh right. Do you have notes from that meeting? Daniel Sloper: I don\u2019t. PW: What did he say to you? DS: I asked him whether he had declared his interest because the embassy had also told me that. He confirmed he had. PW: Did he tell you how? DS: He said orally to his staff. PW: When? DS: Before the meeting. PW: How long before the meeting? DS: I didn\u2019t ask him that question. PW: And you didn\u2019t ask him whether that was advised prior to the meeting being established? DS: No. I asked what was the sequence of events. He was approached by QBT. The staff were asked to arrange a meeting. Ahead of that meeting he declared his interest. PW: Did you ask him why he arranged the meeting? DS: Because he was approached by a government travel provider. PW: Did you hear what I asked you? DS: I asked and that was his answer. PW: Did you ask whether any other travel providers had approached him? DS: I didn\u2019t ask that, no. On the argument that the medical evacuation bill is open to legal challenge and potentially prevents the return of any medical evacuee to Nauru or Manus, as Murph and we have been pointing out this week, the law as it stands is already open to legal challenge and people are not being returned. How do we know that? Senate estimates. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, is the minister at the table with Dfat officials. Payne reminds Wong that Helloworld issued a statement to the Australian stock exchange, which a company would not do lightly. The statement said: At no time has ambassador Hockey or Helloworld CEO Andrew Burnes discussed the Dfat tender and neither Mr Hockey nor Mr Burnes have had any involvement in the tender process. Mr Burnes did not request the meeting with Dfat personnel in the United States. At all times Helloworld and Mr Burnes have acted properly in the tender process. Wong bats it back to Payne. She makes clear the distinction that Dfat officials are dancing around. That is the difference between the official tender process and the pitch leading up to it. Wong: \u201c[Helloworld] were careful words about tenders \u2026 whereas we were talking about a pitch meeting. \u201cWhat they haven\u2019t talked about \u2026 is that Mr Hockey was in the meeting. That was conveniently left out.\u201d So you have the pitch leading up to the tender. Wong says she is trying to get around the \u201clawyerly\u201d use of words \u2013 that is the 26 April meeting was not talking about the tender so nothing to see here. This is something the prime minister said in QT yesterday. \u201cI can advise the Australian embassy staff meeting ... on 26 April 2017, I\u2019m advised, was not in relation to the tender process,\u201d Morrison said. The train is rumbling towards the destination. The exchange between Penny Wong and Daniel Sloper over how that Joe Hockey Helloworld meeting was arranged went like this. This is important because as Gabrielle Chan reported yesterday: Scott Morrison has denied reports the US ambassador Joe Hockey instructed staff to meet with Helloworld subsidiary QBT before it lobbied for government work. The prime minister also told parliament that Hockey, a former Liberal treasurer and one of the 20 largest shareholders in the company, had declared his interest ahead of an embassy meeting, though it was not about the travel service tender process. \u201cI can advise the Australian embassy staff meeting ... on 26 April 2017, I\u2019m advised, was not in relation to the tender process. \u201cQBT was then, and continues to be, a travel agency for [the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] through a whole-of-government supply arrangement. Mr Joe Hockey declared his interest in Helloworld to embassy staff ahead of the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m advised embassy staff did not meet QBT or other staff in relation to the tender and embassy staff have met and corresponded with a whole range of travel providers to discuss the embassy\u2019s travel requirements.\u201d Penny Wong: There is a possibility of saying to the person \u201cI have got a financial interest in you and you will have to approach the embassy separately\u201d that\u2019s the possibility isn\u2019t it? \u201cI am one of your top 20 shareholders it is not a good look for me to be asking people who report to me to meet with you. You\u2019ll have to approach them separately or approach the DHOM\u201d. That would\u2019ve been the option, wouldn\u2019t it? Daniel Sloper: That certainly is an option but it did not occur. PW: He didn\u2019t choose to do that. He chose to be in the meeting? He chose to be in the meeting? DS: He was one of the participants in the meeting, yes. PW: You said they meet with people all the time? Right? I think that was your evidence, that they meet with travel providers all the time? DS: Yes. PW: Which other meetings had Mr Hockey been in? DS: Mr Hockey, as ambassador, meets with \u2026 PW: No, no. Don\u2019t give me a general answer fob-off. Has Mr Hockey been in any other meetings with other competitors or travel providers apart from the Helloworld group? DS: Senator, if I can make a few points. I\u2019m not familiar with which companies are in the tender process because it is still at foot and I\u2019ve been involved with that, so I can\u2019t go to whether he has been involved with that. As ambassador he has met \u2013 and I\u2019ll make a general statement then I\u2019ll come back to the specific \u2013 with a whole range of travel providers, travel industry providers, car hire, hotels and so on through his role. Independently of that the mission also meets with travel providers. PW: Does anybody else have meetings? I just want to know does somebody else have a meeting within 48 hours when they email him out of the blue? DS: I don\u2019t have that information available, but I expect somebody else would be meeting at various rates according to the schedule of the ambassador and other commitments within the embassy. PW: But you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019re just saying that? DS: I don\u2019t have access to all the calendar entries. The speaker, Tony Smith, has given a ruling on Labor\u2019s attempt to refer Tim Wilson\u2019s handlingof the franking credits inquiry to the privilege\u2019s committee. Smith summarised the main thrusts of the complaint as \u201cthe apparent organising of public hearing at certain place and time at behest of a person with vested interest\u201d (Geoff Wilson); and the \u201cauthorisation of a website as chair of committee through which members of the public could lodge submissions and register to attend hearings ... by agreeing to register for a petition\u201d opposing Labor\u2019s policy. Smith:\u201cI appreciate the concerns that may have been raised by the actions of the member Goldstein [Tim Wilson] and how the actions could be seen to cause damage to the committee\u2019s reputation and the reputation of the house committee system more generally.\u201d But Smith said the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate an interference that would \u201cprevent the committee in a fundamental way from fulfilling its basic responsibilities in relation to its inquiry work\u201d. Smith therefore refused to give precedence to a motion to refer Wilson. But he made further criticisms of Tim Wilson: \u201cWhilst I do not believe the actions of [Tim Wilson] meet the test in section 4 of the Privileges Act, I believe they have not always conformed with what I see as the conventions usually observed by chairs of house committees \u2026 including having a private website authorised by and with badging of the chair which appeared to solicit submissions and attendees from just one perspective.\u201d He also warned that \u201chanding out of party political material should not be tolerated by chairs\u201d at committee meetings. Smith said he is prepared to reopen the matter if there is \u201cevidence the committee was unduly prevented from doing its work\u201d, such as evidence from committee members. The manager of opposition business Tony Burke said he would make inquiries of committee members. So I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t necessarily the end of the matter. Tim Wilson thanked Smith for his \u201cfair consideration\u201d of the matter, and said the objective of the inquiry was always to \u201cmaximise the participation of the Australian people into their parliament\u201d. Wilson noted that Australians can make submissions on the APH website and anyone can attend hearings. It is only 7.30pm in Washington right now. Some of these questions Dfat don\u2019t have the answer to, could be answered with a phone call, is what I\u2019m saying. Greetings blergworld, Penny Wong and her eyebrow have been forensically questioning Dfat officials on US ambassador Joe Hockey\u2019s role in the travel arrangements of the Washington embassy. This relates to the story running all this week regarding the links by senior Liberals to travel company Helloworld. The prime minister yesterday defended Hockey, saying he had not requested the meeting between Helloworld subsidiary QBT and officials in Australia\u2019s Washington embassy regarding their travel arrangments. We have heard in estimates this morning that Hockey \u2013 one of the top 20 biggest shareholders in Helloworld \u2013 got a call from said Dfat officials yesterday as they tried to work out how this all unfolded. Dfat officer Daniel Sloper was questioned by Wong about what Hockey told him yesterday. Sloper said he asked Hockey asked whether he declared his interest and Hockey said he had. Hockey had declared his interest orally to his staff, said Sloper. Sloper confirmed the chronology: \u201c(Hockey) was approached by QBT, \u201cThe staff were asked to arrange a meeting, ahead of that meeting, he declared his interest.\u201d Wong: Did you ask him why he arranged the meeting? Sloper: Because he was approached by a government travel provider. Estimates: a visual story. Tim Wilson will not be referred to the privileges committee over his conduct as chair of the committee looking into franking credits, the Speaker, Tony Smith, says. But he does give a small rap over the knuckles with his ruling, saying he understands why the referral request came his way, saying the MP\u2019s actions have \u201cnot always conformed\u201d to the usual conventions committee chairs observe. Speaking to RN this morning, Mark Dreyfus said he can\u2019t see an issue with the medical evacuation bill preventing transfers back: The bill that was passed by parliament has very clear language. About temporary transfers. It is very hard to see, on a legal basis, how we have a problem here. The second thing is the government has no credibility left when it comes to faithfully representing the advice it has received. The director general of Asio said the advice from his agency was misrepresented and would cause damage to the standing of Asio. Just last week the same attorney general misrepresented advice from the solicitor general about the constitutionality of this bill when he tried to stop the Speaker from letting this bill go through the parliament. He asked the Speaker not to give the advice of the solicitor general to the public or the parliament and, wisely, the Speaker refused. Then we learned the solicitor general had made a whole lot of qualifications and reservations. He needs to release this advice today and stop misrepresenting advice and stop misrepresenting the law. Now, we have one day left of government in this part-time parliament, we are not sitting again until April 2nd, but that\u2019s the government\u2019s fault, it doesn\u2019t want the parliament to sit. Instead of this desperate, misrepresenting behaviour that Mr Porter is engaging in, why not approach the parliament and do the work of the government and get the other members of parliament to do the work of parliament, which is absolutely routine? My point is, this is a part-time parliament and it is of the government\u2019s own making that there is a problem here. But we\u2019ve got a day, and if the government approaches us now and releases the advice and tells us what the problem is, of course we will work with the government. The royal commission into the aged care sector is set to hit the road in March. It has announced community forums in Bankstown, NSW, on 1 March and in Bendigo, Victoria on 5 March. The commissioner, Lynelle Briggs, will be at the forums. Some people will be given the chance to make statements. Attendees need to RSVP by 27 February. Other community forums will be announced in coming months. The Department of Social Services says it was \u201cnot alarmed\u201d by reports that more than 2,000 people had died after receiving a Centrelink debt notice under the scheme critics have labelled \u201crobodebt\u201d. The department\u2019s secretary, Kathryn Campbell, said she had seen the statistics and noted the comments of the human services minister, Michael Keenan, who said the death rate among letter recipients was lower than the overall death rate among Centrelink customers. It is not clear whether the figure quoted by the minister includes those on the age pension. Asked about the reports by the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, Campbell said: \u201cWe were not alarmed, we did not see a causal factor.\u201d The data showed 2,030 people died after they were sent a debt notice. About 430 of those who died were between the ages of 16 and 35, while 663 were classed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by Centrelink. The average length of time between the person\u2019s last letter and their death was 222 days. The independent MP Bob Katter just tried to suspend standing orders to move a motion criticising the Nationals for deregulating the dairy industry. The motion notes that since deregulation farmers\u2019 income has dropped from 59 cents a litre to 41 cents. It notes that both Labor and the LNP oppose arbitration (to set prices). The attempt to suspend standing orders fails 72 votes to 68. Senate estimates has heard that more than two-thirds of disability support pension claims were rejected last financial year. Department of Social Services officials said there 104,000 DSP claims in 2017-18, with 73,000 of those claims unsuccessful. Officials maintained that the success rate has been steady over the past few years. It has become increasingly difficult for people to access the payment owing to the tightening of requirements over a number of years. On Tuesday estimates heard there had been a 70% increase in DSP appeals to the administrative appeals tribunal. About 17% of the 676 appeals from claimants to the tribunal were overturned in the first quarter of 2018-19, officials said. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert raised concerns about the waiting time for DSP applications. But officials said 74% of claims were processed within the 49-day benchmark set by the department. The auditor general has criticised the department for the way it calculates median times, saying it was \u201cbiased\u201d. Oh \u2013 the motion to suspend standing orders failed. 73 to 68. Dfat\u2019s chief people officer, Daniel Sloper, has told Penny Wong he spoke to Joe Hockey about the Helloworld stuff yesterday. So far, we know that QBT, which is an offshoot of Helloworld, and of which Hockey is a top 20 shareholder, approached the US embassy for a meeting. Hockey asked staff to arrange the meeting in response to that request. But obviously none of these laws are of *vital importance*, right? Paladin have released another statement, announcing it with this prologue: This morning I have written to our staff, the Australian Department of Home Affairs and the PNG Government with a statement for public release. We are very proud of our work and the values, philosophy and integrity of our leaders. In light of recent misleading media coverage that has called this into question, we felt strongly it was important to state our position, experience and values clearly on behalf of the company. As always our number one priority is the safety, security and wellbeing of all of our staff, the communities in which we operate and the people in our care. We will not be making any further comment.\u201d It includes this: This statement clarifies our relationship with High Risk Security Group (Asia-Pacific) Unipessoal Lda and its related Australian entity HRSG Australasia Pty Ltd (ABN 83 614 059 577) of Level 2, 128-134 Crown Street, Wollongong NSW 2500 (High Risk Group Companies). Neither business is owned, managed or controlled in any way by Paladin, its owners or Directors. We understand there is some confusion in the media around these unrelated entities and any potential bad debts and failed contracts that may be attributed to them. We further clarify that High Risk Security Group Pty Ltd (ABN 64 144 000 573) is the original name of Paladin Group Pty Ltd, recently changed to Paladin Aus Pty Ltd (Paladin Aus). Notwithstanding the similarities in names, we can confirm that there was some discussion in 2009 about Paladin Aus and the High Risk Group Companies pursuing work together. This did not eventuate, and the entities are and always have been completely separate. In fact, Paladin has operated in competition to HRSG in Timor Leste under Sentinel Unipessoal Lda since 2015. Further, we take this opportunity to advise that Paladin Aus Pty Ltd has no service delivery contracts in Australia and as such had been registered at a private residential address. This address has now been changed to a serviced office in Canberra. We absolutely support the stated position of the Speaker of the PNG Parliament and Acting Governor General of PNG, the Honourable Job Pomat MP in his claims that he is not a party to any business by Paladin, its subcontractors (including Peren Investments Limited) and partners (including Pomwan Paladin Security Limited). We recognise the Speaker as a man of absolute integrity, a leader of his people and a respected clan leader in Manus Province. Peren Investments Limited represents the traditional custom landowners for the site of ELRTC in Lorengau under the leadership of Kepo Pomat. Estimates Penny Wong remains one of the best Penny Wongs. I\u2019ve said it before, and I will no doubt say it again, the senator is an exquisite inquisitor. She is talking to the Department of Foreign Affairs officials about what they would do if they received a meeting request from a company they had shares in which was seeking a government tender. Marise Payne is, as the foreign affairs minister, also under the microscope. She was just asked what she would do, if she found herself in a similar position to Mathias Cormann regarding his flights: \u201cSelf-evidently senator, had any of that been received in my case, it would be on my declaration,\u201d she said. Bob Katter is talking on the motion to suspend standing orders in the House. I\u2019ve just been told by a few miffed MPs in the chamber that Katter just referred to the \u201cbludgerigars\u201d in the government \u201cwho need flogging\u201d over what they have allowed to happen (previously) in agricultural industries. Penny Wong is in the Dfat estimates, asking about Joe Hockey and Helloworld. Earlier this morning Christian Porter was asked about Helloworld, while he was on the ABC. \u201cThat issue has arisen, my understanding is people have been asked if they have connections with Helloworld, I certainly have had no connection whatsoever,\u201d he said. Asked, \u201cYou will be supportive, of Labor\u2019s questions for an inquiry into the matter?,\u201d Porter responded: I\u2019m sure this matter will be the subject of inquiry from the prime minister to members of the parliament, but I\u2019m not sure what it is you are saying has occurred or needs to be investigated. Which sounds like the prime minister is asking his ministers and MPs questions, but is not necessarily setting up an investigation. Later, Porter says: I think this is an issue that has been trumped and overblown by a Labor party who has destroyed our border security in the short space of two weeks and it is done so that good people like yourself will ask not terribly specific questions on an issue of minor \u2026 He is interrupted, to point out there had been a specific question. Which there had. But it doesn\u2019t particularly matter how specific the question is, at the moment, because all the answers seem to be the same. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is being grilled about the Helloworld saga and ambassador to the US Joe Hockey\u2019s disclosure about a shareholding in travel company. Reports have emerged that Hockey instructed embassy staff to meet with the Helloworld subsidiary QBT before it lobbied for government work. A Dfat official, Daniel Sloper, said Hockey had declared an interest in the company on 26 April 2017 to Washington staff and it had then been relayed to Canberra. He signed his annual interests disclosure on 9 May. The hearing was told that Australian overseas posts had historically made their own staff travel arrangements. The department had been looking to consolidate them to save money. Why doesn\u2019t Christian Porter want to release the legal advice, which alerted the government to a potential loophole in the medical evacuation bill, which the attorney general says would prevent asylum seekers or refugees from returning to Nauru or Manus (which, if so, probably could just be corrected with an amendment, which is how most of this stuff is fixed). He told the ABC: We don\u2019t want our advice used against us in litigation if we find some way to return people to Manus and Nauru, we will use every power under our auspices to do that. Annnnnnnd it begins with Joel Fitzgibbon moving a motion to suspend standing orders. It\u2019s on the milk price issue again. The bells have rung, the prayers are being said. Parliament has begun for the last time before the budget is handed down. Today\u2019s estimates hearings have begun, including Dfat, where you can absolutely expect Hakeem al-Araibi to be discussed. You\u2019ll find the whole schedule, here. Kerryn Phelps had a chat to Jon Faine on ABC Melbourne. I missed the beginning, but asked whether she would support a no-confidence motion in the government, the Wentworth MP says she believes it is \u201cextremely important that the Australian people have the right to decide who governs them at the next election and that is going to be within the next 90 days\u201d. She said: I don\u2019t think in practical terms there can be an immediate election \u2026 The point is the Australian people have the opportunity in May to decide what they want in their next government and I think it is very important that we maintain focus on these important issues that we are currently dealing with. There is an election coming up very soon \u2013 it is not a year or two away, it is within the next three months, and I think with every day that goes past, people are able to see the conduct of this current government, and they will make their own minds up and they will decide who they want to govern them for the next three years. For me at the moment, the medical issues are a real focus, environmental issues are a major focus for me, and one thing that comes out of the Senate estimates this week \u2026 is that there is a desperate need for a national integrity commission. I think the trust in politicians and our democratic processes have been eroded and I think it is extraordinarily important that we have a properly constituted transparent and retroactive national integrity commission that can take a look at any questions or queries about processes and make sure that there is actually some real teeth. Australia\u2019s biggest coalminer might be limiting its thermal coal production (which make no mistake, is a commercial decision) but Angus Taylor has some strong opinions about Labor\u2019s renewable energy targets, after new modelling. From his release: The work, released by BAEconomics\u2019s Managing Director Dr Brian Fisher, shows that Labor\u2019s 45% Emissions Reduction Target and 50% Renewable Energy Target will: \u2022 cost the economy $472 billion, \u2022 slash more than 336,000 jobs, \u2022 cut the average wage by over $9,000, and \u2022 increase wholesale electricity prices by more than 58%. Bill Shorten needs to come clean. Which industries will he close first? Will it be agriculture or aluminium, mining or manufacturing? Which jobs will he export overseas first? Labor\u2019s reckless targets will punish Australian families already struggling with cost of living pressures, and destroy the industries that have made our economy strong. It\u2019s also worth noting that just yesterday, Christian Porter introduced a series of bills into the House, including amendments to the foreign influence transparency scheme, which has been in place for a whole eight weeks. As Paul Karp pointed out yesterday: The most important change is the definition of \u201ccommunications activity\u201d would be changed to capture \u201cinformation or material being distributed to the public\u201d. That would mean that agents of foreign principals would have to register for distribution pamphlets, for example, in the election. It makes a few tune-ups for what the explanatory memorandum calls \u201cgaps\u201d in the reporting requirements. Apparently some reporting requirements were applied only to people who registered under the scheme, and that has to be extended to those who are \u201cliable to register\u201d. Which sounds, I don\u2019t know, kinda like a loophole? Which is being closed? Christian Porter, despite not releasing the legal advice, is pretty convinced this loophole in the medical evacuation bill is close to end of days. He told the ABC: It is a terrible law, but this legal loophole is very significant. You will be bringing people on Manus and Nauru, who are not in detention, to Christmas Island and placing them in detention, with no authority to return them back to Nauru and/or Manus Island. The \u201cnot in detention\u201d line is part of the government\u2019s strategy to remind people that the asylum seekers and refugees on Manus and Nauru have been released into the community, and therefore \u201care not in detention\u201d \u2013 despite remaining under the care of Australia. As has been pointed out on Twitter, it is worth noting that during the home affairs estimates hearing, we were told that the majority of those transferred to Australia for medical treatment (just under 500) have not returned, since about 2015. That\u2019s largely because of legal challenges. You may have missed this, from late yesterday. It\u2019s probably worth noting, given the debate about Richard Marles\u2019 comments on thermal coal yesterday (he told Sky News: \u201cThe global market for thermal coal has collapsed, and at one level that\u2019s a good thing because what that implies is the world is acting in relation to climate change\u201d): The commodities trader Glencore has bowed to pressure from shareholders, including the Church of England, to limit coal production for environmental reasons \u2013 days after reporting that it produced nearly 130m tonnes of the fossil fuel last year. The Switzerland-based firm, whose oil-trading operation is based in London, laid out plans to improve its environmental record, including a review of its membership of trade bodies it fears may be undermining the international Paris climate agreement. Glencore, which is Australia\u2019s biggest miner of coal, said it was responding to concern within the investment community. The Church of England, which is understood to have a stake worth just under \u00a310m in the group, welcomed the announcement. You can read that whole story here. It\u2019s the last sitting day until the budget sitting begins in April. Shortly after that, all the indications \u2013 at least at this stage \u2013 point to the an election being called. Probably for 11 or 18 May. So what are we talking about today? The same thing we have been talking about since the sitting began last week. The medical evacuation legislation, which was passed against the government\u2019s will, sparked an intense border protection debate which shows no signs of slowing down. Now, the attorney general, Christian Porter, tells us, it might contain a \u201cdrafting error\u201d which would stop the government from being able to send back any asylum seeker or refugee sent to Australia for treatment. The \u201cloophole\u201d is very concerning, Porter says. But not concerning enough that he will release the legal advice, which advises of this loophole, in its entirety. Then of course, there is still Helloworld and Michaelia Cash ticking away. And whatever else estimates throws up. The way the days have been going lately, you never know where the story is going to come from. But we\u2019ll have that all covered for you, of course. Mike Bowers is already on the case, as are Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp. The Guardian brains trust have clocked on and at some stage, my brain may even follow. Maybe after coffee number two. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Teachers will follow on the heels of striking students on Friday with a protest to demand the national curriculum be reformed to make the climate and ecological crisis an educational priority. The Extinction Rebellion group will support the demonstration outside the Department for Education, which organisers describe as a \u201cpeaceful nonviolent protest that may involve civil disobedience\u201d. It is intended as a show of solidarity for pupils who skipped classes last Friday to express their frustration at the failure of older generations to adequately address climate change. Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities in the UK joined the strike. More would be likely to follow, they said, if the government did not live up to a Paris climate agreement promise to enhance climate change education. Instead, they say, there is currently no requirement for children to be taught about the climate crisis so it is treated, at best, as a peripheral subtopic of subjects like geography and science. They are also unhappy that part of the curriculum appears to cast doubt on the evidence for man-made climate change, even though governments, the UN and the overwhelming majority of scientists accept that it is happening. Government guidelines for key stage 4 chemistry say pupils should be taught \u201cevidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change\u201d. Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham, said students in the state system could easily go through 11 years of compulsory education and hear climate change mentioned in fewer than 10 lessons out of approximately 10,000.

      "body": "<p><strong>The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education, </strong><strong>set to report next month, is expected to recommend ways of encouraging young people to consider vocational training routes when they leave school. This will be no small task. In Germany the so-called dual training route, where young people spend a third of their time in </strong><strong>college and two-thirds learning on the job with a company, has long had high esteem, and roughly half of young people choose this route instead of university. But in the UK the picture is very different. Before Christmas the education secretary, Damian Hinds, described the British as a nation of \u201ctechnical education snobs\u201d who consider</strong><strong> university the only path to a decent job. Will this ever change? And what does all this mean for universities?</strong></p> <p><strong>In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talked to Ed Brinksma, the Dutch president of </strong><strong>Germany\u2019s Hamburg University of Technology, and Quintin McKellar, vice-chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Hamburg University of Technology is a new university, established </strong><strong>40 years ago, that prides itself on being both research-led and entrepreneurial. It has a heavy emphasis on engineering subjects, </strong><strong>with particular expertise in green technologies, life science technologies, and aviation and maritime systems. </strong><strong>It works with many of the big players in manufacturing, including Airbus and </strong><strong>Dutch firm NXP. In 2016 34% of HUT graduates were in regular employment, and </strong><strong>58% were doing postgraduate study 18</strong><strong>months after leaving the university.</strong></p> <p><strong>The University of Hertfordshire has an explicit mission to be known globally as the UK\u2019s leading business-facing university. It ranks very highly on employability, with <a href=\"https://www.herts.ac.uk/about-us/news/2018/july/graduate-employment-rate-rise\">96.5% of graduates in employment </a>or further study six months after graduating. All courses are underpinned by industry expertise</strong><strong>. The university has strong degree apprenticeship relationships with Vauxhall and TUI</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/22/2vcs-on-are-university-degree-models-stuck-in-the-past\">2VCs on ... are university degree models stuck in the past?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Will British snobbery stop us from matching Germany on technical education?</strong><br>In Hamburg, as in other German cities, universities and colleges compete on a much more level playing field. Brinksma explains that the city state puts a lot of energy into trying to attract young people to do dual training at one of Hamburg\u2019s vocational colleges. The high regard for vocational training leads to exemplary results in youth unemployment, as well as highly skilled workers. But there is still some degree of social stratification. \u201cIt is less than in Britain but it is still there. Even in Germany there is a clear correlation between people who go to university and the education their parents had.\u201d</p> <p>McKellar is optimistic that things are moving on in Britain. He insists there is no snobbishness about training students for jobs in the newer post-1992 universities, which brought a \u201ctotally different outlook\u201d to higher education. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure it exists in the older universities anymore,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>But I ask him whether the real snobbery lies with parents, who might see technical courses as inferior. \u201cYes, that is true,\u201d he says, expressing frustration that many people still assume degree apprenticeships are for people in dirty boilersuits, and not something that law firms or prestigious companies such as Rolls Royce or KPMG engage in.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly see that mindset in politicians too. We\u2019ve got these amazing schemes with big companies but if you speak to many politicians they say degree apprenticeships are just for people from disadvantaged backgrounds without proper attainment. And that\u2019s just not true. They should be for people at all social levels.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Should more young people go to college?</strong><br>The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education is widely expected to try to push more would-be students into further education. McKellar describes himself as a \u201chuge advocate\u201d of FE, and says colleges have done a terrific job with ever-dwindling resources, but like many vice-chancellors he is fearful of where this is leading. He isn\u2019t opposed to Britain mimicking Germany\u2019s roughly 50/50 split of young people doing on-the-job college training courses or going to university. But he is adamant that this must be about training people who aren\u2019t currently studying, rather than raiding universities.</p> <p>One idea the review team has considered, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/15/student-loan-ban-universities-could-lose-third-of-intake\">according to one leak</a>, is that those with the lowest A-level grades should no longer be able to access loans to go to university. McKellar is vehemently opposed to any such back-door numbers cap. \u201cI think it would be a tragedy for the people who were no longer able to access higher education, but also a tragedy for the country.\u201d</p> <p>In Hamburg the proportion of young people choosing university study has now slightly overtaken the number going to college. But Brinksma says this is not raising any eyebrows in government, and despite the fact that university tuition is free he is not aware of any desire to constrain the number of people getting degrees. \u201cThere was a time about 15 years ago when Germany had some fine scholars but the university system wasn\u2019t great. Since then they have really focused on investing in excellence. I think they are still supporting the growth of universities.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe need a lot of skilled workers \u2013 but a modern society needs higher education as well.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Brinksma sees the future as being about more higher education for many people. \u201cWill the modern student just do one masters degree? Or will they want to come back later and do a succession of courses as they need to learn different skills?\u201d The Labour government stopped many people from choosing this path in the UK back in 2007, when it abolished public support for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6984134.stm\">those taking second degrees</a>. Brinksma says that funding is the crunch point in Germany too. \u201cThe question is, of course, who pays? And this is something that is being debated over here right now.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Are we going in the right direction with degree apprenticeships?</strong><br>Germany has a long tradition of excellent apprenticeships, but these happen entirely outside of universities. Nonetheless Brinksma thinks Britain is right to experiment in this area. \u201cI see the need to have a combination of working and studying, because what you learnt a few years ago might be out of date by the time you get to a job,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we are seeing that some companies are starting to care less about formal university degrees. Google aren\u2019t so interested in degrees. They are hiring people with great programming skills, and that\u2019s becoming more common.\u201d</p> <p>McKellar is passionate about the idea of degree apprenticeships. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to qualify without debt, to train for a job and get a good education while you do it, and you\u2019re very employable at the end,\u201d he says. His university wants to offer them in all of their nine academic schools. </p> <p>His concerns are mainly about ensuring that degree apprenticeship students get a fair deal.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education, set to report next month, is expected to recommend ways of encouraging young people to consider vocational training routes when they leave school. This will be no small task. In Germany the so-called dual training route, where young people spend a third of their time in college and two-thirds learning on the job with a company, has long had high esteem, and roughly half of young people choose this route instead of university. But in the UK the picture is very different. Before Christmas the education secretary, Damian Hinds, described the British as a nation of \u201ctechnical education snobs\u201d who consider university the only path to a decent job. Will this ever change? And what does all this mean for universities? In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talked to Ed Brinksma, the Dutch president of Germany\u2019s Hamburg University of Technology, and Quintin McKellar, vice-chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire. The Hamburg University of Technology is a new university, established 40 years ago, that prides itself on being both research-led and entrepreneurial. It has a heavy emphasis on engineering subjects, with particular expertise in green technologies, life science technologies, and aviation and maritime systems. It works with many of the big players in manufacturing, including Airbus and Dutch firm NXP. In 2016 34% of HUT graduates were in regular employment, and 58% were doing postgraduate study 18months after leaving the university. The University of Hertfordshire has an explicit mission to be known globally as the UK\u2019s leading business-facing university. It ranks very highly on employability, with 96.5% of graduates in employment or further study six months after graduating. All courses are underpinned by industry expertise. The university has strong degree apprenticeship relationships with Vauxhall and TUI. Will British snobbery stop us from matching Germany on technical education? In Hamburg, as in other German cities, universities and colleges compete on a much more level playing field. Brinksma explains that the city state puts a lot of energy into trying to attract young people to do dual training at one of Hamburg\u2019s vocational colleges. The high regard for vocational training leads to exemplary results in youth unemployment, as well as highly skilled workers. But there is still some degree of social stratification. \u201cIt is less than in Britain but it is still there. Even in Germany there is a clear correlation between people who go to university and the education their parents had.\u201d McKellar is optimistic that things are moving on in Britain. He insists there is no snobbishness about training students for jobs in the newer post-1992 universities, which brought a \u201ctotally different outlook\u201d to higher education. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure it exists in the older universities anymore,\u201d he adds. But I ask him whether the real snobbery lies with parents, who might see technical courses as inferior. \u201cYes, that is true,\u201d he says, expressing frustration that many people still assume degree apprenticeships are for people in dirty boilersuits, and not something that law firms or prestigious companies such as Rolls Royce or KPMG engage in. \u201cI certainly see that mindset in politicians too. We\u2019ve got these amazing schemes with big companies but if you speak to many politicians they say degree apprenticeships are just for people from disadvantaged backgrounds without proper attainment. And that\u2019s just not true. They should be for people at all social levels.\u201d Should more young people go to college? The prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education is widely expected to try to push more would-be students into further education. McKellar describes himself as a \u201chuge advocate\u201d of FE, and says colleges have done a terrific job with ever-dwindling resources, but like many vice-chancellors he is fearful of where this is leading. He isn\u2019t opposed to Britain mimicking Germany\u2019s roughly 50/50 split of young people doing on-the-job college training courses or going to university. But he is adamant that this must be about training people who aren\u2019t currently studying, rather than raiding universities. One idea the review team has considered, according to one leak, is that those with the lowest A-level grades should no longer be able to access loans to go to university. McKellar is vehemently opposed to any such back-door numbers cap. \u201cI think it would be a tragedy for the people who were no longer able to access higher education, but also a tragedy for the country.\u201d In Hamburg the proportion of young people choosing university study has now slightly overtaken the number going to college. But Brinksma says this is not raising any eyebrows in government, and despite the fact that university tuition is free he is not aware of any desire to constrain the number of people getting degrees. \u201cThere was a time about 15 years ago when Germany had some fine scholars but the university system wasn\u2019t great. Since then they have really focused on investing in excellence. I think they are still supporting the growth of universities.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe need a lot of skilled workers \u2013 but a modern society needs higher education as well.\u201d Indeed, Brinksma sees the future as being about more higher education for many people. \u201cWill the modern student just do one masters degree? Or will they want to come back later and do a succession of courses as they need to learn different skills?\u201d The Labour government stopped many people from choosing this path in the UK back in 2007, when it abolished public support for those taking second degrees. Brinksma says that funding is the crunch point in Germany too. \u201cThe question is, of course, who pays? And this is something that is being debated over here right now.\u201d Are we going in the right direction with degree apprenticeships? Germany has a long tradition of excellent apprenticeships, but these happen entirely outside of universities. Nonetheless Brinksma thinks Britain is right to experiment in this area. \u201cI see the need to have a combination of working and studying, because what you learnt a few years ago might be out of date by the time you get to a job,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we are seeing that some companies are starting to care less about formal university degrees. Google aren\u2019t so interested in degrees. They are hiring people with great programming skills, and that\u2019s becoming more common.\u201d McKellar is passionate about the idea of degree apprenticeships. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to qualify without debt, to train for a job and get a good education while you do it, and you\u2019re very employable at the end,\u201d he says. His university wants to offer them in all of their nine academic schools. His concerns are mainly about ensuring that degree apprenticeship students get a fair deal. Hertfordshire is thinking hard about how they can ensure apprentices \u2013 who only spend 20% of their time in university and tend to live at home \u2013 actually feel part of the university experience. This might mean encouraging them to join a student society or sports club, or becoming a student ambassador. He also thinks universities have a big role to play in making sure apprentices have a broader range of transferrable skills to protect them. \u201cThese courses have been designed by employers, but the concern I have is that with technology advancing, many of these jobs will disappear. We want to make sure students are trained in things like critical thinking.\u201d How closely does your university work with business? McKellar is quick to stress that university is about much more than getting a job. \u201cBut we fundamentally believe that\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d People from business sit on all of the universities\u2019 curriculum development committees, to make sure that learning is useful and up to date. All subjects offer experiential education where possible, with law students arguing their points in a real court, engineers building cars and historians interviewing people to piece together a detailed history of the local football club. Almost every Hertfordshire student now does some sort of work experience. McKellar explains that this is especially important for students from less advantaged backgrounds, who might not have the connections that will help their middle-class classmates climb the career ladder. \u201cAs well as delivering a set of skills our curriculums now also focus on delivering important attitudes for working life after university, such as professionalism, the ability to research something, and respect for others,\u201d he adds.

Zerpa is an HIV-positive Venezuelan who works as a counsellor with the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF). He migrated to Peru in 2017 after he was invited to take part in a conference for the UN Jovenes Positivos network, which fights against the exclusion of young HIV-positive people. \u201cI came to Peru because I wanted to live,\u201d says Zerpa, who began antiretroviral treatment in his home city of M\u00e9rida in 2015 when he found out he had the virus. But by 2017, Venezuela\u2019s healthcare system had all but collapsed and antiretrovirals, which had been administered free of charge, could only be found on the black market costing up to $500 a pill (\u00a3380), recalls Zerpa. The price is totally out of reach for the vast majority in the country, where the minimum wage is around $30 a month. \u201cI spent six to seven months without taking any retrovirals,\u201d explains Zerpa, who used to work as an HR manager for a fast-food restaurant chain. \u201cDue to a stomach bug, I weighed 35kg. I couldn\u2019t even walk and I had to use a wheelchair. \u201cMy doctor told me, \u2018Darwin, you have two options: you can stay here and die or you can try to leave and find a solution to stay alive.\u2019\u201d Zerpa considers himself one of the lucky ones. He dedicates himself to helping his fellow HIV-positive Venezuelans who are entitled to free treatment in Peru if they can register and bypass a series of bureaucratic hurdles. \u201cI feel happy here, I can help my compatriots. We\u2019ve been given this opportunity. We are just asking that [Peru] doesn\u2019t shut its doors to the rest,\u201d he says. Close to half the male sex workers seeking HIV tests in the square are Venezuelans, AHF counsellor Percy Cuba estimates. Two years before there were practically none, he says. It is not clear how many people who are HIV positive or have Aids are among the more than 3 million who the UN refugee agency says have fled Venezuela since 2015. According to UNAids an estimated 120,000 Venezuelans were living with HIV in 2016; there were around 6,500 new infections and 2,500 Aids-related deaths. Venezuela already had one of the highest rates of HIV infection and adolescent pregnancy in Latin America before its economic collapse in 2014. Since 2010, new HIV infections increased by 24%, according to UNAids. The country\u2019s health ministry stopped publishing health data in 2017 after an official report pointed out a spike in infant and maternal mortality rates, for which the health minister was immediately sacked. The Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimates Aids-related deaths have more than doubled as a result of an 85% shortage of medicines in the country. In little more than a year, the number of Venezuelans migrating to Peru has quadrupled, many attracted by the country\u2019s growing economy, the availability of unregulated work and softer entry requirements. As of February 2019, more than 688,000 Venezuelans were officially registered as living in Peru, making it the second largest recipient of migrants after Colombia even though Venezuela and Peru do not share a border. The possibility of free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is proving to be a major draw for Venezuelans living with HIV. \u201cWhat worries us is that [HIV positive] people are migrating to Peru for the sole reason that they cannot continue their treatment in Venezuela,\u201d says Dr Carlos Benites, who leads Peru\u2019s HIV and Aids control programme. In contrast to Colombia, where migrants need temporary residency to access health insurance, Peru has a public health system that guarantees free treatment for foreigners and nationals with the virus, he says. \u201cSo far the HIV-positive Venezuelans have been easily absorbed into the system,\u201d Benites adds. He says figures from December 2018 show 1,338 Venezuelans were receiving free ARV treatment in Peru. Of those more than 80% (1,095 patients) are in Lima and the nearby port of Callao. According to Benites, about 72,000 people are HIV-positive in Peru, which has a population of close to 32 million, of whom 57,000 are receiving treatment. But as UNHCR predicts the number of Venezuelans in Peru could more than double to 1.4 million by the end of the year, there are concerns that the country\u2019s healthcare system could be put under strain. The director of AHF for the Andean region, Dr Jos\u00e9 Luis Sebasti\u00e1n, says many of the HIV-positive Venezuelans now fleeing their country are particularly vulnerable. \u201cAt the beginning of the migration it was middle-class people, students, professionals \u2026 but in recent months, much poorer people are arriving who don\u2019t have much understanding of how to treat their condition and are desperate because of the situations they\u2019ve faced getting here. They arrive looking for antiretroviral drugs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Brexit continues to reshape party politics Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray and if you only read a few things today, here they are. Theresa May\u2019s appeasement of hardline leavers has been cited by three Conservative MPs \u2013 Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston \u2013 for their quitting the party to join the new Independent Group. Asked if she could ever return, Allen said: \u201cIf we do our jobs properly, there won\u2019t be a Tory party to go back to. We\u2019re about creating something better that is bang smack in the centre ground of British politics, that people out there, I am convinced, we are convinced, want.\u201d Last night, Allen told ITV\u2019s Peston that \u201ca third of the party\u201d \u2013 around 100 of her former colleagues \u2013 shared her frustrations at its direction. The Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC: \u201cThe government which I am supporting implementing a no-deal Brexit - what would I do? I would not be able to maintain my support of the government. I would have to leave the party.\u201d At a press conference, Soubry said: \u201cThe rightwing, the hardline, anti-EU awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years are now running the Conservative party from top to tail.\u201d The latest defections increase the Independent Group\u2019s number to 11, and May\u2019s already tenuous working majority is cut to eight \u2013 though the parliamentary arithmetic in next week\u2019s crucial votes is unlikely to change, because the 11 MPs were already confirmed Brexit rebels. On the Labour side, recriminations from Corbynites continue against the founders of the Independent Group: the Momentum movement has declared it will unleash \u201cmass canvassing events\u201d in the constituencies of Chuka Umunna, Ann Coffey and Angela Smith, putting pressure on them to step aside for byelections. In Brussels, there was little sign of a resolution on the Irish backstop after May met with Jean-Claude Juncker. The latter had a plaster on his cheek from cutting himself while shaving or, as he put it, \u201can unfortunate gesture this morning. I am just telling you this because I don\u2019t want you to think that Mrs May is responsible for this injury.\u201d * * * Dozens die in building blaze \u2013 In a developing story overnight, at least 70 people have died in a huge fire that tore through apartment buildings that doubled as chemical warehouses in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. \u201cThe number of bodies may increase. The search is still going on,\u201d said Ali Ahmed, Bangladesh\u2019s fire service chief. Dozens of people were trapped in the buildings as the highly combustible stores of chemicals, body sprays and plastic granules erupted in flames. Bystanders, including a wedding party, were caught up as flames raced through four adjoining buildings, which were also used as chemical warehouses. A police inspector at the Dhaka Medical College hospital said at least 45 people were injured, including four whose conditions were critical. * * * Calvin Harris savours two Brits \u2013 The Scottish dance music producer Calvin Harris and soft rock band the 1975 have been the biggest winners at the 2019 Brit awards. Success at the Brits had previously eluded the highest-paid DJ in the world, but he finally triumphed with British producer and British single for One Kiss, his UK no 1 with Dua Lipa, who in 2018 won the British female and breakthrough artist awards. The 1975 took home British album of the year for A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships and also won British group, having previously won in 2017. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z made a much-discussed statement as they accepted the award for best international group \u2013 posing in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle styled as Queen Victoria, a show of support for the duchess amid sustained press scrutiny. Here is the full list of winners. * * * Bangladesh refuses to take Begum \u2013 Bangladesh has rejected the British government\u2019s demand that the Isis runaway Shamima Begum go there instead of being taken back by the UK. \u201cShe is a British citizen by birth and never applied for dual nationality with Bangladesh,\u201d said Shahriar Alam, the Bangladeshi foreign minister. \u201cThere is no question of her being allowed to enter into Bangladesh.\u201d Sajid Javid, the British home secretary, has faced questions in the Commons as he pushes ahead with trying to deprive Begum of her citizenship. Javid said her newborn son would be considered separately: \u201cChildren should not suffer, so if a parent loses their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child.\u201d The White House has moved to block the return of Alabama woman Hoda Muthan \u2013 despite Donald Trump calling for European countries to take back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals. * * * Poorer as a nation \u2013 Austerity policies have dragged on the UK economy to the tune of \u00a3300 per household, per month since the Conservatives came to power, according to the New Economics Foundation thinktank. Its analysis says that under the programme of cuts first introduced by a Tory coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the economy has been left \u00a3100bn smaller than it would otherwise have been. In a report by MPs to be published today, ministers will be urged to help revive the UK\u2019s ailing high streets by considering taxing online sales, deliveries or packaging, and cutting property taxes for retailers. * * * Planetoid potshots \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hayabusa 2 probe will tonight fire a pellet at an asteroid to try and kick up enough dust to bring back to Earth. Using a \u201csampler horn\u201d on its underbelly, it will seek to gather the debris from the 1km-wide rock named Ryugu. In the next month or so Hayabusa 2 is scheduled to blast a new crater in Ryugu in order to collect more fresh material.

Business The Swiss bank UBS has been ordered to pay \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.9bn) by a French court for helping wealthy clients dodge tax in a series of rulings that will leave it almost \u00a38bn out of pocket. Futures trade is showing a likely modest rise when the FTSE100 opens for business later this morning while the pound is buying $1.303 and \u20ac1.149. The papers The front pages focus on the three Tory MPs who have left the party over Brexit. The Mirror calls it \u201cBrexodus\u201d and a sign of \u201cTories in Meltdown\u201d. The i reports: \u201cTories join the exodus\u201d and the Guardian says \u201cNow the Tories split: rebels denounce grip of hardliners\u201d. The Sun says \u201cSplit hits the fan\u201d. The Express shows Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston smiling as they walk down the street but gives it the headline \u201cNo laughing matter\u201d. Some papers focus on the comment by Allen that \u201cif we do our jobs right there won\u2019t be a Tory party to go back to\u201d. The Telegraph\u2019s splash is: \u201cTory defectors march out with a vow to destroy the party\u201d and the Mail has \u201cI want to kill off Tory party\u201d. The Times says \u201cCameron made late bid to halt Tory defections\u201d. The FT also features a story about the defection but leads with: \u201cWatchdog leaves Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a37bn takeover of Asda close to collapse\u201d.

      "body": "<h2>Get Inn Hostel, Parede, Portugal</h2> <p>With a symmetrical pastel-blue exterior, a la Wes Anderson, and block colour splashes throughout, this former Portuguese family home just outside Lisbon has been transformed into a vibrant new hostel. The partially dilapidated structure was restored in order to keep the original shape of the roof intact. Minimalist interiors include white walls and polished concrete floors with blocks of intense colour including a bright yellow central stairwell. This connects the dorms, which have curtained bunk beds, and box structures, in dark green, housing bathroom facilities on each floor. There\u2019s also a lounge and a terrace for breakfast and summer barbecues.<br>\u2022 <em>Dorms from \u00a312 room only,</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.getinnhostel.com/en/get-inn-hostel\">getinnhostel.com</a></em></p> <h2>Kloem Hostel, Bangkok</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e6a36832a64ef8c795f52029831fdf9b30726b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6a36832a64ef8c795f52029831fdf9b30726b8/0_47_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bar area at Kloem Hostel, Bangkok\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Most of this new hostel \u2013 in a 1950s government building in the Ratchathewi district of central<em><strong> </strong></em>Bangkok \u2013 was constructed using refurbished sections of the old hardwood structure. Completed in 2018, the design was inspired by traditional Thai homes and modernist architecture, with dark panelled walls and white drapes. New elements include a large, netted seating area over the open-sided lobby, hammocks and a grassy central garden space with Malay rose apple trees. There are dorms with curtained bunk bed pods and private rooms, plus the option to \u201cdecorate your own private space\u201d to feel at home, with a choice of pot plants, fish bowls, bamboo table lamps and more.<br>\u2022 <em>Dorms from \u00a315.50 B&amp;B, doubles from \u00a343 B&amp;B, <a href=\"https://www.kloemhostel.com/\">kloemhostel.com</a></em></p> <h2>Native Hostel, Austin, Texas</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2ebb47cdca119bf4bff611a51e013fedad4885b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2ebb47cdca119bf4bff611a51e013fedad4885b/0_3_800_526/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dorm room at Native Hostel, Austin, Texas, US.\" width=\"500\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This two-storey, central hostel was built in the 1890s as a brewery, with the addition of a brick warehouse section in the 1940s. It later became shops and factories but was turned into a hostel with a large event space in mid-2017. The aim of the new design was to move away from \u201cno-frills\u201d hostels the developers had seen across the US. Plaster, carpets and panels were stripped away to expose the stone and steel structure, including historic etching and stencilling. The result is a stylish industrial-inspired interior with comfy leather and velvet furnishings and large gilded mirrors. Alongside dorms with curtained bunks and private rooms, there\u2019s a restaurant, bar and large warehouse space for live music, film screenings, exhibitions and other events. <br>\u2022 <em>Dorms from $40 B&amp;B, <a href=\"https://nativehostels.com/\">nativehostels.com</a></em></p> <h2>Dock Inn, Rostock, Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cee1ac48c4dcca177c1c677eb5706f1495be25a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee1ac48c4dcca177c1c677eb5706f1495be25a6/0_42_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DockInn, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On the edge of Warnem\u00fcende shipyard, stacked shipping containers have been used to form a large hostel with an urban maritime feel. It\u2019s a short walk to a sandy beach and close to the town centre. Containers have been upcycled to create bright bedrooms and several have been welded together to form larger dorms. Open since mid-2017, the industrial space also has a sauna, climbing wall, cinema room, cafe and large open-plan communal spaces with furniture crafted from wooden pallets. It\u2019s one of the latest in a series of shipping-container hostels to have opened in the past few years around the world, including <a href=\"https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Tetris-Container-Hostel/Foz-do-Iguacu/92439\">Tetris Container Hostel in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Ccasa-Hostel/Nha-Trang/271768\">Ccasa Hostel in Nha Trang, Vietnam</a>. <br>\u2022 <em>Dorms from \u00a31</em><em>7 room only, <a href=\"https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Dock-Inn-Hostel-Warnemuende/Rostock/275406\">hostelworld.com</a></em></p> <h2>Long Story Short, Olomouc, Czech Republic</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a84ac30c656d8dc66080cc937ca8528a244ce611\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a84ac30c656d8dc66080cc937ca8528a244ce611/0_64_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Long Story Short, Czech Republic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Part of a 17th-century horseshoe-shaped fortress \u2013 a <em>podkov</em> as it\u2019s also known \u2013 this hostel blends the history of the building with contemporary design features.

The historic town of Olomouc in Moravia, in the east of the Czech Republic, was once protected by a fort known as <a href=\"https://www.strednimorava-tourism.cz/en/destination/locatelliho-bastion\">Locatelli\u2019s Bastion</a>. It became a military bakery in the 19th century. There\u2019s a mix of dorms and private rooms, a cafe, bar and lounge, and a garden with live events in the summer months.

It\u2019s a modern, eco-friendly property, which opened in mid-2017, and was constructed using only local materials, with a shade system created to minimise the need for air-conditioning. Giving it the feel of a pricier beachside hotel, the large 600 sq m decked veranda has a four-sided infinity pool. There\u2019s a cafe and gym on-site, too, and all rooms and dorms have a sea view, so it\u2019s bed to board in seconds.<br>\u2022 <em>Dorms from \u00a320 room only, doubles \u00a384 room only, <a href=\"https://99surflodge.com/en/rooms/\">99surflodge.com</a></em></p> <h2>The Sands, Taos, New Mexico, US</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b0c173fdc2158ebdeb1e1d2ed22b5dbb23e7bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b0c173fdc2158ebdeb1e1d2ed22b5dbb23e7bb4/0_44_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trailer that is now a hostel at The Sands (at Hotel Luna Mystica), Taos, USA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Sands is a new hostel at <a href=\"https://hotellunamystica.com/\">Hotel Luna Mystica</a>, a vintage trailer hotel and campsite in the New Mexico desert.

It has dorms and split-level private rooms, a kitchen on every floor, a library, a bar and lounge area with vintage furniture and grand piano.

Renovation of the historic property took about a year, and was completed in 2017, with many of the design features utilising local craftspeople.

      "bodyText": "Get Inn Hostel, Parede, Portugal With a symmetrical pastel-blue exterior, a la Wes Anderson, and block colour splashes throughout, this former Portuguese family home just outside Lisbon has been transformed into a vibrant new hostel. The partially dilapidated structure was restored in order to keep the original shape of the roof intact. Minimalist interiors include white walls and polished concrete floors with blocks of intense colour including a bright yellow central stairwell. This connects the dorms, which have curtained bunk beds, and box structures, in dark green, housing bathroom facilities on each floor. There\u2019s also a lounge and a terrace for breakfast and summer barbecues. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a312 room only, getinnhostel.com Kloem Hostel, Bangkok Most of this new hostel \u2013 in a 1950s government building in the Ratchathewi district of central Bangkok \u2013 was constructed using refurbished sections of the old hardwood structure. Completed in 2018, the design was inspired by traditional Thai homes and modernist architecture, with dark panelled walls and white drapes. New elements include a large, netted seating area over the open-sided lobby, hammocks and a grassy central garden space with Malay rose apple trees. There are dorms with curtained bunk bed pods and private rooms, plus the option to \u201cdecorate your own private space\u201d to feel at home, with a choice of pot plants, fish bowls, bamboo table lamps and more. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a315.50 B&amp;B, doubles from \u00a343 B&amp;B, kloemhostel.com Native Hostel, Austin, Texas This two-storey, central hostel was built in the 1890s as a brewery, with the addition of a brick warehouse section in the 1940s. It later became shops and factories but was turned into a hostel with a large event space in mid-2017. The aim of the new design was to move away from \u201cno-frills\u201d hostels the developers had seen across the US. Plaster, carpets and panels were stripped away to expose the stone and steel structure, including historic etching and stencilling. The result is a stylish industrial-inspired interior with comfy leather and velvet furnishings and large gilded mirrors. Alongside dorms with curtained bunks and private rooms, there\u2019s a restaurant, bar and large warehouse space for live music, film screenings, exhibitions and other events. \u2022 Dorms from $40 B&amp;B, nativehostels.com Dock Inn, Rostock, Germany On the edge of Warnem\u00fcende shipyard, stacked shipping containers have been used to form a large hostel with an urban maritime feel. It\u2019s a short walk to a sandy beach and close to the town centre. Containers have been upcycled to create bright bedrooms and several have been welded together to form larger dorms. Open since mid-2017, the industrial space also has a sauna, climbing wall, cinema room, cafe and large open-plan communal spaces with furniture crafted from wooden pallets. It\u2019s one of the latest in a series of shipping-container hostels to have opened in the past few years around the world, including Tetris Container Hostel in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil, and Ccasa Hostel in Nha Trang, Vietnam. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a317 room only, hostelworld.com Long Story Short, Olomouc, Czech Republic Part of a 17th-century horseshoe-shaped fortress \u2013 a podkov as it\u2019s also known \u2013 this hostel blends the history of the building with contemporary design features. Traces of stone emerge behind white plastered walls and, under arched ceilings, mezzanine-beds give a stylish twist to traditional bunks. The historic town of Olomouc in Moravia, in the east of the Czech Republic, was once protected by a fort known as Locatelli\u2019s Bastion. It became a military bakery in the 19th century. There\u2019s a mix of dorms and private rooms, a cafe, bar and lounge, and a garden with live events in the summer months. The ground floor also includes Vault 42, a co-working space open to digital nomad guests. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a38 room only, longstoryshort.cz 99 Surf Lodge, Tola, Nicaragua This sleek, minimalist hostel is right on the beach in Playa Santana, between Colorado and Popoyo in north-west Nicaragua, regarded as one of the best surf spots in the country. It\u2019s a modern, eco-friendly property, which opened in mid-2017, and was constructed using only local materials, with a shade system created to minimise the need for air-conditioning. Giving it the feel of a pricier beachside hotel, the large 600 sq m decked veranda has a four-sided infinity pool. There\u2019s a cafe and gym on-site, too, and all rooms and dorms have a sea view, so it\u2019s bed to board in seconds. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a320 room only, doubles \u00a384 room only, 99surflodge.com The Sands, Taos, New Mexico, US The Sands is a new hostel at Hotel Luna Mystica, a vintage trailer hotel and campsite in the New Mexico desert. Its 1957 Spartan Imperial Mansion trailer was renovated in 2017, and being larger than most trailers has room inside for eight bunks and shared space with kitchenette, bathroom with a separate shower room next door. It\u2019s a 20-minute drive to natural hot springs on the banks of the Rio Grande River, or 30 minutes from skiing or hiking in the valley. Beyond the customary beers and a singsong round the outdoor firepit at night, restaurant and live music venue Taos Mesa Brewing welcomes guests next door. \u2022 Dorms from $25 room only, hostelworld.com The Passenger, Porto Porto\u2019s S\u00e3o Bento railway station opened in 1896 and is now a Unesco world heritage site, known for its spectacular grand hall decorated with more than 20,000 azulejo tiles. The hostel, which opened in 2017, is between the first and third floors and retains original design features including the large arched windows, high ceilings and parquet floor. It has dorms and split-level private rooms, a kitchen on every floor, a library, a bar and lounge area with vintage furniture and grand piano. The third floor will soon have an indoor garden and the station\u2019s original clock tower is being redeveloped into a gallery and event space set for opening later this year. \u2022 Dorms from \u20ac18 B&amp;B, hostelworld.com Rodamon Riad, Marrakech Now home to a city-centre hostel, this 100-year-old riad (a house with an interior garden or courtyard) has views of the Djemaa el-Fna market place, mosque Ben Youseff and the Atlas Mountains from the rooftop terrace. Unlike many of the pricier riad palace hotels in the area, the hostel has dorms with curtained bunks, private en suite doubles, as well as family rooms. Renovation of the historic property took about a year, and was completed in 2017, with many of the design features utilising local craftspeople. Interiors mix traditional Moroccan and modern, minimalist styles, with the main attraction being an emerald green and white-tiled courtyard with a restaurant, pool and fountain. \u2022 Dorms from \u00a312 B&amp;B, hostelworld.com Kex, Portland, Oregon Named after the former biscuit factory it was built in, Reykjav\u00edk hostel Kex (Icelandic for biscuit) is opening a property in Portland, Oregon.

      "body": "<p>A Japanese spacecraft is to attempt an audacious smash-and-grab manoeuvre on a speeding asteroid in an attempt to collect samples and return them to Earth.</p> <p>The Hayabusa 2 probe is due to touch down on the asteroid Ryugu at 11pm GMT on Thursday. It will then fire a tantalum pellet into the surface to kick up dust and grains that it will try to capture.</p> <p>The operation will be more of a delicate kiss than a hard touchdown. The spacecraft will barely touch the asteroid as it seeks to gather the dislodged debris with an instrument named the Sampler Horn that hangs from its underbelly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging because it all has to be done autonomously,\u201d said Ian Franchi, an astronomer at the Open University in Milton Keynes. \u201cThere is so little gravity, and there are so many boulders on the surface.\u201d</p> <p>Ryugu is less than a kilometre across and its density is such that its gravitational pull is one sixty-thousandth that on Earth. In such meagre gravity, material dislodged by Hayabusa\u2019s bullet should bounce up the 1.5-metre Sampler Horn into a chamber inside the probe.</p> <p>Hayabusa 2 caught up with Ryugu in June last year after a three-and-a-half-year journey to intercept it.

      "bodyText": "A Japanese spacecraft is to attempt an audacious smash-and-grab manoeuvre on a speeding asteroid in an attempt to collect samples and return them to Earth. The Hayabusa 2 probe is due to touch down on the asteroid Ryugu at 11pm GMT on Thursday. It will then fire a tantalum pellet into the surface to kick up dust and grains that it will try to capture. The operation will be more of a delicate kiss than a hard touchdown. The spacecraft will barely touch the asteroid as it seeks to gather the dislodged debris with an instrument named the Sampler Horn that hangs from its underbelly. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging because it all has to be done autonomously,\u201d said Ian Franchi, an astronomer at the Open University in Milton Keynes. \u201cThere is so little gravity, and there are so many boulders on the surface.\u201d Ryugu is less than a kilometre across and its density is such that its gravitational pull is one sixty-thousandth that on Earth. In such meagre gravity, material dislodged by Hayabusa\u2019s bullet should bounce up the 1.5-metre Sampler Horn into a chamber inside the probe. Hayabusa 2 caught up with Ryugu in June last year after a three-and-a-half-year journey to intercept it. Mission controllers at the Japanese space agency had planned to touch down in October, but delayed the attempt after cameras revealed the surface to be far rockier than expected. Scientists on the mission have spent the past few months performing lab tests with replica equipment to ensure the spacecraft still has a chance of collecting some of the asteroid. Hayabusa 2 will fire a 5g pellet at more than 650mph into the asteroid\u2019s surface. If all goes to plan, the probe will collect up to 10g of grains thrown up by the impact, before retreating to a safe distance. The material will then be stored onboard until the spacecraft returns to its landing site in Woomera, South Australia, in 2020 after a journey of more than 3bn miles. The asteroid belongs to a family of space rocks that are the most primitive building blocks of the solar system. \u201cThis is the material that didn\u2019t get swept up into planets, it got left behind,\u201d said John Bridges, a professor of planetary science at the University of Leicester. \u201cThe reason we want to study it is that this is what material was like at year zero.\u201d Similar material falls to Earth as meteorites, but it is battered and burned as it tears through the atmosphere and quickly becomes contaminated when it thumps into the ground. The asteroid material from Hayabusa 2 will show scientists what meteorite material is like before it plunges to Earth. Analysis of the asteroid grains may shed light on where Earth got its water.

Asteroids also carry organic material that may be important for the emergence of life. The advantage of having pristine grains to study is that, unlike fragments of meteorites, they will not be contaminated with organic material from Earth. In September, Hayabusa 2 dropped two robotic \u201choppers\u201d on to Ryugu which have beamed back images and data from the surface.

Jack Seale Flack 10pm, W This glossy drama stars Anna Paquin as Robyn, a PR fixer who can clean up her clients\u2019 messes but not her own. The first episode sees her saving the reputation of a cheating celeb chef (Max Beesley), pleasing her boss (Sophie Okonedo) and making time for her devoted boyfriend (Arinz\u00e9 Kene). Get past the initial fluff and it has dark edges. Hannah Verdier Film choice The Artist 10pm, BBC Four A true original, this silent, monochrome movie from Michel Hazanavicius is a fond account of the arrival of the talkies in 20s Hollywood. Jean Dujardin won one of its five Oscars for his matinee idol George Valentin, whose career nosedives while that of starlet Peppy (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) takes off. Delightful.

It also suggests an overhaul of planning regulations, including scrapping rules that allow developers to turn offices into flats without special permission.</p> <p>Clive Betts MP, the chair of the committee, said it was likely that \u201cthe heyday of the high street primarily as a retail hub is at an end\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The government should consider taxing online sales, deliveries or packaging and cutting property taxes for retailers as part of a package to help revive the UK\u2019s ailing high streets, according to an influential group of MPs. In a report published on Thursday, the housing communities and local government committee says local authorities need more help, including extra cash, to redevelop town centres. It also suggests an overhaul of planning regulations, including scrapping rules that allow developers to turn offices into flats without special permission. Clive Betts MP, the chair of the committee, said it was likely that \u201cthe heyday of the high street primarily as a retail hub is at an end\u201d. However, he added: \u201cThis need not be its death knell. Local authorities must get to grips with the fact that their town centres need to change; they need to innovate, setting out a long-term strategy for renewal, reconfiguring the town centre and finding new ways of using buildings and encouraging new independent retailers.\u201d Betts said dated planning policies and unfair business rates, which are a tax based on the value of property occupied by a business, were \u201cstacking the odds against businesses with a high street presence and this must end\u201d. The demand for change comes after several well-known high street names have disappeared or been forced to drastically reduce their store numbers as they struggle to cope with online competition, a general slowdown in consumer spending and rising costs from business rates. Other factors include the lower value of the pound against the dollar and the euro. In November, retailers called for decisive action from the government after data showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty had soared by more than 4,400 in the first six months of this year. About 70,000 retail jobs were lost in the final months of 2018 and nearly a third of retail businesses plan to lay off staff in coming months, according to a report by the British Retail Consortium industry body, which was published last month. The HCLG committee report says the government \u201cneeds to go further and faster\u201d to help those with traditional high street shops. \u201cTax reforms are needed to level the playing field between online and high street retailers, and we urge the government to investigate all the options in this area, including an online sales tax,\u201d Betts said. The detailed 79-page report was compiled after weeks of evidence from retailers, including the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, who suggested a 20% tax on online sales. Helen Dickenson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the committee\u2019s proposal to reform business rates. She said: \u201cThe select committee are spot on when they say, \u2018retailers are paying more than their fair share of tax\u2019. In fact, retail accounts for 5% of the economy, pays 10% of all business tax and shoulders 25% of the UK\u2019s business rates bill.\u201d She described the rates system as \u201cdamaging and outdated\u201d and \u201ca major factor in store closures\u201d. However, she said a tax on online retail would do more damage than good: \u201cWith eight of the top 10 internet retailers also having physical shops, it is clear that an online tax would further damage the high street.\u201d The HCLG report welcomes the government\u2019s recently introduced Future High Streets Fund, which is designed to help reinvent town centres.

That doesn\u2019t mean complacency from Labour. It\u2019s possible to rebut the smear that Corbyn or the Labour party as a whole are antisemitic, while arguing there needs to be more decisive action from Labour on tackling the antisemitism of a minority.

Second, the new movement will have to be clear about its political agenda. And when that happens, one thing will be abundantly clear: here is a group of MPs completely at odds with the times in which we live.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

If there is a huge appetite for a centrist realignment of politics then it is difficult to answer why the combined share of the two main parties reached the highest level for nearly half a century in 2017, why Labour enjoyed the biggest vote surge since 1945, and why the Liberal Democrats flatlined at a historic low. That doesn\u2019t mean complacency from Labour. It\u2019s possible to rebut the smear that Corbyn or the Labour party as a whole are antisemitic, while arguing there needs to be more decisive action from Labour on tackling the antisemitism of a minority. It cannot simply take for granted the votes of those remainers for whom Brexit is a key priority. Labour\u2019s abandonment of the principled case for migration is depressing, too. Expect an extended honeymoon for this political formation. But, sooner or later, two things will happen. First, the nation will have to choose between a Tory government in which Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s hard right is in the ascendancy, and an anti-austerity Labour government opposed to a hard Brexit. Second, the new movement will have to be clear about its political agenda. And when that happens, one thing will be abundantly clear: here is a group of MPs completely at odds with the times in which we live. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Domestic questions that are burning and unanswerable in more or less equal measure are a staple of social media. This week, it was towels. Specifically, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Advil/status/1097218169062731776\" title=\"\">how many does an adult human need to own</a>? The podcast host Abdul Dremali asked, and more than 2,000 Twitter replies later, he still couldn\u2019t go shopping for towels. There are some household jobs that no one knows if they are doing right. So can the experts settle a few domestic debates?</p> <h2>1 How many bath towels does a household need?</h2> <p>Each family member should have their own. \u201cYou can\u2019t share a towel,\u201d insists <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynsey_queenofclean/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Lynsey Crombie,</a> AKA <a href=\"https://queenofclean.blog/2017/01/05/introduction-to-me/\" title=\"\">Queen of Clean</a> from Channel 4\u2019s Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners. She thinks this means that five bath towels are necessary per person. But this is because she has a high towel turnover: she washes them every other day, \u201cif not after every use\u201d. The <a href=\"http://www.aggiemackenzie.co.uk/\">cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie</a> is more relaxed, saying she relies on \u201ca sniff test\u201d to know when a towel needs washing, but even she will not let a towel exceed \u201cthree or four days\u201d of usage. They may be out of step, though. A poll of 3,000 people by <a href=\"https://www.hubbub.org.uk/\">Hubbub</a>, an environmental charity, found that people washed their towels every 11 days. Sally Bloomfield, a professor of hygiene at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that towels and bed linen need to be \u201chygienically cleaned\u201d at 40C, despite the environmental benefits of a 30C wash. If you are dropping the temperature, using a powder product or tablet, she says, will \u201cboost the hygiene efficacy\u201d because it contains active oxygen bleach. Bloomfield thinks a weekly towel wash would suffice, but reiterates: \u201cDon\u2019t share towels.\u201d To extend the time between washes, avoid putting towels on top of each other and let them dry out after use. Anna Watson, the head of advocacy at <a href=\"https://www.chemtrust.org/\">CHEMTrust</a>, thinks a towel could go two weeks between washes.</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict: </strong>Five towels per person, each washed every few days.<br><strong>Environmental expert</strong><strong>s\u2019 verdict: </strong>Two, each washed once a fortnight.</p> <h2>2 How often should you change your sheets?</h2> <p>I wash my bed linen once a week. At least, I think I do. But given that my washing day has fallen on almost every day of the week, I think I may miscount. This isn\u2019t too bad. Crombie thinks once a week is sufficient. She does her whole household\u2019s linen on a Sunday \u2013 unless someone has a bug, in which case she does it daily. In her TV work, she has visited homes where sheets have been left unchanged for two months, and says the smell is disgusting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/26/home-improvement-clean-aggie\">MacKenzie</a>, who was arguably the forerunner of the Insta clean phenomenon, agrees. Apparently, the aroma is unmistakably greasy and sour. As she points out: \u201cThe less you change sheets, the more bits of skin will be in the bed.\u201d She recommends a weekly bed change (pyjamas every few days), but for children\u2019s beds \u2013 or if there\u2019s not much \u201ctraffic\u201d in your bed \u2013 a fortnightly switchover is acceptable. Using a top sheet between your body and the duvet means that the duvet cover can be washed once a month, she says, and the mattress protector \u201cwhen it looks dingy\u201d. I look mine in the eye once a year, but Crombie washes hers, and the pillow protectors, weekly. The key is to make sure that you have a full load and use eco settings, says Stephanie Hurry from <a href=\"https://www.waterwise.org.uk/\">Waterwise</a>, which works for greater water efficiency. Chad Staddon, a resource economist at UWE Bristol who is \u201cinterested in people\u2019s behaviours around water\u201d, says he could last two weeks, but his wife prefers a weekly wash. The Hubbub poll found that, on average, its respondents changed their sheets every 16 days. Bloomfield says that pets\u2019 bedding needs to be washed as often as human bedding \u2013 but not at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict: </strong>Once a week.<br><strong>Enviro</strong><strong>nmental expert</strong><strong>s\u2019 verdict: </strong>Once a week is reasonable.</p> <h2>3 Can shoes be worn indoors?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0a1ac05cb59ec780eca39824686d42dad61347f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a1ac05cb59ec780eca39824686d42dad61347f/437_0_4949_2969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Row of shoes of a family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn my house, I don\u2019t like people to wear shoes,\u201d Crombie says. She also dislikes bare feet indoors; one of her pet hates is seeing the imprint of a sweaty foot on a wooden floor. However, if guests come to a dinner party and \u201cthe shoes are part of the outfit\u201d, they can stay on the feet. I fear I could spend a long time trying to evaluate how integral shoes are to a look, so this acid test may not suit all personalities. In any case, if a guest wears shoes indoors, Crombie recommends washing the floor as soon as they have left \u2013 but, she laughs: \u201cI\u2019m not normal!\u201d MacKenzie, who has co-authored a new cleaning book called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/miracle-of-vinegar.html\">The Miracle of Vinegar</a>, also likes shoes to be removed at the front door. Bloomfield says that floors are a low risk as a transmitter of germs, and is unmoved either way. Watson at ChemTRUST says that she likes shoes to be removed. Heather Poore, the creative director at Hubbub, says she removes hers. But Stephen Munton, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.domesticcleaningalliance.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Domestic Cleaning Alliance</a>, disagrees. \u201cA floor is there to be walked on,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict: </strong>No.<br><strong>Environmental expert</strong><strong>s\u2019 verdict: </strong>No. But this is a matter of personal preference.</p> <h2>4 How often should you wash your jeans?</h2> <p>\u201cIf jeans are only worn in the house and not outside, I will wear them again without washing. But if I\u2019ve worn them out and about, they need to be washed,\u201d says Crombie, whose book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-clean-your-house-9780008341947.html\" title=\"\">How to Clean Your House</a> is published next month. \u201cThey hold on to a lot of germs,\u201d she adds. This contradicts the advice of many denim manufacturers. Levi\u2019s CEO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/30/jeans-in-the-freezer-grant-wahl-us-world-cup\" title=\"\">once revealed that he didn\u2019t wash his jeans for a year</a>. MacKenzie says she can get eight to 10 wears out of jeans without washing them. The <a href=\"https://www.loveyourclothes.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Love Your Clothes campaign</a> recommends freeze-washing: putting the jeans in the freezer for 24 hours, although this doesn\u2019t remove stains. \u201cPersonally, I would put mine in the wash every couple of weeks,\u201d says Hurry from Waterwise. \u201cYou want to be thinking about the amount you are washing clothes,\u201d says Watson. Last year, Friends of the Earth found that clothes washing generates about 4,000 tonnes of plastic microfibre pollution in the UK every year.

But MacKenzie says this is an issue that needs to be addressed. She would never let a toilet brush enter her house. \u201cToilet brushes give me the heebie-jeebies. I think it\u2019s because I have seen so many in my time,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t bear them. I just think they are vile.\u201d Bloomfield agrees they are unhygienic. Crombie owns a silicone one without bristles. \u201cThere is a fetid liquid bacteria soup at the bottom of every toilet-brush holder,\u201d MacKenzie points out. Until now, I have always accepted toilet brushes as one of life\u2019s necessary inconveniences, but MacKenzie says she \u201cwould much rather get a pair of thick rubber gloves on and use my fingernail under the thick rubber gloves to get any bits\u201d. Even though she has said the words \u201cthick rubber gloves\u201d twice, they are still not putting a thick enough layer between me and the image of the fingernail on the toilet bowl. Crombie also advocates donning the rubber gloves for \u201ca sweep round any sticky bits with some toilet paper\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict:</strong> Toilet brushes are not to be trusted.<br><strong>Environmental expert</strong><strong>s\u2019 verdict: </strong>This is not an environmental issue.</p> <h2>6 What is the best way to wash a cleaning cloth?</h2> <p>Cloths that are used to clean somehow always seem inherently clean themselves. This is wrong, of course. Especially the ones that curl in a slimy heap by the tap. \u201cCloths are a wonderful spreader of germs. Oh, they are fantastic!\u201d Bloomfield says. Crombie goes through a staggering 16 cloths a day, all colour-coded. Other than the toilet cloth, which goes in a tub on its own, she washes them all in the machine at 60C, adding a bit of Dettol Laundry Cleanser to the mix. She washes tea towels after each use. Some people, she says, and my face grows hotter as she says this, have a habit of folding used tea towels as neatly as possible and hanging them on the oven like a good deed. Those towels are dirty, she says. MacKenzie loves microfibre cloths. To clean them: \u201cGet a bowl of boiling water, add a capful of bleach and dump the cloth in,\u201d she says. How often? \u201cI\u2019d say at the end of each day. Once you\u2019ve wiped down your surfaces.\u201d Hurry says that she \u201cwould usually give it a rinse or a wash after each use. Then when it was starting to look a bit too grubby, I\u2019d throw it away.\u201d Watson at CHEMTrust never buys a cloth. She makes hers out of cut-up holey children\u2019s clothes, and sticks them in with the clothes wash every other day.</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict: </strong>Wash after each use. Minimum of daily.<br><strong>Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: </strong>Rinse after use. Wash every other day.</p> <h2>7 How often should you dust?</h2> <p>\u201cThere are chemicals in all our products, carpets and furniture,\u201d Watson says. \u201cThose chemicals get abraded off and build up in household dust. You want to stay on top of that.\u201d She suggests once a week to dust surfaces. \u201cTo try to reduce your exposure to chemicals that are present in indoor air, trying to keep your house as dust-free as possible.\u201d This seems tricky because in my house the dust seems to regroup barely an hour after it has been dusted. I use a dry e-cloth duster. \u201cCan I just say, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going wrong,\u201d MacKenzie says. \u201cDamp. No polish,\u201d says Munton, who is actually dusting as we speak.

Or, if you have asthma, probably every few days.\u201d Crombie, who has \u201ca lot of vacuums\u201d, likes to do her bedroom daily, and says: \u201cIf you have the ability to pull out the bed easily, then do it every time you Hoover. Otherwise once a month.\u201d Access is clearly a factor here, and this may be why the Good Housekeeping Institute replies to say: \u201cIdeally once every three months.\u201d \u201cHmm. I\u2019m afraid to say that it\u2019s really important to be thinking about those places in a house where dust accumulates,\u201d says Watson. \u201cI\u2019m not saying once a week. It depends if you\u2019ve got a bed that\u2019s off the floor. If it\u2019s fairly accessible, do it.

I can do it in four minutes 30,\u201d she says with some satisfaction. On top of that, she does a weekly deep clean lasting half an hour. \u201cSwish something around at least once a day,\u201d says Munton, who is out of breath from lugging a vacuum down a staircase. He likes to clean toilet seats with washing-up liquid. \u201cIt\u2019s the best. It\u2019s pH-neutral. It\u2019s cheap. Everybody\u2019s got some.\u201d Hurry from Waterwise is circumspect. \u201cThis is one we wouldn\u2019t dictate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut with the right sort of products and a bit of elbow grease, you wouldn\u2019t need to use a lot of water.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Cleaners\u2019 verdict: </strong>Daily toilet clean plus a weekly deep clean of bathroom.<br><strong>Environmental expert\u2019s verdict: </strong>As you see fit.</p> <h2>10 Is it best to shower in the morning or evening?</h2> <p>In the morning, MacKenzie says. In the evening, Crombie says. She likes \u201cto go to bed clean\u201d. Her husband \u201cis the other way round \u2026 He\u2019ll do a full day\u2019s work, travel on the tube, then undress and get into my bed. Whereas I think if you go to bed clean, you get up clean.\u201d Munton showers morning and evening. Hurry prefers morning showers, especially ones that are four minutes or shorter: the average shower uses eight to 12 litres of water a minute. Some power showers go up to 15 litres a minute. Reducing the products you use will limit the amount of time you spend under the water. \u201cA shower is water plus energy and that\u2019s invariant,\u201d says Staddon, whose gran used to flake off the lye soap with a penknife, and give Staddon the same bar to wash with as she used to wash dishes and clothes.

      "bodyText": "Domestic questions that are burning and unanswerable in more or less equal measure are a staple of social media. This week, it was towels. Specifically, how many does an adult human need to own? The podcast host Abdul Dremali asked, and more than 2,000 Twitter replies later, he still couldn\u2019t go shopping for towels. There are some household jobs that no one knows if they are doing right. So can the experts settle a few domestic debates? 1 How many bath towels does a household need? Each family member should have their own. \u201cYou can\u2019t share a towel,\u201d insists Lynsey Crombie, AKA Queen of Clean from Channel 4\u2019s Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners. She thinks this means that five bath towels are necessary per person. But this is because she has a high towel turnover: she washes them every other day, \u201cif not after every use\u201d. The cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie is more relaxed, saying she relies on \u201ca sniff test\u201d to know when a towel needs washing, but even she will not let a towel exceed \u201cthree or four days\u201d of usage. They may be out of step, though. A poll of 3,000 people by Hubbub, an environmental charity, found that people washed their towels every 11 days. Sally Bloomfield, a professor of hygiene at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that towels and bed linen need to be \u201chygienically cleaned\u201d at 40C, despite the environmental benefits of a 30C wash. If you are dropping the temperature, using a powder product or tablet, she says, will \u201cboost the hygiene efficacy\u201d because it contains active oxygen bleach. Bloomfield thinks a weekly towel wash would suffice, but reiterates: \u201cDon\u2019t share towels.\u201d To extend the time between washes, avoid putting towels on top of each other and let them dry out after use. Anna Watson, the head of advocacy at CHEMTrust, thinks a towel could go two weeks between washes. Cleaners\u2019 verdict: Five towels per person, each washed every few days. Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: Two, each washed once a fortnight. 2 How often should you change your sheets? I wash my bed linen once a week. At least, I think I do. But given that my washing day has fallen on almost every day of the week, I think I may miscount. This isn\u2019t too bad. Crombie thinks once a week is sufficient. She does her whole household\u2019s linen on a Sunday \u2013 unless someone has a bug, in which case she does it daily. In her TV work, she has visited homes where sheets have been left unchanged for two months, and says the smell is disgusting. MacKenzie, who was arguably the forerunner of the Insta clean phenomenon, agrees. Apparently, the aroma is unmistakably greasy and sour. As she points out: \u201cThe less you change sheets, the more bits of skin will be in the bed.\u201d She recommends a weekly bed change (pyjamas every few days), but for children\u2019s beds \u2013 or if there\u2019s not much \u201ctraffic\u201d in your bed \u2013 a fortnightly switchover is acceptable. Using a top sheet between your body and the duvet means that the duvet cover can be washed once a month, she says, and the mattress protector \u201cwhen it looks dingy\u201d. I look mine in the eye once a year, but Crombie washes hers, and the pillow protectors, weekly. The key is to make sure that you have a full load and use eco settings, says Stephanie Hurry from Waterwise, which works for greater water efficiency. Chad Staddon, a resource economist at UWE Bristol who is \u201cinterested in people\u2019s behaviours around water\u201d, says he could last two weeks, but his wife prefers a weekly wash. The Hubbub poll found that, on average, its respondents changed their sheets every 16 days. Bloomfield says that pets\u2019 bedding needs to be washed as often as human bedding \u2013 but not at the same time. Cleaners\u2019 verdict: Once a week. Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: Once a week is reasonable. 3 Can shoes be worn indoors? \u201cIn my house, I don\u2019t like people to wear shoes,\u201d Crombie says. She also dislikes bare feet indoors; one of her pet hates is seeing the imprint of a sweaty foot on a wooden floor. However, if guests come to a dinner party and \u201cthe shoes are part of the outfit\u201d, they can stay on the feet. I fear I could spend a long time trying to evaluate how integral shoes are to a look, so this acid test may not suit all personalities. In any case, if a guest wears shoes indoors, Crombie recommends washing the floor as soon as they have left \u2013 but, she laughs: \u201cI\u2019m not normal!\u201d MacKenzie, who has co-authored a new cleaning book called The Miracle of Vinegar, also likes shoes to be removed at the front door. Bloomfield says that floors are a low risk as a transmitter of germs, and is unmoved either way. Watson at ChemTRUST says that she likes shoes to be removed. Heather Poore, the creative director at Hubbub, says she removes hers. But Stephen Munton, the director of the Domestic Cleaning Alliance, disagrees. \u201cA floor is there to be walked on,\u201d he says. Cleaners\u2019 verdict: No. Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: No. But this is a matter of personal preference. 4 How often should you wash your jeans? \u201cIf jeans are only worn in the house and not outside, I will wear them again without washing. But if I\u2019ve worn them out and about, they need to be washed,\u201d says Crombie, whose book How to Clean Your House is published next month. \u201cThey hold on to a lot of germs,\u201d she adds. This contradicts the advice of many denim manufacturers. Levi\u2019s CEO once revealed that he didn\u2019t wash his jeans for a year. MacKenzie says she can get eight to 10 wears out of jeans without washing them. The Love Your Clothes campaign recommends freeze-washing: putting the jeans in the freezer for 24 hours, although this doesn\u2019t remove stains. \u201cPersonally, I would put mine in the wash every couple of weeks,\u201d says Hurry from Waterwise. \u201cYou want to be thinking about the amount you are washing clothes,\u201d says Watson. Last year, Friends of the Earth found that clothes washing generates about 4,000 tonnes of plastic microfibre pollution in the UK every year. Making sure the drum is full helps, as this reduces friction between clothes, making them shed fewer plastic fibres. Cleaners\u2019 verdict: Every one to 10 wears. Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: When they are dirty. 5 Is it OK to use a toilet brush? It had never occurred to me \u2013 nor the environmentalists interviewed \u2013 that there might be another way to clean a toilet. But MacKenzie says this is an issue that needs to be addressed. She would never let a toilet brush enter her house. \u201cToilet brushes give me the heebie-jeebies. I think it\u2019s because I have seen so many in my time,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t bear them. I just think they are vile.\u201d Bloomfield agrees they are unhygienic. Crombie owns a silicone one without bristles. \u201cThere is a fetid liquid bacteria soup at the bottom of every toilet-brush holder,\u201d MacKenzie points out. Until now, I have always accepted toilet brushes as one of life\u2019s necessary inconveniences, but MacKenzie says she \u201cwould much rather get a pair of thick rubber gloves on and use my fingernail under the thick rubber gloves to get any bits\u201d. Even though she has said the words \u201cthick rubber gloves\u201d twice, they are still not putting a thick enough layer between me and the image of the fingernail on the toilet bowl. Crombie also advocates donning the rubber gloves for \u201ca sweep round any sticky bits with some toilet paper\u201d. Cleaners\u2019 verdict: Toilet brushes are not to be trusted. Environmental experts\u2019 verdict: This is not an environmental issue. 6 What is the best way to wash a cleaning cloth? Cloths that are used to clean somehow always seem inherently clean themselves. This is wrong, of course.

      "bodyText": "The conscientious citizens of Philadelphia continue to put their pizza boxes, plastic bottles, yoghurt containers and other items into recycling bins. But in the past three months, half of these recyclables have been loaded on to trucks, taken to a hulking incineration facility and burned, according to the city\u2019s government. It\u2019s a situation being replicated across the US as cities struggle to adapt to a recent ban by China on the import of items intended for reuse. The loss of this overseas dumping ground means that plastics, paper and glass set aside for recycling by Americans is being stuffed into domestic landfills or is simply burned in vast volumes. This new reality risks an increase of plumes of toxic pollution that threaten the largely black and Latino communities who live near heavy industry and dumping sites in the US. About 200 tons of recycling material is sent to the huge Covanta incinerator in Chester City, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, every day since China\u2019s import ban came into practice last year, the company says. \u201cPeople want to do the right thing by recycling but they have no idea where it goes and who it impacts,\u201d said Zulene Mayfield, who was born and raised in Chester and now spearheads a community group against the incinerator, called Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living. \u201cPeople in Chester feel hopeless \u2013 all they want is for their kids to get out, escape. Why should we be expendable? Why should this place have to be burdened by people\u2019s trash and shit?\u201d Some experts worry that burning plastic recycling will create a new fog of dioxins that will worsen an already alarming health situation in Chester. Nearly four in 10 children in the city have asthma, while the rate of ovarian cancer is 64% higher than the rest of Pennsylvania and lung cancer rates are 24% higher, according to state health statistics. The dilemma with what to do with items earmarked for recycling is playing out across the US. The country generates more than 250m tons of waste a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with about a third of this recycled and composted. Until recently, China had been taking about 40% of US paper, plastics and other recyclables but this trans-Pacific waste route has now ground to a halt. In July 2017, China told the World Trade Organization it no longer wanted to be the end point for yang laji, or foreign garbage, with the country keen to grapple with its own mountains of waste. Since January 2018, China hasn\u2019t accepted two dozen different recycling materials, such as plastic and mixed paper, unless they meet strict rules around contamination. The imported recycling has to be clean and unmixed \u2013 a standard too hard to meet for most American cities. It is \u201cvirtually impossible to meet the stringent contamination standards established in China\u201d, said a spokeswoman for the city of Philadelphia, who added that the cost of recycling has become a \u201cmajor impact on the city\u2019s budget\u201d, at around $78 a ton. Half of the city\u2019s recycling is now going to the Covanta plant, the spokeswoman said. There isn\u2019t much of a domestic market for US recyclables \u2013 materials such as steel or high-density plastics can be sold on but much of the rest holds little more value than rubbish \u2013 meaning that local authorities are hurling it into landfills or burning it in huge incinerators like the one in Chester, which already torches around 3,510 tons of trash, the weight equivalent of more than 17 blue whales, every day. \u201cThis is a real moment of reckoning for the US because of a lot of these incinerators are aging, on their last legs, without the latest pollution controls,\u201d said Claire Arkin, campaign associate at Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. \u201cYou may think burning plastic means \u2018poof, it\u2019s gone\u2019 but it puts some very nasty pollution into the air for communities that are already dealing with high rates of asthma and cancers.\u201d Hugging the western bank of the Delaware River, which separates Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Chester City was once a humming industrial outpost, hosting Ford and General Motors plants. Since the war, however, Chester has been hollowed out, with an exodus of jobs ushering in an era where a third of people live in poverty. The industry that remains emits a cocktail of soot and chemicals upon a population of 34,000 residents, 70% of them black. There\u2019s a waste water treatment plant, a nearby Kimberly-Clark paper mill and a medical waste facility. And then there\u2019s Covanta\u2019s incinerator, one of the largest of its kind in the US. Just a tiny fraction of the trash burned at the plant is from Chester \u2013 the rest is funneled in via truck and train from as far as New York City and North Carolina. The burning of trash releases a host of pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and particulate matter, which are tiny fragments of debris that, once inhaled, cause an array of health problems. It\u2019s difficult to single out the exact cause of any cancer but a host of studies have identified possible links between air pollution and ovarian and breast cancers, which are unusually prevalent in Chester. A 1995 report by the EPA found that air pollution from local industry provides a \u201clarge component of the cancer and non-cancer risk to the citizens of Chester\u201d. \u201cThere are higher than normal rates of heart disease, stroke and asthma in Chester, which are all endpoints for poor air,\u201d said Dr Marilyn Howarth, a public health expert at the University of Pennsylvania who has advised Chester activists for the past six years. Howarth said residents now risk a worsened exposure to pollution due to increased truck traffic rumbling through their streets, bringing recycling to the plant. Once burned, plastics give off volatile organics, some of them carcinogenic. \u201cIt is difficult to link any single case of cancer, heart disease or asthma directly to a particular source. However, the emissions from Covanta contain known carcinogens so they absolutely increase the risk of cancer to area residents.\u201d Covanta say that pollution controls, such as scrubbers in smokestacks, will negate toxins emitted by recyclables. After passing through the emissions control system, the plant\u2019s eventual output is comfortably below limits set by state and federal regulators, the company says, with emissions of dioxins far better than the expected standard.

It is being presented by organisers as a turning point for the way in which the church handles allegations across the globe and the way it strengthens child protection policies. If it is indeed a turning point, the survivors of clerical sexual abuse and lay Catholics, exhausted by the constant revelations, will be mightily relieved. But they will also be wanting the church to explain why there has been a pandemic of abuse over so many years, and why abusers were left free to assault and rape children.</p> \n<p>The extent to which abuse was kept hidden for so long by complicit church leaders was exposed by the Boston Globe investigation, the subject of the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight. The journalists discovered a cover-up of a series of abusive priests operating in Massachusetts by the Boston archdiocese and its cardinal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/cardinal-bernard-law-boston-sex-abuse-scandal-dies\" title=\"\">Bernard Law</a>. The avoidance of scandal \u2013 something Catholic canon law advocates \u2013 was the priority. Abuse has also flourished in places where the church is so powerful that civil authorities long failed to take action \u2013 places like Boston, and Ireland.</p> \n<p>A cause that is often cited for grooming and abusing children is the vow of celibacy made by a Catholic priest. But is it? Plenty of other paedophiles \u2013 Jimmy Savile, say, or Rolf Harris \u2013 were not celibates. But the culture of celibacy could well lead to abuse not being reported. One lawyer working on abuse cases in Britain told me of a priest who realised another was abusing children and threatened to report it to their bishop. But the accused priest then threatened to put in a complaint about his own relationship with a woman. He backed down. Given that the American psychotherapist and former priest Richard Sipe estimated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/07/catholic-priests-unmasked-god-boys\" title=\"\">half of Catholic priests do not remain celibate</a>, one can see how a conspiracy of silence can develop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"abbee759-ccb3-402b-9b41-9be57a4e131d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YUokj9OiQJI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The recent case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/pope-defrocks-ex-cardinal-theodore-mccarrick-over-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick</a> of Washington DC also underlies the role that silence has played in this scandal. He was well-known to prominent politicians \u2013 he celebrated Ted Kennedy\u2019s requiem mass \u2013 but beneath the cloak of respectability, McCarrick was a manipulator of power for his own personal gain, taking sexual advantage of seminarians. While his behaviour was known to many inside the church, action was only taken in 2018, when credible stories emerged of his assaults on minors. Last weekend he was finally defrocked. It may well suit Francis and his advisers to be perceived as taking firm and drastic action against an eminent member of the church just days before the abuse summit. But Catholics will want to see the Vatican owning up to a cover-up.</p> \n<p>There is also the bigger question. Why is this happening in the Catholic church? Like music tutors, teachers, BBC stars, politicians or Anglican priests, Catholic prelates have been in positions of power and trust which they could exploit to gain access to children. But is there something else as well? At a recent hearing of the UK child abuse inquiry, Christopher Jamison, abbot primate of the English Benedictine Congregation, said that the reason monk-priests had perpetrated abuse was because their training <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/04/popes-uk-envoy-fails-to-respond-to-requests-by-child-sex-abuse-inquiry\" title=\"\">focused too much on doctrine</a> and not enough on human formation \u2013 studying themselves and others. \u201cThere was catastrophic moral failure and weak leadership responding to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat weak leadership can involve naivety; a willingness of a bishop to believe a paedophile priest when he admits an offence, says it will never happen again and begs forgiveness.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/vatican-reveals-secret-rules-for-priests-who-father-children\">Vatican reveals it has secret rules for priests who father children</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pope Francis\u2019s adviser on child sex abuse, Father Hans Zollner, last year described the abuse crisis to me as a \u201cmoral catastrophe\u201d. The summit this weekend will underline how far the church recognises that catastrophe and what it intends to do. It needs to commit itself to making the protection of children paramount, and consider whether bishops can be pastoral towards their priests and also police them. It needs to think hard about training for the priesthood and the role of personal growth.</p> \n<p>For Francis the summit will be a test of his credibility. His papacy began well with his appointment of a pontifical commission into the abuse of minors which included survivors on its panel but they left, frustrated by lack of progress.He also caused outrage when he defended a Chilean bishop who protected an abuser as a victim of calumny.</p> \n<p>At the summit, survivors of abuse will give testimonies each day. There will be themes of accountability, responsibility and transparency. It will end with a penitential service and be addressed by the pope. The church has been penitent many times about abuse \u2013 so frequently that some survivors have grown deeply sceptical about the value of its apologies. Transparency, though, is another matter. If it signs up to that, to the end of cover-ups, to clarity about the paramountcy of children\u2019s protection, then change might finally be coming.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of the Tablet and author of The Keys and the Kingdom: The British and the Papacy</p>",

Plenty of other paedophiles \u2013 Jimmy Savile, say, or Rolf Harris \u2013 were not celibates. But the culture of celibacy could well lead to abuse not being reported. One lawyer working on abuse cases in Britain told me of a priest who realised another was abusing children and threatened to report it to their bishop. But the accused priest then threatened to put in a complaint about his own relationship with a woman. He backed down. Given that the American psychotherapist and former priest Richard Sipe estimated that half of Catholic priests do not remain celibate, one can see how a conspiracy of silence can develop. The recent case of ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington DC also underlies the role that silence has played in this scandal. He was well-known to prominent politicians \u2013 he celebrated Ted Kennedy\u2019s requiem mass \u2013 but beneath the cloak of respectability, McCarrick was a manipulator of power for his own personal gain, taking sexual advantage of seminarians. While his behaviour was known to many inside the church, action was only taken in 2018, when credible stories emerged of his assaults on minors. Last weekend he was finally defrocked. It may well suit Francis and his advisers to be perceived as taking firm and drastic action against an eminent member of the church just days before the abuse summit. But Catholics will want to see the Vatican owning up to a cover-up. There is also the bigger question. Why is this happening in the Catholic church? Like music tutors, teachers, BBC stars, politicians or Anglican priests, Catholic prelates have been in positions of power and trust which they could exploit to gain access to children. But is there something else as well? At a recent hearing of the UK child abuse inquiry, Christopher Jamison, abbot primate of the English Benedictine Congregation, said that the reason monk-priests had perpetrated abuse was because their training focused too much on doctrine and not enough on human formation \u2013 studying themselves and others. \u201cThere was catastrophic moral failure and weak leadership responding to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat weak leadership can involve naivety; a willingness of a bishop to believe a paedophile priest when he admits an offence, says it will never happen again and begs forgiveness.\u201d Pope Francis\u2019s adviser on child sex abuse, Father Hans Zollner, last year described the abuse crisis to me as a \u201cmoral catastrophe\u201d. The summit this weekend will underline how far the church recognises that catastrophe and what it intends to do. It needs to commit itself to making the protection of children paramount, and consider whether bishops can be pastoral towards their priests and also police them. It needs to think hard about training for the priesthood and the role of personal growth. For Francis the summit will be a test of his credibility. His papacy began well with his appointment of a pontifical commission into the abuse of minors which included survivors on its panel but they left, frustrated by lack of progress.He also caused outrage when he defended a Chilean bishop who protected an abuser as a victim of calumny. At the summit, survivors of abuse will give testimonies each day. There will be themes of accountability, responsibility and transparency. It will end with a penitential service and be addressed by the pope. The church has been penitent many times about abuse \u2013 so frequently that some survivors have grown deeply sceptical about the value of its apologies. Transparency, though, is another matter. If it signs up to that, to the end of cover-ups, to clarity about the paramountcy of children\u2019s protection, then change might finally be coming. \u2022 Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of the Tablet and author of The Keys and the Kingdom: The British and the Papacy",

      "bodyText": "Green groups say Australia\u2019s biggest coal producer Glencore should commit to withdrawing from new coalmining projects if it is serious about aligning its business with the goals of the Paris agreement. The company has moved to cap its output of thermal and coking coal at current production levels of 145m tonnes a year after pressure from investors who want companies to take stronger action and factor in the financial risks of climate change. Glencore says the decision to cap coal production and focus investment on commodities including nickel, copper and cobalt used in the renewables industry does not mean it intends to drop greenfield coal projects in Australia, such as its Wandoan coal project in Queensland\u2019s Surat Basin. The project has been on hold for several years for economic reasons because it would require investment for both the mine and associated new infrastructure. In New South Wales, the company\u2019s proposal for the expanded United Wambo Project in the Hunter Valley is being assessed by the NSW Independent Planning Commission and the forecast tonnes of that project are already contained within the 145MT cap. \u201cGlencore has been very clear that we closely consider market conditions before bringing on new coal projects as they need to be economically sustainable over a long period,\u201d a company spokesman said following the announcement. \u201cAs older mines in our portfolio come to the end of their economic life, all coal projects will be considered.

It follows work by the Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative pushing the world\u2019s biggest emitters to reduce emissions and improve financial disclosures related to climate change. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change and a member of the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said more companies would be making similar statements in the future. \u201cI can definitely say there will be more announcements in the months ahead from very big companies related to climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople tend to think of this as climate activism or investor activism but actually what it is is these are very big, very mainstream investors who want very big and mainstream companies to have a plan on climate change. \u201cThis is some of Australia\u2019s and the world\u2019s biggest institutional investors and pension funds saying you have to have a plan on climate change.

      "bodyText": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives has knocked back an attempt to sanction Tim Wilson for his handling of the franking credit inquiry but left the door open if Labor members of the committee give evidence they experienced political interference. In a statement to the House on Thursday, Tony Smith criticised Wilson by noting he had broken conventions by creating a private website to solicit submissions against Labor\u2019s policy and by the apparent coordination of meetings with one of its primary opponents. Smith concluded that although there was \u201cthe potential for interference\u201d, Labor had yet to establish that interference prevented the House economics committee from fulfilling its responsibilities. Last week Labor pushed to refer Tim Wilson to the privileges committee over alleged politicisation of the inquiry which he chairs. Wilson authorised a partisan website stoptheretirementtax.com, part-funded by Geoff Wilson, his first-cousin once-removed, which garners submissions opposed to Labor\u2019s policy and signs submitters up to a Wilson Asset Management petition, a company chaired by Geoff Wilson. In September Geoff Wilson boasted to investors he had asked Tim Wilson to schedule inquiry hearings alongside Wilson Asset Management roadshow events to help investors protest against Labor\u2019s policy. Smith refused to give precedence to Labor\u2019s motion to refer Tim Wilson, noting that the penal power of the House is significant and \u201cshould be exercised with restraint\u201d. He said there is a \u201csignificant hurdle\u201d to establish a case of contempt, which must \u201camount to an improper interference of the committee of the free exercise of its authority or functions\u201d. \u201cI appreciate the concerns that may have been raised by the actions of the member for Goldstein [Tim Wilson] and the actions could be seen to have caused damage to the committee\u2019s reputation and the reputation of the House committee system more generally,\u201d Smith said. But he concluded the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate an interference that would \u201cprevent the committee in a fundamental way from continuing to fulfil its basic responsibilities in relation to its inquiry work\u201d. Smith said that Tim Wilson\u2019s actions \u201chave not always conformed with what I see as the conventions usually observed by chairs of House committees\u201d. \u201cThe particular matters I would mention include having a private website authorised by and with the badging of the chair of the committee which appeared to solicit submissions and attendees at public hearings from just one perspective.\u201d \u201cAnd secondly, apparently arranging for a public hearing of the committee to coincide with the meeting of a group with an active interest in the inquiry, including the possible intention to engage in protest activity at the hearing.\u201d Smith said he was satisfied there was the \u201cpotential for interference\u201d and said he is prepared to consider the referral if there is \u201cevidence the committee was unduly prevented from doing its work\u201d, such as evidence from committee members. Smith warned that \u201chanding out of party political material should not be tolerated by chairs\u201d at committee meetings. He also said it would be \u201cgood practice\u201d to declare a pecuniary interest, although the rules only ban a direct pecuniary interest that is \u201cpeculiar to a particular person\u201d. Tim Wilson has declared on the pecuniary interest register that he is a shareholder in two funds managed by Wilson Asset Management but failed to make a declaration in public hearings, including the 30 November hearing at which Geoff Wilson gave evidence. He has said such a declaration is not necessary because he will not be affected by Labor\u2019s changes to the franking credit system. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, thanked Smith and said he would make inquiries of committee members in line with the Speaker\u2019s advice. Labor MP and committee member Matt Thistlethwaite told Guardian Australia the Speaker had confirmed Tim Wilson\u2019s actions were \u201cnot within the conventions of parliament\u201d. \u201cThe handing out of membership forms at inquiry hearings and Liberal MP posters have damaged the reputation of the committee,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Tim Wilson\u2019s done doesn\u2019t pass the pub test. The average Australian just thinks \u2026 he\u2019s been overtly political in an inquiry that should be about the facts and working to improve our taxation system.\u201d Tim Wilson thanked Smith for his \u201cfair consideration\u201d of the matter, and said the objective of the inquiry was always to \u201cmaximise the participation of Australian people into their parliament\u201d. Wilson said the process is open and noted that Australians can make submissions on the official committee website and anyone can attend hearings.",

      "bodyText": "The much-maligned AFLX competition, which takes place on Friday in Melbourne, will employ a game of rock, paper, scissors instead of the more traditional coin toss to determine the direction teams kick at Marvel Stadium. The latest innovation is an attempt at maintaining the focus on entertainment at the pre-season event by creating \u201cbanter\u201d on the pitch, with teammates of the four captains encouraged to hang around the staging of the game and engage in ribbing the opposition. The schoolyard staple is one of a number of new initiatives brought in for this year\u2019s tournament, now in its second incarnation after being introduced in 2o18. Another sees the captains of the four teams \u2013 Bolts, Rampage, Deadly and Flyers \u2013 select their own theme songs to be played when they run out onto the pitch. An open dress code has been allowed for players arriving at the stadium, allowing them to express themselves sartorially outside the confines of usual club attire, and when they take to the field, they will sport jumpers with either their own names or a chosen nickname on their backs. Numbers are also of the players\u2019 choosing. The leading scorer on the night will be presented with the \u201cSuperboot\u201d trophy as the AFL seeks to combat opposition to the competition and raise fun levels to new heights. In keeping with the aim of making the spectacle appeal to children, kids zones will be dotted along the boundary line and there will be other assorted children-friendly activities including ball pits, jumping mats and face painters. There will also be a rock-climbing wall inside the stadium. AFLX is a watered down version of AFL, played on a rectangular pitch over shorter periods with fewer players and tweaked rules. The aim, according to the AFL, is to appeal to an overseas audience and younger fans, but since its inception has been met with some resistance. And the latest move has, perhaps predictably, been met with ridicule in some quarters. Anticipation for Friday\u2019s tournament has also been tempered by a number of big-name withdrawals through injury. Melbourne\u2019s Tom McDonald and GWS forward Jeremy Cameron became the latest star players to drop out on Wednesday. McDonald was due to play for Jack Riewoldt\u2019s Rampage side, with Cameron selected to play for Nat Fyfe\u2019s Flyers. Hawthorn pair Isaac Smith and Luke Breust had already pulled out in favour of rest while new teammate Chad Wingard, along with Port Adelaide\u2019s Robbie Gray, Melbourne\u2019s Steven May, Fremantle\u2019s Joel Hamling and North Melbourne\u2019s Robbie Tarrant are all missing through injury. Fyfe and fellow AFLX captain Patrick Dangerfield sought to defend the concept in the wake of the criticism on Thursday, with the Fremantle star emphasising the event is supposed to be fun and \u201cfor the kids\u201d. \u201cThe colours are bright, the names are a bit funky. Have a good time,\u201d he said. Dangerfield, who will lead the Bolts on Friday, said he could not understand the negative press and that critics of the revamped competition were missing the point. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting seeing just how many negative articles there has been and the personal opinion of those journalists,\u201d Dangerfield said. \u201cIt [AFLX] is not aimed at them, it\u2019s aimed at a younger demographic.

The state boasts a fiercely conservative Republican party \u2013 which chased out Senator Jeff Flake, one of the president\u2019s chief critics, and just recently elected a Trump acolyte as it\u2019s chair. But it also sent the late John McCain to the Senate six times and in 2018, elected Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and will hold a competitive Senate race in 2020 to serve the remainder of McCain\u2019s term. </p> \n  <p>All of this is to say that new polling from Arizona-based firm OH Predictive Insights indicates that the right Democratic presidential nominee might just have a shot there. <br></p> \n  <p>The poll \u2013 and, reminder, it is very early in the process \u2013 shows that in a prospective match up between former vice-president Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the men are tied.

It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information.

The Washington Post is now supporting CNN\u2019s report that the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as early as next week. Regulations call for Mueller to submit to the attorney general a confidential explanation as to why he decided to charge certain individuals, as well as who else he investigated and why he decided not to charge those people. The regulations then call for the attorney general to report to Congress about the investigation. An adviser to President Trump said there is palpable concern among the president\u2019s inner circle that the report might contain information about Trump and his team that is politically damaging, but not criminal conduct. After postponing due to threats against his family, Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, has set a date to appear before Congress. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports that a neo-Nazi serving as a lieutenant in the US coast guard was allegedly plotting an attack on Democratic members of Congress and media personalities.

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the Alabama woman who left the US to join Islamic State in Syria is not a US citizen and won\u2019t be allowed back in the US. Hoda Muthana, 24, first came forward in an interview with the Guardian this week where she said she regretted her decision to join the terrorist group. Donald Trump said he told Pompeo to block Muthana from entering the US - which raises questions about whether the decision to call Muthana \u201cnot a citizen\u201d was made in accordance with US and international law. As early as next week, the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, according to CNN. Citing anonymous sources, CNN said Barr plans to submit to Congress a summary of Mueller\u2019s confidential report. Hate groups in the US have continued to surge in the Trump era, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, raised $6m from 223,047 people in the first 24 hours of his campaign, with an average donation of $27 - the most money in the first 24 hours of any other Democratic contender for the 2020 White House race. Donald Trump repeatedly insulted the news media on Twitter this morning, at one point calling the New York Times \u201ca true enemy of the people\u201d. New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger responded: \u201cThe phrase \u2018enemy of the people\u2019 is not just false, it\u2019s dangerous. It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information.\u201d Sign up for our morning briefing for a global perspective on the US.

Hassan Shibly, the lawyer for the family of Hoda Muthana, shared a document on Twitter that appears to show the young woman was born in New Jersey in 1994. Shibly has told reporters that the administration\u2019s position is based on a \u201ccomplicated\u201d interpretation of the law involving her father, who was a diplomat. \u201cThey\u2019re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Shibly told The Associated Press. Muthana was born in the United States to parents from Yemen who became naturalized American citizens, according to the Counter Extremism Project at George Washington University. Guardian political correspondent Lauren Gambino with more on Bernie Sanders\u2019 big day. Bernie\u2019s having a big week. Yuuuge, you might say. After raising more than $6m in just over 24 hours, the Vermont senator on Wednesday jumped to the top of the fourth presidential straw poll by progressive website, Daily Kos. About 56,000 people responded to the latest poll, which happen every two weeks. This is significant because the women of the Senate, some of Sanders\u2019 fiercest competition for the nomination, were ahead in the first three straw polls, which in one survey found Sanders behind vice president Joe Biden, the closest the field may have to an establishment backed moderate. In the 24-hour poll, which coincided with Sanders\u2019 launch, his standing rose from 13% in two weeks ago to 44%, while Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren round out the top three with 15% and 10% respectively, according to the survey results. In as much as any poll can reveal at this point, it\u2019s another sign that Sanders has maintained significant grassroots support. The question is whether his loyal base is strong enough to withstand the competition for many of his supporters. House Democrats plan to file a resolution as soon as Friday that\u2019s aimed at blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of an emergency at the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press. That could set up a vote by the full House by mid-March. The clash is over a declaration that Trump is using to try spending billions of dollars beyond what Congress has authorized to start building border barriers. Passage by the Democratic-run House seems likely. The measure would then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval. Trump has promised a veto, which would be difficult for Congress to override. The plan was described by officials at three progressive groups who heard of them from congressional aides but were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Donald Trump said on Twitter that he ordered the State department to block Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who left the US to join Islamic State in 2014, from returning to the US. Muthana told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group and wants to return to the US with her 18-month-old son. Earlier today, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Muthana was \u201cnot a citizen,\u201d but the State department has not responded to inquiries from the Guardian about how that could be the case for the 24-year-old, who was born in New Jersey. Trump\u2019s tweet raises questions about the State department\u2019s declaration that Muthana is \u201cnot a citizen\u201d and whether that designation is in accordance with US and international law. The Trump adminstration\u2019s statements about Muthana also contrast their calls on other countries to bring back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals. A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) says that hate groups in the US have continued to surge in the Trump era, and that the president himself has helped to mainstream hate by \u201cfueling fears of a white minority country\u201d. Jason Wilson, writing for the Guardian, said the SPLC counted 1,020 hate groups in the United States in 2018, up 7% from the previous year: In a press conference, Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project blamed in part the \u201cwords and imagery coming out of the Trump administration\u201d which have been \u201cheightening the fears\u201d of demographic replacement. The report points to a range of murders and violent attacks \u2013 like a mail-bombing spree that targeted Democrats and media organisations and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue \u2013 as evidence that the conspiracy-fueled far right is increasingly willing to commit extreme acts. Another similar recent report from the Anti-Defamation League suggested that extremist murders in the United States in 2018 were carried out almost exclusively by the far right. But the SPLC also points to the increasingly strident expression of far right ideas in conservative media, and from Republican politicians, as evidence that hate is being mainstreamed. Lawyers for the family of Hoda Muthana \u2013 the American-born woman who told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria \u2013 have responded to secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s claim that the 24-year-old is not a US citizen. An attorney for the woman\u2019s family, Hassan Shibly, told the Associated Press that the administration\u2019s position is based on a \u201ccomplicated\u201d interpretation of the law involving her father. \u201cThey\u2019re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Shibly said. Muthana was born in 1994 in Hackensack, New Jersey, the lawyer said. Most people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship but there are exceptions. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to US law and is not automatically considered a US citizen at birth. The State department has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s inquiries about Muthana\u2019s immigration status. A former Trump campaign staffer has filed a class action lawsuit seeking to invalidate all nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements signed by staffers to the campaign, according to Buzzfeed\u2019s Zoe Tilllman: The claims brought by former campaign staffer Jessica Denson represent the broadest attack to date on the Trump campaign\u2019s practice of having staffers, volunteers, and contractors sign agreements barring them from ever publicly criticizing Trump, his company, or his family, and from disclosing private or confidential information. The Trump campaign has gone after several former staffers who publicly aired their grievances against Trump, his administration, or his campaign, including Omarosa Manigault Newman and Cliff Sims, who recently wrote a book about his time in the White House called Team Of Vipers. Denson was ordered to pay nearly $50,000 to the campaign after filing a workplace discrimination and harassment lawsuit in 2017. Donald Trump said the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation would be \u201ctotally up to the attorney general\u201d while taking questions from reporters at the White House this afternoon. Trump also insulted Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, who has been criticizing the president on his book tour. Trump described McCabe as a \u201cpoor man\u2019s J. Edgar Hoover,\u201d and said \u201cI\u2019m very proud to say that we caught him\u201d and fired him. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the Alabama woman who left the US to join Islamic State in Syria is not a US citizen and won\u2019t be allowed back in the US. Hoda Muthana, 24, first came forward in an interview with the Guardian this week. In a statement, Pompeo said Muthana \u201cis not a US citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid US passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States. We continue to strongly advise all US citizens not to travel to Syria.\u201d Muthana said she now deeply regrets the decision to go and wants to return to the US. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor, Martin Chulov, interviewed Muthana and described his time inside the sprawling camp of al-Hawl in the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast. The father of senator Kamala Harris has criticized his daughter for remarks she made about smoking marijuana in an interview with The Breakfast Club radio show. Kamala Harris\u2019s parents divorced when she was seven and she was raised by her mother. Harris said in an interview this week that she had smoked marijuana before and wants weed legalized. \u201cI did inhale,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt was a long time ago, but yes. I just broke news! You know, I joke about it \u2013 half joke \u2013 but half my family\u2019s from Jamaica! Are you kidding me?\u201d Donald Harris said his daughter used a \u201cfraudulent stereotype\u201d in a statement to jamaicaglobalonline.com: My dear departed grandmothers(whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents , must be turning in their grave right now to see their family\u2019s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty. More from Guardian political correspondent (and Arizona native), Lauren Gambino, who has a response for all those wondering: will Arizona be a battleground state in 2020? Democrats have their eyes on the Sun Belt after Arizona and Nevada knocked out two Republican senators in 2018, Texas held a closer-than-anyone-could-have-imagined Senate race, and Georgia and Florida came close to electing Democratic governors. Arizona often eludes the party in presidential years. The state boasts a fiercely conservative Republican party \u2013 which chased out Senator Jeff Flake, one of the president\u2019s chief critics, and just recently elected a Trump acolyte as it\u2019s chair. But it also sent the late John McCain to the Senate six times and in 2018, elected Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and will hold a competitive Senate race in 2020 to serve the remainder of McCain\u2019s term. All of this is to say that new polling from Arizona-based firm OH Predictive Insights indicates that the right Democratic presidential nominee might just have a shot there. The poll \u2013 and, reminder, it is very early in the process \u2013 shows that in a prospective match up between former vice-president Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the men are tied. Interesting, Biden captured voters under 54 years of age while Trump won voters over 55 years old. In a prospective match up against senator Bernie Sanders, who announced his candidacy on Tuesday, Trump leads by a 12-point margin. The only demographic where Sanders bests Trump is with young people aged 18-34. Senator Kamala Harris comes the closest after Biden, trailing Trump 40%-49%. But she ties him with women and beats him with young people. All of this in a state where Trump\u2019s job approval is above water. As early as next week, the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, according to CNN. CNN, citing anonymous sources, notes that the precise timing of the announcement could change, but after the announcement, Barr plans to submit to Congress a summary of Mueller\u2019s confidential report. This snowy morning in Washington DC has seen senator Bernie Sanders top the 2020 record fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign and Donald Trump declare, again, that the New York Times is \u201ca true enemy of the people\u201d. Trump will be in meetings with Austria\u2019s chancellor for the rest of the afternoon. We\u2019ll be back with updates on that and more around 1.45pm ET/10.45am PT. Until then, a summary of this morning\u2019s events: Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, raised $6m from 223,047 people in the first 24 hours of his campaign, with an average donation of $27 - the most money in the first 24 hours of any other Democratic contender for the 2020 White House race. Donald Trump repeatedly insulted the news media on Twitter this morning, at one point calling the New York Times \u201ca true enemy of the people\u201d. The White House is assembling a panel to weigh whether climate change is a national security threat, according to the Washington Post. Vladimir Putin said in a speech this morning that Russia will develop new weapons and aim them at western \u201ccentres of decision-making\u201d if the west deploys new short and medium-range missiles in Europe. Washington governor Jay Inslee, one politician who might bring climate change to the top of the 2020 presidential election agenda, tells the Guardian that Trump is \u201ca blip in history we need to get over, and quickly\u201d. Sign up for our morning briefing for a global perspective on the US. We\u2019ll email you a summary of the day\u2019s top stories and must-reads. Subscribe now. New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger released a statement in response to Trump\u2019s comment this morning that the newspaper was \u201ca true enemy of the people\u201d. Sulzberger\u2019s statement began by listing quotes from past presidents who praised the news industry, including Ronald Reagan, who said: \u201cThere is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong and independent press to our continued success.\u201d Sulzberger continued: All these presidents had complaints about their coverage and at times took advantage of the freedom every American has to criticize journalists. But in demonizing the free press as the enemy, simply for performing its role of asking difficult questions and bringing uncomfortable information to light, President Trump is retreating from a distinctly American principle. It\u2019s a principle that previous occupants of the Oval Office fiercely defended regardless of their politics, party affiliation, or complaints about how they were covered. The phrase \u201cenemy of the people\u201d is not just false, it\u2019s dangerous. It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information. And it is particularly reckless coming from someone whose office gives him broad powers to fight or imprison the nation\u2019s enemies. As I have repeatedly told President Trump face to face, there are mounting signs that this incendiary rhetoric is encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad. Through 33 presidential administrations, across 167 years, The New York Times has worked to serve the public by fulfilling the fundamental role of the free press. To help people, regardless of their backgrounds or politics, understand their country and the world. To report independently, fairly and accurately. To ask hard questions. To pursue the truth wherever it leads. That will not change. The US supreme court ruled this morning that there are limits on civil forfeiture laws that allow local governments to take and keep private property, including cash and houses, used to commit crimes. The use of civil forfeiture has increased in recent decades and is controversial across the political spectrum. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the court\u2019s opinion for a case that centered on an Indiana man, Tyson Timbs. When police arrested Timbs for selling about $400 worth of heroin, they seized his $40,000 Land Rover. The AP reported: Timbs pleaded guilty, but faced no prison time. The biggest loss was the Land Rover he bought with some of the life insurance money he received after his father died. Timbs still has to win one more round in court before he gets his vehicle back, but that seems to be a formality. A judge ruled that taking the car was disproportionate to the severity of the crime, which carries a maximum fine of $10,000. But Indiana\u2019s top court said the justices had never ruled that the eighth amendment\u2019s ban on excessive fines \u2013 like much of the rest of the Bill of Rights \u2013 applies to states as well as the federal government. The case drew interest from liberal groups concerned about police abuses and conservative organizations opposed to excessive regulation. Timbs was represented by the libertarian public interest law firm Institute for Justice. One of the six people to survive the 2018 shooting at Maryland\u2019s Capital Gazette newspaper, Rachael Pacella, said Trump\u2019s \u201cmedia-bashing\u201d make her fear for her life and the lives of other reporters. Pacella responded to Trump\u2019s tweeted complaint that \u201cthe press has never been more dishonest than it is today\u201d with a string of tweets about her fears and the considerations she makes to protect herself. Five of Pacella\u2019s coworkers were fatally shot by a suspect who had a well-documented history of harassing the paper\u2019s journalists. A judge said a lawsuit aiming to stop Barack Obama\u2019s presidential center from being opened in a Chicago park could go forward after the city tried to dismiss the lawsuit. The advocacy group Protect Our Parks alleged Chicago illegally transferred land to a private entity, the Obama Foundation. The AP reports: Judge John Robert Blakey did toss parts of the suit in his Tuesday ruling, but concluded the group has standing to sue because it represent taxpayers with concerns that providing parkland in the public trust to the Obama center violates their due-process rights. The ruling doesn\u2019t mean the group will necessarily prevail in the end, but confirms that the suit poses a formidable threat to the project. The judge indicated that he doesn\u2019t want the litigation to drag out, and that he would strictly limit any fact gathering leading up to trial to 45 days. A proposed Presidential Committee on Climate Security panel is being assembled to weigh whether climate change is a national security threat, according to the Washington Post. The panel is being spearheaded by William Happer, a professor who, according to the Post, \u201chas said that carbon emissions linked to climate change should be viewed as an asset rather than a pollutant\u201d. According to the NSC [National Security Council] discussion paper, the order would create a federal advisory committee \u201cto advise the president on scientific understanding of today\u2019s climate, how the climate might change in the future under natural and human influences, and how a changing climate could affect the security of the United States.\u201d The document notes that the government has issued several major reports under Trump identifying climate change as a serious threat. \u201cHowever, these scientific and national security judgments have not undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial scientific peer review to examine the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, as well as implications for national security,\u201d it said. Calls for the resignation of Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who admitted to using blackface in a dance contest, have quelled, according to two new polls released today. Politico reports: In a Quinnipiac University poll, 42% of voters say Northam should resign \u2013 but more, 48%, say he shouldn\u2019t. White voters are split evenly \u2013 46% say he should resign, and the same percentage say he shouldn\u2019t \u2014 but a majority of black voters, 56%, say Northam should not quit. Even fewer Virginians say Northam should resign in a second poll out Wednesday, conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs for the University of Virginia Center for Politics. In that poll, which surveyed adults in the commonwealth, only 31% say Northam should resign, compared to 43% who say he shouldn\u2019t. Some spot analysis from Guardian political correspondent, Lauren Gambino, who was on the trail with Bernie Sanders during the 2016 campaign. Senator Bernie Sanders raised an eye-popping $5.9m from 223,047 people in the first 24 hours of his campaign, with an average donation of ... $27. In an email announcing the haul, his campaign said the record-setting donations were a sign of \u201cunprecedented support for his vision\u201d. It also noted his launch video was viewed more than 8.335m times across social media platforms, including 5.3m views on Twitter. The fundraising figures were watched closely as an early test of whether Sanders could still harness the support and energy that propelled his unlikely rise in 2016 and brought him within striking distance of the nomination. At least for now, the campaign believes the answer is a resounding yes \u2013 yes he can. \u201cIn the first 24 hours since his announcement, Sanders demonstrated a level of grassroots support of unprecedented size and excitement, signalling the strength of the movement set on winning the Democratic nomination, defeating Donald Trump and creating a government that works for all Americans,\u201d his campaign said in an email. As a point of comparison, Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign raised $1.5m in its first 24 hours, a massive haul for a first-time senator who voters are still getting to know. The numbers, which tied Sanders\u2019 first-day donations in the 2016 race, were viewed as am early sign of her strength. The Vermont senator\u2019s fundraising prowess is likely to be one of his greatest advantages in a fractured, competitive field that is expected to rely heavily on small-dollar donations. Reporters at the New York Times and the Washington Post have highlighted how the president\u2019s past actions and statements about their newspapers contradict his complaints this morning. Katie Rogers, White House correspondent for the New York Times, noted an interview the newspaper\u2019s publisher, AG Sulzberger, had with Trump several weeks ago: The Washington Post\u2019s Danielle Paquette said the White House cites Washington Post reporting and figures in its own press releases: The independent senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, has raised the most money in the first 24 hours of his campaign than any of the other Democratic contenders with $6m in the bank. That haul was more than double the $1.5m that California senator Kamala Harris raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign. She had been the biggest first-day fundraiser in the race so far. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said the Democrat raised more than $1m in the 48 hours after launching her presidential bid this month. A high school student from Covington, Kentucky, has sued the Washington Post for defamation, claiming the newspaper falsely accused him of racist acts and instigating a confrontation with a Native American activist in a January videotaped incident at the Lincoln Memorial. The Washington Post\u2019s vice-president for communications, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said: \u201cWe are reviewing a copy of the lawsuit and we plan to mount a vigorous defense.\u201d The Kentucky student, who was wearing a Make America Great Again hat during the incident, has the support of the president: Vladimir Putin has suggested Russia could be forced to aim weapons at Washington if the west deploys new short and medium-range missiles in Europe. In a speech to senior Russian officials in Moscow, Putin said the possible deployment of missiles that could reach Moscow in 10 minutes was \u201cdangerous for Russia,\u201d and that Moscow would be forced to review \u201csymmetrical and asymmetrical actions\u201d. This morning on Twitter, the president complained about California, called Bernie Sanders \u201ccrazy\u201d and, of course, and denounced the news media. Trump didn\u2019t specify what reporting was false. The New York Times site for the past 24 hours has been leading on an investigation into Trump\u2019s response to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The piece, \u201cIntimidation, Pressure and Humiliation: Inside Trump\u2019s Two-Year War on the Investigations Encircling Him\u201d, and is accompanied by analysis of Trump\u2019s more than 1,000 public attacks on the investigation. The Guardian\u2019s US environment reporter, Oliver Milman, spoke with one politician who might bring climate change to the top of the 2020 presidential election agenda, Washington governor Jay Inslee. The US stands virtually alone in the world in having a leader, Donald Trump, who openly dismisses the reality of climate change. Inslee said: He\u2019s embarrassing. Even Republicans are embarrassed about him. To fail to mention the greatest existential threat in the world is pathetic. He\u2019s a blip in history we need to get over, and quickly. Good morning, The president\u2019s war with the most populous state in the union, California, rattled on last night when the Department of Transportation announced plans to cancel $929m in federal grant funds for California\u2019s high-speed rail project. The state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said the move was \u201cpolitical retribution\u201d for California\u2019s lawsuit against Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall on the US-Mexico border. Expect fallout from the revoked funds and declared emergency to trickle on today. Meanwhile, one of the many hoping to unseat the president in the 2020 election, Bernie Sanders, saw a surge in enthusiasm for his campaign after entering the race for the White House on Tuesday. In the 12 hours after Sanders\u2019 campaign launched, the independent senator from Vermont had raised $4m from 150,000 donors in all 50 states, according to his campaign. Today, Trump is scheduled to have a private lunch with secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and then will spend the rest of his afternoon in meetings with Austria\u2019s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. The chancellor presides over the only western European country with a far-right presence in government \u2013 but we\u2019ll get more into that a bit later. Stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "A primary school teacher who has been the target of protests by parents concerned about teachings on LGBT rights and equalities has been chosen as a finalist in a prestigious $1m global education award. Andrew Moffat, who is assistant head at Parkfield Community school in Alum Rock, Birmingham, is one of 10 teachers from around the world who have made it to the shortlist for the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize 2019. He was selected from more than 10,000 nominations from 179 countries in recognition of his work promoting inclusivity and tolerance among schoolchildren, in particular an equality education programme he devised called No Outsiders. In recent weeks, however, Moffat\u2019s school, which serves a predominantly Muslim community, has become the focus of demonstrations by parents worried that children are being taught about same-sex couples and gender identity when they are too young. One mother, whose daughter attends the school, told the BBC: \u201cSorry, at this age it\u2019s totally wrong. Children at this age don\u2019t even know if they are coming or going, let alone knowing what sexual orientation they will become.\u201d The school claims Moffat has been the target of a number of threats, which have been reported to the police. It has received 80 formal complaints from parents objecting to Moffat\u2019s No Outsiders programme and raising concerns about sex education, which is being updated and revised by the government ready for teaching in September 2020. Parkfield, which was rated outstanding by the schools watchdog Ofsted in 2016, was visited by inspectors last week. They are yet to report back. The 2016 Ofsted report praised the No Outsiders programme, which has been adopted by other schools around the country. Moffat, who is gay and left his previous job because of a backlash over his sexuality, said he was delighted to have made it to the shortlist for the prize, which he hoped would give his work on equality and tolerance a global platform. Asked about the protests, he said: \u201cI\u2019m quite pragmatic. We\u2019ve got to find a way to engage parents on some issues that many find challenging. Yes, at the moment we are having challenges in my own school. But it\u2019s about not running away from those challenges. What alternative is there?\u201d Moffat, who was awarded an MBE in 2017 for services to equality and diversity in education, said there had been a misapprehension that his No Outsiders work was about sex education when it was about promoting social cohesion by teaching equality and helping children to become tolerant of difference. \u201cMany parents have come to me to say this work is important and they support it,\u201d he said.

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said latest figures show the number of asylum-seeking children in care in England has gone up from 2,760 in 2014-15 to 4,480 in 2017-18. As a result council spending has risen from \u00a377m to \u00a3152m over the same period, putting additional pressure on children\u2019s services which, according to the LGA, face a \u00a33.1bn funding gap by 2025 in order to maintain the current level of services.

      "bodyText": "The UK government is undermining national security by delaying the introduction of publicly available share ownership registers in Britain\u2019s major tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, the foreign affairs select committee has said. During a general inquiry into the relationship between the UK and its overseas territories, the MPs on the committee discovered that the Foreign Office planned to delay the introduction of publicly available beneficial share ownership registers until 2023, three years after the deadline MPs believed they had set. Public registers are seen as critical by campaigners for cracking down on money laundering, corruption and tax evasion, including by leaders of authoritarian governments. The Commons believed it had set a clear deadline of the end of 2020 after a cross-party backbench rebellion during last year\u2019s passage of the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill. But the government \u2013 without consulting parliament \u2013 interpreted the amendment to the bill as merely requiring ministers to state by the 2020 deadline when they would introduce the registers, and then unilaterally set the date for their introduction as the end of 2023, after the next election. The overseas territories, anxious to protect the income associated with secret tax havens, had warned of a major constitutional rupture with London if the 2020 date were imposed. In its report the foreign affairs select committee states: \u201cWe profoundly regret that public registers may not be published before 2023. It is simply not acceptable that this will be long after the deadline set out in the act.\u201d They point out that the government \u201chas judged public registers of beneficial ownership to be a matter of national security\u201d. \u201cThose who seek to undermine our security and that of our allies must not be able to use the OTs to launder their funds. We cannot wait until public registers are a global norm and we cannot let considerations of competitiveness prevent us from taking action now. The lowest common denominator is not enough,\u201d the report says. It is understood that the Labour frontbench is considering tabling amendments to the finance bill to make it clear that the originally intended 2020 deadline is being restored. The report also calls on ministers to set a date by which the overseas territories are required to legalise same-sex marriage or risk facing the law being imposed by Westminster. The FCO rejected any suggestion that it has defied the will of parliament by setting a date after the next general election for the introduction of public registers. It said in a statement: \u201cAs set out clearly in the act, we will prepare draft legislation by the end of 2020, with all overseas territories (OTs) expected to have fully functioning public registers in place by the end of 2023.
