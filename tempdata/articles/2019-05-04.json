      "body": "<p>When the Newcastle upon Tyne result came in, Linda McAvan knew it was all over. It was 23 June 2016 and, after a day knocking on doors, the Labour MEP and remain campaigner was at her local count in Sheffield. Things started to go wrong before midnight. Newcastle was meant to be a comfortable victory, but remain only scraped home. Then Sunderland voted to leave. Across McAvan\u2019s Yorkshire and Humber constituency, counts were called: Craven, Scarborough, Sheffield; leave, leave, leave. In the small hours, David Dimbleby called it: \u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d At a stroke, 73 British members of the European parliament were handed their redundancy papers.</p> <p>These MEPs, who make up nearly 10% of the 751 members of the European parliament, did not lose their seats immediately: this was just the start of the UK\u2019s odyssey to leave the European Union. While the past three years have seen Westminster convulsed by cabinet resignations, missed deadlines and political deadlock, British MEPs have carried on their business more or less as usual. Now, they face the once-unimaginable prospect of a fresh European election \u2013 an event that some hope will be a proxy referendum, while Nigel Farage seeks to repeat his 2014 landslide with a new Brexit party.</p> <p>They have been strange days for MEPs on both sides of the debate. For those who voted remain, it has been unsettling \u2013 an endless limbo. For those who campaigned to leave, the 2016 vote was the fulfilment of a life\u2019s work \u2013 but one that soured as the grinding reality of negotiations kicked in. How has it felt to be there, in Brussels, or in the European parliament\u2019s official seat in Strasbourg, as the endgame plays out? Over the past four months, I\u2019ve been talking to four MEPs to find out.</p> <p>When I first meet McAvan in mid-January, Theresa May\u2019s deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-suffers-historic-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-her\" title=\"\">has just suffered its first, epic defeat</a>; but most people still think the UK will leave the EU as planned on 29 March. McAvan is presiding over one of her last meetings, as chair of the international development committee. Around 100 people sit at blond-wood desks arranged in a semicircle (a symbol of the European parliament\u2019s constant quest for consensus). The seating is hierarchical: MEPs take the front desk; behind them sit civil servants from the European commission; MEPs\u2019 assistants take the back rows. The interpreters sit in black-tinted glass booths on an upper tier; today\u2019s meeting is relayed in 12 languages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f69b598007e15417fa4fd78532514a1e2507583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f69b598007e15417fa4fd78532514a1e2507583/789_929_4779_2868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MEP Linda McAvan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018MPs and journalists don\u2019t really understand how the EU works\u2019: Labour MEP Linda McAvan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mashid Mohadjerin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McAvan\u2019s agenda is wide, covering the annual aid budget, a law to create an overseas volunteer service, a regulation on the labelling of \u201caromatised wine products\u201d. McAvan, who has neat blond hair and lilac-framed glasses, works through the votes briskly. \u201cIn favour? Against? Abstentions? Carried.\u201d This is the unglamorous slog that doesn\u2019t hit the headlines.</p> <p>European parliament votes look like auctions on fast-forward. Like much EU business, it can be hard to follow. MEPs vote by a show of hands; if this is close, they insert a card into a voting box and press a button, the results flashing up on TV screens. With its bland, anonymous-looking meeting rooms, Brussels feels a world away from the crumbling gothic palace of Westminster \u2013 which, for many Commons-based politicians, it is. \u201cMPs and journalists are top among those who don\u2019t really understand how the EU works,\u201d McAvan tells me a few hours later. She says she has got used to Westminster colleagues dismissing MEPs as having no influence. \u201cBut we are legislating! Of course we have to negotiate with ministers \u2013 but when we do a final deal, it\u2019s a law.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People haven\u2019t quite clicked this is going to happen. I\u2019ve been invited to things in May, even June</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the clunky language of the EU, the European parliament is a co-legislator with 28 member state governments. The parliament negotiates with ministers to agree laws, giving the average MEP more clout than the average backbencher. But much of that law-making rarely gets attention, unless something goes wrong. These laws are a big part of the inner wiring of society: rules to speed up the extradition of criminal suspects, to promote the welfare of chickens, to set passenger compensation for cancelled flights, or protect depositors from collapsing banks.</p> <p>The reality is often more mundane than the tabloid myth of \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d intent on banning mushy peas, prawn cocktail crisps or barmaids\u2019 cleavage \u2013 a genre of fantasy that obscures the fact that the UK was one of the most influential countries in the union. \u201cWe still have this Dad\u2019s Army image of Europe,\u201d McAvan says. \u201cBut most of the time we <em>wanted</em> the laws \u2013 we agreed with them.\u201d</p> <p>She says she has been invited to do UK radio phone-ins on nonexistent EU plans, such as banning miles. \u201cAnd I will say, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 And [the producer] will say, \u2018Lots of people will phone in because they will be angry.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>McAvan was elected in a 1998 byelection. It was a hopeful time. A dynamic young prime minister had swept to power on a landslide, and he wanted Britain at the \u201ccentre of Europe\u201d. He even spoke French.</p> <p>By the time Tony Blair arrived on the scene, McAvan had been in Brussels for more than a decade. After graduating in French and Spanish, she worked for a Yorkshire campaign to bring European funds to depressed mining towns. It chalked up a victory when Brussels forced Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major to match European funds for Yorkshire and the Humber. Later came European-funded roads, business parks, digital startups, \u00a31m for Doncaster racecourse.</p> <p>But along the way, people stopped noticing, McAvan suggests. Meanwhile Europe became lax on protecting workers\u2019 pay, she thinks. The \u201csocial Europe\u201d promise of policies to protect workers\u2019 rights gave way to the market mantras of the late 90s and 2000s. \u201cJobs [were] moving away and we didn\u2019t pay enough attention.\u201d Immigration became a more divisive issue, and Blair\u2019s promise to fulfil \u201cour European destiny\u201d never played out. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to be always going to Europe to tell them how to do it,\u201d McAvan recalls.</p> <p>She regrets that British politicians, of all parties, became afraid to make the case for Europe. \u201cWe were apologising, when actually we should have been saying this: \u2018Be proud of our membership of the European Union.\u2019\u201d While McAvan thinks some of \u201cthe mega pro-Europeans\u201d go too far in wanting the EU to be loved, \u201cWe should just ask [for it] to be recognised as another level of decision-making.\u201d</p> <p>But now it looks too late. When we meet again in March, McAvan has started clearing her office. MEP assistants have been issued redundancy letters. There are rumours of a ceremony to take down the British flag. Still, there is a sense of disbelief that the UK is going \u2013 underlined by the endless delays back in London. \u201cEven people active in politics haven\u2019t quite clicked this is going to happen,\u201d McAvan says. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to things in May, even June.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>A decade after Labour attempted a new course on Europe, the Tories tried to break with the past. Another young leader wanted to shake up his party, with talk of sunshine and public services. In 2006, David Cameron told the Conservative party conference that it was time to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Daniel Dalton started working in the European parliament shortly before Cameron became leader. He was in tune with the party\u2019s new mood. A retired professional cricketer now in his mid-40s, Dalton had studied politics and coached former gang members in the sport in his spare time. He \u201csort of fell into\u201d Europe; an internship for one Tory MEP led to a job with another. Arriving in Brussels, he read Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged, her dystopian novel about government regulation often feted by libertarians. It cemented his views: \u201cI naturally mistrust the role of government to make the change they want to make.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64bd4f232d64b7285c8e4b1aee4f49ce6eae3422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64bd4f232d64b7285c8e4b1aee4f49ce6eae3422/197_498_5657_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton, a remainer turned leaver, with a German wife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mashid Mohadjerin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dalton\u2019s early years coincided with a decisive shift for the Conservatives. In order to secure victory in the leadership race, Cameron promised to remove Tory MEPs from the European People\u2019s party (EPP) \u2013 the main centre-right bloc, the political family of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. What seemed like an obscure point of party administration had fateful consequences. The most immediate was that the Conservatives had to create their own MEP group, or risk seeing their influence and access to European funds wither away \u2013 and so the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group was born. The Tories joined forces with Polish nationalists and a ragbag of fringe parties, a few with dubious far-right pasts. Some Tory grandees complained Cameron was making a terrible mistake in appeasing the Eurosceptic right.</p> <p>This argument resurfaced last year, after Conservative MEPs voted against launching a procedure that could lead to EU sanctions on Hungary, whose authoritarian government is unpicking democratic checks and balances. As home affairs spokesman, Dalton was on the frontline of that debate. Should the party have taken a stand against Viktor Orb\u00e1n? His response has a Eurosceptic tint: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote <em>with</em> Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Let\u2019s make that clear. We voted <em>against</em> EU powers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The endless to-ing and fro-ing between Brussels and Strasbourg has long been criticised by British politicians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dalton\u2019s office in Strasbourg houses little more than a computer, a few papers and a plate of half-eaten fruit. There are few personal touches in any office here, as MEPs spend no more than four days a month in Strasbourg \u2013 a labyrinth of buildings and bridges spanning the Marne-Rhine canal and the Ill river. There are escalators that take you one floor higher than you needed, stairs you cannot find, circular corridors with identical doors. As an old joke goes, the building is a giant metaphor for the EU: \u201cYou can see where you want to go, but not how to get there.\u201d </p> <p>The endless to-ing and fro-ing between Brussels and Strasbourg has long been criticised by British politicians as a waste of time and money. Most MEPs want to scrap the Strasbourg seat, but every attempt to do so meets the French president\u2019s veto. Dalton admits he will be glad to see the back of it, but leaving the EU is bittersweet for this party loyalist \u2013 a remainer who converted to leave. Personally, he was saddened by the result and regrets that British citizens will lose their right to live and work in Europe \u2013 something that has benefited him, his German wife and their young family. His support for freedom of movement makes him \u201cunusual for a Conservative\u201d, he admits. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had a full term yet, and I would like to have had longer. But I don\u2019t believe you can take part in a referendum and then say, if the result isn\u2019t the one we like, I don\u2019t respect the result.\u201d In Dalton\u2019s West Midlands constituency, the vote was decisive: 29 of 30 councils voted to go.</p> <p>Remain lost the economic argument, he believes. \u201cMost people turned around and said, \u2018Either we don\u2019t believe you, or it will be worth it to get out of an ever-closer union.\u2019 People are prepared to take an economic hit from leaving the EU.\u201d He adds that he thinks the cost of Brexit has been exaggerated.</p> <p>It is wrong, even dangerous, Dalton says, to suggest that people were misled by slogans on a bus. It may just be that the UK, with all its polarities, was always \u201cpolitically incompatible with Europe\u201d. In Westminster, it is government versus opposition, blue versus red, seated two sword-lengths apart. In Brussels, \u201cIt is much more about compromise. And I think compromise is a little bit outside [British] political culture.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I meet Jill Evans, Plaid Cymru\u2019s only MEP, who is campaigning for a second referendum, it is late January. The night before, the prime minister told MPs that she intended to renegotiate the Irish backstop \u2013 a demand Brussels rejects almost immediately. Meanwhile Evans has just made the seven-hour commute from her constituency in the Rhondda Valley to her Brussels hotel. We meet in her office, down a corridor shared with other separatist parties and the Greens. The space has the feel of student halls \u2013 event posters stuck on the walls alongside the Welsh flag, the Scottish Saltire and the Catalan standard, and a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on one MEP\u2019s door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb48fdbb9840103192163b3f9d6123e131e4147c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb48fdbb9840103192163b3f9d6123e131e4147c/94_11_6275_3765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cases of documents outside MEPs\u2019 offices in Brussels, ready for the endless to-ing and fro-ing between parliament buildings there and in Strasbourg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cases of documents outside MEPs\u2019 offices in Brussels, ready for the endless to-ing and fro-ing between parliament buildings there and in Strasbourg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mashid Mohadjerin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brexit Day, 29 March, is less than two months away, and Evans says the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of uncertainty makes it hard to focus on preparing to leave. \u201cI never dreamed I would be the last Plaid Cymru MEP, and that is something that causes me great despair.\u201d In her two decades as an MEP, she has fought a lonely and fruitless battle for Welsh be added to the EU\u2019s (currently) 24 official languages. One of the original Greenham Common protesters, she planned on retiring from parliament this year, at the age of 59.</p> <p>During the referendum campaign, Evans crunched the numbers to show that Wales got more money back from the EU than it paid in through taxes \u2013 a net annual gain of between \u00a323m and \u00a3117m. But Wales still voted to leave.</p> <p>It was hard to tell people hit by government cuts they were doing well from the EU, Evans says. \u201cI think about what would have happened in those austerity years without European funding. But people didn\u2019t feel the benefits in their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I meet Ukip MEP Mike Hookem in his Strasbourg office, Sky News\u2019s rolling \u201cBrexit crisis\u201d coverage is on full blast.

By autumn 2018, a trickle of departures became a flood. One after another, MEPs quit in protest at the leadership of Gerard Batten \u2013 including Farage, who left the party \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d after Batten appointed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (known as Tommy Robinson) as an adviser.</p> <p>Hookem is furious that his former colleagues left without resigning their seats. Most have now joined the Brexit party. He says he wrote to Farage, asking him to stand down. There was no reply. \u201cI\u2019ve supported Nigel! I\u2019ve campaigned for him! But what do they say, never meet your heroes.\u201d He clarifies: \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t my hero \u2013 it\u2019s just a figure of speech.\u201d</p> <p>He defends Batten against the charge of taking Ukip in an extremist, Islamophobic direction. \u201cGerard has got this thing about the Qur\u2019an,\u201d he admits, without spelling out what that thing might be. \u201cYes, he is the leader \u2013 but he is not taking the party down there.\u201d Nor does he share Batten\u2019s approval of Yaxley-Lennon. \u201cIf he becomes a member of the party I will leave, because that is not the party I joined.\u201d If people are confused as to why the Ukip leader employs a far-right activist, he says, that\u2019s because \u201cthey are reading the mainstream media\u201d, deploying the Trumpian get-out-of-jail-free card. </p> <p>A few weeks later, the Guardian publishes an investigation revealing an influx of the far right into Ukip; when I bump into Hookem he says he is upset. \u201cI am a working-class lad from Hull. I am not racist, I am not far right. All I want is Great Britain out of the EU \u2013 to do trade deals around the world and be the confident nation it once was.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t want to be photographed for this article, but later changes his mind.

He used to vote Labour, but hasn\u2019t since 1997. He joined Ukip in 2008 and worked his way up: regional organiser, then MEP in Ukip\u2019s 2014 landslide. By that time, Ukip was becoming a more organised presence in Brussels. In the early days, the plan was simply to turn up and vote no. But then the party began hiring researchers, even taking positions on the nitty-gritty \u2013 drafting counter-proposals and voting in committee meetings, although continuing to shun the business of EU law-making. Sitting alongside their mini union jacks in the debating chamber, Ukip got noticed. Farage was invited on to Question Time, while other British MEPs despaired of a prime-time slot. The Ukip leader was already expert at getting noticed: one 2010 YouTube clip of Farage calling the then European council president \u201ca low-grade bank clerk\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/25/nigel-farage-herman-van-rompuy-damp-rag\" title=\"\">has been viewed 1.5m times</a>. </p> <p>The EU launched Ukip into British politics. \u201cWe needed that platform, that is absolutely right,\u201d Hookem agrees. The day before one of our meetings, he delivered a speech designed for YouTube. Officially, he was taking part in a debate on the \u201cmultiannual plans for stocks fished in western waters and adjacent waters\u201d, in other words, ensuring cod, herring and lobster are not fished out of existence. There were eight heartfelt speeches and the room was thick with jargon: regionalisation, multiannual management, landing obligations.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VbVBCeLQuo\" title=\"\">When Hookem got to his feet</a>, the debate tilted into a parallel universe. Riffing on Donald Tusk\u2019s \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d comments on Brexiters, he denounced the fisheries policy, made a reference to the second world war, threw in a Winston Churchill quote, cited Greece\u2019s anti-austerity protesters, Catalan separatists, Polish and Hungarian nationalists and French gilets jaunes \u2013 anyone who might be deemed anti-EU. One person clapped loudly as he sat down, then the debate flipped back into fish quotas.</p> <p>But while Ukip has learned from Farage\u2019s methods, it is harder to repeat his success. After two months on Hookem\u2019s YouTube channel, his clip has had 34 views.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s springtime in Strasbourg and the covered bridge that connects two wings of parliament is a heat trap. Two weeks have passed since Brexit day, and Britain\u2019s departure has been delayed, twice. The union jack still flies. British officials are still meeting EU contacts in the cafes. British MEPs were supposed to have gone now, but they haven\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018You\u2019re still here!\u2019 when we walk out of the lift, so it has a comic side to it,\u201d Evans says. The previous Strasbourg session was more emotional for her: farewell drinks, speeches, some tears. Far from being marginalised, Evans says she has benefited from \u201cthe overwhelming support\u201d of other members. \u201cIt\u2019s meant the world, really. MEPs aren\u2019t the most popular politicians, even among politicians, and to have that kind of solidarity has been something really special.\u201d By now, Evans thought she\u2019d be tending her garden, but instead she is preparing a campaign \u2013 for the European elections on 23 May. \u201cEvery week that goes by and we are still here strengthens the feeling: we remain in the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton is a more reluctant MEP candidate and still hopes for an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare at the moment. However, we are politicians and politicians live with a Damocles sword over their heads. I don\u2019t particularly think anyone should feel sorry for us.\u201d The latest polls have shown the Conservatives crashing to an all-time low. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020a50a849182711fa3b33405e005206e450ec64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020a50a849182711fa3b33405e005206e450ec64/76_443_6497_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MEPs\u2019 pigeonholes in Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MEPs\u2019 pigeonholes in Brussels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mashid Mohadjerin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The polls also look bad for Ukip. Farage\u2019s new Brexit party could be a clean slate, as yet untainted by the far right and candidates that teach their dogs Hitler salutes. When I speak to Hookem, hours after a YouGov poll puts the Brexit party in first place, he acknowledges the competition. \u201cIt causes us a little bit of concern,\u201d he says, before making the bold claim that \u201cFarage has been played by the establishment\u201d as a means of splitting the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McAvan has decided not to stand again. As she leaves Strasbourg, she is writing thank you cards, in EU blue and gold. She thought she would be the last ever female MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber. Now she expects to see a successor and is buoyed by the campaign.</p> <p>The voting bell is ringing out. McAvan gathers her papers and walks down to the chamber. Bumping into a colleague in the lifts, she mentions this article, originally billed as a portrait of Britain\u2019s last MEPs. Now there is a question mark at the end of that phrase.</p> <p>The conversation continues as we walk into the busy corridors. \u201cThe Brexit story is not over yet,\u201d she says. And she heads to the chamber to place her votes.</p> <p><em>Jennifer Rankin is the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent.</em></p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Newcastle upon Tyne result came in, Linda McAvan knew it was all over. It was 23 June 2016 and, after a day knocking on doors, the Labour MEP and remain campaigner was at her local count in Sheffield. Things started to go wrong before midnight. Newcastle was meant to be a comfortable victory, but remain only scraped home. Then Sunderland voted to leave. Across McAvan\u2019s Yorkshire and Humber constituency, counts were called: Craven, Scarborough, Sheffield; leave, leave, leave. In the small hours, David Dimbleby called it: \u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d At a stroke, 73 British members of the European parliament were handed their redundancy papers. These MEPs, who make up nearly 10% of the 751 members of the European parliament, did not lose their seats immediately: this was just the start of the UK\u2019s odyssey to leave the European Union. While the past three years have seen Westminster convulsed by cabinet resignations, missed deadlines and political deadlock, British MEPs have carried on their business more or less as usual. Now, they face the once-unimaginable prospect of a fresh European election \u2013 an event that some hope will be a proxy referendum, while Nigel Farage seeks to repeat his 2014 landslide with a new Brexit party. They have been strange days for MEPs on both sides of the debate. For those who voted remain, it has been unsettling \u2013 an endless limbo. For those who campaigned to leave, the 2016 vote was the fulfilment of a life\u2019s work \u2013 but one that soured as the grinding reality of negotiations kicked in. How has it felt to be there, in Brussels, or in the European parliament\u2019s official seat in Strasbourg, as the endgame plays out? Over the past four months, I\u2019ve been talking to four MEPs to find out. When I first meet McAvan in mid-January, Theresa May\u2019s deal has just suffered its first, epic defeat; but most people still think the UK will leave the EU as planned on 29 March. McAvan is presiding over one of her last meetings, as chair of the international development committee. Around 100 people sit at blond-wood desks arranged in a semicircle (a symbol of the European parliament\u2019s constant quest for consensus). The seating is hierarchical: MEPs take the front desk; behind them sit civil servants from the European commission; MEPs\u2019 assistants take the back rows. The interpreters sit in black-tinted glass booths on an upper tier; today\u2019s meeting is relayed in 12 languages. McAvan\u2019s agenda is wide, covering the annual aid budget, a law to create an overseas volunteer service, a regulation on the labelling of \u201caromatised wine products\u201d. McAvan, who has neat blond hair and lilac-framed glasses, works through the votes briskly. \u201cIn favour? Against? Abstentions? Carried.\u201d This is the unglamorous slog that doesn\u2019t hit the headlines. European parliament votes look like auctions on fast-forward. Like much EU business, it can be hard to follow. MEPs vote by a show of hands; if this is close, they insert a card into a voting box and press a button, the results flashing up on TV screens. With its bland, anonymous-looking meeting rooms, Brussels feels a world away from the crumbling gothic palace of Westminster \u2013 which, for many Commons-based politicians, it is. \u201cMPs and journalists are top among those who don\u2019t really understand how the EU works,\u201d McAvan tells me a few hours later. She says she has got used to Westminster colleagues dismissing MEPs as having no influence. \u201cBut we are legislating! Of course we have to negotiate with ministers \u2013 but when we do a final deal, it\u2019s a law.\u201d In the clunky language of the EU, the European parliament is a co-legislator with 28 member state governments. The parliament negotiates with ministers to agree laws, giving the average MEP more clout than the average backbencher. But much of that law-making rarely gets attention, unless something goes wrong. These laws are a big part of the inner wiring of society: rules to speed up the extradition of criminal suspects, to promote the welfare of chickens, to set passenger compensation for cancelled flights, or protect depositors from collapsing banks. The reality is often more mundane than the tabloid myth of \u201cBrussels bureaucrats\u201d intent on banning mushy peas, prawn cocktail crisps or barmaids\u2019 cleavage \u2013 a genre of fantasy that obscures the fact that the UK was one of the most influential countries in the union. \u201cWe still have this Dad\u2019s Army image of Europe,\u201d McAvan says. \u201cBut most of the time we wanted the laws \u2013 we agreed with them.\u201d She says she has been invited to do UK radio phone-ins on nonexistent EU plans, such as banning miles. \u201cAnd I will say, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 And [the producer] will say, \u2018Lots of people will phone in because they will be angry.\u2019\u201d McAvan was elected in a 1998 byelection. It was a hopeful time. A dynamic young prime minister had swept to power on a landslide, and he wanted Britain at the \u201ccentre of Europe\u201d. He even spoke French. By the time Tony Blair arrived on the scene, McAvan had been in Brussels for more than a decade. After graduating in French and Spanish, she worked for a Yorkshire campaign to bring European funds to depressed mining towns. It chalked up a victory when Brussels forced Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major to match European funds for Yorkshire and the Humber. Later came European-funded roads, business parks, digital startups, \u00a31m for Doncaster racecourse. But along the way, people stopped noticing, McAvan suggests. Meanwhile Europe became lax on protecting workers\u2019 pay, she thinks. The \u201csocial Europe\u201d promise of policies to protect workers\u2019 rights gave way to the market mantras of the late 90s and 2000s. \u201cJobs [were] moving away and we didn\u2019t pay enough attention.\u201d Immigration became a more divisive issue, and Blair\u2019s promise to fulfil \u201cour European destiny\u201d never played out. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to be always going to Europe to tell them how to do it,\u201d McAvan recalls. She regrets that British politicians, of all parties, became afraid to make the case for Europe. \u201cWe were apologising, when actually we should have been saying this: \u2018Be proud of our membership of the European Union.\u2019\u201d While McAvan thinks some of \u201cthe mega pro-Europeans\u201d go too far in wanting the EU to be loved, \u201cWe should just ask [for it] to be recognised as another level of decision-making.\u201d But now it looks too late. When we meet again in March, McAvan has started clearing her office. MEP assistants have been issued redundancy letters. There are rumours of a ceremony to take down the British flag. Still, there is a sense of disbelief that the UK is going \u2013 underlined by the endless delays back in London. \u201cEven people active in politics haven\u2019t quite clicked this is going to happen,\u201d McAvan says. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to things in May, even June.\u201d *** A decade after Labour attempted a new course on Europe, the Tories tried to break with the past. Another young leader wanted to shake up his party, with talk of sunshine and public services. In 2006, David Cameron told the Conservative party conference that it was time to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d. Daniel Dalton started working in the European parliament shortly before Cameron became leader. He was in tune with the party\u2019s new mood. A retired professional cricketer now in his mid-40s, Dalton had studied politics and coached former gang members in the sport in his spare time. He \u201csort of fell into\u201d Europe; an internship for one Tory MEP led to a job with another. Arriving in Brussels, he read Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged, her dystopian novel about government regulation often feted by libertarians. It cemented his views: \u201cI naturally mistrust the role of government to make the change they want to make.\u201d Dalton\u2019s early years coincided with a decisive shift for the Conservatives. In order to secure victory in the leadership race, Cameron promised to remove Tory MEPs from the European People\u2019s party (EPP) \u2013 the main centre-right bloc, the political family of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. What seemed like an obscure point of party administration had fateful consequences. The most immediate was that the Conservatives had to create their own MEP group, or risk seeing their influence and access to European funds wither away \u2013 and so the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group was born. The Tories joined forces with Polish nationalists and a ragbag of fringe parties, a few with dubious far-right pasts. Some Tory grandees complained Cameron was making a terrible mistake in appeasing the Eurosceptic right. This argument resurfaced last year, after Conservative MEPs voted against launching a procedure that could lead to EU sanctions on Hungary, whose authoritarian government is unpicking democratic checks and balances. As home affairs spokesman, Dalton was on the frontline of that debate. Should the party have taken a stand against Viktor Orb\u00e1n? His response has a Eurosceptic tint: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote with Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Let\u2019s make that clear. We voted against EU powers.\u201d Dalton\u2019s office in Strasbourg houses little more than a computer, a few papers and a plate of half-eaten fruit. There are few personal touches in any office here, as MEPs spend no more than four days a month in Strasbourg \u2013 a labyrinth of buildings and bridges spanning the Marne-Rhine canal and the Ill river. There are escalators that take you one floor higher than you needed, stairs you cannot find, circular corridors with identical doors. As an old joke goes, the building is a giant metaphor for the EU: \u201cYou can see where you want to go, but not how to get there.\u201d The endless to-ing and fro-ing between Brussels and Strasbourg has long been criticised by British politicians as a waste of time and money. Most MEPs want to scrap the Strasbourg seat, but every attempt to do so meets the French president\u2019s veto. Dalton admits he will be glad to see the back of it, but leaving the EU is bittersweet for this party loyalist \u2013 a remainer who converted to leave. Personally, he was saddened by the result and regrets that British citizens will lose their right to live and work in Europe \u2013 something that has benefited him, his German wife and their young family. His support for freedom of movement makes him \u201cunusual for a Conservative\u201d, he admits. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had a full term yet, and I would like to have had longer. But I don\u2019t believe you can take part in a referendum and then say, if the result isn\u2019t the one we like, I don\u2019t respect the result.\u201d In Dalton\u2019s West Midlands constituency, the vote was decisive: 29 of 30 councils voted to go. Remain lost the economic argument, he believes. \u201cMost people turned around and said, \u2018Either we don\u2019t believe you, or it will be worth it to get out of an ever-closer union.\u2019 People are prepared to take an economic hit from leaving the EU.\u201d He adds that he thinks the cost of Brexit has been exaggerated. It is wrong, even dangerous, Dalton says, to suggest that people were misled by slogans on a bus. It may just be that the UK, with all its polarities, was always \u201cpolitically incompatible with Europe\u201d. In Westminster, it is government versus opposition, blue versus red, seated two sword-lengths apart. In Brussels, \u201cIt is much more about compromise. And I think compromise is a little bit outside [British] political culture.\u201d *** When I meet Jill Evans, Plaid Cymru\u2019s only MEP, who is campaigning for a second referendum, it is late January. The night before, the prime minister told MPs that she intended to renegotiate the Irish backstop \u2013 a demand Brussels rejects almost immediately. Meanwhile Evans has just made the seven-hour commute from her constituency in the Rhondda Valley to her Brussels hotel. We meet in her office, down a corridor shared with other separatist parties and the Greens. The space has the feel of student halls \u2013 event posters stuck on the walls alongside the Welsh flag, the Scottish Saltire and the Catalan standard, and a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on one MEP\u2019s door. Brexit Day, 29 March, is less than two months away, and Evans says the \u201crollercoaster\u201d of uncertainty makes it hard to focus on preparing to leave. \u201cI never dreamed I would be the last Plaid Cymru MEP, and that is something that causes me great despair.\u201d In her two decades as an MEP, she has fought a lonely and fruitless battle for Welsh be added to the EU\u2019s (currently) 24 official languages. One of the original Greenham Common protesters, she planned on retiring from parliament this year, at the age of 59. During the referendum campaign, Evans crunched the numbers to show that Wales got more money back from the EU than it paid in through taxes \u2013 a net annual gain of between \u00a323m and \u00a3117m. But Wales still voted to leave. It was hard to tell people hit by government cuts they were doing well from the EU, Evans says. \u201cI think about what would have happened in those austerity years without European funding. But people didn\u2019t feel the benefits in their everyday lives.\u201d *** When I meet Ukip MEP Mike Hookem in his Strasbourg office, Sky News\u2019s rolling \u201cBrexit crisis\u201d coverage is on full blast. We are high in the parliament\u2019s tower, with a sweeping view of a city that is a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation, as Theresa May fights to speak over a wall of noise in the Commons. \u201cYou have gotta ask yourself,\u201d he says, \u201cis this woman absolutely incompetent, or is she playing a very smart game, because she is a remainer?\u201d It is 12 February and May is attempting to take the UK out of the single market and customs union \u2013 a hard Brexit by anyone\u2019s standards \u2013 but Hookem smells betrayal. Solidly built and straight-talking, Hookem is one of only a few Ukip MEPs left, after the party stunned the establishment by taking first place in the 2014 European elections, winning 24 seats. A few quit in the early years: Janice Atkinson joined the far-right group led by Marine Le Pen; Diane James quit after 18 days as Ukip leader; and Steven Woolfe left after what is known in Ukip circles as the \u201cStrasbourg altercation\u201d. This came a few months after the referendum, when the party was fizzing with rumours of defections to the Tories. Woolfe got into a scuffle with Hookem in a parliament antechamber and later collapsed on a walkway. There were no witnesses to the fracas, but from his hospital bed, Woolfe told the Daily Mail that Hookem \u201ccame at me and landed a blow\u201d. Hookem described the incident as \u201chandbags at dawn\u201d and still maintains that he never punched Woolfe. A Ukip internal report concluded there was no evidence Hookem had started a fight. But it was just one sign the party was imploding. By autumn 2018, a trickle of departures became a flood. One after another, MEPs quit in protest at the leadership of Gerard Batten \u2013 including Farage, who left the party \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d after Batten appointed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (known as Tommy Robinson) as an adviser. Hookem is furious that his former colleagues left without resigning their seats. Most have now joined the Brexit party. He says he wrote to Farage, asking him to stand down. There was no reply. \u201cI\u2019ve supported Nigel! I\u2019ve campaigned for him! But what do they say, never meet your heroes.\u201d He clarifies: \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t my hero \u2013 it\u2019s just a figure of speech.\u201d He defends Batten against the charge of taking Ukip in an extremist, Islamophobic direction. \u201cGerard has got this thing about the Qur\u2019an,\u201d he admits, without spelling out what that thing might be. \u201cYes, he is the leader \u2013 but he is not taking the party down there.\u201d Nor does he share Batten\u2019s approval of Yaxley-Lennon. \u201cIf he becomes a member of the party I will leave, because that is not the party I joined.\u201d If people are confused as to why the Ukip leader employs a far-right activist, he says, that\u2019s because \u201cthey are reading the mainstream media\u201d, deploying the Trumpian get-out-of-jail-free card. A few weeks later, the Guardian publishes an investigation revealing an influx of the far right into Ukip; when I bump into Hookem he says he is upset. \u201cI am a working-class lad from Hull. I am not racist, I am not far right. All I want is Great Britain out of the EU \u2013 to do trade deals around the world and be the confident nation it once was.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t want to be photographed for this article, but later changes his mind. By April, he is mulling standing against Batten as leader. Hookem grew up in the heart of Hull\u2019s fishing community. \u201cThey went out to put food on the nation\u2019s table,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was probably the most dangerous job in the world.\u201d His older brother was killed in the \u201ctriple trawler disaster\u201d of 1968, when three vessels sank in one month, claiming 58 lives. Hookem joined the RAF at 17, later serving in the army. He used to vote Labour, but hasn\u2019t since 1997. He joined Ukip in 2008 and worked his way up: regional organiser, then MEP in Ukip\u2019s 2014 landslide. By that time, Ukip was becoming a more organised presence in Brussels. In the early days, the plan was simply to turn up and vote no. But then the party began hiring researchers, even taking positions on the nitty-gritty \u2013 drafting counter-proposals and voting in committee meetings, although continuing to shun the business of EU law-making. Sitting alongside their mini union jacks in the debating chamber, Ukip got noticed. Farage was invited on to Question Time, while other British MEPs despaired of a prime-time slot. The Ukip leader was already expert at getting noticed: one 2010 YouTube clip of Farage calling the then European council president \u201ca low-grade bank clerk\u201d has been viewed 1.5m times. The EU launched Ukip into British politics. \u201cWe needed that platform, that is absolutely right,\u201d Hookem agrees. The day before one of our meetings, he delivered a speech designed for YouTube. Officially, he was taking part in a debate on the \u201cmultiannual plans for stocks fished in western waters and adjacent waters\u201d, in other words, ensuring cod, herring and lobster are not fished out of existence. There were eight heartfelt speeches and the room was thick with jargon: regionalisation, multiannual management, landing obligations. When Hookem got to his feet, the debate tilted into a parallel universe. Riffing on Donald Tusk\u2019s \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d comments on Brexiters, he denounced the fisheries policy, made a reference to the second world war, threw in a Winston Churchill quote, cited Greece\u2019s anti-austerity protesters, Catalan separatists, Polish and Hungarian nationalists and French gilets jaunes \u2013 anyone who might be deemed anti-EU. One person clapped loudly as he sat down, then the debate flipped back into fish quotas. But while Ukip has learned from Farage\u2019s methods, it is harder to repeat his success. After two months on Hookem\u2019s YouTube channel, his clip has had 34 views. *** It\u2019s springtime in Strasbourg and the covered bridge that connects two wings of parliament is a heat trap. Two weeks have passed since Brexit day, and Britain\u2019s departure has been delayed, twice. The union jack still flies. British officials are still meeting EU contacts in the cafes. British MEPs were supposed to have gone now, but they haven\u2019t. \u201cPeople say, \u2018You\u2019re still here!\u2019 when we walk out of the lift, so it has a comic side to it,\u201d Evans says. The previous Strasbourg session was more emotional for her: farewell drinks, speeches, some tears. Far from being marginalised, Evans says she has benefited from \u201cthe overwhelming support\u201d of other members. \u201cIt\u2019s meant the world, really. MEPs aren\u2019t the most popular politicians, even among politicians, and to have that kind of solidarity has been something really special.\u201d By now, Evans thought she\u2019d be tending her garden, but instead she is preparing a campaign \u2013 for the European elections on 23 May. \u201cEvery week that goes by and we are still here strengthens the feeling: we remain in the EU.\u201d Dalton is a more reluctant MEP candidate and still hopes for an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare at the moment. However, we are politicians and politicians live with a Damocles sword over their heads. I don\u2019t particularly think anyone should feel sorry for us.\u201d The latest polls have shown the Conservatives crashing to an all-time low. The polls also look bad for Ukip. Farage\u2019s new Brexit party could be a clean slate, as yet untainted by the far right and candidates that teach their dogs Hitler salutes. When I speak to Hookem, hours after a YouGov poll puts the Brexit party in first place, he acknowledges the competition. \u201cIt causes us a little bit of concern,\u201d he says, before making the bold claim that \u201cFarage has been played by the establishment\u201d as a means of splitting the Brexit vote. Meanwhile, McAvan has decided not to stand again. As she leaves Strasbourg, she is writing thank you cards, in EU blue and gold. She thought she would be the last ever female MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber. Now she expects to see a successor and is buoyed by the campaign. The voting bell is ringing out. McAvan gathers her papers and walks down to the chamber. Bumping into a colleague in the lifts, she mentions this article, originally billed as a portrait of Britain\u2019s last MEPs. Now there is a question mark at the end of that phrase. The conversation continues as we walk into the busy corridors. \u201cThe Brexit story is not over yet,\u201d she says. And she heads to the chamber to place her votes.
