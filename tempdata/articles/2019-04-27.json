      "bodyText": "The Scottish National party has voted to establish an independent currency \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d if Scotland were to leave the UK, as activists rejected a more cautious timetable put forward by the party leadership. In a narrow victory for the grassroots, the party conference agreed by 52 votes to amend part of a wide-ranging economic blueprint, created by the party\u2019s sustainable growth commission, to allow for a new currency to be fast-tracked and \u201cready for introduction as soon as practicable after Independence Day\u201d. The SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had urged the membership to support a more gradual approach before this weekend\u2019s campaign conference in Edinburgh. The amended resolution was passed following a tense but respectful debate, which party deputy Keith Brown urged should be \u201can advert for independence\u201d. The growth commission\u2019s report, which was published last May, attracted a wave of criticism for what many saw as an overly cautious and market-driven approach, including its plans to keep sterling for an indefinite period while cutting public spending. It faced a backlash on the conference floor with a number of amendments tabled, several of which attempted to scrap the \u201csix tests\u201d on market credibility, trade and public opinion that the commission recommends should be met before a new currency is established. Delegates did not support scrapping the six tests, but amended the wording relating to when a new currency could be established, removing the defined timescale that a decision should be taken by the end of the first term of an independent parliament. Proposing the resolution along with the Scottish government\u2019s finance secretary, Derek Mackay, Brown told delegates that a convincing economic policy was key to strengthening the case for independence. Reminding the conference hall in Edinburgh that they could not take for granted that support for independence would increase, he recognised the urgency that some felt about establishing a new currency but warned that \u201cgoing harder and faster would damage that case and fail to win more support\u201d. Brown warned them: \u201cWhen you cast your vote think about how you want to feel the day after another referendum.\u201d Proposing the amendment to scrap the tests, the SNP veteran and former MP George Kerevan insisted that the debate was not about \u201ca divide between those who want to convince and those who are rushing ahead\u201d, but argued that voters on the doorstep would want to know when the party planned to introduce a new currency, and the six tests would lose support. As the proceedings unfolded, some speakers compared the atmosphere to the 2012 debate when the party changed policy to remaining within Nato as an independent country, against fierce grassroots opposition. But most party members and politicians were in buoyant mood, as the sunshine streamed in through the high windows of Edinburgh\u2019s International Conference Centre, following a YouGov poll released overnight that found support for independence up four points since last June to 49%. The survey, the first to be conducted since Sturgeon said she would introduce legislation to allow the option of holding another independence referendum before 2021 if Brexit goes ahead, also found that 48% thought there should not be a second vote within the next five years. It also put Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party in third place in European election voting intention at 13 points, behind Labour at 14 and the SNP at 40 points, with the Scottish Conservatives trailing at 10.",

Daubney, who came to prominence by promoting the idea of an endless male adolescence, marked his candidature by declaring that the Brexit party was a fresh start \u201cwith a new wave of people who understand the real world\u201d.</p> <p>The term \u201creal world\u201d is obviously a subjective concept, but I suggest that few people would rush to place those two words next to the names <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/20/farage-rees-mogg-nottingham-brexit-party-election\" title=\"\">Annunziata Rees-Mogg</a> and Ann Widdecombe, who are also Brexit party candidates.</p> <p>\u201cYou picked the two people from the entire roster who don\u2019t fit the bill,\u201d Daubney says. \u201cBut look across the rest of the names and you\u2019ll see a new wave of people who aren\u2019t from the political class that goes straight from university to lobbying and work experiences in Westminster. They\u2019ve had real jobs.\u201d</p> <p>The real job that Daubney held for eight years at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2010/aug/20/loaded-magazine-covers\" title=\"\"><em>Loaded</em></a> involved such tasks as shooting radioactive wolves from a helicopter in Chernobyl, taking acid to celebrate LSD\u2019s 40th anniversary, drinking a lot of alcohol, ogling women\u2019s breasts and, in his own words, being \u201ca skilled defender of the indefensible\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Westminster is meant to be full of experts and where have they got us? Nowhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cynics might argue that it\u2019s the perfect CV for someone looking to get ahead in Brussels. But what expertise do Daubney and his fellow party novices have to offer voters that more experienced politicians cannot?</p> <p>\u201cWestminster is meant to be full of experts and where have they got us? Nowhere. They have refused to enact the will of the people and people are sick to the back teeth of so-called experts because they exist in a world of self-interest and aren\u2019t interested in what the common person thinks.\u201d</p> <p>Daubney\u2019s own political journey, he believes, mirrors that of many potential Brexit party voters. He thought he\u2019d be a lifelong Labour supporter, but \u201cpulled the rip-cord\u201d when Ed Miliband became leader. He\u2019s since twice voted for the Liberal Democrats and once for the Women\u2019s Equality party, thanks to its policy on shared parental leave.</p> <p>He says that in Manchester, where he was introduced to Brexit party supporters, the room was \u201cpacked with lifelong but despondent Labour supporters, looking for permission to jump ship\u201d. Labour, he believes, is going to get \u201ca nasty surprise\u201d at the European elections.</p> <p>But what of Daubney, what nasty surprises are in store for him? He says he\u2019s never voted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> or Ukip, but he believes that the Brexit party can replace the status quo, and become part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/nov/20/how-populism-emerged-as-electoral-force-in-europe\" title=\"\">European tide of populism</a>.</p> <p>What, though, are its policies?</p> <p>\u201cNigel has said that he will lay those out after the European elections,\u201d he says. He thinks it\u2019s \u201cextremely naive to think the Brexit party is reheated Ukip\u201d, though, given Farage\u2019s track record and policies as a politician, some would say it\u2019s naive to believe that he will abandon his rightwing beliefs.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/23/former-communist-claire-fox-standing-as-mep-for-farages-brexit-party\" title=\"\">Claire Fox [another Brexit party candidate]</a> said there\u2019s probably not much she\u2019d agree with Nigel about women\u2019s rights, workers\u2019 rights, immigration.

      "bodyText": "The Brexit party announced its candidates for the European elections last week, and among them was Martin Daubney, a former editor of the lads\u2019 magazine Loaded and more recently a campaigner on men\u2019s issues. Daubney, who came to prominence by promoting the idea of an endless male adolescence, marked his candidature by declaring that the Brexit party was a fresh start \u201cwith a new wave of people who understand the real world\u201d. The term \u201creal world\u201d is obviously a subjective concept, but I suggest that few people would rush to place those two words next to the names Annunziata Rees-Mogg and Ann Widdecombe, who are also Brexit party candidates. \u201cYou picked the two people from the entire roster who don\u2019t fit the bill,\u201d Daubney says. \u201cBut look across the rest of the names and you\u2019ll see a new wave of people who aren\u2019t from the political class that goes straight from university to lobbying and work experiences in Westminster. They\u2019ve had real jobs.\u201d The real job that Daubney held for eight years at Loaded involved such tasks as shooting radioactive wolves from a helicopter in Chernobyl, taking acid to celebrate LSD\u2019s 40th anniversary, drinking a lot of alcohol, ogling women\u2019s breasts and, in his own words, being \u201ca skilled defender of the indefensible\u201d. Cynics might argue that it\u2019s the perfect CV for someone looking to get ahead in Brussels. But what expertise do Daubney and his fellow party novices have to offer voters that more experienced politicians cannot? \u201cWestminster is meant to be full of experts and where have they got us? Nowhere. They have refused to enact the will of the people and people are sick to the back teeth of so-called experts because they exist in a world of self-interest and aren\u2019t interested in what the common person thinks.\u201d Daubney\u2019s own political journey, he believes, mirrors that of many potential Brexit party voters. He thought he\u2019d be a lifelong Labour supporter, but \u201cpulled the rip-cord\u201d when Ed Miliband became leader. He\u2019s since twice voted for the Liberal Democrats and once for the Women\u2019s Equality party, thanks to its policy on shared parental leave. He says that in Manchester, where he was introduced to Brexit party supporters, the room was \u201cpacked with lifelong but despondent Labour supporters, looking for permission to jump ship\u201d. Labour, he believes, is going to get \u201ca nasty surprise\u201d at the European elections. But what of Daubney, what nasty surprises are in store for him? He says he\u2019s never voted for Nigel Farage or Ukip, but he believes that the Brexit party can replace the status quo, and become part of a European tide of populism. What, though, are its policies? \u201cNigel has said that he will lay those out after the European elections,\u201d he says. He thinks it\u2019s \u201cextremely naive to think the Brexit party is reheated Ukip\u201d, though, given Farage\u2019s track record and policies as a politician, some would say it\u2019s naive to believe that he will abandon his rightwing beliefs. \u201cClaire Fox [another Brexit party candidate] said there\u2019s probably not much she\u2019d agree with Nigel about women\u2019s rights, workers\u2019 rights, immigration. All those conversations will have to be had down the line. They\u2019re conversations I\u2019d like to listen to.\u201d But whatever the outcome of that debate, and even if the UK somehow manages not to leave the EU, Daubney has no intention of resigning, should he become an MEP. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, to use a colourful metaphor, it\u2019s better to be inside the tent pissing outwards. If you\u2019re trying to enact change in an institution, then you\u2019re better off being part of it.\u201d Especially when that tent is paying you a hundred grand plus hefty expenses \u2013 certainly, Farage has managed to stick it out for 20 years now. Although Daubney has said that he\u2019d prefer to stay in Europe than leave with Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, his preference is a no-deal Brexit, which he sees as \u201can exciting way to look to the future in terms of trade deals, WTO and just being optimistic about Britain moving forwards\u201d. But what about the fact that an overwhelming majority of economic observers argue that it will have a very negative impact on the British economy in the short and medium term? \u201cI think people have lost faith in that negatively biased frame of mind,\u201d he says, dismissing a whole field of study as an exercise in wilful pessimism. If there\u2019s anything that can be done then, he says, people of all stripes believe \u201cthere\u2019s only one man who can do it\u201d. \u201cThe naysayers and the deniers have reinvigorated Farage,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening.

      "body": "<p>During his rise to power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, France\u2019s youngest modern leader, was often seen surrounded by a close-knit group of identikit white male advisers in suits, fellow graduates of elite political schools, soon nicknamed \u201cthe Mormons\u201d for their uniformity. But one woman stood out: Senegalese-born Sibeth Ndiaye, his media communications supremo. The straight-talking 39-year-old in a biker jacket played a key role in crafting Macron\u2019s image as the change-making outsider; the man who built a new centrist party in order to fight the far-right <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, with his intriguing personal story as a gifted school pupil who married his drama teacher, Brigitte.</p> <p>Often, when Ndiaye briefed the Paris media establishment on Macron\u2019s policy ideas, she was the only minority ethnic person in the room. She remembers the exact moment Macron really understood how this felt. It was 2015, he was an ambitious economy minister in government under the Socialist president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, and she was organising the media scrum following him at an aviation show in a hangar north of Paris. But the police kept blocking her way. \u201cEvery time we got to a stand, the security cordon would stop me going through,\u201d she says when we meet in her office. \u201cUsually I\u2019m incredibly strong in those situations. But this time \u2013 I don\u2019t know why, maybe I was tired \u2013 I just cracked and I sat down and cried.\u201d The local police chief stepped in and personally escorted her through the event.</p> <p>She says that when Macron realised what had happened, \u201che shook my hand for a very long while, looking me straight in the eye. And something was forged between us. It\u2019s one thing to have an intellectual awareness of discrimination, it\u2019s another thing to experience it directly. From that moment, whenever I was out on a walkabout with him, he developed this habit of always turning round and checking: \u2018Where\u2019s Sibeth?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ndiaye has been at his side ever since, running his media operation at the presidential palace after he won the 2017 election. She is so close to him that she has advised him on his trouser length, occasionally done his makeup and been known to tuck verses of poetry into his briefings. She is seen as one of the few people who can speak frankly to the president. \u201cShe\u2019s direct with him and she jokes and teases him, where I wouldn\u2019t have dared,\u201d one former adviser tells me. This month, Macron propelled her from the shadows on to the public stage, appointing her a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/31/macron-reshuffle-ministers-resign-run-paris-mayor-election\" title=\"\">cabinet minister and government spokesperson</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f304c9327fc9e9d1ecc9e221a7ede4570e6da36e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f304c9327fc9e9d1ecc9e221a7ede4570e6da36e/0_135_4093_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then public relations adviser of French president Sibeth Ndiaye (L) and French president Emmanuel Macron leave the Elysee palace in Paris in October 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Elys\u00e9e palace with President Macron. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A unique quirk of French politics is that the spokesperson has a junior ministerial role, sitting on the parliament front benches. Ndiaye\u2019s job is to ruthlessly argue the government\u2019s cause and explain its actions on TV \u2013 like Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/30/sarah-huckabee-sanders-press-secretary-sean-spicer\" title=\"\">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a>, but with more power. She arrives in the role at a particularly testing time. Five months of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\" title=\"\">anti-government street demonstrations</a> have seen sporadic rioting on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. Two years into his term, the pro-business Macron, who promised to transform France with a new form of inclusive politics, has instead been accused of arrogance and being \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d, his approval ratings dropping below 30% this month. In January, Ndiaye\u2019s predecessor as spokesperson, Benjamin Griveaux \u2013 now hoping to run for mayor of Paris \u2013 had to be bundled out of a ministry side door after protesters on a forklift truck smashed down the massive wooden gates outside his office and rampaged across the cobbled courtyard, damaging cars and breaking windows.</p> <p>***</p> <p>There\u2019s no sign of any unrest the day I meet Ndiaye in the 18th-century Paris mansion that serves as her ministry. Hours later, news will break of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-a-visual-guide-and-timeline\" title=\"\">the fire tearing through Notre Dame</a>, causing a turmoil of announcements and meetings, but now we sit in a quiet office with leather sofas, a vast glass chandelier, modern paintings and campaign pictures of Ndiaye with Macron on the mantelpiece. Over a pot of tea, she is warm and informal. We\u2019re far from the relentless election campaign two years ago when I\u2019d see her sprinting along the drab, grey corridors of Macron\u2019s HQ or still working at midnight on the cold train home from a faraway rally (her days would usually end at 3am).</p> <p>As a press officer she was known to be direct \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/fr/title/80190879\" title=\"\">campaign documentary</a>, she is seen berating a magazine writer: \u201cThat\u2019s not the work of a journalist, that\u2019s the work of a slob.\u201d Indeed, she feels her new job is to cut through political waffle and listen to voters. \u201cIn order to convince people, you need to understand their difficulties, fears, questions, what they want,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you need to use their vocabulary to make yourself better understood.\u201d</p> <p>Ndiaye grew up in Senegal, moving to France when she was 17. Unlike many ministers in a centrist government supposed to have been pulled from both left and right, her background is in the leftwing student union movement \u2013 when she worked for Macron at the economy ministry, she took public transport every day from the suburban town of Saint-Denis, where she lived with her social housing director husband and three children, twin girls now nine years old and a son aged six. (They have since moved to Paris to be nearer her work.)</p> <p>Since her appointment, she has become one of the most talked-about and photographed members of the French government; Macron would like her to represent a new, more human face of French politics. Her brief \u2013 far from easy \u2013 is to make the government seem more likable, more in touch. \u201cProximity, generosity,\u201d the president is said to have advised her.</p> <p>However, her new public-facing role has unleashed a riot of sexist and racist abuse. One French author tweeted last month that Ndiaye having natural afro hair in government was an affront to France: a \u201cprovocation and a total lack of respect\u201d. Trolls compared her patterned dresses to cleaners\u2019 overalls.</p> <p>The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, slammed \u201cthe outpouring of racist hatred\u201d. The leftwing MP Jean-Philippe Nilor warned that France \u2013 a republic supposedly built on the foundation that citizens are equal, no matter their class, race or religion \u2013 had failed to move on in the six years since the black justice minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/french-justice-minister-christiane-taubira-resigns\" title=\"\">Christiane Taubira</a> was likened to a monkey on social media and saw children wave bananas at her at an event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1977f16882419ad565e557c72cdff6c58831c574\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1977f16882419ad565e557c72cdff6c58831c574/97_0_4383_5600/783.jpg\" alt=\"Sibeth Ndiaye, French cabinet minister and government spokeswoman\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018France can\u2019t resolve Brexit in Britain\u2019s place. None of us wants a no-deal, but we\u2019re prepared if it happens.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Alcock/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s revealing of the moment we live in: that fear of the other, that retreat into what we believe our identity to be,\u201d Ndiaye says of the recent abuse. She says she feels both Senegalese, where she grew up, and French, where she has lived for more than 20 years; she took joint French nationality three years ago. \u201cI have never felt rejected or excluded by my adopted country, but I know there are some people \u2013 through fear, foolishness or anxiety over what I might represent \u2013 who can be racist.\u201d She says it was worse for the family of her husband, who is white. His family come from \u201ca little French town where they are not constantly confronted with this. So it was very shocking for them \u2013 more so than for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ndiaye\u2019s appointment ensures Macron\u2019s promised gender parity in government, although she is one of only two BAME people out of 36 ministers. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re black, people will always cast doubt on why you\u2019re there,\u201d she said recently in a TV interview.</p> <p>Ndiaye grew up in Dakar, steeped in the politics of the African independence movement. Her mother, who was of mixed Togolese and German descent, was a senior judge who went on to head Senegal\u2019s constitutional council. Her father, a politician, was born into a poor family outside Dakar, the orphaned son of a Senegalese soldier who died fighting for France in the second world war. Her parents met at university in Paris in the heady days of 1960s street demonstrations and activism, and then returned to Senegal. Democracy was important at home \u2013 even Ndiaye\u2019s name was decided in a family vote with the agreement of her three elder sisters.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up bathed in politics,\u201d she says. \u201cI have an image in my head of my parents sitting in our living room, under a huge cloud of cigarette smoke as they talked and talked and talked: about the future of the African continent, and French politics, too.\u201d</p> <p>Every Friday lunchtime, they would host an open house with key thinkers and intellectuals, eating traditional Senegalese fish and rice, and putting the world to rights. Ndiaye would come home from school at lunch to be part of it and \u201chide in a corner\u201d so she could stay the afternoon.</p> <p>Earlier this month, on the steps of Ndiaye\u2019s ministry, in her first speech in her new role, she thanked her family for helping her break glass ceilings. She has paid tribute to her father who, with four daughters, was a feminist who insisted school \u201cwas a tool for emancipation\u201d. \u201cAnd I was surrounded by powerful, professional women, many with external signs of power \u2013 for example, women who had chauffeur-driven cars, which was something then considered to be reserved for men,\u201d she tells me.</p> <p>When she was 17, her father became desperately ill and was treated in a Paris hospital. He said he wanted her to have the chance to study abroad, like her sisters, so she moved to attend a high school in Paris, boarding in a student residence. Her father died only a few months after she arrived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bda7204b976cde900575525466f597f3ae92177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bda7204b976cde900575525466f597f3ae92177/0_0_4602_3243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newly appointed French Junior Minister and Government\u2019s spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye (L) speaks next to her predecessor Benjamin Griveaux during a hand over ceremony at the ministry in Paris on April 1, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking over as government spokesperson from Benjamin Griveaux earlier this month.

Before that, she hadn\u2019t realised \u201cthe rejection\u201d that could happen over skin colour. \u201cMy parents were intellectually black, and we talked a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI had learned the poems of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/21/3\" title=\"\">Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/21/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor</a>, I was steeped in the concept of la n\u00e9gritude. But it was an intellectual concept. I had never felt it bodily. And I felt it bodily in France.\u201d</p> <p>It was also the first time she was asked if she had grown up in a hut. Shocked, she learned the western image of Africa, \u201ca TV image of children in the dust\u201d.

      "bodyText": "During his rise to power, Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s youngest modern leader, was often seen surrounded by a close-knit group of identikit white male advisers in suits, fellow graduates of elite political schools, soon nicknamed \u201cthe Mormons\u201d for their uniformity. But one woman stood out: Senegalese-born Sibeth Ndiaye, his media communications supremo. The straight-talking 39-year-old in a biker jacket played a key role in crafting Macron\u2019s image as the change-making outsider; the man who built a new centrist party in order to fight the far-right Marine Le Pen, with his intriguing personal story as a gifted school pupil who married his drama teacher, Brigitte. Often, when Ndiaye briefed the Paris media establishment on Macron\u2019s policy ideas, she was the only minority ethnic person in the room. She remembers the exact moment Macron really understood how this felt. It was 2015, he was an ambitious economy minister in government under the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and she was organising the media scrum following him at an aviation show in a hangar north of Paris. But the police kept blocking her way. \u201cEvery time we got to a stand, the security cordon would stop me going through,\u201d she says when we meet in her office. \u201cUsually I\u2019m incredibly strong in those situations. But this time \u2013 I don\u2019t know why, maybe I was tired \u2013 I just cracked and I sat down and cried.\u201d The local police chief stepped in and personally escorted her through the event. She says that when Macron realised what had happened, \u201che shook my hand for a very long while, looking me straight in the eye. And something was forged between us. It\u2019s one thing to have an intellectual awareness of discrimination, it\u2019s another thing to experience it directly. From that moment, whenever I was out on a walkabout with him, he developed this habit of always turning round and checking: \u2018Where\u2019s Sibeth?\u2019\u201d Ndiaye has been at his side ever since, running his media operation at the presidential palace after he won the 2017 election. She is so close to him that she has advised him on his trouser length, occasionally done his makeup and been known to tuck verses of poetry into his briefings. She is seen as one of the few people who can speak frankly to the president. \u201cShe\u2019s direct with him and she jokes and teases him, where I wouldn\u2019t have dared,\u201d one former adviser tells me. This month, Macron propelled her from the shadows on to the public stage, appointing her a cabinet minister and government spokesperson. A unique quirk of French politics is that the spokesperson has a junior ministerial role, sitting on the parliament front benches. Ndiaye\u2019s job is to ruthlessly argue the government\u2019s cause and explain its actions on TV \u2013 like Donald Trump\u2019s Sarah Huckabee Sanders, but with more power. She arrives in the role at a particularly testing time. Five months of gilets jaunes anti-government street demonstrations have seen sporadic rioting on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. Two years into his term, the pro-business Macron, who promised to transform France with a new form of inclusive politics, has instead been accused of arrogance and being \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d, his approval ratings dropping below 30% this month. In January, Ndiaye\u2019s predecessor as spokesperson, Benjamin Griveaux \u2013 now hoping to run for mayor of Paris \u2013 had to be bundled out of a ministry side door after protesters on a forklift truck smashed down the massive wooden gates outside his office and rampaged across the cobbled courtyard, damaging cars and breaking windows. *** There\u2019s no sign of any unrest the day I meet Ndiaye in the 18th-century Paris mansion that serves as her ministry. Hours later, news will break of the fire tearing through Notre Dame, causing a turmoil of announcements and meetings, but now we sit in a quiet office with leather sofas, a vast glass chandelier, modern paintings and campaign pictures of Ndiaye with Macron on the mantelpiece. Over a pot of tea, she is warm and informal. We\u2019re far from the relentless election campaign two years ago when I\u2019d see her sprinting along the drab, grey corridors of Macron\u2019s HQ or still working at midnight on the cold train home from a faraway rally (her days would usually end at 3am). As a press officer she was known to be direct \u2013 in a campaign documentary, she is seen berating a magazine writer: \u201cThat\u2019s not the work of a journalist, that\u2019s the work of a slob.\u201d Indeed, she feels her new job is to cut through political waffle and listen to voters. \u201cIn order to convince people, you need to understand their difficulties, fears, questions, what they want,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you need to use their vocabulary to make yourself better understood.\u201d Ndiaye grew up in Senegal, moving to France when she was 17. Unlike many ministers in a centrist government supposed to have been pulled from both left and right, her background is in the leftwing student union movement \u2013 when she worked for Macron at the economy ministry, she took public transport every day from the suburban town of Saint-Denis, where she lived with her social housing director husband and three children, twin girls now nine years old and a son aged six. (They have since moved to Paris to be nearer her work.) Since her appointment, she has become one of the most talked-about and photographed members of the French government; Macron would like her to represent a new, more human face of French politics. Her brief \u2013 far from easy \u2013 is to make the government seem more likable, more in touch. \u201cProximity, generosity,\u201d the president is said to have advised her. However, her new public-facing role has unleashed a riot of sexist and racist abuse. One French author tweeted last month that Ndiaye having natural afro hair in government was an affront to France: a \u201cprovocation and a total lack of respect\u201d. Trolls compared her patterned dresses to cleaners\u2019 overalls. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, slammed \u201cthe outpouring of racist hatred\u201d. The leftwing MP Jean-Philippe Nilor warned that France \u2013 a republic supposedly built on the foundation that citizens are equal, no matter their class, race or religion \u2013 had failed to move on in the six years since the black justice minister Christiane Taubira was likened to a monkey on social media and saw children wave bananas at her at an event. \u201cI think it\u2019s revealing of the moment we live in: that fear of the other, that retreat into what we believe our identity to be,\u201d Ndiaye says of the recent abuse. She says she feels both Senegalese, where she grew up, and French, where she has lived for more than 20 years; she took joint French nationality three years ago. \u201cI have never felt rejected or excluded by my adopted country, but I know there are some people \u2013 through fear, foolishness or anxiety over what I might represent \u2013 who can be racist.\u201d She says it was worse for the family of her husband, who is white. His family come from \u201ca little French town where they are not constantly confronted with this. So it was very shocking for them \u2013 more so than for me.\u201d Ndiaye\u2019s appointment ensures Macron\u2019s promised gender parity in government, although she is one of only two BAME people out of 36 ministers. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re black, people will always cast doubt on why you\u2019re there,\u201d she said recently in a TV interview. Ndiaye grew up in Dakar, steeped in the politics of the African independence movement. Her mother, who was of mixed Togolese and German descent, was a senior judge who went on to head Senegal\u2019s constitutional council. Her father, a politician, was born into a poor family outside Dakar, the orphaned son of a Senegalese soldier who died fighting for France in the second world war. Her parents met at university in Paris in the heady days of 1960s street demonstrations and activism, and then returned to Senegal. Democracy was important at home \u2013 even Ndiaye\u2019s name was decided in a family vote with the agreement of her three elder sisters. \u201cI grew up bathed in politics,\u201d she says. \u201cI have an image in my head of my parents sitting in our living room, under a huge cloud of cigarette smoke as they talked and talked and talked: about the future of the African continent, and French politics, too.\u201d Every Friday lunchtime, they would host an open house with key thinkers and intellectuals, eating traditional Senegalese fish and rice, and putting the world to rights. Ndiaye would come home from school at lunch to be part of it and \u201chide in a corner\u201d so she could stay the afternoon. Earlier this month, on the steps of Ndiaye\u2019s ministry, in her first speech in her new role, she thanked her family for helping her break glass ceilings. She has paid tribute to her father who, with four daughters, was a feminist who insisted school \u201cwas a tool for emancipation\u201d. \u201cAnd I was surrounded by powerful, professional women, many with external signs of power \u2013 for example, women who had chauffeur-driven cars, which was something then considered to be reserved for men,\u201d she tells me. When she was 17, her father became desperately ill and was treated in a Paris hospital. He said he wanted her to have the chance to study abroad, like her sisters, so she moved to attend a high school in Paris, boarding in a student residence. Her father died only a few months after she arrived. At school she suffered what she calls \u201cthe shock of discovering for the first time that I was black\u201d. Before that, she hadn\u2019t realised \u201cthe rejection\u201d that could happen over skin colour. \u201cMy parents were intellectually black, and we talked a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI had learned the poems of Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, of L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor, I was steeped in the concept of la n\u00e9gritude. But it was an intellectual concept. I had never felt it bodily. And I felt it bodily in France.\u201d It was also the first time she was asked if she had grown up in a hut. Shocked, she learned the western image of Africa, \u201ca TV image of children in the dust\u201d. She says: \u201cAfrica was that, but it was also other things.\u201d Studying biology, she became an activist in a leftwing student union. Her political awakening \u2013 as with many of her generation on the left \u2013 came one night in Paris in April 2002. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ex-paratrooper leader of the far-right Front National, a party slammed by its opponents as antisemitic, racist and xenophobic, swept into the second-round runoff of the presidential election against the rightwing Jacques Chirac. Ndiaye had been watching on TV with student union friends. \u201cOur spontaneous reaction was to run down into the street, and it\u2019s the first time I ever shouted slogans at a demonstration. It was \u2018F for fascist, N for Nazi, down with the Front National\u2019.\u201d She joined the Socialist party straight away, but quickly became discouraged by the fact that no mainstream parties were asking \u201cthe fundamental questions\u201d about why voters were turning to Le Pen. \u201cThat\u2019s what later drew me to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s project, the idea of deeply questioning the way the country had evolved: what was behind that slow 30-year drift, that insidious poison.\u201d And yet Marine Le Pen, who took over the far-right party from her father, recently renaming it the National Rally, is still there, with a large support base. When she reached the final round presidential runoff against Macron in 2017, barely anyone took to the streets. Now her party is polling only a point or so short of Macron\u2019s for the European elections next month. Ndiaye insists, \u201cMy feeling is that we are armed to come to the battle against her.\u201d Ndiaye sees a link between the anger in the vote for Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002 and the protests today, saying: \u201cThe gilets jaunes are telling us they reject a society where they feel that even when you work, you can\u2019t get by, where there\u2019s an injustice of whichever family you\u2019re born into, you\u2019ve got very little chance of moving up. They think things are being decided without them. Those are things that in some way had been underlying Emmanuel Macron\u2019s election and that we have already put our finger on.\u201d She argues that Macron\u2019s recent listening exercise \u2013 a three-month \u201cnational great debate\u201d in town halls across the country \u2013 will lead to structural change. Then there\u2019s the upheaval within the EU \u2013 Ndiaye got her new job just after Theresa May negotiated the latest Brexit extension at Brussels. Macron was being portrayed in the UK as a stubborn would-be General Charles de Gaulle, isolated among European leaders in refusing the UK a longer time frame for sorting out its political mess. Like all French ministers, Ndiaye insists the ball is in the UK\u2019s court. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s very important that the Brexit vote is respected, even if I don\u2019t share the opinion expressed in the outcome,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a French point of view, we can\u2019t resolve British problems in Britain\u2019s place. So it\u2019s now up to the British to find the means to validate the withdrawal agreement which was negotiated at length between the UK and the EU.\u201d She says May\u2019s talks with Labour were seen in Paris as a step towards an orderly Brexit. \u201cNone of us wants a no-deal, but we are prepared for one if it happens.\u201d *** Despite the differences in their background \u2013 she a former leftwing activist, he a former investment banker \u2013 Ndiaye and Macron\u2019s relationship has been described by observers as \u201crelaxed\u201d and close. He once said a head of state should read literature or philosophy every night, lest they lose touch with reality.

Today, Ndiaye defends Macron, saying he \u201chas enormous respect for the media, and I share that, because he\u2019s convinced that democracy can\u2019t exist without counter-powers.\u201d She says the new executive simply wanted some elements of political decision-making to take place calmly, away from constant leaks. \u201cJournalists naturally do their job, they try to open the black box,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd my role was in some way to make sure they didn\u2019t open that box. Yes, our way of doing things was different, but at no point was it about showing contempt for the work of journalists or denying them a major place in the balance of democracy. On the contrary.\u201d Whether Ndiaye \u2013 who is so closely personally associated with Macron and was so adept in a spin doctor role \u2013 can now convince disillusioned, leftwing or less well-off French voters that the government is genuinely on their side remains to be seen. Her appointment sets the government firmly apart from the far-right populism of Le Pen. But is that enough to win over voters losing confidence in the political class? Ndiaye says only one factor has driven her life since her childhood in Senegal: \u201cInjustice. I could never bear it. I have always asked myself, why me and not others?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy did I live in a privileged way, go to school, was well-dressed, have things that others didn\u2019t just because they weren\u2019t born into the right family?\u201d That rage has never left her, she says. For now, at the ministry, Ndiaye must rush to her next government meeting. And just like the women in power she grew up admiring, her chauffeur-driven car awaits. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).
