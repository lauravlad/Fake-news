Or would Johnson be forced, by law, to request an extension? If the EU refused an extension (unlikely, but could Johnson then attempt to sabotage that request in order force a no deal scenario?). </p> <p>Could the EU act unilaterally in this situation? </p> <p>*turned out to be not so quick, sorry!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>In your question you talk about parliament legislating against no deal. Unless it passes a law requiring the PM to revoke article 50, it cannot absolutely legislate to stop no deal. One possible option might be to legislate to require the PM to either win a vote approving a no-deal Brexit or to request an article 50 extension. If that law had been passed by the time of an election, it would stand. But the EU has to agree an article 50 extension, and so the UK cannot determine that unilaterally.</p> <p>On the main point, whether an election campaign ending after 31 October would oblige the new PM to request an article 50 extension, effectively halting Brexit to allow the electorate to express its views, opinion varies. <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/exiting-the-european-union-committee/the-progress-of-the-uks-negotiations-on-eu-withdrawal/oral/103726.pdf\">At the Brexit committee last week</a> <strong>David Lidington</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, implied that the proper thing to do would be to delay. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Certainly, the convention that has been established hitherto and is reflected in the cabinet manual is that if a general election is called, whether triggered by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act or because parliament gets to the end of its term, the government from that moment goes on to a caretaker basis and does not take any significant decisions that would prejudice the freedom of decision taking by whichever government the people elect.</p> </blockquote> <p>But at the hearing the Tory Brexiter <strong>Peter Bone</strong> strongly objected to Lidington\u2019s interpretation. If Boris Johnson were PM, he could argue that he was elected leader with a mandate to leave the EU by 31 October, and so he might ignore the cabinet manual. Bone argued that, because parliament voted to trigger article 50, leaving on 31 October was already the default, and that that is what a government in caretaker mode should implement.</p> <p>As for whether the EU could unilaterally keep the UK in, the answer is no.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:51:06.715Z\">at 4.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2dceda8f08d0b6ca531a4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:34:06.751Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a question from below the line which is pertinent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131082458\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101462185\" title=\"View Katherine1984\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101462185\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Katherine1984\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101462185\" title=\"View Katherine1984\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Katherine1984</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131082458\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 July 2019 10:44am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Andrew \u2013 Most agree that a No Confidence vote on a Tory government set on a No Deal Brexit is inevitable.</p> <p>So it will come down to how many anti-Brexit Tory rebels are prepared to vote against the government to how many Labour MPs who are pro-Brexit, either because of their own convictions or because they are representing a Leave-voting constituency, will vote to support the government to get Brexit through on 31st October.</p> <p>Do we have a good guide to how many of each group there are?</p> <p>Thank you.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>It is not quite as simple as that, because <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/\">there are now 20 independent MPs in the Commons</a> - 15 independents, and five Independents Group for Change ones - and it is not obvious how they would all vote. Most would vote against the government on a confidence motion, but probably not all of them, and I have not seen an up-to-date count. If there were an early election, almost all of them would probably lose their seats.</p> <p>Trying to work out how many Tory MPs would, in practice, resign the whip and vote against their own government to stop a no-deal Brexit is not easy. Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would. Others who said they would, like Anna Soubry, have already left. There are a lot more who are saying they would vote to stop no-deal, but who won\u2019t at this stage commit to voting to bring down a government committed to no-deal. A few of these might be willing to sacrifice their careers in Tory politics to stop no-deal, but perhaps only a handful more than those who have already declared.</p> <p>I was surprised to hear the Labour MP Sarah Champion suggest she might not vote with her own party on a no confidence motion. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2db7008f08cf92bb770d18#block-5d2db7008f08cf92bb770d18\"> 12.39pm.)</a> Any Labour MP who rebelled like this would not be allowed to stand for the party at a general election, and so it does not seem a sensible move for anyone keen to keep their seat. Perhaps one or two of the Labour Brexiters planning to retire anyway might be willing to abstain to help Brexit over the line, but, with the possible exception of Kate Hoey, they all hate the Tories and Boris Johnson even more than they like Brexit, so I would not put money on that either.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:12:46.119Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Theresa May was warned her three Brexit priorities for Ireland were incompatible</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is what <strong>Sir Ivan Rogers</strong>, the former ambassador to Brussels, said in the hearing about how Theresa May was making incompatible promises on Ireland.

This is a significant development that means the next Tory leader will go into talks with the EU tied to a position more extreme than what was being advocated by hardish Brexiters only about six months ago (eg Dominic Raab, who would have stayed in cabinet if the backstop had been time-limited). <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-15/boris-johnson-and-jeremy-hunt-make-no-deal-brexit-probable-robert-peston/\">In a blog responding to the debate</a>, ITV\u2019s political editor <strong>Robert Peston</strong> said EU leaders would see this as the moment when \u201cthe Tory party became the no-deal party\u201d.</p> <p>This morning<strong> Dominic Grieve,</strong> the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs doing most to find a way of allowing parliament to block no-deal, said the next Tory leader (almost certainly Johnson) would bring down his government if he tried to push for no-deal. Speaking on the Today programme, he also said the policy shift announced last night was \u201csignificant\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, has told MPs that he advised Theresa May in 2016 that her three Brexit priorities for Northern Ireland were incompatible. (See 3.39pm and 4.12pm.) In separate evidence to the foreign affairs committee, on leaks, he said he would never put anything interesting in a diplomatic telegram, a communication widely circulated at Westminster. The age limit for playing National Lottery scratchcards and online instant win games could be increased to 18, the government has said. Culture minister Mims Davies said she was launching a consultation on whether the existing age limit of 16 for all National Lottery games should be raised for some or all games and products. The number of first-time applications for Irish passports from Great Britain has risen sharply since the EU referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one. The House of Lords has been adjourned after a peer was taken ill. Doorkeepers went to the aid of Labour former Foreign Office minister Lord Judd as other peers looked anxiously on, the Press Association reports. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tom Watson and four members of Labour\u2019s governing body have backed a new motion which would auto-exclude members accused of racism or other forms of discrimination, overseen by an independent appointee, in a radical overhaul of the party\u2019s complaints process. The proposed change, in the wake of the BBC Panorama documentary where eight whistleblowers alleged interference from the senior Labour officials in antisemitism complaints, will be debated at next week\u2019s full meeting of the national executive committee. The motion, signed by Watson, MP George Howarth, councillor Alice Perry and Nick Forbes and the societies representative James Asser, calls on the NEC to resolve to bring forward rule changes to annual conference to: establish an independent complaints process to deal with allegations of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia. automatically exclude a member from the party where there is irrefutable evidence of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia. It is unclear whether the NEC, which has a pro-Jeremy Corbyn majority, would pass such a new rule. Currently complaints are subject to a quasi-judicial process which can take years to resolve complaints and members can only be expelled after a hearing by the party\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the National Constitutional Committee, which has elected members from the party. High-profile cases including the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone took more than two years to resolve. And here is another interesting question from below the line. In your question you talk about parliament legislating against no deal. Unless it passes a law requiring the PM to revoke article 50, it cannot absolutely legislate to stop no deal. One possible option might be to legislate to require the PM to either win a vote approving a no-deal Brexit or to request an article 50 extension. If that law had been passed by the time of an election, it would stand. But the EU has to agree an article 50 extension, and so the UK cannot determine that unilaterally. On the main point, whether an election campaign ending after 31 October would oblige the new PM to request an article 50 extension, effectively halting Brexit to allow the electorate to express its views, opinion varies. At the Brexit committee last week David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, implied that the proper thing to do would be to delay. He explained: Certainly, the convention that has been established hitherto and is reflected in the cabinet manual is that if a general election is called, whether triggered by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act or because parliament gets to the end of its term, the government from that moment goes on to a caretaker basis and does not take any significant decisions that would prejudice the freedom of decision taking by whichever government the people elect. But at the hearing the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone strongly objected to Lidington\u2019s interpretation. If Boris Johnson were PM, he could argue that he was elected leader with a mandate to leave the EU by 31 October, and so he might ignore the cabinet manual. Bone argued that, because parliament voted to trigger article 50, leaving on 31 October was already the default, and that that is what a government in caretaker mode should implement. As for whether the EU could unilaterally keep the UK in, the answer is no. Here is a question from below the line which is pertinent. It is not quite as simple as that, because there are now 20 independent MPs in the Commons - 15 independents, and five Independents Group for Change ones - and it is not obvious how they would all vote. Most would vote against the government on a confidence motion, but probably not all of them, and I have not seen an up-to-date count. If there were an early election, almost all of them would probably lose their seats. Trying to work out how many Tory MPs would, in practice, resign the whip and vote against their own government to stop a no-deal Brexit is not easy. Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would. Others who said they would, like Anna Soubry, have already left. There are a lot more who are saying they would vote to stop no-deal, but who won\u2019t at this stage commit to voting to bring down a government committed to no-deal. A few of these might be willing to sacrifice their careers in Tory politics to stop no-deal, but perhaps only a handful more than those who have already declared. I was surprised to hear the Labour MP Sarah Champion suggest she might not vote with her own party on a no confidence motion. (See 12.39pm.) Any Labour MP who rebelled like this would not be allowed to stand for the party at a general election, and so it does not seem a sensible move for anyone keen to keep their seat. Perhaps one or two of the Labour Brexiters planning to retire anyway might be willing to abstain to help Brexit over the line, but, with the possible exception of Kate Hoey, they all hate the Tories and Boris Johnson even more than they like Brexit, so I would not put money on that either. This is what Sir Ivan Rogers, the former ambassador to Brussels, said in the hearing about how Theresa May was making incompatible promises on Ireland. (See 3.39pm.) Speaking about his time in Brussels, before he resigned in January 2017, he said: You could see, if you were me, the Irish question was being underplayed. We were not focusing enough on it. It was obviously going to be the core of the problem ... One of the most unpopular things I think I said to the prime minister in the autumn of 2016 is \u2018You\u2019ve made three commitments in good faith to different audiences, but they are not really compatible with each other. You have said to the Irish under no circumstances will a hard border be erected across the island of Ireland. You\u2019ve said to the Democratic Unionist community under no circumstances will there be divergence from the rest of Great Britain. And you\u2019ve said to the right of your own party that you\u2019re heading out of the customs union. Well, you can\u2019t do all three. You\u2019ve got to choose two of the three.\u2019 And I had the same conversation with then foreign secretary [Boris Johnson]. Ivan Rogers has now finished giving evidence to the foreign affairs committee about Brexit. He and two other former ambassadors are now giving evidence about the leaking of classified information. I will be keeping an eye on this hearing, but I won\u2019t be covering it in detail. You can watch a live feed here. This is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, commenting on the fall in the value of the pound today. (See 12.28pm.) The instability and uncertainty caused by the Conservative party leadership contest has real world consequences. The commitment of both contenders to a no-deal Brexit makes it even more important the government put an end to playing games with people\u2019s livelihoods and call a general election now. Back in the foreign affairs committee Ivan Rogers says that, structurally, the way the Brexit department was operating was \u201cbound to be a mess\u201d because Olly Robbins, when he was its permanent secretary, was reporting both to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who had a particular stance on Brexit, and to the prime minister, in his capacity as her adviser. That caused a tension because the Davis\u2019s priorities and the PM\u2019s were not always the same, he says. And this is from Sky\u2019s Stephen Murphy. @Paschald is Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister. Turning away from the foreign affairs committee hearing for a moment, Sky\u2019s Sam Coates is reporting that Boris Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October under plans being considered by his campaign. Rogers says before he left the civil service he thought the Irish issue was being underplayed. He says he recalls telling Theresa May that she had made three commitments on Northern Ireland that were not compatible. She had told the Irish that there would be no hard border, she had told the DUP that there would be no divergence between Britain and Northern Ireland, and she had told the right of her party that that UK would leave the customs union. He says he told her that she could only have two of those three. He says the same to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, he says. Ivan Rogers says he told May her three Brexit priorities for Northern Ireland were incompatible with each other. Rogers is describing what John Springford from the Centre for European Reform called May\u2019s Irish trilemma. https://www.cer.eu/insights/theresa-mays-irish-trilemma Rogers says Theresa May had huge experience of justice and home affairs when she became PM. But she did not have experience of the economic side of the EU. In justice and home affairs the UK had a lot of opt-outs. But in relation to the single market, opt-outs weren\u2019t available, he says. He says the UK had to choose between a range of options. He says this was not a popular message to give to the PM. Rogers says, if Theresa May has played hardball in the final three months of 2016, he does not know if the EU would have agreed to open negotiations before the UK triggered article 50. But when the UK did trigger article 50 at the end of March 2017, the EU was celebrating, he says. Q: Do you think you should have seen the PM\u2019s red lines speech in advance? Rogers says he was \u201csurprised\u201d not to have read it. He says he was ever more surprised that Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, had not read it. He says the speech took EU leaders by surprise. He says he spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Donald Tusk, the European council president, afterwards. He says Juncker told him three times. Juncker said it led to only one conclusion. Q: Which was? That the UK was going much further out of the EU than Juncker had expected, says Rogers. He says perhaps EU leaders should not have been surprised. At that point some EU leaders assumed a new PM would try to keep the UK in the EU. Rogers says he told them that would not be happening. Rogers says he was told by Olly Robbins, the PM\u2019s Brexit adviser, that Theresa May was going to announce a date for triggering article 50 in her speech to the Conservative party conference in the autumn of 2016. Rogers says he said it would be a bad idea, but he recognised that it was probably too late to influence the process. He says his argument was that, by announcing a date, the UK would lose negotiating leverage. Olly rang me up to say, \u2018She\u2019s going to announce the date set for triggering article 50 tomorrow. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea. What do you think?\u2019 I said no I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good idea because you lose a lot of leverage the moment you do that. But presumably if they are telling you that they are going to announce it, we\u2019re fighting a losing battle but I think it\u2019s worth fighting just to at least register that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very wise because that\u2019s exactly what the opposition wants you to do. Rogers says he was not shown in advance the May speech setting red lines for Brexit. It was a party conference speech. He would not expect to see it in advance, he says. Tugendhat asks about a memo from Rogers that was leaked in 2016 saying trade talks with the EU could take up to 10 years and still fail. Rogers says he wrote these memos to try to explain what would happen. He says they were long intentionally. He says David Cameron told him that he read Rogers\u2019 memos on the plane as he was on his way to EU meetings. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the committee, is asking the question. Q: Did the Foreign Office set guidelines for what the future relationship with the EU should be? Rogers says by this time he had left the civil service. But he does not think the Foreign Office was centrally involved. Turning away from the foreign affairs committee hearing for a moment, the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman has posted Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reply to the letter he received from Labour peers yesterday. Rogers says he recalls telling Sir Jeremy Heywood, the then cabinet secretary, that if the UK voted to leave the EU, Brexit would dominate Whitehall for a decade. Two successive parliaments would be dominated by the need to pass Brexit legislation, Rogers says he recalls saying. Rogers says the UK has been \u201cdemonstrably on a different track\u201d from the rest of the EU for much of its membership. Rogers says when he left the civil service in 2006 to work in the private sector he told people the issue for the future was not whether or not the UK would join the euro, but whether or not it would leave the EU. The Brexit crisis has been coming for a very long time, he says. Rogers says he warned about the possibility of Brexit some time before the 2016 referendum. After the 2015 civil servants considered the case for Brexit planning, he said. They might have looked at the models of Brexit available to ministers. But ministers did not want the work done, he says. And he says it was not for the cabinet secretary to go ahead and order that work if ministers were not in favour. He says the leave campaign avoided having a plan in the campaign, because having a plan would have made it harder to keep the leave coalition together. But Rogers says he had read all the plans for Brexit that were around. He says he probably knew more about the options than anyone else. Q: Did any civil servants object to the lack of planning? Rogers says he does not think there is a record of any objections. But he says he recalls Nick Clegg, in the coalition government, objecting to the idea of the work being done. Rogers says he thinks Clegg would have objected to anything that might have made Brexit look more credible. Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, is giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about relations with the EU. Rogers has been one of the most outspoken and perceptive critics of the government\u2019s Brexit policy since he resigned in January 2017. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for refusing to accept that President Trump\u2019s tweets about how four non-white congresswomen should go back their own countries was racist. (See 9.45am.) Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Brexit plan to axe the Irish border backstop from the withdrawal agreement will be rejected outright by the European Union, EU sources have said. Former cabinet ministers could be among those who feel they have no choice but to vote down a Boris Johnson administration in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Dominic Grieve has said. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has praised Boris Johnson as a \u201cpassionately green Tory\u201d. Speaking in Kew Gardens, where he was giving a speech, he gave a warm endorsement to the runaway favourite in the Tory leadership contest who three years ago he declared unfit to be prime minister. Gove, who has not said whether he will be voting for Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, said: I know Boris has been passionate about the environment for decades. When I first met Boris Johnson he described himself to me without prompting as a passionately green Tory and in every role he has had he has championed the environment. As foreign secretary he\u2019s been a powerful and persuasive voice on safeguarding wildlife from exploitation, further protecting our oceans and fighting climate change. I know they both would be great prime ministers and I want to affirm today that we can trust them both to do the right thing on every critical issue facing us and of course most critically on the environment. Gove also said he expected the next PM to include an environment bill in the next Queen\u2019s Speech. He said: Later this year we plan to integrate and elevate our new environmental ambitions into law. It will be the new prime minister who will have the ultimate decision on the content of the environment bill. But the party has collectively agreed it will be the flagship measure of the next Queen\u2019s speech. I\u2019m greatly encouraged that both candidates to be our next prime minister have made clear they will not dilute our environmental ambitions, indeed they would seek to raise them. The lobbying firm co-run by the man heading Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign has been writing to councils on behalf of a tobacco company before the announcement of planned new anti-smoking measures due in the coming weeks. Scotland\u2019s drug-related death toll has increased by 27% over the past year to reach a record high of 1,187, putting the country on a par in terms of the fatality rate per capita with the United States, where synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have devastated drug-using populations. Ursula von der Leyen has championed gender equality in her appeal to MEPs to back her as the first female president of the European commission, telling the European parliament: \u201cWe represent half of our population. We want our fair share.\u201d The rightwing philosopher Sir Roger Scruton has received an apology from the government minister who sacked him over comments in a magazine interview. As the Press Association reports, Scruton was dismissed from his role as a housing adviser in April but James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said he regretted the way the decision was made. Brokenshire is also expected to meet Scruton in the coming days to see what role he would be prepared to play on the building design agenda in future. In a letter published in the Spectator, Brokenshire apologised for sacking Scruton from his role in the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. As you know, I regret that the decision to remove you from your leadership role within the commission was taken in the way that it was. I am sorry - especially as it was based on a clearly partial report of your thoughts ... If you would be willing, I would like to invite you to meet to discuss [the commission\u2019s] and what part you might be prepared to play in advancing this important agenda which we both care about so much. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cThe communities secretary has expressed regret over the circumstances of [Scruton\u2019s] dismissal. I believe that they are meeting in the coming days to have a discussion.\u201d Oversight of Britain\u2019s railways should be in the hands of one individual or body which is independent of government, according to the head of a major review. As the Press Association reports, former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams, who is leading the government-commissioned Rail Review, said the appointment of a \u201cFat Controller\u201d type figure would be \u201ckey for regaining public trust\u201d. Williams told the BBC the influence of the Department for Transport (DfT) should be restricted to budgets and overall policy rather than day-to-day operations. He added: \u201cSomeone needs to be accountable to the public.\u201d This suggests the possible return of a body similar to the Strategic Rail Authority, which existed from 2001 to 2005 and was tasked with raising standards through the awarding of franchises. There is a real end-of-term feeling in the Commons at the moment. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gave Philip Hammond, the chancellor, what was effectively a leaving present in Treasury questions recently - a book of radical walks. Today Greg Clark, the business secretary, gave a model car to his Labour counterpart, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Clark handed over the gift after speaking about changes to the UK automotive industry and new electric vehicle projects. Hammond and Clark are both expected to be sacked next week, largely because they are both firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest, insist no-deal must remain an option, and their comments about the backstop last night have made it even more probable. The Labour MP Sarah Champion has told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live (not to be confused with the original) that if necessary she would accept no-deal and that she cannot be sure how she would vote on a no confidence motion, the BBC\u2019s Andrew Alexander reports. UPDATE: Here are the clips. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who is covering Michael Gove\u2019s speech this morning. And these are from the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan. From Bloomberg The pound has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar in over two years, after Boris Johnson raised fears of a no-deal Brexit with his comments about the Northern Ireland backstop last night (see 9.19am), my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. He has more on his business live blog. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has put out research showing that, if the pound were to fall to parity with the dollar in the event of a no-deal Brexit (a standard assumption, although of course no one can predict for certain what would happen), the cost of an average British holiday would rise by \u00a3225. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, has described the decision by both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to rule out a Brexit deal involving the backstop as \u201ca very, very dangerous step\u201d, PoliticsHome reports. Hoare told Sky News that he hoped whoever won the leadership contest would reconsider once it was over. He said allowing a hard border to return in Ireland was \u201cbeyond contemplation\u201d. This is from the Tory Brexiter Steve Baker, who has expressed his opposition to President Trump\u2019s go back home tweets by celebrating a pro-immigration speech given by Ronald Reagan. If you have a few minutes, the speech is well worth watching. It\u2019s compelling. How will the Brexit crisis get resolved? The People\u2019s Vote campaign has published a report (pdf) this morning looking at six possible outcomes, all of which it describes as dead ends. The other two it lists are a no-deal Brexit, which it describes as the cliff edge, and a second referendum, which is presents as the solution. Speaking at the launch Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, said that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision last night to rule out any deal including a Northern Ireland backstop meant the Brexit options were being radicalised. Grieve explained: When challenged and confronted [Johnson] radicalised even further and excluded any possibility of trying to negotiate some way out of the backstop at all. It had to go in its totality. The consequence of that is make it the choices starker and starker. It makes them starker for me as well, let\u2019s be absolutely clear about this. I\u2019ve always been willing as a politician to listen to people willing to come up with credible compromises but what I\u2019ve found so staggering about the Conservative leadership [contest] is it has been played to a tune of growing extremism. In a statement issued in the People\u2019s Vote\u2019s press notice, Grieve also said that an electoral alliance with the Brexit party would mark \u201cthe end of the Conservative party as we know it\u201d. He said: Some talk about an alliance in such an election with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party as if it could deliver a landslide but, even if that was the case, it would not be for a party that Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher or Major would recognise. It would be a victory for a virulent form of populism that is a threat to our most cherished values and our democracy. It would be the end of the Conservative party as we know it. The far-right group Britain First has been fined \u00a344,200 by the Electoral Commission for failing to comply with financial rules. As the Press Association reports, Britain First was fined by the watchdog for multiple offences committed while it was a registered political party in the period up to November 2017. Although it has since de-registered, Britain First remains responsible for its actions during that period, the commission said. David Henig, the trade specialist and former civil servant who now runs the UK Trade Policy Project, has posted a good thread on Twitter about the Brexit stance of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. It starts here. Tonight MEPs will vote on whether or not to approve Ursula von der Leyen as the new president of the European commission. In her speech at the start of the debate, Von der Leyen restated her willingness to agree to another article 50 extension provided the UK supplies \u201ca good reason\u201d. She said: We cannot talk about Europe without talking about our friends from the UK. For the very first time, in 2016 a member state decided to leave the EU. This is a serious decision, we regret it but we respect it. Since then, together with the current government of the UK, the EU has worked hard to organise the orderly departure of the UK. Von der Leyen said the withdrawal agreement \u201cprovides certainty where Brexit created uncertainty\u201d. She went on: However, I stand ready for a further extension of the withdrawal date should more time be required for a good reason. Speaking in the debate, the Brexit party leader and MEP Nigel Farage said the European parliament had been \u201chumbled and humiliated\u201d by the process which led to Von der Leyen being nominated by the European council instead of the candidates backed by the political groups in the parliament. Claiming that she was a \u201cfanatic for building a European army\u201d, he went on: In some ways I\u2019m really rather pleased, because you have just made Brexit a lot more popular in the UK, thank God we are leaving. Von der Leyen hit back saying it was important to continue to work with the British \u201cbut I think, Mr Farage, we can probably do without what you have got to say here\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cnot cut out\u201d to be Labour leader, the Labour peer Toby Harris told the Today programme this morning. Harris, who chairs the Labour peers group, was speaking about the offer by Labour peers to help Corbyn address the antisemitism problem facing the party. Corbyn himself had \u201chuge responsibility\u201d for this, Harris said. He explained: There\u2019s no question that in any organisation the moral tone that it sets, the style that it operates in is set from the top \u2013 that\u2019s what leadership is all about. So obviously Jeremy Corbyn has got a huge responsibility in this. He could have reined back some of his more idiotic supporters and stopped them doing some of the things they are doing \u2013 the intimidation of members, the extraordinary discriminatory remark; he could have reined back the people in his office who have been apparently interfering in cases of discipline within the party. The concern that I have \u2013 and I have known Jeremy Corbyn for 47 years \u2013 is that he is not cut out to be a party leader. He is a brilliant campaigner and yet I suspect the details, the managerial responsibilities, the day-to-day management of the way in which the party operates are not necessarily his skills. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised the two Tory leadership candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, for their refusal to describe President Trump\u2019s go back home tweets to four congresswomen as racist in the Sun/talkRadio debate last night. Here is our story about what Johnson and Hunt did say about Trump. Unemployment fell by 51,000 to 1.29m in the three months to May, the Office for National Statistics has said. And average earnings increased by 3.4% compared with 3.2% in the previous month. At the Sun/talkRadio Tory leadership debate last night, both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt declared that the Northern Ireland backstop was \u201cdead\u201d and that, even if the EU were to agree to put a time limit on how long it would last, it would still be unacceptable. This is a significant development that means the next Tory leader will go into talks with the EU tied to a position more extreme than what was being advocated by hardish Brexiters only about six months ago (eg Dominic Raab, who would have stayed in cabinet if the backstop had been time-limited). In a blog responding to the debate, ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston said EU leaders would see this as the moment when \u201cthe Tory party became the no-deal party\u201d. This morning Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs doing most to find a way of allowing parliament to block no-deal, said the next Tory leader (almost certainly Johnson) would bring down his government if he tried to push for no-deal. Speaking on the Today programme, he also said the policy shift announced last night was \u201csignificant\u201d. Here are the main points. Grieve warned that Johnson would bring down his own government if he tried to implement a no-deal Brexit. He said: As I\u2019ve said on many occasions in the house over the last 12 months, if a government persists in trying to carry out a no-deal Brexit, I think that administration is going to fall. Grieve said the appointment of a new cabinet, with ministers opposed to no-deal almost certainly being demoted to the back benches, would increase the number of Tory MPs willing to vote against no-deal. This could \u201cmake a difference\u201d to voting numbers in the Commons, he said. I think that by the end of next week there are going to be more Conservatives who have indicated very clearly that no-deal is unacceptable and many of them will no longer be on the front bench. There were many MPs who thought a no-deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Britain, he said. He said that blocking a no-deal Brexit \u201ctechnically ... may be quite difficult\u201d for the Commons. That was why an attempt to go for no-deal could lead to a no confidence motion instead, he argued. He said MPs were increasingly realising that a second referendum might be the best solution. Grieve himself backs a second referendum. He told the programme: Quite a lot of my colleagues know at the end of the day that it\u2019s going to be a choice between a referendum or a general election, and a general election moreover which may well not deliver any conclusive outcome and help us out of the crisis. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Conservative MP Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Margaret Beckett speak at the launch of a People\u2019s Vote report looking at possible Brexit outcomes. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs her penultimate cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 10am: Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, and Robert Buckland, the justice minister, give evidence to the Commons justice committee. 11.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives a speech on global warming. 2.45am: Sir Ivan Rogers, the former ambassador to the EU, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about Brexit and about the leaking of classified information. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish at about 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Brexit plan to axe the Irish border backstop from the withdrawal agreement will be rejected outright by the European Union, EU sources have said. Informed sources say it is doomed to failure and if the next prime minister goes to Brussels with such a proposal, he will be told in \u201cno uncertain terms\u201d that it amounts to a declaration of no deal. Brussels had already rebuffed such a plan when the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who is part of Johnson\u2019s campaign, met the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week. In what was seen as \u201cspinning for a Boris plan\u201d, Barclay told Barnier five times during the meeting that the backstop was dead. Sources say he told Barnier they wanted a series of mini-deals and alternative arrangements for the Irish border. He was told that was Brexit fantasy and a non-starter, and that the \u201cmini-deals\u201d outlined in EU contingency plans were temporary and covered only the \u201cbare bones\u201d such as aviation, mobile phone roaming and haulier driving licences. They did not include the major issues such as trade or the Irish border. The EU is watching developments in the UK very closely and has already prepared responses on a range of possibilities including a call for the EU to endorse the so-called \u201cBrady amendment\u201d, which was passed in the House of Commons in January.

This will also be rejected. Johnson and Hunt have declared the Northern Ireland backstop \u201cdead\u201d and promised to throw it out of any deal they negotiate with the EU, in comments that significantly harden their Brexit positions. While their words may be the source of alarm, the Irish fully expected this and see it as campaign spin. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said in a radio interview over the weekend that he would give whoever became prime minister \u201ca fair hearing\u201d but warned that the victor would be in for a \u201creality check\u201d when he got the keys to Downing Street. \u201cPoliticians when they are in campaign mode, and both of those men are in campaign mode, tend to campaign in poetry, in simple terms and high-level messages. \u201cWhen you get into office you have to govern in prose, and I imagine whoever is the new prime minister is going to face a very serious reality check when they sit down with their officials,\u201d he told Pat Kenny on Newstalk.

No-deal opponents could also try a number of other tactics leading to a no-confidence vote \u2013 without forcing a general election, but possibly with a new prime minister emerging.</p> \n<p>Rahman expects \u201cmanoeuvres to begin\u201d in September and the revolt \u2013 likely to be joined by several current cabinet and junior ministers \u2013 to peak as the UK gets closer to the 31 October cliff edge, most likely after the 17-18 October European summit. \u201cOne thing is clear: things are going to get very messy indeed,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CER_Grant/status/1150803671858462721\">Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform says</a> the EU will not blink on renegotiation. It could, however, offer a new political declaration on the future relationship, confirm it does not want the backstop to be permanent, and offer a longer transition \u2013 though none of those are sure to make a difference in Westminster.</p> \n<p>A further lengthy article 50 extension may well only be offered if the UK held an election or referendum, Grant says.

You can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Boris Johnson belatedly admitted to mishandling the leak of diplomatic cables that led to the resignation of Britain\u2019s ambassador to the US, but Tory voters still back him over Jeremy Hunt to become party leader and prime minister by almost two to one. With the apparent PM-in-waiting continuing to insist he will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, warnings about the impact of leaving without an agreement came thick and fast. The business secretary, Greg Clarke, said a no-deal Brexit would lead to the loss of \u201cmany thousands\u201d of jobs, the Bank of England warned it could trigger a \u201cmaterial shock\u201d to the UK economy, and the Revolution Foundation said Britain now faced its highest risk of a recession since the financial crisis. However the Commons speaker, John Bercow, did not select a key amendment designed to scupper attempts by a future government to force no deal by proroguing parliament, despite the backbench Tory MP Dominic Grieve declaring that suspension would mean \u201cthe end of parliamentary democracy\u201d in the UK. Not surprisingly, campaigners are beginning to seek other routes to stop parliament being shut down to facilitate no deal. The former Conservative prime minister, John Major, said he would seek a judicial review, while businesswoman Gina Miller warned she would launch immediate legal action. The government also faces a high court judicial review over an alleged \u201clarge-scale breach\u201d of the rights of EU citizens denied a vote in May\u2019s European elections. Meanwhile, the woman chosen by EU leaders to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u2013 to nobody\u2019s surprise - that she would not be reopening Brexit talks. Yet in their final debate, both Johnson and Hunt significantly hardened their Brexit positions, declaring the Northern Ireland backstop \u201cdead\u201d and promising that even if it was tweaked it could not feature in any exit deal with the EU. Something will have to give ... What next According to the usually well-informed analyst Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, the incoming government will do \u201ceverything it can\u201d to deny no-deal opponents parliamentary space, denying opposition day debates and trying to avoid no-deal legislation to prevent it being amended. At least two bills will, however, have to be rushed through before 31 October, on trade and financial services. No-deal opponents could also try a number of other tactics leading to a no-confidence vote \u2013 without forcing a general election, but possibly with a new prime minister emerging. Rahman expects \u201cmanoeuvres to begin\u201d in September and the revolt \u2013 likely to be joined by several current cabinet and junior ministers \u2013 to peak as the UK gets closer to the 31 October cliff edge, most likely after the 17-18 October European summit. \u201cOne thing is clear: things are going to get very messy indeed,\u201d he says. Meanwhile Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform says the EU will not blink on renegotiation. It could, however, offer a new political declaration on the future relationship, confirm it does not want the backstop to be permanent, and offer a longer transition \u2013 though none of those are sure to make a difference in Westminster. A further lengthy article 50 extension may well only be offered if the UK held an election or referendum, Grant says. And when talks on the future relationship finally start, the EU27 will be every bit as tough on coordinating the process, ensuring EU unity and keeping member states and MEPs on board as it was during phase one.
