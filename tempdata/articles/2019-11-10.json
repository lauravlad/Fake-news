Here is a summary of the main developments this afternoon:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have announced new policies for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. </strong>Labour promised them free education and retraining, more apprenticeships, better medical care and homes reserved for ex-armed forces personnel who have been sleeping rough.<strong> </strong>The Lib Dems proposed scrapping settlement fees for veterans born outside the UK, while the Tories pledged to make veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares. </li> <li><strong>The chancellor, Sajid Javid\u2019s claims that Labour has \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament have been derided as a fiction.</strong> The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto.</li> <li><strong>Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans,</strong> which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. </li> <li><strong>The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit</strong>, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public.</li> <li><strong>The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness.</strong> The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005.</li> <li> <strong>The Green party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, has said he believes it is set for its biggest vote ever, as despite movement on the climate crisis by other parties, it is still leading the way. </strong>\u201cThe size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc835568f08be4a102e67ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T16:18:00.029Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We know polls are notoriously unreliable and it\u2019s very early days in the election but I\u2019m going to chuck this in anyway, just for fun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElectCalculus/status/1193505955599835136\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UPDATED PREDICTION: Our latest poll-of-polls has the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Conservative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Conservative</a> lead over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Labour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Labour</a> steady at around 10pc.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today. Here is a summary of the main developments this afternoon: Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have announced new policies for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. Labour promised them free education and retraining, more apprenticeships, better medical care and homes reserved for ex-armed forces personnel who have been sleeping rough. The Lib Dems proposed scrapping settlement fees for veterans born outside the UK, while the Tories pledged to make veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares. The chancellor, Sajid Javid\u2019s claims that Labour has \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament have been derided as a fiction. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans, which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The Green party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, has said he believes it is set for its biggest vote ever, as despite movement on the climate crisis by other parties, it is still leading the way. \u201cThe size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal,\u201d he said. We know polls are notoriously unreliable and it\u2019s very early days in the election but I\u2019m going to chuck this in anyway, just for fun. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, has explained how the Tories arrived at the \u00a31.2tn, five-year figure they attributed to Labour\u2019s spending plans. As well as making the point that Labour has not yet released its manifesto and that the figure has deliberately been summed up for five years to make it look \u201cmore dramatic\u201d, he writes: The Conservatives\u2019 suggestion is that Labour\u2019s spending plans would push up the annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between government income and expenditure \u2013 and national debt. This would then lead to spending cuts or the levying of higher taxes to bring the public finances back under control. However, the analysis appears to take little account of any benefits the higher spending could deliver for the public purse or public wellbeing. After a decade of austerity there has been growing public clamour for higher spending on services. Although nationalisation could come with a hefty price tag it would mean taking control of profit-generating assets. Labour has said this would mean the policy effectively paying for itself over time. Javid also promised to significantly raise spending and borrowing levels. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said both Labour and the Tories would lift state spending to 1970s levels. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Britain\u2019s oldest independent economics research organisation, Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could cost the UK economy as much as \u00a370bn over the next 10 years. My colleague, Heather Stewart, has written a story about Labour\u2019s response to the Tory accusation, carried on the front page of many Sunday papers, that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn. Labour\u2019s election coordinator, Andrew Gwynne, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: Look, this is an absolute work of fiction by the Conservatives. You can\u2019t trust a word that [Boris] Johnson and his ministers say on this issue. We will have a fully costed manifesto in due course when we launch that. And you know, the challenge is actually for the Conservatives to fully cost their own manifesto, something they didn\u2019t do in 2017. Here are details of the package of measures Labour is pledging for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. With the climate emergency moving up the political agenda \u2013 although not high enough for many \u2013 does the Green party face a battle to persuade people it is the only party tackling the crisis? Both Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP, and its co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, have insisted that when it comes to the most meaningful response, the Greens still lead the way. Bartley said he believes his party will secure the biggest Green vote ever in the upcoming general election. Speaking to BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics (quotes from PA Media), Bartley said: I think at this election we\u2019re seeing climate change right up there at the top of the agenda. We think we\u2019re going to see the biggest Green vote ever. Discussing the other major parties\u2019 climate policies, he added: The size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal. We know that we\u2019re going to have to make this investment and we\u2019re going to have to make it quickly. And the more quickly we make it, the more we\u2019re going to save in the long run. Earlier, Lucas said people should vote Green because the party is leading the way and others are following. It will hold the other parties\u2019 \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d on the issue, she told Andrew Marr. Parties have announced policies to assist armed forces veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for veterans who were born outside the UK, the Tories are making veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares, while Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has accused Labour of \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament, although the Tories\u2019 analysis was debunked by the opposition and commentators. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. With it being Remembrance Sunday, political leaders have joined those at the Cenotaph paying tribute to tribute to those killed in past conflicts. The parties have also announced policies to help veterans. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for armed forces veterans who were born outside the UK. The Tories have said veterans will be eligible for a railcard giving them a third off the cost of train travel. Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness, his family said. From PA Media: Lord Mawhinney, who served as Tory party chairman from 1995 to 1997 under Sir John Major\u2019s government, died on Saturday evening. In a statement, his family said: \u201cHis death brings an end to a life dedicated to public service and rooted in an unwavering Christian faith. \u201cHe was a much loved husband, father and grandfather and a friend to many. He will be much missed.\u201d He was elected MP for Peterborough in 1979 and later represented North West Cambridgeshire, retiring in 2005, and was a member of the cabinet from 1994 until 1997. During that time he served as minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. Lord Mawhinney also served as Football League chairman for seven years from 2003. During his time at the helm of the sporting body, he introduced the fit and proper persons test for prospective club directors and the publication of club spending on agents\u2019 fees. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has blamed the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d for the delay in publishing a report by the intelligence and security committee examining Russian influence in British politics. From PA Media: Chairman of the committee Dominic Grieve had previously accused the government of \u201csitting on the report\u201d and said it was sent to the PM for approval on 17 October. Speaking on BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics, Shapps said he was \u201cnot close\u201d to the report. When asked why it had not been published, he said: \u201cLet me just explain how these things work within government at this moment in time as you come up to an election. \u201cI wanted to publish some very trivial information, which was certainly not of any great, huge public interest, and I was blocked from doing so by the civil service machine because come an election you not allowed to, into purdah, publish things which are seen as controversial in any way. So I suspect it\u2019s just the machinery of government.\u201d He added: \u201cI just think as soon as you get to anything, as in the same way as spending plans and all the rest of it, they (civil service machine) will block almost any publishing come an election and I suspect that\u2019s all that\u2019s happened here, which is then being turned into \u2018oh well, there must be something here\u2019 when it\u2019s actually probably just the usual way that purdah, as it\u2019s called, works.\u201d Earlier, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said the report\u2019s publication had been \u201ctimed out because of the election\u201d. Amid much debate about spending, the Mirror\u2019s political editor says a TV debate between Sajid Javid and John McDonnell could be on the cards, although claims the chancellor may not be as keen as he\u2019s making out \u2026 Here is an analysis by BBC Reality Check on Sajid Javid\u2019s claims about Labour spending: The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was reluctant to be drawn on the Conservatives\u2019 spending plans this morning but had plenty to say about Labour\u2019s. My colleague, Peter Walker, has written up Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s interview on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, and the business minister\u2019s insistence Boris Johnson was correct in saying Northern Ireland businesses will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos from Andrew Marr\u2019s interviews with Andrew Gwynne, Caroline Lucas and Sajid Javid. You are borrowing more and spending more, Marr tells Javid. He quotes a past comment in which the chancellor stressed the importance of living within his means. The chancellor once again criticises Labour\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d spending plans. Will there be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party? There will be an inquiry in Islamophobia and it will start this year, says Javid boldly. But asked to clarify, he says it will be a general inquiry into prejudice. Why is the ISC report into Russian interference not being published? \u201cI think it\u2019s been timed out because of the election,\u201d the chancellor answers. Are you sure no Russian money is pulling the strings in this election? I am confident with respect to my own party, says Javid. And that concludes the interview. Marr asks Javid how the Tories are going to fund all their spending plans. The IFS says we\u2019re going to be spending more than we\u2019re bringing in by \u00a350bn under the Conservatives over the next few years. Javid says what comes in in taxes will match the day-to-day spending. We may borrow \u00a320bn to fund capital investments \u201cbut we can afford to do that\u201d. Marr suggests to the chancellor that higher taxes will be necessary. Javid disagrees. He claims the Tories will increase capital expenditure in a \u201ccontrolled manner\u201d unlike Labour \u2013 at which Marr admonishes him for once again trying to get the conversation on to Labour\u2019s plans. Marr asks about the failure of the government to publish the impact of its Brexit deal. We\u2019re talking about something like \u00a372bn in extra borrowing, suggests Marr. That\u2019s not the figure, says Javid. The Bank of England said there would be growth every year, the chancellor says. \u201cThese numbers that you set out I don\u2019t recognise.\u201d Marr challenges Javid for saying he doesn\u2019t recognise the numbers, while not producing his own. Javid utters a soundbite about getting Brexit done. Marr asks about Moody\u2019s downgrading the UK\u2019s credit outlook. Javid says the downgrade is because of the paralysis in parliament and the only way to end that is to return a Conservative majority in parliament. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is on Marr now. Marr suggests the \u00a31.2tn the Tories claim Labour will spend during the next parliament is \u201cbogus\u201d. \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Javid. Marr says you\u2019ve taken all Labour conference motions and assumed they will implement them straight away. Javid says every single costing has come from Labour\u2019s own figures, independent sources \u2026 or we have worked them out ourselves. You\u2019ve been very unfair, says Marr. This is the true cost of Corbyn\u2019s Labour, says Javid. He continues to stand by the analysis. Marr asks if the Tories will raise the threshold for National Insurance contributions. Javid says he\u2019s not going to set out manifesto commitments. Marr counters that this is something Boris Johnson has promised. Javid says he believes in low tax. Marr says you seem more familiar with Labour\u2019s manifesto than your own. What about inheritance tax? Javid again declines to comment on the Tory manifesto, taking the discussion back to the Labour manifesto. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is on Marr now. She\u2019s asked whether the Remain Alliance electoral pact, in 60 seats, can make a difference. She says that it can given that it we are probably heading for a hung parliament. They wanted Labour to be included she says but it was not possible. Marr asks about the \u00a3100bn a year the Greens have committed to \u201cgreening the economy\u201d and the economic impact. Lucas says that would make the UK a net-zero economy by 2030. The government target of 2050 is not good enough. She says it will pay for itself as it will generate jobs and cut health costs. Marr asks Lucas when she last flew. She says she flies as her son lives in the United States. She says \u201csystems change\u201d is important, we shouldn\u2019t focus on individual\u2019s actions and \u2018sitting in judgement on each other\u201d. Does there need to be an end to factory farming? Yes, says Lucas, stressing there needs to be a shift away from industrialised agriculture towards more eco-friendly practices. Marr suggests it is a problem for Greens that other parties, particularly Labour, are moving in the same direction on the climate emergency. Lucas says that voters should realise why they are moving in that direction - because of the Greens who will continue to hold their feet to the fire. She also says that last week there was someone on the show claiming that regional airport expansion is consistent with curbing the climate crisis. Moving swiftly onto BBC One, where Andrew Marr is interviewing the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne. He is asked about how Labour would get its Brexit deal through the party and the Commons. Gwynne says there has to be compromise, which there hasn\u2019t been so far. He says the way to do it is to let the people decide (through a second referendum). It will be the people, not the politicians that decide. We are the only party offering that. Marr asks whether comments by Jeremy Corbyn last week amounted to preserving free movement. Gwynne says there will be \u201cbespoke arrangements\u201d and refers to \u201creciprocal agreements\u201d with the EU that will allow both British and EU citizens to continue to enjoy benefits such as participation in the Erasmus scheme. Marr asks whether the Labour manifesto will say that freedom of movement will end after Brexit, as it said in 2017. Gwynne tells Marr to ask him next week when the manifesto is published. The Lib Dems\u2019 Home Affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, is being quizzed by Sophy Ridge now. Jardine is asked about the Remain Alliance electoral pact in 60 seats. Is that a kick in the teeth for voters? You\u2019re saying Brexit trumps everything? Jardine says Brexit does trump everything. \u201cIt\u2019s sucking the lifeblood out of everything in this country\u201d. Only then can other issues be tackled, she says. Jardine is asked about whether the Lib Dems are just trying to hang on to existing seats in Scotland. She answers in the negative and says the important distinction between the Lib Dems and the SNP (both remain parties) is that the Lib Dems are against the uncertainty that another independence referendum would bring. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos of Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford and Nia Griffith on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. The last question put to Griffith by Ridge is why can\u2019t Labour shake off the antisemitism allegations? Griffith says: \u201cWe do need to make sure we stamp this out in the party.\u201d She says Labour is making sure it takes action and investigates. The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, is on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, back over on Sky. Ridge shows her polling that shows, in ex-industrial towns, Labour was well ahead in 2017 but is now trailing the Tories. She says the polling also shows the only areas where Labour is ahead is core cities. Griffith says: \u201cThis is a snapshot now.\u201d She believes there will be a change in polls over the next couple of weeks. Griffith is asked about the Tory claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK \u00a31.2tn over five years. These figures have come from \u201cabsolutely nowhere\u201d, says Griffith. She says when the Labour manifesto is published it will be fully costed, as it was in 2017. Griffith claims the Tories are trying to detract from the Labour manifesto, which will be far more exciting than the Conservatives. Ridge asks, on Remembrance Sunday, whether Labour would ever intervene in foreign conflicts. Griffith replies: There are going to be cases where we are not going to be able to walk by on the other side. She refers to humanitarian crises in the past such as in the Balkans and Rwanda. Ridge asks whether a Labour government would ever be prepared to use a nuclear deterrent. Griffith says the whole point of a deterrent is that you don\u2019t reveal what you would or wouldn\u2019t do. There must be \u201cthat element of doubt in your opponent\u2019s mind\u201d. Over to the BBC One for the Andrew Marr show now: Here\u2019s a clip of Kwasi Kwarteng on Sky News: Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in the House of Commons, was on after Kwarteng. Ridge asked what would be the red lines for the SNP in a hung parliament, when negotiating with other parties.. Blackford said austerity was important. Asked about Trident, he said the SNP had consistently opposed nuclear weapons but did not say it was a red line (as Nicola Sturgeon said in 2015). Climate change was also an important issue, said Blackford. Ridge shows Kwarteng Sky polling saying only 30% of voters think the Tories will spend more on public services. Their message that they are ending austerity is not getting through, she suggests. He responds by saying that Brexit is the central issue \u201cand then we can have a debate about spending\u201d. Ridge asks whether businesses in Northern Ireland will have to fill in forms after Brexit. Boris Johnson said no forms will be necessary but the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said forms would be required in terms of trade from Northern Ireland to GB. Kwarteng says the PM is right but declines to say Barclay is wrong. Next Ridge asks about the abandoned pledge for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Kwarteng says the government has a good record of tackling discrimination. He refers to Sajid Javid being in the cabinet. Asked about Lady Warsi\u2019s criticism of Matt Hancock for \u201cwhitesplaining\u201d, Karteng gives a general answer about all discrimination being unacceptable. Ridge asks Kwarteng about Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin, who is estimated to have killed 1 million people. Kwarteng defends the comparison as appropriate. He says \u201cthe philosophy, the underlying thinking\u201d is similar but there is no suggestion that Corbyn will line people up against a wall and kill anybody. Ridge asks how the Conservatives have gone through Labour\u2019s figures but not come up with their own. Kwarteng says opposition parties can \u201cpromise the earth\u201d without any analysis. Asked again about the figure for the Conservatives, he says: I\u2019m not going to bandy around figures. Ridge tells Kwarteng that\u2019s exactly what the Tories are doing with respect to Labour. Kwasi Karteng is asked by Sophy Ridge if the \u00a31.2tn figure (see previous update) is \u201cproject fear\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d, given Labour hasn\u2019t published its manifesto. The business minister says \u201cthey\u2019ve spoken about the four-day week\u201d as part of his justification. He says Labour\u2019s policies \u201cdon\u2019t add up\u201d. Ridge points out that not everything passed at conference becomes a policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that they are reckless in their spending,\u201d says Kwarteng. Ridge asks what the Tories\u2019s spending commitments will cost. Kwarteng says \u00a3150bn on infrastructure but won\u2019t give an answer to the overall figure. All he will say is that it is nowhere near Labour\u2019s figure. Good morning, welcome to Politics Live. It\u2019s a Sunday and it\u2019s just over a month until the general election so leading figures from the different parties will be desperately trying to make their case on the politics talk shows this morning. I\u2019ll be bringing you the action and keeping you updated all all the developments. If you want to get in touch/bring something to my attention your best bet is to tweet me @Haroon_Siddique. The Observer leads with the story that the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has delayed its announcement on whether Boris Johnson should face an investigation into possible criminal misconduct over allegations about a conflict of interest in his dealings while mayor of London with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri until after the election. It says: The decision prompted fury from Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared that a ruling had been \u201csuppressed\u201d in order to protect Johnson from potentially damaging headlines at a crucial stage of the election campaign. The IOPC has denied the allegation that it has delayed the announcement claiming no decision has been made. First up out of the politics shows is Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News and she will be joined by the business minister Kwasi Kwarteng. He will no doubt want to put the emphasis on the Tories\u2019 claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK more than \u00a31tn over five years. The Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday all loyally splashed on the story. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rubbished the dossier, which assumes all policies passed at the Labour conference are firm commitments.",

      "body": "<p>Brian Mawhinney, Lord Mawhinney, was the first Ulsterman to join the cabinet in 59 years when he became transport secretary in 1994. Like many transport ministers, Mawhinney, who has died aged 79, lasted barely a year in the post.</p> <p>He inherited rail privatisation and moved Railtrack into the private sector more quickly than planned. He worked to build bridges with the environmental lobby and tried to stimulate a debate on the balance in transport policy between road and rail. He was intellectually demanding of \u2013 and sometimes sharp with \u2013 officials; his departure was met with some relief in the department.</p> <p>In July 1995, following his re-election as party leader by Conservative MPs, the beleaguered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-major\" title=\"\">John Major</a> appointed Mawhinney as party chairman. With less than two years of the parliament to run, his tasks were to restore morale, raise money and prepare the ground for a general election campaign. He was a tough operator \u2013 a quality Major thought was required given the dire political position \u2013 and was a dogged rather than a persuasive media spokesman for the party. And with the Conservatives divided and Labour under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> riding high, he had a poor hand. But he was close and loyal to Major; the two men and their wives often dined together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/brian-mawhinney-former-tory-cabinet-minister-dies-aged-79\">Brian Mawhinney, former Tory cabinet minister, dies aged 79</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 1997 general election campaign was a Tory disaster; the party was bitterly divided over Europe and the result was its worst in modern times. At the end of each campaign day he often brought bad news to Major, whose aides thought, unfairly, that Mawhinney was too eager to share problems with the leader, rather than lifting his spirits.</p> <p>Mawhinney saw his job as chairman as delivering what Major wanted \u2013 rather than be a strong, independent-minded operator doing things his way \u2013 and that is why he informed Major of the whole picture. When Major left No 10 for the last time, he had Mawhinney at his side. There remained little for him in politics after Blair brought Labour to power. But in 2003 Mawhinney\u2019s career took a turn when he began a seven-year spell as chairman of the Football League.</p> <p>For one who had a reputation as a political bruiser, he showed diplomatic skills in the post. He helped to reform the league\u2019s structure, introduced English football\u2019s first \u201cfit-and-proper person\u201d test for club ownership in 2004, and renamed the divisions as the Championship, League One and League Two. Although he tightened financial regulations and raised the issue of the potential for bankruptcy of clubs who spent recklessly, he failed to persuade clubs to agree to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/15/brian-mawhinney-football-league-salary-cap\" title=\"\">salary cap</a>. He resigned in 2010 at the age of 70.</p> <p>Born in Belfast, he was the son of Frederick Mawhinney, a restaurateur, and his wife, Coralie (nee Wilkinson), both devout members of the Church of Ireland. Brian attended the <a href=\"http://rbai.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Belfast Academical Institution</a> and graduated in physics from Queen\u2019s University in the city, having taken part in an exchange programme with the University of Michigan. He continued his studies at the Royal Free hospital, London, where his work on the effects of radiation on bone growth earned him a PhD. He took a lecturing post in the subject at the University of Iowa in 1968 and two years later returned to the Royal Free as a lecturer.</p> <p>Mawhinney stood and lost for the Conservatives in the safe Labour seat of Stockton-on-Tees in October 1974. The following year he was selected for Labour-held Peterborough, which he won in 1979. In the Commons he was one of the few MPs with a scientific background. Following boundary reorganisation in 1997 he sat for North West Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>Mawhinney joined the \u201cGuy Fawkes\u201d group of new 1979 Tory MPs. Largely non-Oxbridge, it was not as glamorous as the 1979 \u201cBlue Chip\u201d bunch. It was, Major said, a \u201cworkmanlike\u201d group. If Chris Patten and William Waldegrave were Blue Chips with high expectations and already prominent, Mawhinney had, significantly, Major as a Guy Fawkes colleague. Major had been elected for the neighbouring Huntingdonshire seat and later as prime minister gave cabinet posts to Mawhinney, John Gummer, Richard Ryder and Gillian Shephard, all members of what was known as the \u201cEast Anglia mafia\u201d.</p> <p>As a backbencher Mawhinney was interested in Northern Ireland and health, and was a member of Conservative committees on both. Although deeply religious, he was non-sectarian and kept his distance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/12/the-rev-ian-paisley\" title=\"\">the Rev Ian Paisley</a>. He supported integrated schooling and as a Northern Ireland junior minister introduced it in the province. He was a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship Group and the General Synod (for five years) and a lay preacher. An early autobiography, In the Firing Line (1999), was a serious exploration of his Christianity.</p> <p>He campaigned against smoking and took a dim view of easing licensing hours. In keeping with his belief in personal self-reliance, he argued that people whose lifestyles led to ill-health should pay for their medical treatment. His family background gave him conservative views on most social issues, including abortion and Sunday trading. After a few weeks as a new member, he introduced a private member\u2019s bill to limit the exposure of indecent posters outside cinemas and clubs.</p> <p>He was appointed under-secretary in the Northern Ireland Office in 1986 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>, and in 1990 Major promoted him to minister of state in the same department. Unionists attacked him for co-sponsoring the Anglo-Irish agreement, on the grounds that they had conceded too much. In 1992 he moved to the Department of Health to support Virginia Bottomley over the reorganisation (including closures) of London hospitals and market-oriented NHS reforms; he was Mr Nasty to her Mrs Nice.</p> <p>After his time at the Department for Transport, he remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio while party chairman. He was knighted in the 1997 dissolution honours list and was shadow home affairs spokesman under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\" title=\"\">William Hague</a>; many senior ex-ministers had refused to join the shadow cabinet. The downside was that he was a link with the now discredited past and returned to the backbenches after a year. He left the Commons in 2005, and was made a life peer.</p> <p>In 2013 he published another volume of autobiography, Just a Simple Belfast Boy.</p> <p>Mawhinney married Betty Oja, whom he met as a student in Michigan, in 1965. They had two sons, Andrew and Stephen, and a daughter, Alison.</p> <p>\u2022 Brian Stanley Mawhinney, Lord Mawhinney, politician, born 26 July 1940; died 9 November 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brian Mawhinney, Lord Mawhinney, was the first Ulsterman to join the cabinet in 59 years when he became transport secretary in 1994. Like many transport ministers, Mawhinney, who has died aged 79, lasted barely a year in the post. He inherited rail privatisation and moved Railtrack into the private sector more quickly than planned. He worked to build bridges with the environmental lobby and tried to stimulate a debate on the balance in transport policy between road and rail. He was intellectually demanding of \u2013 and sometimes sharp with \u2013 officials; his departure was met with some relief in the department. In July 1995, following his re-election as party leader by Conservative MPs, the beleaguered John Major appointed Mawhinney as party chairman. With less than two years of the parliament to run, his tasks were to restore morale, raise money and prepare the ground for a general election campaign. He was a tough operator \u2013 a quality Major thought was required given the dire political position \u2013 and was a dogged rather than a persuasive media spokesman for the party. And with the Conservatives divided and Labour under Tony Blair riding high, he had a poor hand. But he was close and loyal to Major; the two men and their wives often dined together. The 1997 general election campaign was a Tory disaster; the party was bitterly divided over Europe and the result was its worst in modern times. At the end of each campaign day he often brought bad news to Major, whose aides thought, unfairly, that Mawhinney was too eager to share problems with the leader, rather than lifting his spirits. Mawhinney saw his job as chairman as delivering what Major wanted \u2013 rather than be a strong, independent-minded operator doing things his way \u2013 and that is why he informed Major of the whole picture. When Major left No 10 for the last time, he had Mawhinney at his side. There remained little for him in politics after Blair brought Labour to power. But in 2003 Mawhinney\u2019s career took a turn when he began a seven-year spell as chairman of the Football League. For one who had a reputation as a political bruiser, he showed diplomatic skills in the post. He helped to reform the league\u2019s structure, introduced English football\u2019s first \u201cfit-and-proper person\u201d test for club ownership in 2004, and renamed the divisions as the Championship, League One and League Two. Although he tightened financial regulations and raised the issue of the potential for bankruptcy of clubs who spent recklessly, he failed to persuade clubs to agree to a salary cap. He resigned in 2010 at the age of 70. Born in Belfast, he was the son of Frederick Mawhinney, a restaurateur, and his wife, Coralie (nee Wilkinson), both devout members of the Church of Ireland. Brian attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and graduated in physics from Queen\u2019s University in the city, having taken part in an exchange programme with the University of Michigan. He continued his studies at the Royal Free hospital, London, where his work on the effects of radiation on bone growth earned him a PhD. He took a lecturing post in the subject at the University of Iowa in 1968 and two years later returned to the Royal Free as a lecturer. Mawhinney stood and lost for the Conservatives in the safe Labour seat of Stockton-on-Tees in October 1974. The following year he was selected for Labour-held Peterborough, which he won in 1979. In the Commons he was one of the few MPs with a scientific background. Following boundary reorganisation in 1997 he sat for North West Cambridgeshire. Mawhinney joined the \u201cGuy Fawkes\u201d group of new 1979 Tory MPs. Largely non-Oxbridge, it was not as glamorous as the 1979 \u201cBlue Chip\u201d bunch. It was, Major said, a \u201cworkmanlike\u201d group. If Chris Patten and William Waldegrave were Blue Chips with high expectations and already prominent, Mawhinney had, significantly, Major as a Guy Fawkes colleague. Major had been elected for the neighbouring Huntingdonshire seat and later as prime minister gave cabinet posts to Mawhinney, John Gummer, Richard Ryder and Gillian Shephard, all members of what was known as the \u201cEast Anglia mafia\u201d. As a backbencher Mawhinney was interested in Northern Ireland and health, and was a member of Conservative committees on both. Although deeply religious, he was non-sectarian and kept his distance from the Rev Ian Paisley. He supported integrated schooling and as a Northern Ireland junior minister introduced it in the province. He was a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship Group and the General Synod (for five years) and a lay preacher. An early autobiography, In the Firing Line (1999), was a serious exploration of his Christianity. He campaigned against smoking and took a dim view of easing licensing hours. In keeping with his belief in personal self-reliance, he argued that people whose lifestyles led to ill-health should pay for their medical treatment. His family background gave him conservative views on most social issues, including abortion and Sunday trading. After a few weeks as a new member, he introduced a private member\u2019s bill to limit the exposure of indecent posters outside cinemas and clubs. He was appointed under-secretary in the Northern Ireland Office in 1986 by Margaret Thatcher, and in 1990 Major promoted him to minister of state in the same department. Unionists attacked him for co-sponsoring the Anglo-Irish agreement, on the grounds that they had conceded too much. In 1992 he moved to the Department of Health to support Virginia Bottomley over the reorganisation (including closures) of London hospitals and market-oriented NHS reforms; he was Mr Nasty to her Mrs Nice. After his time at the Department for Transport, he remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio while party chairman. He was knighted in the 1997 dissolution honours list and was shadow home affairs spokesman under William Hague; many senior ex-ministers had refused to join the shadow cabinet. The downside was that he was a link with the now discredited past and returned to the backbenches after a year. He left the Commons in 2005, and was made a life peer. In 2013 he published another volume of autobiography, Just a Simple Belfast Boy. Mawhinney married Betty Oja, whom he met as a student in Michigan, in 1965. They had two sons, Andrew and Stephen, and a daughter, Alison. \u2022 Brian Stanley Mawhinney, Lord Mawhinney, politician, born 26 July 1940; died 9 November 2019",

Both parties have promised significant increases in public investment, funded by government borrowing. That marks a dramatic change in approach for the Conservatives since the departure of Javid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, who was chancellor until July but has now stepped down from parliament. Theresa May\u2019s party dismissed Labour\u2019s plans for increased borrowing two years ago and said the party was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d. Javid, however, said last week he would be prepared to contemplate borrowing up to 3% of GDP to invest in infrastructure and other projects.

After the Conservatives\u2019 disastrous campaign in 2017, Hammond complained that his party had not focused enough on the economy as an issue, contrasting a spendthrift Labour party with Tory fiscal rectitude.

      "body": "<p>Veteran journalists working in the pre-digital era were often required to phone in their stories to copy-takers who, after a couple of paragraphs, would often ask: \u201cIs there much more of this?\u201d</p> <p>The public could be forgiven for thinking and saying much the same after just a week of electioneering. Broadcast news and current affairs programmes are full of it. Newspaper front pages are devoted to it. Social media is humming with it. And there are still 31 days to go.</p> <p>How could it be otherwise? What is so fascinating this time around, quite apart from the obvious fact that so much hangs on the election\u2019s outcome, is the momentous and simultaneous change in both the political and the media landscapes. All the old certainties on both sides of the divide are over. Two-party parliamentary politics is long gone. National newsprint domination of the debate, if not entirely extinct, is on the endangered list.</p> <p>Although television still holds the central ground, viewing figures suggest it is gradually losing its audience appeal, especially among young voters. They prefer Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram.</p> <p>This double fragmentation, with multiparty politics trying to get messages across to the electorate through multiplatform media, is a particular challenge for mainstream journalists. Their response has been less than overwhelming. They appear to have learned nothing from detractors who complain about arrogance and partisan spin. Thousands of social media postings point to the supposed faults of the mainstream media, while people seem to revel in writing hostile below-the-line comments on newspaper websites. Do editors and reporters simply ignore them?</p> <p>Day after day, coverage in tabloids has been predictable and repetitive \u2013 self-serving, shrill and sometimes silly. A Sun headline on a story about a Labour frontbencher\u2019s exaggeration of the number of cancelled NHS operations, apart from being inexplicable, brought back memories of postwar Soviet paranoia: \u201cReds in op ed howler\u201d.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph, the paper shaped like a broadsheet but with a tabloid agenda, has been risibly propagandist on behalf of its columnist Boris Johnson. Readers\u2019 letters would suggest it retains their support despite its hysterical coverage. Then again, it is losing readers at a faster rate than its rivals.</p> <p>Papers and news broadcasters were soon engaged in that most favoured of election campaign games known as \u201cgaffe-hunting\u201d. Trust Jacob Rees-Mogg to be first out of the starting gate with a crassly insensitive remark about Grenfell. A wealthy Old Etonian, who dresses and talks as if he has time-travelled from the 18th century, is a gift both to journalists and to Labour.</p> <p>Several other instances of supposed blunders followed. By far the most interesting, for several reasons, was the \u201cdoctoring\u201d of a video of a Piers Morgan interview with Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer. Shared on social media, it suggested that Starmer was lost for words when asked about his party\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> <p>Despite a claim by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, that it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead people, it was roundly denounced by a senior colleague, the defence minister Johnny Mercer. Whether true or not, it indicated the Tories are putting great store by social media content.</p> <p>The incident also revealed concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook\u2019s policing of false content. Its UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/07/facebook-we-would-let-tories-run-doctored-starmer-video-as-ad\" title=\"\">maintained that the network would have allowed the Starmer video</a> to have been used as a paid-for advert on the specious grounds that it had stimulated a \u201cferocious political debate\u201d.</p> <p>That view was not shared by the editor of the Yorkshire Post, James Mitchinson, who was outraged by the posting of the edited clip, contending that it was a \u201cdangerous\u201d stunt. He argued that politicians could not demand respect while deceiving the public. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s damaging to your trust levels and demeaning to the electorate.\u201d</p> <p>And where did Mitchinson make his comments? On Twitter, of course. It has become the go-to communications platform for journalists, including most national newspaper and broadcasting political editors. After lobby briefings and discreet conversations with their sources, they race to be first to tweet the news.</p> <p>It has become a new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless. Great sport for journalists and those inside the Westminster bubble but, really, what\u2019s the point in the wider world? It is surely time for editors to curb their journalists\u2019 Twitter enthusiasm. They are simply seeking bragging rights: look what I know that you don\u2019t. This showing off is embarrassing and surely counter-productive because it undermines their status.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more obvious than at the BBC. Its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, is wearing out her fingers with incessant tweeting.</p> <p>All too often, the result of her tweets, along with those of her rivals, such as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and Sky News\u2019s Beth Rigby, is to generate stories tangential to the central news agenda.

      "bodyText": "Veteran journalists working in the pre-digital era were often required to phone in their stories to copy-takers who, after a couple of paragraphs, would often ask: \u201cIs there much more of this?\u201d The public could be forgiven for thinking and saying much the same after just a week of electioneering. Broadcast news and current affairs programmes are full of it. Newspaper front pages are devoted to it. Social media is humming with it. And there are still 31 days to go. How could it be otherwise? What is so fascinating this time around, quite apart from the obvious fact that so much hangs on the election\u2019s outcome, is the momentous and simultaneous change in both the political and the media landscapes. All the old certainties on both sides of the divide are over. Two-party parliamentary politics is long gone. National newsprint domination of the debate, if not entirely extinct, is on the endangered list. Although television still holds the central ground, viewing figures suggest it is gradually losing its audience appeal, especially among young voters. They prefer Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram. This double fragmentation, with multiparty politics trying to get messages across to the electorate through multiplatform media, is a particular challenge for mainstream journalists. Their response has been less than overwhelming. They appear to have learned nothing from detractors who complain about arrogance and partisan spin. Thousands of social media postings point to the supposed faults of the mainstream media, while people seem to revel in writing hostile below-the-line comments on newspaper websites. Do editors and reporters simply ignore them? Day after day, coverage in tabloids has been predictable and repetitive \u2013 self-serving, shrill and sometimes silly. A Sun headline on a story about a Labour frontbencher\u2019s exaggeration of the number of cancelled NHS operations, apart from being inexplicable, brought back memories of postwar Soviet paranoia: \u201cReds in op ed howler\u201d. The Daily Telegraph, the paper shaped like a broadsheet but with a tabloid agenda, has been risibly propagandist on behalf of its columnist Boris Johnson. Readers\u2019 letters would suggest it retains their support despite its hysterical coverage. Then again, it is losing readers at a faster rate than its rivals. Papers and news broadcasters were soon engaged in that most favoured of election campaign games known as \u201cgaffe-hunting\u201d. Trust Jacob Rees-Mogg to be first out of the starting gate with a crassly insensitive remark about Grenfell. A wealthy Old Etonian, who dresses and talks as if he has time-travelled from the 18th century, is a gift both to journalists and to Labour. Several other instances of supposed blunders followed. By far the most interesting, for several reasons, was the \u201cdoctoring\u201d of a video of a Piers Morgan interview with Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer. Shared on social media, it suggested that Starmer was lost for words when asked about his party\u2019s Brexit policy. Despite a claim by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, that it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead people, it was roundly denounced by a senior colleague, the defence minister Johnny Mercer. Whether true or not, it indicated the Tories are putting great store by social media content. The incident also revealed concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook\u2019s policing of false content. Its UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, maintained that the network would have allowed the Starmer video to have been used as a paid-for advert on the specious grounds that it had stimulated a \u201cferocious political debate\u201d. That view was not shared by the editor of the Yorkshire Post, James Mitchinson, who was outraged by the posting of the edited clip, contending that it was a \u201cdangerous\u201d stunt. He argued that politicians could not demand respect while deceiving the public. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s damaging to your trust levels and demeaning to the electorate.\u201d And where did Mitchinson make his comments? On Twitter, of course. It has become the go-to communications platform for journalists, including most national newspaper and broadcasting political editors. After lobby briefings and discreet conversations with their sources, they race to be first to tweet the news. It has become a new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless. Great sport for journalists and those inside the Westminster bubble but, really, what\u2019s the point in the wider world? It is surely time for editors to curb their journalists\u2019 Twitter enthusiasm. They are simply seeking bragging rights: look what I know that you don\u2019t. This showing off is embarrassing and surely counter-productive because it undermines their status. Nowhere is this more obvious than at the BBC. Its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, is wearing out her fingers with incessant tweeting. All too often, the result of her tweets, along with those of her rivals, such as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and Sky News\u2019s Beth Rigby, is to generate stories tangential to the central news agenda. In their haste to tweet they also fall into the trap of repeating briefings before they\u2019ve had the chance to feed them through their own journalistic filter. They overlook that famous journalistic dictum when dealing with politicians (and their special advisers): \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d Sometimes, they move into areas that call into question their commitment to impartiality. Last week, Rigby tweeted: \u201cIn a party where just one in five MPs are female, the roll call of talented women who\u2019ve just quit the Tories is alarming.\u201d She did preface her comment with the word \u201cViews\u201d, but she could face accusations of bias. She appears to have gone out on a limb that her competitors have wisely refused to follow. All, however, can be accused media narcissism. While impressing each other with their tweets, they do little to provide worthwhile information to the public. Finally, if you want to track a form of partisanship that becomes more and more evident by the day, count the number of times \u2013 on TV, on radio and in newspapers \u2013 the prime minister is referred to as Boris and his Labour rival as Jeremy.

But he argues that the current thefts and robberies are nothing compared with the \u201cheroin years\u201d of the 1970s and 1980s when drug disputes in Hortaleza were settled with knives and pistols. \u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been going on for quite a few years,\u201d he said. With the centre overwhelmed, some young people had taken to sleeping on the streets to avoid the conflicts and overcrowding, while others escaped by sniffing glue. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of care: lots of these kids are cold and hungry and have been on the streets for hours.\u201d After the economic crisis, and with the rise of Vox, Arag\u00f3n said, old xenophobic narratives had begun to resurface. And some agendas, he added, were better served by demonising people and focusing on problems rather than accepting responsibility.\u201cThere are people in this neighbourhood who are helping, by giving boxing lessons and organising football matches,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people doing all that but other people are interested in telling a different story. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is adolescent kids who are bored, alone and have no future. That normally means things are going to happen. It would be odd if they didn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month \u2013 in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise \u2013 the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p> <p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It\u2019s not only that he\u2019ll have to get the voice right (at his best \u2013 or worst, depending on your point of view \u2013 Bercow sounds like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g\" title=\"\">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that\u2019s the easy part (\u201cOrder, orr-duu-rrr!\u201d). It\u2019s the personality that\u2019s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he\u2019s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he\u2019s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I\u2019ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <p>When we meet in a Soho club, he has been a civilian \u2013 no longer the Speaker, and no longer the MP for Buckingham, the seat he has represented since 1997 \u2013 for three days. What is he feeling? Is it grief, or relief?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel grief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I say relief\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that, because it was the greatest privilege of my life. It probably sounds trite, but it\u2019s too early to know how I\u2019m going to feel. I had a structure, and now that structure is gone, and it is discombobulating. In 10 years [as Speaker], I missed Prime Minister\u2019s Questions twice, on both occasions to speak at funerals. The question arises: whither now?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7625fba08fdf4c054310726d985b04378276ec3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7625fba08fdf4c054310726d985b04378276ec3f/0_218_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In House of Commons, gold mace in foreground out of focus, Bercow stands with three others sitting around.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow on his final day as Speaker on 31 October.

Convention dictates that the Speaker head to the upper house on retirement, but there is talk that pesky Bercow will be denied this privilege (talk that emanated first from the camp of an increasingly furious Theresa May earlier this year).</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he says, with utmost graciousness, \u201cbut yes, I would accept, if it was offered to me. I want to write, consult, have fun, and do good. I want to ensure that I\u2019m solvent, and I would like to speak to a wide variety of audiences around the world. That would appeal. What I loathe and fear is dancing.\u201d So, no <em>Strictly</em>, then? Certainly not.</p> <p>What about the election? How is he going to vote? \u201cYou can ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d Oh, please tell me. \u201cNo.\u201d As I\u2019m sure he knows \u2013 he wears the smile of an assassin \u2013 this is still an answer of a kind: given that he was a Conservative MP only five<strong> </strong>minutes ago, one would assume that if his intention was to vote Tory, he\u2019d simply say so. But it\u2019s also odd, this being one of only two matters on which he will hold back (the other is the allegations of bullying made against him in 2018, which he will not discuss beyond saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never bullied anyone in my life\u201d). He certainly isn\u2019t convinced the Tories will win.</p> <p>\u201cThe polls are volatile. The Conservatives are somewhat ahead. But they need to be 10 points ahead to be confident of a majority.\u201d Either way \u2013 a Tory majority, or not \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the election will \u201csort\u201d the issue of Brexit. \u201cThis is just phase one. We\u2019ve yet to have the debate about the trade deal between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world. We\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years.\u201d Does this depress him? \u201cI don\u2019t easily get depressed but my personal view is that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t easily get depressed but I believe Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the past three years, Bercow has presided over the efforts of first Theresa May\u2019s government, and then that of Boris Johnson, to pass a bill on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU through the House of Commons. It wasn\u2019t work that he ever anticipated having to do. On the night of the referendum in June 2016, watching the television in his children\u2019s playroom at Speaker\u2019s House, he was as surprised as anyone by the result. \u201cA lot of us in the political class are too London-centric, and that must apply to me, too, because I thought most Brits would, in a pragmatic way, vote to remain.\u201d Once a new prime minister had been installed in No 10, however, his amazement only grew.</p> <p>\u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit would have a clear idea of what they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity. I would say that Brexiteers bear some share of the blame for the delay because they did not have an agreed approach to delivery. There are, for instance, prominent Brexiteers who very publicly stated that achieving a trade deal with the EU would be absolutely straightforward.\u201d Does he mean Liam Fox, the former secretary of state for international trade? Apparently, he does. \u201cQuite why he thought that, you\u2019d have to ask him. On average, a trade deal between two willing parties takes seven years to implement.\u201d</p> <p>The other problem was the attitude of Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she bears me any ill will. I don\u2019t bear her any. She was doing her best. But there was one major problem. The government pursued its approach as though it had an absolute right to parliamentary delivery \u2013 even when it was a minority government [after the 2017 election]. There is a respectable argument for saying that it was incumbent upon it to try and achieve a wider consensus; to reach out to other parties. But no serious effort was made to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c14559203ddfce9135eba54efeea4ea7e198417\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c14559203ddfce9135eba54efeea4ea7e198417/0_231_2928_3659/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bercow in morning suit walking holding hands with Sally, much taller than him, wearing fascinator.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow and his wife, Sally, at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout all this, Bercow was determined, as he had been ever since his election as Speaker in 2009, to protect the rights of the backbencher, ensuring that the executive could not force its will on the House. Some, however, saw his actions as unforgivably political, and slanted in favour of remain. In March, to the fury of many, he prevented May from bringing a third vote on her withdrawal agreement, quoting a convention that went back to 1604. In September, he allowed rebel MPs to take control of the Commons agenda to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he defends his impartiality in this period: \u201cThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that I was completely fair. I reject the charge that I was the agent of remainers.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s impartial <em>now</em>. Far from it. He sounds to me like someone who has won a famous victory: a triumphant partisan by any other name.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the prorogation of parliament last August. When he heard that this was what Boris Johnson was planning, he was in Turkey with his family. \u201cWithin an hour, I\u2019d issued a statement to say I thought it was a constitutional outrage. That annoyed some: they said it wasn\u2019t for me to pronounce. But if the Speaker doesn\u2019t speak up for parliament, it\u2019s hard to know who does.\u201d A few days later, though, the supreme court ruled that the prorogation was, indeed, illegitimate. \u201cAn 11-nil verdict!\u201d he says, like the Arsenal fan that he is. He looks at me steadily. \u201cDo you understand if I say that when people know you were wrong, they find it easier to forgive you? But that when they know you were right, they don\u2019t like it?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, did they come and apologise? No, they just attacked the court instead.\u201d</p> <p>Where does he think the impulse for this prorogation came from? \u201cI find it hard to penetrate the recesses of their fertile minds,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say they weren\u2019t seeking to stop debate, but it absolutely was not a normal prorogation.\u201d His voice begins to rise. \u201cIt was declared illegitimate. Ultra vires. Not <em>proper</em>. And, crucially, void. I repeat: void. Void. <em>Void</em>. Invalid. It didn\u2019t <em>happen</em>.\u201d By now, I\u2019m holding up a finger to indicate that, yes, I\u2019ve got the message. But it\u2019s no good. \u201cExpunged from the record. <em>Expunged</em>. Not deleted. <em>Expunged</em>. That conveys an impression of some force. You can imagine a team of people with clothes doing the sponging, wiping it away.\u201d You sound quite glad about this, I say. \u201cYes, I am glad about it,\u201d he replies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b24d5a3d70e10f3ab0aa80550fb36b20c8052f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b24d5a3d70e10f3ab0aa80550fb36b20c8052f7/907_0_1868_2334/800.jpg\" alt=\"A male aide puts on Bercow's gown in a corridor in the House of Commons\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On prorogation, John Bercow says: \u2018If the Speaker doesn\u2019t stand up for parliament, it\u2019s difficult to know who does.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a theory that Bercow, whose father was a cab driver, is motivated more than anything by social class. Having sometimes found himself the victim of snobbery, it is the fuel on which his engine runs, the spur for his greatest feuds and grudges. He tells me that he gets on well with Boris Johnson, whom he finds \u201cpersonable\u201d, but that he was rather less keen on David Cameron. \u201cHe was immensely capable on his feet, very dextrous, and on big occasions, he could be impressive\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming? \u201cThere is, yes, and that is that David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. He has the most enormous, probably public school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks that people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d</p> <p>Did Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor, bait him? \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I didn\u2019t think George was mean. He is an icy calculator; when there is a strong difference of opinion, he\u2019s rather clinical.\u201d He makes his voice slightly posher, and a little bit Bond villain. <em>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing personal, but I am going to have to take you out. The exigencies of the time require it. I don\u2019t dislike you, but the time for your political assassination has arrived. The slot has been booked, the weapon has been identified.\u2019</em> David Cameron is a more emotional character. Was he mean to me? He did strongly object to my becoming Speaker. He was not keen on me at all, but then, when he stood for the leadership, I said I didn\u2019t think Oxford-hunting-shooting-fishing-membership-of-White\u2019s was a combination to appeal to the masses. I thought he was too privileged.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming Speaker, Bercow says, was his way of dealing with his feelings about parliamentary life. He didn\u2019t care for the front benches [he was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Iain Duncan Smith, and shadow secretary of state for international development under Michael Howard], but on the back benches he felt \u201cunrecognised, powerless\u2026 eventually I said to my wife: \u2018Honey, this is a recipe for unhappiness.\u2019\u201d Some time after this, he had a drink with the former MP Jonathan Aitken, whose godfather, Selwyn Lloyd, was Speaker in the 70s. \u201c\u2018There are other routes to fulfilment,\u2019 Jonathan said. He almost winked at me.\u201d Was this a lightbulb moment? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>And did he always know he would be a reforming Speaker (among his reforms are, famously, the establishment of a nursery in what was previously the House of Commons pistol range; an increase in the use of urgent questions, whereby any MP can demand a minister comes to the dispatch box; and the abandonment of the Speaker\u2019s traditional dress)? \u201cNo, but the reforms were obvious.\u201d He wanted the place to be more open, welcoming and, well, normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be hermetically sealed in fancy dress.\u201d</p> <p>Such changes were, of course, all of a piece with what Bercow calls his \u201cpolitical journey\u201d, an ideological odyssey that began in Edgware, north London, where he was born in 1963. His father had a car business at the time, and his mother was a secretary, though they divorced when he was 12. He was a precocious child. One story has him sitting on the wall in front of the family home, ostentatiously reading the <em>Times</em>, the newspaper so huge, it all but hid him from view. He appeared on<em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eAkveRVQSE\" title=\"\">Crackerjack</a></em>, the children\u2019s TV show and, as a teenager in the audience at <em>Question Time</em>, he lectured Barbara Castle, accusing her of having swapped the Commons for the European Parliament because she knew the Labour party had no future. He was also a tennis player: a Middlesex under-12s champion, no less. He shakes his head, forlornly. \u201cAs Jo Durie\u2019s coach once said to my mum: \u2018I don\u2019t think John is the most talented player on the circuit, but there are two things I admire about him: he will run for ever, and he cares massively about winning.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e097701bb5140f318e0c83d4a6e262409f155e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e097701bb5140f318e0c83d4a6e262409f155e88/0_128_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Bercow in shorts and T-shirt jokes with David Cameron and aides in suits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow jokes with David Cameron at a schools tennis event on a court set up outside the Houses of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he disliked school. \u201cI was distracted by my parents\u2019 break-up. I was at sea for a period. I\u2019ve got some sad memories: terrible tensions between them, though much later they made up.\u201d He only got going at Essex University, where he received a first class degree in government.</p> <p>According to one commentator, by the time he was in his late teens, Bercow was \u201cmore rightwing than Marie-Antoinette\u201d: at university, he was a hang \u2019em, flog \u2019em type, a fierce opponent of the EU, and a member of the Monday Club, a notorious fringe group that was then aligned with the Tories. He was, in other words, the polar opposite, politically speaking, of the man who, in 2002, would resign from the shadow cabinet over his support for same-sex adoption. I wonder: is he embarrassed by his former self? I expect prevarication, some talk of youthful folly. But his response is straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cYes, very much so,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular\u2026 \u201d (It\u2019s at this point that it happens for the first time: his eyes fill with tears and he chokes slightly on his words.) \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of having argued for the privatisation of the coal industry, or advocating tax of 15p in the pound. An intellectual case can be made [for those things]. No, the only thing I feel really ashamed about is that, when I joined the Monday Club, I joined its immigration, repatriation and race relations industry subcommittee. I\u2019m <em>deeply</em> ashamed of that.\u201d</p> <p>So why did he do it? \u201cYes, what on earth was this north London Jewish boy doing teaming up with a bunch of bigots, racists and crypto-fascists? I think I was rather influenced by my father, who in many respects was a good dad \u2013 honest, loyal, hard working, he\u2019s been dead for 33 years last week\u2026\u201d Again, the eyes brim and the voice cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish my dad, but it is possible for Jewish people to be racist, just as it is possible for people of other faiths to be. Dad was a creature of his time. He had a particular view about Commonwealth immigration. One day, I went to see him, and he mentioned Enoch Powell, whom he thought much maligned. I went off and read his [Powell\u2019s] speeches, and I thought: wow, he\u2019s got views about markets and price controls and Northern Ireland, and I fell for that. When you are a young person, you can be attracted by an ideology.\u201d</p> <p>So what changed? How did his move leftwards begin? \u201cIn the Monday Club, I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and antisemitic, too, and I recoiled, and left. But that was in 1984. I remained strongly Conservative for a long period. I was a Thatcherite until 2001.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Monday Club I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and I recoiled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was, he says, Tony Blair\u2019s second election victory that finally caused him to do some deep thinking. \u201cWe were smashed to smithereens. I thought: there\u2019s something wrong, here. The electorate cared about public services that we had under-resourced, and it cared about fairness. In our attitude to women and minorities, we came across as the nasty party, and I didn\u2019t think I was a nasty person.\u201d</p> <p>With this in mind, is he dismayed by the current mood? \u201cYes, there is a nastiness abroad. It is a pity.\u201d Again, he is on the verge of tears as he gasps out the words: \u201cIn the 1950s, there were notices in pubs that said: No blacks, no Irish, no dogs. The idea that there is a regression into an\u2026 <em>atavistic </em><em>camp</em> is a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>Has he received the kind of threats that many other MPs, particularly Jewish members, have recently described? \u201cOh, yes. But it\u2019s something I can shrug off. I don\u2019t want to be pious. I am capable of being upset from time to time. But have I lost a wink of sleep over this? No. I lose sleep about the health of a member of my family.\u201d At this point, beginning to sob, he asks me to switch off my tape recorder.</p> <p>When he has recovered, we talk about his wife and three children, with whom he has shared the \u201cbizarre, surreal\u201d experience of living in Speaker\u2019s House. Some have attributed the shift in his politics to the influence of his wife, Sally, a Labour supporter who famously has a \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d sticker on her car. But this doesn\u2019t seem to me quite right, not least because they met, in 1989, at a Conservative students\u2019 training conference. Was it love at first sight? \u201cI was very attracted to her, and I was completely amazed she had the remotest interest in me.\u201d Naturally, his determination kicked in. \u201cI worked at it. We had an on-off relationship, but I never gave up, and 13 years later, we got married.\u201d</p> <p>He says his wife has been a rock. But there have been \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 some challenges. She was photographed for a newspaper wearing only a sheet (power is an aphrodisiac, she said); appeared in reality TV shows; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/lord-mcalpine-libel-row-sally-bercow\" title=\"\">lost a libel case</a> brought by Lord McAlpine; and had an affair with her husband\u2019s cousin.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ve had periods of turbulence,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s well known that Sally left me for a period.\u201d How did he cope? It was so public. \u201cIn the Commons, a dear friend, Charles Walker [a Tory MP], came up to me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t know how you keep going. You must feel so embarrassed.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not embarrassed. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019 How did I cope? I compartmentalised.\u201d Did he know he\u2019d get her back? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a great certainty, but I thought it was worth trying. I do [love her a lot], and I\u2019m happier together than apart.\u201d For one last time, his eyes grow watery. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to think the grass is greener. I like to stick with things.\u201d</p> <p>He must go now. The man from the speaking agency he has joined, desperate to talk to him, is tapping on the door. But I sense a certain reluctance: the result, I think, of a feeling on his part that, at last, he has the chance to show people what he is. \u201cThe way I talk is not an affectation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came from my father, who also spoke in paragraphs. There are certain rather stupid political scribblers, pompous, public school idiots\u201d \u2013 I interrupt: can he possibly be referring to Quentin Letts? (Letts is the <em>Times</em> sketch-writer.) \u201cDid you say Lentin Quetts?\u201d he barks back. And now he really lets rip.</p> <p>\u201cThey have this stupid, bigoted, thick-as-pig-shit idea of me as someone who is just acting a part. It\u2019s just snobbery. Because public-school people are predestined: there\u2019s a map for them.\u201d Does he mean that they don\u2019t understand that the rest of us must be more pragmatic, perhaps shaking off versions of ourselves from time to time? He nods.</p> <p>\u201cI may be odd and pompous and an irritant. But I am <em>completely</em> authentic.\u201d He shows me the palms of his hands. \u201cThis is me,\u201d he says, sounding half dazed at the thought.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month \u2013 in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise \u2013 the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen. If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It\u2019s not only that he\u2019ll have to get the voice right (at his best \u2013 or worst, depending on your point of view \u2013 Bercow sounds like Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh in the 1935 movie Mutiny on the Bounty). Actually, that\u2019s the easy part (\u201cOrder, orr-duu-rrr!\u201d). It\u2019s the personality that\u2019s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he\u2019s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he\u2019s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I\u2019ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears. When we meet in a Soho club, he has been a civilian \u2013 no longer the Speaker, and no longer the MP for Buckingham, the seat he has represented since 1997 \u2013 for three days. What is he feeling? Is it grief, or relief? \u201cI don\u2019t feel grief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I say relief\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that, because it was the greatest privilege of my life. It probably sounds trite, but it\u2019s too early to know how I\u2019m going to feel. I had a structure, and now that structure is gone, and it is discombobulating. In 10 years [as Speaker], I missed Prime Minister\u2019s Questions twice, on both occasions to speak at funerals. The question arises: whither now?\u201d Will he go to the Lords? Convention dictates that the Speaker head to the upper house on retirement, but there is talk that pesky Bercow will be denied this privilege (talk that emanated first from the camp of an increasingly furious Theresa May earlier this year). \u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he says, with utmost graciousness, \u201cbut yes, I would accept, if it was offered to me. I want to write, consult, have fun, and do good. I want to ensure that I\u2019m solvent, and I would like to speak to a wide variety of audiences around the world. That would appeal. What I loathe and fear is dancing.\u201d So, no Strictly, then? Certainly not. What about the election? How is he going to vote? \u201cYou can ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d Oh, please tell me. \u201cNo.\u201d As I\u2019m sure he knows \u2013 he wears the smile of an assassin \u2013 this is still an answer of a kind: given that he was a Conservative MP only five minutes ago, one would assume that if his intention was to vote Tory, he\u2019d simply say so. But it\u2019s also odd, this being one of only two matters on which he will hold back (the other is the allegations of bullying made against him in 2018, which he will not discuss beyond saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never bullied anyone in my life\u201d). He certainly isn\u2019t convinced the Tories will win. \u201cThe polls are volatile. The Conservatives are somewhat ahead. But they need to be 10 points ahead to be confident of a majority.\u201d Either way \u2013 a Tory majority, or not \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the election will \u201csort\u201d the issue of Brexit. \u201cThis is just phase one. We\u2019ve yet to have the debate about the trade deal between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world. We\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years.\u201d Does this depress him? \u201cI don\u2019t easily get depressed but my personal view is that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period.\u201d For the past three years, Bercow has presided over the efforts of first Theresa May\u2019s government, and then that of Boris Johnson, to pass a bill on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU through the House of Commons. It wasn\u2019t work that he ever anticipated having to do. On the night of the referendum in June 2016, watching the television in his children\u2019s playroom at Speaker\u2019s House, he was as surprised as anyone by the result. \u201cA lot of us in the political class are too London-centric, and that must apply to me, too, because I thought most Brits would, in a pragmatic way, vote to remain.\u201d Once a new prime minister had been installed in No 10, however, his amazement only grew. \u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit would have a clear idea of what they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity. I would say that Brexiteers bear some share of the blame for the delay because they did not have an agreed approach to delivery. There are, for instance, prominent Brexiteers who very publicly stated that achieving a trade deal with the EU would be absolutely straightforward.\u201d Does he mean Liam Fox, the former secretary of state for international trade? Apparently, he does. \u201cQuite why he thought that, you\u2019d have to ask him. On average, a trade deal between two willing parties takes seven years to implement.\u201d The other problem was the attitude of Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she bears me any ill will. I don\u2019t bear her any. She was doing her best. But there was one major problem. The government pursued its approach as though it had an absolute right to parliamentary delivery \u2013 even when it was a minority government [after the 2017 election]. There is a respectable argument for saying that it was incumbent upon it to try and achieve a wider consensus; to reach out to other parties. But no serious effort was made to do that.\u201d Throughout all this, Bercow was determined, as he had been ever since his election as Speaker in 2009, to protect the rights of the backbencher, ensuring that the executive could not force its will on the House. Some, however, saw his actions as unforgivably political, and slanted in favour of remain. In March, to the fury of many, he prevented May from bringing a third vote on her withdrawal agreement, quoting a convention that went back to 1604. In September, he allowed rebel MPs to take control of the Commons agenda to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he defends his impartiality in this period: \u201cThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that I was completely fair. I reject the charge that I was the agent of remainers.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s impartial now. Far from it. He sounds to me like someone who has won a famous victory: a triumphant partisan by any other name. Take, for instance, the prorogation of parliament last August. When he heard that this was what Boris Johnson was planning, he was in Turkey with his family. \u201cWithin an hour, I\u2019d issued a statement to say I thought it was a constitutional outrage. That annoyed some: they said it wasn\u2019t for me to pronounce. But if the Speaker doesn\u2019t speak up for parliament, it\u2019s hard to know who does.\u201d A few days later, though, the supreme court ruled that the prorogation was, indeed, illegitimate. \u201cAn 11-nil verdict!\u201d he says, like the Arsenal fan that he is. He looks at me steadily. \u201cDo you understand if I say that when people know you were wrong, they find it easier to forgive you? But that when they know you were right, they don\u2019t like it?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, did they come and apologise? No, they just attacked the court instead.\u201d Where does he think the impulse for this prorogation came from? \u201cI find it hard to penetrate the recesses of their fertile minds,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say they weren\u2019t seeking to stop debate, but it absolutely was not a normal prorogation.\u201d His voice begins to rise. \u201cIt was declared illegitimate. Ultra vires. Not proper. And, crucially, void. I repeat: void. Void. Void. Invalid. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d By now, I\u2019m holding up a finger to indicate that, yes, I\u2019ve got the message. But it\u2019s no good. \u201cExpunged from the record. Expunged. Not deleted. Expunged. That conveys an impression of some force. You can imagine a team of people with clothes doing the sponging, wiping it away.\u201d You sound quite glad about this, I say. \u201cYes, I am glad about it,\u201d he replies. There is a theory that Bercow, whose father was a cab driver, is motivated more than anything by social class. Having sometimes found himself the victim of snobbery, it is the fuel on which his engine runs, the spur for his greatest feuds and grudges. He tells me that he gets on well with Boris Johnson, whom he finds \u201cpersonable\u201d, but that he was rather less keen on David Cameron. \u201cHe was immensely capable on his feet, very dextrous, and on big occasions, he could be impressive\u2026\u201d Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming? \u201cThere is, yes, and that is that David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. He has the most enormous, probably public school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks that people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d Did Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor, bait him? \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I didn\u2019t think George was mean. He is an icy calculator; when there is a strong difference of opinion, he\u2019s rather clinical.\u201d He makes his voice slightly posher, and a little bit Bond villain. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing personal, but I am going to have to take you out. The exigencies of the time require it. I don\u2019t dislike you, but the time for your political assassination has arrived. The slot has been booked, the weapon has been identified.\u2019 David Cameron is a more emotional character. Was he mean to me? He did strongly object to my becoming Speaker. He was not keen on me at all, but then, when he stood for the leadership, I said I didn\u2019t think Oxford-hunting-shooting-fishing-membership-of-White\u2019s was a combination to appeal to the masses. I thought he was too privileged.\u201d Becoming Speaker, Bercow says, was his way of dealing with his feelings about parliamentary life. He didn\u2019t care for the front benches [he was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Iain Duncan Smith, and shadow secretary of state for international development under Michael Howard], but on the back benches he felt \u201cunrecognised, powerless\u2026 eventually I said to my wife: \u2018Honey, this is a recipe for unhappiness.\u2019\u201d Some time after this, he had a drink with the former MP Jonathan Aitken, whose godfather, Selwyn Lloyd, was Speaker in the 70s. \u201c\u2018There are other routes to fulfilment,\u2019 Jonathan said. He almost winked at me.\u201d Was this a lightbulb moment? \u201cYes.\u201d And did he always know he would be a reforming Speaker (among his reforms are, famously, the establishment of a nursery in what was previously the House of Commons pistol range; an increase in the use of urgent questions, whereby any MP can demand a minister comes to the dispatch box; and the abandonment of the Speaker\u2019s traditional dress)? \u201cNo, but the reforms were obvious.\u201d He wanted the place to be more open, welcoming and, well, normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be hermetically sealed in fancy dress.\u201d Such changes were, of course, all of a piece with what Bercow calls his \u201cpolitical journey\u201d, an ideological odyssey that began in Edgware, north London, where he was born in 1963. His father had a car business at the time, and his mother was a secretary, though they divorced when he was 12. He was a precocious child. One story has him sitting on the wall in front of the family home, ostentatiously reading the Times, the newspaper so huge, it all but hid him from view. He appeared on Crackerjack, the children\u2019s TV show and, as a teenager in the audience at Question Time, he lectured Barbara Castle, accusing her of having swapped the Commons for the European Parliament because she knew the Labour party had no future. He was also a tennis player: a Middlesex under-12s champion, no less. He shakes his head, forlornly. \u201cAs Jo Durie\u2019s coach once said to my mum: \u2018I don\u2019t think John is the most talented player on the circuit, but there are two things I admire about him: he will run for ever, and he cares massively about winning.\u2019\u201d But he disliked school. \u201cI was distracted by my parents\u2019 break-up. I was at sea for a period. I\u2019ve got some sad memories: terrible tensions between them, though much later they made up.\u201d He only got going at Essex University, where he received a first class degree in government. According to one commentator, by the time he was in his late teens, Bercow was \u201cmore rightwing than Marie-Antoinette\u201d: at university, he was a hang \u2019em, flog \u2019em type, a fierce opponent of the EU, and a member of the Monday Club, a notorious fringe group that was then aligned with the Tories. He was, in other words, the polar opposite, politically speaking, of the man who, in 2002, would resign from the shadow cabinet over his support for same-sex adoption. I wonder: is he embarrassed by his former self? I expect prevarication, some talk of youthful folly. But his response is straightforward. \u201cYes, very much so,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular\u2026 \u201d (It\u2019s at this point that it happens for the first time: his eyes fill with tears and he chokes slightly on his words.) \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of having argued for the privatisation of the coal industry, or advocating tax of 15p in the pound. An intellectual case can be made [for those things]. No, the only thing I feel really ashamed about is that, when I joined the Monday Club, I joined its immigration, repatriation and race relations industry subcommittee. I\u2019m deeply ashamed of that.\u201d So why did he do it? \u201cYes, what on earth was this north London Jewish boy doing teaming up with a bunch of bigots, racists and crypto-fascists? I think I was rather influenced by my father, who in many respects was a good dad \u2013 honest, loyal, hard working, he\u2019s been dead for 33 years last week\u2026\u201d Again, the eyes brim and the voice cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish my dad, but it is possible for Jewish people to be racist, just as it is possible for people of other faiths to be. Dad was a creature of his time. He had a particular view about Commonwealth immigration. One day, I went to see him, and he mentioned Enoch Powell, whom he thought much maligned. I went off and read his [Powell\u2019s] speeches, and I thought: wow, he\u2019s got views about markets and price controls and Northern Ireland, and I fell for that. When you are a young person, you can be attracted by an ideology.\u201d So what changed? How did his move leftwards begin? \u201cIn the Monday Club, I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and antisemitic, too, and I recoiled, and left. But that was in 1984. I remained strongly Conservative for a long period. I was a Thatcherite until 2001.\u201d It was, he says, Tony Blair\u2019s second election victory that finally caused him to do some deep thinking. \u201cWe were smashed to smithereens. I thought: there\u2019s something wrong, here. The electorate cared about public services that we had under-resourced, and it cared about fairness. In our attitude to women and minorities, we came across as the nasty party, and I didn\u2019t think I was a nasty person.\u201d With this in mind, is he dismayed by the current mood? \u201cYes, there is a nastiness abroad. It is a pity.\u201d Again, he is on the verge of tears as he gasps out the words: \u201cIn the 1950s, there were notices in pubs that said: No blacks, no Irish, no dogs. The idea that there is a regression into an\u2026 atavistic camp is a tragedy.\u201d Has he received the kind of threats that many other MPs, particularly Jewish members, have recently described? \u201cOh, yes. But it\u2019s something I can shrug off. I don\u2019t want to be pious. I am capable of being upset from time to time. But have I lost a wink of sleep over this? No. I lose sleep about the health of a member of my family.\u201d At this point, beginning to sob, he asks me to switch off my tape recorder. When he has recovered, we talk about his wife and three children, with whom he has shared the \u201cbizarre, surreal\u201d experience of living in Speaker\u2019s House. Some have attributed the shift in his politics to the influence of his wife, Sally, a Labour supporter who famously has a \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d sticker on her car. But this doesn\u2019t seem to me quite right, not least because they met, in 1989, at a Conservative students\u2019 training conference. Was it love at first sight? \u201cI was very attracted to her, and I was completely amazed she had the remotest interest in me.\u201d Naturally, his determination kicked in. \u201cI worked at it. We had an on-off relationship, but I never gave up, and 13 years later, we got married.\u201d He says his wife has been a rock. But there have been \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 some challenges. She was photographed for a newspaper wearing only a sheet (power is an aphrodisiac, she said); appeared in reality TV shows; lost a libel case brought by Lord McAlpine; and had an affair with her husband\u2019s cousin. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had periods of turbulence,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s well known that Sally left me for a period.\u201d How did he cope? It was so public. \u201cIn the Commons, a dear friend, Charles Walker [a Tory MP], came up to me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t know how you keep going. You must feel so embarrassed.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not embarrassed. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019 How did I cope? I compartmentalised.\u201d Did he know he\u2019d get her back? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a great certainty, but I thought it was worth trying. I do [love her a lot], and I\u2019m happier together than apart.\u201d For one last time, his eyes grow watery. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to think the grass is greener. I like to stick with things.\u201d He must go now. The man from the speaking agency he has joined, desperate to talk to him, is tapping on the door. But I sense a certain reluctance: the result, I think, of a feeling on his part that, at last, he has the chance to show people what he is. \u201cThe way I talk is not an affectation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came from my father, who also spoke in paragraphs. There are certain rather stupid political scribblers, pompous, public school idiots\u201d \u2013 I interrupt: can he possibly be referring to Quentin Letts? (Letts is the Times sketch-writer.) \u201cDid you say Lentin Quetts?\u201d he barks back. And now he really lets rip. \u201cThey have this stupid, bigoted, thick-as-pig-shit idea of me as someone who is just acting a part. It\u2019s just snobbery. Because public-school people are predestined: there\u2019s a map for them.\u201d Does he mean that they don\u2019t understand that the rest of us must be more pragmatic, perhaps shaking off versions of ourselves from time to time? He nods. \u201cI may be odd and pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic.\u201d He shows me the palms of his hands. \u201cThis is me,\u201d he says, sounding half dazed at the thought.",
