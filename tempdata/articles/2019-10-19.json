As a data scientist it interests me that the way the Brexit debate is being conducted is not about facts, it\u2019s about emotions because the issue is too complex to fully break down. Leavers are being pulled by Brexit-pushing newspapers which make them feel Brexit is something they should be thinking about, and deflecting them away from the real issues.

People think differently now, after being misled in 2016, and we should have the opportunity to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this any more. We don\u2019t want to compound our errors.\u201d You only need to look at what\u2019s happened to the pound to see how much faith people have that the current administration can negotiate a better trade deal than what we\u2019ve got.

As a data scientist it interests me that the way the Brexit debate is being conducted is not about facts, it\u2019s about emotions because the issue is too complex to fully break down. Leavers are being pulled by Brexit-pushing newspapers which make them feel Brexit is something they should be thinking about, and deflecting them away from the real issues. All my life I\u2019ve ignored that type of newspaper and thought: \u201cIt\u2019s just words.\u201d But it turns out that words matter. Andrew Lee, 35 from Toronto, lives in London, works in finance I have dual British-Canadian citizenship. I feel a second referendum is the only way to get out of the deadlock, irrespective of one\u2019s preference for leave or remain because we need a steer from the people, now that three years have passed and the goalposts have moved. People think differently now, after being misled in 2016, and we should have the opportunity to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this any more. We don\u2019t want to compound our errors.\u201d You only need to look at what\u2019s happened to the pound to see how much faith people have that the current administration can negotiate a better trade deal than what we\u2019ve got. Fundamentally, the question is: What is the path forward for this country and this people? And the three administrations in the last three years have been unable to pull us out of this quagmire.",

If she backs Johnson\u2019s deal, she could take others with her.</p> \n  <p><strong>Norman Lamb: </strong>while the rest of the Liberal Democrats are firmly against the deal, Lamb \u2013 who will step down at the next election \u2013 has long been much more Brexit-minded than his colleagues.

      "bodyText": "Thank you for following the blog today and for all your comments. Here is a summary of the day\u2019s main developments. Boris Johnson has until 11pm to request an extension to Brexit from the EU after losing a vote on an amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin. The Letwin amendment, which puts a brake on Brexit, was passed by 322 votes to 306. The prime minister insisted he would \u201cnot negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn told him he must comply with the law and the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford warned Johnson could end up in court. The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said another meaningful vote would be held on Monday. But the Speaker, John Bercow, indicated he might not allow this as it would be \u201ccurious or irregular\u201d attempt to \u201cinvalidate\u201d the result of today\u2019s vote. Bercow also indicated that he could write the letter to the EU requesting an extension if instructed to by a judge or MPs. No 10 has yet to clarify whether Johnson will send the letter. The People\u2019s Vote campaign claims 1 million people have joined a march in London demanding they get a say on any Brexit deal. John McDonnell, Caroline Lucas and Anna Soubry were among those who addressed the crowds after the parliamentary vote. Here\u2019s what Gina Miller \u2013 who has won two legal challenges against the government over Brexit \u2013 said about today. Police are stood round a group singing Rule Britannia, chanting: \u201cOh Tommy Tommy (Robinson)\u201d and calling for a no-deal Brexit as pro-EU protesters are singing: \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also needed a police escort today. In her case it was after addressing the People\u2019s Vote march and being followed by pro-Brexit supporters. Another response, this time from the the taoiseach: Here is what the European parliament\u2019s representative on Brexit has said about today\u2019s events: The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has also been given a police escort leaving parliament. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, was escorted by police as she left the House of Commons to the sound of protesters on the People\u2019s Vote march shouting: \u201cShame on you.\u201d Having left the Commons after the Letwin amendment was passed, a number of MPs have been addressing the People\u2019s Vote march. The decision by MPs to pass the Letwin amendment brings the legal action against the prime minister which resumes on Monday in Scotland\u2019s highest civil court into sharp relief. The court of session will resume its hearing into a request for an emergency interdict, or injunction, to force Johnson to send the Brexit extension letter required by the Benn act. Johnson told the Commons on Saturday he was not legally required to do so \u2013 a position the court is now likely to test on Monday. Ten days ago, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, sitting with Lords Drummond-Young and Brodie, postponed a decision on enforcing the act\u2019s provisions because they did not then know whether Johnson would have to uphold its provisions or would fail to do so. That case, brought by Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company, Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, the SNP MP will resume at noon on Monday. If Johnson has failed to send the letter as required, by 11pm tonight, the court is expected to rule on Monday on whether to give Johnson 24 hours to do so or face being held in contempt of court. Legal sources believe the prime minister is in significant legal peril. Lawyers for the UK government told the court on 9 October they knew the solemn pledges given at an earlier hearing that Johnson would comply with the act were legally binding. The UK government told the court of session on Friday 4 October the prime minister accepted \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d And the court will also adjudicate on a second part of the application: an interdict forcing the UK government not to frustrate or undermine the intent of the letter, by attempting to sidestep the extension move. If he or his ministers, or their proxies, try to subvert the request for an extension \u2013 say by sending a second letter asking the EU to ignore the extension application, they will also be at risk of contempt. It is only if Johnson fails to send the letter and fails to adhere to the court\u2019s interdict requiring him to do so that the court will consider the nuclear option. It has unique powers called nobile officium, which allow the court or its agent to send that letter to all 27 EU member states and institutions on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Those powers have never been used in such a way, and if the Scottish court uses them, it would provoke another extraordinary constitutional confrontation. Assuming the court issues a definitive ruling next week, the case is expected to end up in the UK supreme court within days. Proceedings in the House of Commons have now been adjourned after a lengthy discussion about what happens next following the government\u2019s defeat on the Letwin amendment. Many opposition MPs were unhappy at the prospect of the government tabling another meaningful vote for Monday. It was unclear whether the Speaker, John Bercow, would grant this. Last year, the Speaker said the government could not keep bringing back the same question to parliament in the hope that they got a different answer. The independent - former Labour - MP Jared O\u2019Mara voted for the Letwin amendment, as did the vast majority of Labour MPs. The leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, suggested there could be a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on Monday. This was then supported by Oliver Letwin, whose amendment prevented it happening today. But it is for the Speaker, John Bercow, to decide whether to allow that motion on Monday and he gave the strongest indication he would not. Earlier, as the benches emptied out after the vote, the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry QC asked Bercow if he would write the letter requesting an extension if the prime minister did not do so. He said he would do so if asked by the judge or MPs. Here is what the Conservatives are saying: A spokeswoman for the European commission said it was up to the UK government to make the next move after the developments in the Commons. She said: The European commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called Letwin amendment meaning that the withdrawal agreement itself was not put to vote today. It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible. A spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, declined to comment. Ambassadors for the EU27 will meet on Sunday morning to discuss the latest developments. More from the march ... Boris Johnson has until 11pm to send that extension letter to the EU. Organisers of the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d march say there are 1 million people in attendance, my colleague Aamna Mohdin tells me. Here is Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the government defeat on the amendment: You can see how everyone voted here. As they go on debating whether the PM can be forced to write the letter to the EU requesting an extension, No 10 is keeping mum. This was the reaction on the \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d march: Here is a celebratory selfie by a Lib Dem MP with the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas. Oliver Letwin says he will be voting for the deal with the intention that the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, and can now do so with the knowledge that if the bill does not pass in time, the UK will not crash out. The DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds says the party will examine the deal in detail and its priority will remain the integrity of the union. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, says the deal is a bad deal and the public deserve to have a say. The most urgent thing now is that the prime minister complies with the law. She asks for parliament to be suspended so that Boris Johnson can send a letter asking the EU for a suspension and then come back to parliament and confirm that he has sent it. This request is declined by the Speaker. Corbyn calls on Johnson to reconsider what he has said about not asking for an extension. The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, asks the Speaker what can be done to ensure the government complies with the law and the Benn act. Blackford says Johnson thinks \u201che\u2019s above the law\u201d but will find himself in court if he doesn\u2019t abide by it. The PM says it was \u201cpretty close\u201d today and he hopes MPs will accept his deal next week in \u201coverwhelming numbers\u201d. I continue to commend this deal to the house. Jeremy Corbyn says that parliament has spoken. It is an emphatic decision by this house ... The prime minister must now comply with the law. He says Johnson can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail MPs. Boris Johnson thanks everyone for giving up their time but says \u201calas\u201d, the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has been passed up. He says he is not dismayed by the result. He continues in the strong belief that the best thing for the UK and the EU is to leave on 31 October. I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so. The legislation will be introduced next week, says Johnson. The government loses. 322 to 306. This withholds approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the legislation to enact it \u2013 the EU withdrawal bill \u2013 is passed. Labour think they\u2019ve won... Here\u2019s what people are saying about the Letwin amendment vote: MPs are now voting on the Letwin amendment. Michael Gove is up taking a conciliatory tone, stressing that he accepts everyone is acting in what he thinks are the best interests of the country. But he says those he respects most are those from both benches who voted to remain but now are voting for the deal because it is the will of the British people. On that basis, he says the speech that stood out was that by Theresa May who voted for remain but now wants to honour the result of the referendum. Gove says MPs should be prepared to put aside \u201cour perfect Brexit\u201d for the sake of the common good. He says if there is a vote to delay people will feel that parliament has shirked its responsibilities. Asked a question about how the government will avoid a no deal if it is passed but legislation is not passed on time, Gove says the best way to avoid that is to vote for the government\u2019s deal. If the amendment is passed there will be no meaningful vote today, he says. If parliament votes for the deal unamended people will feel \u201clike a cloud has lifted\u201d, he claims. Another Tory who had the whip withdrawn has confirmed he will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. As the Brexit debate continues, so do Ukip\u2019s travails. It has taken steps to suspend its leader, Richard Braine, amid a fresh power struggle within the party, my colleague Aaron Walawalkar writes. A man has been arrested for trespass within the Palace of Westminster. Antoinette Sandbach, who had the Tory whip withdrawn last month, says she will back the Letwin amendment. Making the point that she has voted for a Brexit deal more times than the prime minister, she says Johnson\u2019s deal is \u201csubstantially worse\u201d: I\u2019m not saying much about the deal. I was always taught that if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. She also says she would vote for an amendment in favour of a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d if there was an opportunity to do so. The Lib Dems\u2019 Tom Brake says the PM is a \u201ccolourful Pied Piper\u201d who struck the deal to further his own ambition. Brake says Boris Johnson himself has said the deal may not survive the transition period and could still lead to a no-deal crash-out. He advocates a people\u2019s vote, referencing \u201cthe hundreds of thousands of people over there in Parliament Square\u201d. Brake urges MPs to support the Letwin amendment and reject the deal. The Tory MP and former cabinet member Liam Fox says the amendment will not take EU off the table, as the government would be forced to ask the EU for any extension. The only way to prevent no deal is to vote for the PM\u2019s deal, says Fox. He says the government made a contract with the British people. It\u2019s a question of faith in our electoral system itself. He says he has \u201cstrong reservations\u201d about the deal but it\u2019s time to deliver. Fox also voted three times for Theresa May\u2019s deal. The veteran Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash has confirmed he will vote for the deal. He was a doubt for the government. While the debate goes on in parliament ... The Speaker, John Bercow, had placed a five-minute rule on contributions from MPs. He has now reduced it to three minutes. Chris Grayling uses his time to pay tribute to the prime minister and urge people to accept the deal. Grayling also warns the Letwin amendment, if passed, may cause the house to decline to decide on a deal today. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson made a furious contribution in which he also suggested the party\u2019s MPs would back the Letwin amendment. More from the march. Ken Clarke, former Tory chancellor, home secretary and more, says what we have before us is \u201cundoubtedly a bad deal\u201d and worse than that proposed by Theresa May. But now the choice is very real. He says he\u2019s worried that the purpose of the convoluted agreement over Ireland was so the rest of the UK could be taken out of the customs union straight away. The Canada deal took nine years to put in place, says Clarke. But he says all along he has been determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit. We should support this deal. Some pro-Brexit protesters have been ushered away from the People\u2019s Vote march. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle responds to Theresa May, saying there was a promise not to create a border in the Irish Sea but that is what has happened. He also says the original referendum was ill-defined. If you want to know what the British people think now: \u201cAsk them.\u201d The Lib Dems\u2019 Sam Gyimah (formerly of the Conservatives of course) asks Kyle if he agrees that any deal should be put to a people\u2019s vote. Kyle says he voted for three different versions of Brexit but it\u2019s got to the point that there are so many different versions of Brexit that there is \u201cirreconcilable division\u201d in the house. The public must have a say, he concludes. Theresa May speaks. She tells a slightly stodgy anecdote about Jonny May scoring two tries for England in the rugby. Saying she feels a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, May says: I intend to rebel against all of those who don\u2019t want to vote to deliver Brexit. She says the SNP has a history of rejecting the results of referendums. The former prime minister says if parliament doesn\u2019t back the deal \u201cit is guilty of the most egregious con tricks on the British people\u201d. If you don\u2019t want no deal you have to vote for a deal. Businesses are crying out for certainty. People want certainty in their lives. She concludes by saying if you want the country to move forward, vote for the deal today. More from the People\u2019s Vote march. Gareth Ellner, 37, dressed up as a Brexit unicorn called \u201cSunlit uplands\u201d, said: I like dressing up and I thought we have been promised the unicorn and I thought it\u2019s right for everyone to get a unicorn. Ellner said he\u2019s worried by the events taking place in parliament. I\u2019m concerned that Boris has told enough lies to enough people to get it [the deal] through. He is still holding out hope for a second referendum. We didn\u2019t know what we were voting to. I am ashamedly one of the voters who voted leave because I thought screw David Cameron. I was politically naive but recent events have made me more political active.\u201d One man pointed to Ellner\u2019s costume and asked: \u201cIt\u2019s not a sexual thing?\u201d before taking a photo with him. The former Labour MP Jared O\u2019Mara, who had said he would resign from parliament in September, has been spotted in the house. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, says the deal gives Northern Ireland a competitive advantage over Scotland. He says Northern Ireland is effectively being kept in the customs union, which is what Scotland wanted. This prime minister and his Brexit fan club in No 10 don\u2019t care about Scotland. He says it was \u201cdishonesty and lies\u201d by Vote Leave that brought this country to vote for Brexit. This is the beginning and end of their precious union. Whether the deal is passed or not today, an extension is needed and there should be an election to get rid of this \u201crotten government\u201d, says Blackford. Former cabinet minister Justine Greening, who had the Tory whip withdrawn, says the house is being given an \u201cimpossible choice\u201d. She likens it to buying a house without going inside. Greening \u2013 along with fellow Tory exiles Dominic Grieve and Guto Bebb \u2013 has previously made clear she wants a second referendum. My colleague Mattha Busby is at the People\u2019s Vote march. Here is Oliver Letwin. He says the purpose of his amendment is to prevent Britain crashing out with no deal if legislation is not passed by 31 October. He says he will vote for implementation of the deal. Despite my support for the PM\u2019s deal I do not believe its responsible to make that threat [of my deal or no deal]. His amendment will only be used to prevent a no-deal Brexit, he says. There\u2019s a lot of love for the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, on Twitter. Starmer says we could end up on WTO terms at the end of 2020 under this deal. This is a trapdoor to no deal. He reminds the house that \u201cnot a single trade union supports this deal\u201d. Labour MP Rushanara Ali says: This is a Trojan deal for no deal Brexit. Starmer agrees. Labour MP Helen Hayes said there should be another vote to give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of young people marching for a people\u2019s vote today. The mayor of London has joined the marchers. Starmer said Johnson\u2019s argument that he is not putting a border in the Irish Sea is simply wrong. On the reasons why the government wants to leave, Starmer says: It\u2019s obvious where the government is going. They want a licence to diverge. Once you move out of alignment you don\u2019t go back. You break the economic model we\u2019ve been operating for decades. Once you do that you look across to the US \u2026 and that\u2019s a different economic model, a deregulated model. He says 10 days is standard holiday in the US and corporate bodies have much more power than workers. The Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb says he has agonised this week over whether to support the deal. He says we run the risk of \u201cinflaming unionist opinion\u201d. Lamb, the only Lib Dem who potentially might have supported the deal, released a video earlier today saying he would not support it. Meanwhile, outside parliament, the people\u2019s vote march has begun. Addressing the crowd at the start, Young Greens co-chair Rosie Rawle said: We have never seen our future snatched away like we are at the present moment. We\u2019re inheriting a country ravaged by austerity and privatisation \u2026 We\u2019re being dragged out of Europe against our will \u2026 And we\u2019re forced to watch our planet spiral towards climate breakdown. But today, every single one of us are here to say \u2019We are not going to let this happen\u2019. While bullies like Boris Johnson and layabouts like Jacob Rees-Mogg drive our future off a cliff, there are millions of young people getting politicised, organised and mobilised. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, pleads: Don\u2019t take us out of the customs union. He says that is just what this deal does, it \u201crips up\u201d our close trading relationship with the EU and will result in job losses. If the aspiration of the government is to have a trading relationship \u201cas close as possible\u201d to the existing one, why were those words taken out, asks Starmer. Ed Vaizey, another one of the Tory MPs to have the whip withdrawn over attempts to block a no-deal Brexit, asked if the Letwin amendment did not pass and the deal was voted for but the bill did not pass by 31 October, whether that would lead to no deal? Barclay did not give a straight answer. The former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, another who had the whip, removed said the Letwin amendment was nothing more than \u201can insurance policy\u201d. Barclay said the purpose of the amendment was just delay, \u201cto stop us getting Brexit done\u201d. He says today is an opportunity for all those who want to avoid no deal. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, is unhappy about the channelling of the memory of Mo Mowlam by Stephen Barclay. The Tory MP Mark Francois says no member of the ERG spoke against the deal at its meeting this morning. If the deal is passed this morning we will faithfully vote the bill through to the end so that we leave the EU, says Francois, attempting to quash the suggestion that MPs might vote for the deal before trying to force through a no deal at a later date. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger again asks how MPs can vote without any economic analysis. To laughter, Barclay says no level of analysis would change her mind. He adds that the deal was only done on Thursday and says analysis would be contingent on what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world. Labour\u2019s Caroline Flint describes the Letwin amendment as \u201ca panic measure\u201d. She says it also underlines that the sponsors of the Benn act had only the intention to delay Brexit and stop it. Pretty clear that she intends to vote for the deal. Gareth Snell is one of the Labour MPs the government is hoping will vote for the deal. Significant backing for the deal: Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says: We will set regulation that is world-leading. He says the UK parliament went ahead of the EU in several areas including maternity rights and will continue to do. Alistair Burt, one of 21 Conservatives who had the whip removed for backing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, says he will not support the Letwin amendment. The debate on motions is beginning now. Stephen Barclay is met by cries of \u201cHow dare you?\u201d after he invokes the name of the late Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam. The speaker intervenes, urging MPs to calm down. Barclay continues, saying he was referring to her ability to unify. Barclay says he respects the intentions of Oliver Letwin. But his amendment would render today\u2019s vote meaningless.\u2026 The public would be appalled by pointless further delay. He asks Letwin to withdraw it. Johnson says it cannot be right to delay beyond 31 October so it is his deal or no deal. In response to a question about how he would appeal to remainers, he repeats that it is an opportunity for people who love Europe to move forward. This is what BBC Newsnight\u2019s political editor is saying about the impact of the Letwin amendment. The former Labour MP, Frank Field, says only one vote should be necessary today. The PM says it would be a good thing if the house had what was promised, a meaningful vote tonight. My fear is that the vote we have will not be meaningful. And Sky News says: The Conservative MP Nigel Evans asks the prime minister what message he would have for MPs representing leave constituencies. I think you can guess the answer .... The Tory MP Jeremy Wright says it is incumbent on all MPs to settle the debate and accept a \u201cgood deal\u201d rather than delay in expectation of a \u201cperfect deal\u201d. Johnson says it is as perfect a deal as you can get in the circumstances, while accepting \u201cthere are difficulties with it\u201d. Let\u2019s knock it through if we possibly can tonight. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden says PM is promising Tory MPs the deregulated future they dream off while promising opposition MPs a road to better workers\u2019 rights, interests Johnson rubbished while a journalist. Both cannot be true, he insists. Johnson says both are possible. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger asks how MPs can vote on a deal today when the PM\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, was on TV this morning saying no economic assessment of the deal had been done. Johnson responds by saying the deal has been welcomed by a broad range of people, including the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. The Tory MP John Baron stands up and says he will back the deal because it abolishes the \u201canti-democratic backstop\u201d. The abolition also makes a free trade deal more likely, says Baron. Johnson - unsurprisingly - agrees. Another former Tory, David Gauke, says Johnson has done well to agree a deal but asks whether he will ensure that a \u201cdeep and special relationship\u201d is agreed with the EU before the implementation period comes to an end. The PM says the 14-month period to reach a free trade deal with the EU is sufficient even though it is \u201ca blistering pace\u201d. He says detractors said he would never be able to reopen the withdrawal deal or get rid of the backstop (some would suggest he has not achieved the latter). The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas says the deal takes a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d to our social and environmental standards and that is why the PM will not put it to the British people. Johnson says she has misread the deal, as parliament makes a commitment to uphold standards. He says he hopes standards will be even higher. Justine Greening, another former Tory, asks if the PM recognises that dismissing concerns of other nations within the UK and communities within England is no way to bring Britain back together. Johnson says he didn\u2019t mean to dismiss anyone\u2019s concerns. His strong belief is the way to move the country forward is to get the deal done. He even insists getting Brexit done will give people the opportunity to stress their pro-European views. Greg Clark, another former Tory who had the whip removed, asks if Johnson will give a commitment that workers\u2019 rights in the UK will never be inferior to those in the EU. The PM says: \u201cYes, I can.\u201d There is a lot of noise in response including someone shouting \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah\u201d. Unclear whether it is a hearty endorsement of Johnson or sarcastic ... Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, says the Welsh are an \u201cafterthought\u201d and he has refused to share impact assessments. She denounces the \u201cbillionaire\u2019s Brexit\u201d. The PM responds by saying Wales voted to leave and she should respect that. This was Philip Hammond, one of 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip, for backing legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says Johnson has put a border down the Irish Sea after promising he would not do so. Why would anyone believe him again? Johnson says she is \u201csimply wrong\u201d. We have delivered in defiance of the scepticism of the party opposite who said it was necessary to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union, says the PM. The Labour MP, Hilary Benn, says the deal will ensure friction-free trade for Northern Ireland. Why is the PM so determined to deny that to the rest of the UK? Johnson says Benn believes in a delay to Brexit, which the PM does not agree with. There are reasons for treating the NI border with sensItivity and respect, says the PM. David Davis says the prime minister has achieved what was deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d two weeks ago. The DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, takes a different view. He says the deal is contrary to the deal made in 2017 that said regulatory difference could only be implemented with the agreement of the Northern Ireland assembly. The PM says the arrangements with respect to Northern Ireland that have made the deal possible are temporary. He also criticises the idea that anyone should have a veto when the overall Brexit vote was won by 52% to 48%. He also insists the deal upholds the Good Friday agreement. The PM says it will not remove workers\u2019 rights and accuses Swinson of not allowing the British public a say on the deal by preventing a general election. He also mocks what he says is the Lib Dems\u2019 lack of influence in Brussels. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, stands up and begins by saying the deal removes protections on workers\u2019 rights. The speaker, John Bercow, intervenes as she is jeered admonishing MPs for shouting her down. She blasts the PM for not giving the British public a choice on his deal. Iain Duncan Smith rises and says he will back the deal. He calls on Oliver Letwin to remove his amendment, in order to give the people \u201ca meaningful vote\u201d. The PM responds by saying it would be a great shame if the opportunity to have a meaningful vote \u201cwere to be taken away from us\u201d. He stresses that he thinks Letwin is motivated by the best of intentions. Bizarrely, the PM begins his response to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader by congratulating the England rugby team on their World Cup quarter-final victory over Australia. It\u2019s a great deal for all four home nations, says Johnson. The Scots will enjoy the benefit of their \u201cspectacular marine wealth\u201d, says the PM. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the PM and his cronies don\u2019t care about Scotland. This Tory government has sold Scotland out. He says special arrangements have been made for Northern Ireland but not for Scotland, despite a majority of Scots voting to remain in the EU. The Scottish parliament and people have been treated with contempt, says Blackford. Any and all assessments of any Brexit outcome show that Scotland and the whole of the UK will be poorer as a result of leaving the EU, he says. The Old Etonian prime minister gets some jeers, responding to Clarke, as he refers to the European \u201celite\u201d. He, unsurprisingly paints an optimistic view of trade post-Brexit under his deal. Norman Lamb, the only potential Lib Dem to vote for the deal, will not do so, he has said. It is Ken Clarke now. He asks the PM if he would accept that for the last 50 years and all four PMs whose governments Clarke served in believed EU membership enhanced Britain\u2019s place in the world and strengthened its economy. Like a schoolteacher admonishing a pupil, Johnson says he is \u201cdisappointed by the tone\u201d of Corbyn\u2019s response. Brexit gives us the opportunity to do things we have not had the opportunity to do and people want us to do, including protecting the environment and animals, says Johnson. He quotes the Conservative peer Stuart Rose, who was chair of Britain Stronger in Europe, but said the deal would be good for the economy. Corbyn does not trust his own party, says Johnson, immediately after saying it is not the time for adversarial politics. He concludes by saying the deal will take the whole of Europe forward. It is \u201cnonsense\u201d to say this is the only way of blocking no deal, says Corbyn. It would lead to a race to the bottom in regulations, insists the Labour leader. He wants the PM to confirm that if a free trade agreement is not done, the UK will revert to trade under World Trade Organization rules. Concluding, Corbyn dubs it a \u201csell-out\u201d deal. Moving on to workers\u2019 rights, Corbyn warns \u201cwe cannot give the government a blank cheque\u201d. It would hammer the economy, cost jobs and sell workers down the river, says the Labour leader, quoting Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC. He was jeered as he mentioned her name. Corbyn responded by saying she represented 6 million voters. Corbyn says he understands the fatigue and frustration in the house but we simply cannot vote for a deal worse than that which was voted down three times. Corbyn says the PM is not being honest about the effect of this deal on manufacturing and jobs. He says a vote for the deal would be a vote to cut jobs all over the country and usher in a \u201cTrump trade deal \u2026 exposing our families to chlorinated chicken\u201d. Johnson says his deal is \u201ca great prospect and a great deal\u201d and urges MPs to vote for it. Now it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s turn. He begins by thanking parliamentary staff who have come in on their day off to facilitate this session. But he says Johnson has negotiated a deal that is even worse than the original withdrawal agreement: These benches will not be duped. There is \u201cvery little appetite\u201d among EU27 leaders for any further delay, Johnson says, even of \u201cone single day\u201d. He urges MPs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He says even if he is compelled under the Benn Act to write a letter requesting an extension, he will never believe that delay is a good idea. It\u2019s time to get this thing done, he says, \u201cto end this debilitating feud\u201d. \u201cOur National Health Service will not be on the table\u201d in future trade talks, Johnson tells MPs. (The threat of a Trump-led US grab on NHS contracts is a concern for many.) The Speaker, John Bercow, has announced that MPs will vote on Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn\u2019s amendment, in which the House of Commons would withhold support from Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal until the relevant legislation has been passed. If it passes, it would force the prime minister to request an extension to Brexit by 11pm tonight, the deadline set in the Benn act. Some MPs see it as extra insurance against a no-deal Brexit, in case MPs supported Johnson\u2019s deal today \u2013 fulfilling the requirements of the Benn act \u2013 and then voted against the withdrawal bill. Without an extension in place, they feared the government could still take Britain out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Other backers of the Letwin amendment would like to support Johnson\u2019s deal, but regard it as securing extra time to scrutinise it, and perhaps secure amendments. Government sources are suggesting this morning that if Letwin passes \u2013 as appears highly likely \u2013 the whips will simply order Conservative MPs to go home, effectively boycotting the vote on the motion as amended. They are not making clear whether they will request an article 50 extension. Johnson moves on to concerns around workers\u2019 rights and protections. No one believes in lowering standards, he says, to loud heckles from opposing benches. Animal welfare standards could be higher post-Brexit, he says. Johnson now sets out the details of his new deal, struck with the EU this week. For those wondering how much it differs from Theresa May\u2019s deal, here\u2019s a handy visual guide: And here\u2019s a point-by-point breakdown of the key changes: Johnson says his deal allows the UK \u201cwhole and entire\u201d to leave the EU, but preserves the ties of friendship and cooperation. He praises the EU for its flexibility in reopening the withdrawal agreement. And he says he will listen to all MPs speaking in the Commons today. Johnson says the UK has over the years been a \u201cbackmarker\u201d in the EU, opting out of schemes such as the euro. He says we have been \u201chalfhearted Europeans\u201d, but adds that this means \u201cpart of our hearts\u201d are with Europe. It is our continent. It is precisely because we are capable of thinking both things at once \u2026 that the whole experience of the last three and a half years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive. Johnson says his deal \u201ccan heal the rift in British politics\u201d: Now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today. Bercow says he has selected the Letwin amendment for debate, and also Kyle-Wilson amendment to the second motion. And now Boris Johnson is on his feet to present his deal to the Commons. Speaker John Bercow is welcoming MPs to this extraordinary Saturday session. And here\u2019s confirmation that the hardline Brexiters of the ERG have broken from the DUP \u2013 Steve Baker and Mark Francois say they and their colleagues will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal: Tory MP Bernard Jenkin seems to be confirming that the ERG will vote for the deal, albeit not wholeheartedly: The Sunday Times\u2019 political editor, Tim Shipman, quotes an unnamed \u201cNo 10 source\u201d saying the government will abandon the vote on the deal if the Letwin amendment \u2013 which would allow parliament to withhold its approval until the legislation to implement Brexit has passed \u2013 goes through today. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says that if that happens, MPs will be asked to vote on the deal on Monday instead: Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, described Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as a \u201csellout\u201d. She told the BBC: It\u2019s actually far worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal, which was voted down repeatedly in the House of Commons. It\u2019s a sellout, it sells out industry, it sells out our rights and protection, and it potentially sells off our NHS in future trade deals to Donald Trump \u2013 and that\u2019s not something we can condone.\u201d She called on the government to provide stronger commitments on workers\u2019 rights: The protections that have been offered are simply, as I understand it \u2026 pretty similar to what Theresa May\u2019s proposed, with the ability for parliament to review any changes in EU law when it comes to workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections then vote on them that is \u2026 dependent on a Tory majority, who at the best of times would vote against any improvements in workers\u2019 rights. What we want to see is a legal lock \u2026 so we don\u2019t fall behind improvements in workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, so if the government was serious about that then they would make more robust legal protections.\u201d While Long Bailey wouldn\u2019t comment on Labour\u2019s whipping arrangement for the Letwin amendment, she did say: We don\u2019t trust Boris Johnson at all and we need to protect as much as we possibly can, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we were supportive of this amendment.\u201d MPs present and past have been out and about on the airwaves this morning setting out their positions. Former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 ejected by Boris Johnson after he voted for the Benn act \u2013 told the BBC he would vote for the Letwin amendment: This cannot be the final vote today because we do not know the full shape of the package. The Letwin amendment gives us an insurance policy that prevents us having to look at this bill against the constant threat of the government to pull the plug and crash us out on 31 October. We have to remove any risk of leaving on 31 October 31 with no deal.\u201d Tony Blair told BB Radio 4\u2019s Today programme MPs should defeat the deal: If this deal had been put before the British parliament a year ago, or two years ago, there is absolutely no way it would pass. The only reason the government can try and get it passed now is frankly \u2026 people are completely fed up with Brexit. They want it over. They want it done with.\u201d But the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, tweeted that MPs should get onboard with the plan: Sky News reports that Steve Baker, who chairs the hardline Brexiter ERG, has said the group will back the deal today: With the DUP definitely against the deal, and a number of the former Conservative MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already come onboard, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision. The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They face intense Labour pressure to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it is amended via the Letwin-Benn plan. Key players Steve Baker: the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group (ERG), is meeting first thing on Saturday. Whichever way Baker, its chair, chooses to vote will be a key indicator for the choice of other Spartans. Philip Hammond: on the other side of the Tory divide, the former chancellor is prominent among the sizeable group of rebel MPs who lost the whip last month, and could go either way. Caroline Flint: co-leader of the \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d grouping, Flint is a leading member of the Labour contingent that believes the UK should leave sooner rather than later. If she backs Johnson\u2019s deal, she could take others with her. Norman Lamb: while the rest of the Liberal Democrats are firmly against the deal, Lamb \u2013 who will step down at the next election \u2013 has long been much more Brexit-minded than his colleagues. He is believed to still be deciding, and while it will only be one vote, this could be crucial. Welcome to our live coverage of the vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The decision MPs make today could determine whether the UK leaves the EU, as Johnson has promised, on 31 October, or instead faces the prospect of requesting an extension from the European Union \u2013 and a possible general election. Peter Walker has written a guide to see you through the day. Here are the key moments: The Commons convenes at 9.30am with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions. The actual motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. Also on the order paper is the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act \u2013 better known as the Benn act. This is the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed. The Lords is also sitting to consider the same two issues.",

      "bodyText": "What MPs are voting on today MPs have a packed timetable for \u201csuper Saturday\u201d \u2013 the first time the Commons has met on a Saturday since 1982. The Speaker, John Bercow, has selected two amendments from MPs trying to change, shape and amend Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which is being presented as a motion for approval. The Letwin amendment \u2013 passed by 322 votes to 306 The rebel MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who lost the Conservative whip and now sits as an independent after blocking a no-deal Brexit, has consistently tried to use parliamentary procedure to shape how the UK leaves the EU. His latest amendment would withhold approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the legislation to enact it \u2013 the EU withdrawal bill \u2013 is passed. This might happen next week. Passing the Letwin amendment would trigger the Benn act, which compels Johnson to request an extension to article 50 if a deal cannot be agreed. Letwin said he supported Johnson\u2019s deal and it was \u201csensible\u201d, but that he wanted to make sure there is an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that if the Brexit deal is approved but something goes wrong at a later stage the government has an extension already in place so there is no possible way the country can crash out without a deal. The deadline in the Benn act is 11pm on Saturday, so this is an attempt to close down a potential loophole. The amendment has the backing of Labour: however, it has been heavily criticised for denying Johnson a conclusive vote on his deal. Other people to put their name to the amendment were Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, and the former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond. If the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill \u2013 the legislation needed to enact Brexit. There could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday \u2013 which government sources suggested could effectively become the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d denied to Johnson on Saturday. Boris Johnson\u2019s deal If the Letwin amendment has not passed, MPs will then move on to vote for or against the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. On the order paper, the government has stated: \u201cThat, in light of the new deal agreed with the European Union, which enables the United Kingdom to respect the result of the referendum on its membership of the European Union and to leave the European Union on 31 October with a deal.\u201d But if the Letwin amendment has already been accepted, the motion would not signal approval \u2013 but would say the Commons \u201cwithholds approval unless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d. Downing Street says that would make it a meaningless vote. The Kyle amendment This is attached to a second motion put down by the government on Saturday, which asks MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit. The Labour MP Peter Kyle has tabled an amendment that calls for a second referendum. He tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that this will give greater focus and clarity to the debate and lessen the anxiety for colleagues grappling with the very real challenges \u2026 by separating them out.\u201d The text of his amendment says any final decision on the future relationship between the UK and EU \u201cshould be subject to a confirmatory referendum before exit day\u201d. However, the government is not expected to move the no-deal motion \u2013 because Johnson wants to leave the EU with a deal.",

      "body": "<p>The campaigning group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a> is always on the lookout for what it calls \u201cthermonuclear hypocrisy\u201d in politics, and specifically on Brexit. So when, in August, its founders belatedly came across an article that Michael Gove had written for the <em>Daily Mail</em> in March 2019, they felt they had hit the jackpot. In it, Gove, who is now chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 or more prosaically, the man charged with making Brexit happen, deal or no deal \u2013 had noted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was like, \u2018Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government\u2019s no-deal Titanic,\u2019\u201d exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/led-by-donkeys-reveal-identities-brexit-billboards-posters\" title=\"\">Led By Donkeys</a>. \u201cThe leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they <em>are</em> claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.\u201d</p> <p>Led By Donkeys, which came into existence only in January, had already had considerable success, and a lot of fun, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted, and probably wished they hadn\u2019t. The project started with blowing up tweets \u2013 from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47801288\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> and Leave tub-thumpers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/billboard-campaign-reminds-voters-of-mps-brexit-promises\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/19/led-by-donkeys-billboards-nigel-farage-ann-widdecombe\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage</a> \u2013 and slapping them on billboards in the dead of night. But the group quickly became more ambitious and its work has appeared everywhere from a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=People%27s+Vote+London+in+March+led+by+donkeys+banner&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.mediatel.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2Fled-by-donkeys.png\" title=\"\">40m x 20m banner</a> at the People\u2019s Vote demonstration in London in March to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bydonkeys/status/1113827097930280960\" title=\"\">projections on the cliffs of Dover</a>. Their targets are overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, though Jeremy Corbyn was mocked with a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/poster-campaign-challenges-jeremy-corbyn-to-back-a-peoples-vote_uk_5c62a328e4b0ffd8515df4c2\" title=\"\">billboard</a> that had his Twitter handle but was otherwise left blank, so that people could write on to it what they would like the Labour leader to say on the issue.</p> <p>Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/04/led-by-donkeys-billboard-crusaders-launch-campaign-in-london-during-trump-visit\" title=\"\">projected his approval ratings</a> (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/boris-johnson-s-comments-on-donald-trump-1-6084635\" title=\"\">quite stupefying ignorance</a>\u201d was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on <em>The Late Show </em>and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/brexit-the-horror-film-billboards-mock-governments-get-ready-campaign-led-by-donkeys\" title=\"\">posters</a> satirising the government\u2019s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f8218a2d8db42c5ad07a2baf1c519ddcd99815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f8218a2d8db42c5ad07a2baf1c519ddcd99815/0_212_5760_3249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Led By Donkeys\u2019 first billboards, in Leeds, January 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Led By Donkeys\u2019 first billboards, in Leeds, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/visible-from-space-gove-portrait-appears-on-beach-in-brexit-protest\" title=\"\">sand sculpture</a> of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK\u2019s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove\u2019s face and his comment (\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal\u201d) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach.</p> <p>Stewart smiles. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.\u2019 And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s really impressive!\u2019 So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he\u2019ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a wild, confounding and very busy few months for the Led By Donkeys team who, besides Stewart, are Oliver Knowles, 44, James Sadri and Will Rose, both 40. At the beginning of the year they were unknown; now they are one of the loudest voices in opposition to the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Drone footage of the Redcar sand installation has been watched 1.1m times.

The founders, anonymous initially, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/25/led-by-donkeys-reveal-identities-brexit-billboards-posters\" title=\"\">\u201cunmasked\u201d</a> in May by the rightwing Guido Fawkes website. All four had worked at Greenpeace at one point \u2013 two of them still do \u2013 leading them to be described as \u201clefty environmentalists\u201d. For some, Led By Donkeys epitomises the \u201cRemoaner\u201d camp, preaching to other like-minded zealots (and hardly anyone else) mainly on social media. Certainly, it is not always clear how much damage their stinging attacks on Leave-promoting politicians are really inflicting. After skewering the March to Leave, and especially Farage\u2019s half-hearted involvement, Led By Donkeys was dismayed to watch the Brexit Party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-win-big-wake-up-call-westminster\" title=\"\">perform buoyantly</a> in the European elections in May, winning the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions, and 32% overall.</p> <p>These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don\u2019t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government; in fact, they started the project for \u201ccatharsis\u201d: they could either laugh or cry \u2013 and they would rather laugh. And that\u2019s still true today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/12/brexit-the-horror-film-billboards-mock-governments-get-ready-campaign-led-by-donkeys\">Brexit the horror film: billboards mock government's 'get ready' campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say, though, that there isn\u2019t serious intent behind the project. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?\u2019\u201d says Stewart. \u201cLook, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?\u201d</p> <p>Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it\u2019s told with vim in a new book by the founders, <em>Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends </em><em>With a Ladder Took on Brexit</em>. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders\u2019 connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. \u201cIt just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,\u201d says Stewart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5a885d2f3bb57f60b2937182aa6a050d8e3182d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a885d2f3bb57f60b2937182aa6a050d8e3182d/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Jacob Rees Mogg billboard in London, September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Jacob Rees Mogg billboard in London, September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace\u2019s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose \u2013 who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives \u2013 is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/13/brexit-remain-radicalisation-fbpe-peoples-vote\">\u2018Loud, obsessive, tribal\u2019: the radicalisation of remain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.\u201d They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on \u201clions led by the donkeys\u201d, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area.</p> <p>The team didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: \u201cWe come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we\u2019ve got, and, speaking personally, isn\u2019t that bothered by getting a conviction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,\u201d adds Sadri. \u201cIt feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.\u201d</p> <p>Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. \u201cIt very nearly didn\u2019t continue as a project,\u201d says Knowles, the man up the \u00a390 B&amp;Q ladder that night. \u201cWe were covered in paste, couldn\u2019t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing.

I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.\u201d</p> <p>Posting the politicians\u2019 quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe \u2013 \u201cHomosexual acts are wrongful\u201d \u2013 on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at \u201cface value\u201d. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can\u2019t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet \u2013 but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a49cfe13ed25e4740a70156a90721cb63d785664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49cfe13ed25e4740a70156a90721cb63d785664/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds, January 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds, January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media \u2013 albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet\u2019s gone viral, the local newspaper\u2019s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,\u201d they write in their book. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.\u201d</p> <p>For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they\u2019re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn\u2019t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and \u201cnot let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS\u201d. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn\u2019t have last time. Knowles says: \u201cPeople have told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive.

      "bodyText": "The campaigning group Led By Donkeys is always on the lookout for what it calls \u201cthermonuclear hypocrisy\u201d in politics, and specifically on Brexit. So when, in August, its founders belatedly came across an article that Michael Gove had written for the Daily Mail in March 2019, they felt they had hit the jackpot. In it, Gove, who is now chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 or more prosaically, the man charged with making Brexit happen, deal or no deal \u2013 had noted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.\u201d \u201cIt was like, \u2018Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government\u2019s no-deal Titanic,\u2019\u201d exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of Led By Donkeys. \u201cThe leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they are claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.\u201d Led By Donkeys, which came into existence only in January, had already had considerable success, and a lot of fun, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted, and probably wished they hadn\u2019t. The project started with blowing up tweets \u2013 from the likes of David Cameron and Leave tub-thumpers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage \u2013 and slapping them on billboards in the dead of night. But the group quickly became more ambitious and its work has appeared everywhere from a 40m x 20m banner at the People\u2019s Vote demonstration in London in March to projections on the cliffs of Dover. Their targets are overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, though Jeremy Corbyn was mocked with a billboard that had his Twitter handle but was otherwise left blank, so that people could write on to it what they would like the Labour leader to say on the issue. Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for \u201cquite stupefying ignorance\u201d was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government\u2019s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march. Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK\u2019s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove\u2019s face and his comment (\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal\u201d) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach. Stewart smiles. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.\u2019 And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s really impressive!\u2019 So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he\u2019ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.\u201d It has been a wild, confounding and very busy few months for the Led By Donkeys team who, besides Stewart, are Oliver Knowles, 44, James Sadri and Will Rose, both 40. At the beginning of the year they were unknown; now they are one of the loudest voices in opposition to the government\u2019s Brexit policy. Drone footage of the Redcar sand installation has been watched 1.1m times. The Led By Donkeys coverage of the pro-Brexit march in March \u2013 which took the form of regular updates to their 300,000 Twitter followers, long after the media pack had departed \u2013 was perhaps primarily responsible for revealing it as a lacklustre, poorly attended shambles. Yet, while the Led By Donkeys team are heroes to many who would like a second referendum, their work is not universally adored. The founders, anonymous initially, were \u201cunmasked\u201d in May by the rightwing Guido Fawkes website. All four had worked at Greenpeace at one point \u2013 two of them still do \u2013 leading them to be described as \u201clefty environmentalists\u201d. For some, Led By Donkeys epitomises the \u201cRemoaner\u201d camp, preaching to other like-minded zealots (and hardly anyone else) mainly on social media. Certainly, it is not always clear how much damage their stinging attacks on Leave-promoting politicians are really inflicting. After skewering the March to Leave, and especially Farage\u2019s half-hearted involvement, Led By Donkeys was dismayed to watch the Brexit Party perform buoyantly in the European elections in May, winning the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions, and 32% overall. These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don\u2019t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government; in fact, they started the project for \u201ccatharsis\u201d: they could either laugh or cry \u2013 and they would rather laugh. And that\u2019s still true today. \u201cYou just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.\u201d That\u2019s not to say, though, that there isn\u2019t serious intent behind the project. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?\u2019\u201d says Stewart. \u201cLook, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?\u201d Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it\u2019s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders\u2019 connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. \u201cIt just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,\u201d says Stewart. The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace\u2019s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose \u2013 who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives \u2013 is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters. No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: \u201cBritain faces a simple and inescapable choice \u2013 stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.\u201d They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on \u201clions led by the donkeys\u201d, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area. The team didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: \u201cWe come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we\u2019ve got, and, speaking personally, isn\u2019t that bothered by getting a conviction.\u201d \u201cIt felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,\u201d adds Sadri. \u201cIt feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.\u201d Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. \u201cIt very nearly didn\u2019t continue as a project,\u201d says Knowles, the man up the \u00a390 B&amp;Q ladder that night. \u201cWe were covered in paste, couldn\u2019t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn\u2019t feel like it was going anywhere.\u201d A little too amateurish perhaps? Stewart bristles a little. \u201cI would describe it as guerrilla-style,\u201d he smiles, then relents. \u201cNo, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.\u201d The plan was always to combine the analogue \u2013 billboards \u2013 with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the Guardian columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in; there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about it at all,\u201d remembers Hyde, \u201cbut as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It\u2019s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea \u2013 one of the few things on what I suppose you\u2019d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another \u2018letter to the Times from 100 businessmen\u2019.\u201d Led By Donkeys describes what it does as \u201cpolitical theatre\u201d and it\u2019s most effective when, whether it\u2019s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can\u2019t just thumb past it on your smartphone. \u201cPeople talk about how the problems in today\u2019s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,\u201d says Sadri. \u201cSo there\u2019s something about taking a politician\u2019s tweet \u2013 something that flies past you at a million miles per hour \u2013 and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody\u2019s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: \u2018We have to look at that if it\u2019s a sunny day, if it\u2019s pissing with rain.\u2019 And it gives you time to digest it if you\u2019re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.\u201d The \u201canarchic, guerrilla\u201d phase of Led By Donkeys actually lasted for little more than a week, but took in cover-of-darkness assignments to Romford, which voted 70% Leave, and Dover where, their pasting skills improving, they covered four sites in a night. But life was becoming increasingly complicated at work and home \u2013 all four have two young children each \u2013 and when the idea of crowdfunding to rent billboard space came up, they decided to dip a toe in. Not only would it make them legit, but it would allow Led By Donkeys posters to cover the entire country, not just towns that could be reached at night and get them home for the morning school run. They set a target of \u00a310,000, which they hit in three hours; by the end of the day they had raised \u00a330,000. The total now is over \u00a3600,000. Going straight hasn\u2019t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved. \u201cI did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cSo suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn\u2019t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.\u201d Still, even if they are \u201cmired in Excel spreadsheets\u201d now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed \u201cSOS\u201d on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. \u201cQuite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,\u201d noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament\u2019s representative in the Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we\u2019re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,\u201d says Knowles. \u201cAnd our premise is that there\u2019s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren\u2019t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?\u201d The concepts can also become more outsized. \u201cBeing in Redcar,\u201d says Rose, \u201cwatching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed \u2013 that was a different level of excitement.\u201d Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as \u201csecret heroes\u201d of the campaign. But it\u2019s hard to tell what impact, if any, they have had on the political discourse. \u201cI have absolutely no idea!\u201d says Hyde. \u201cI mean it all gets worse, doesn\u2019t it\u2026 We know politicians lie or make promises they can\u2019t keep, but that perception seems to have achieved full spectrum dominance on all sides of our political divides. I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.\u201d Posting the politicians\u2019 quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe \u2013 \u201cHomosexual acts are wrongful\u201d \u2013 on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at \u201cface value\u201d. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can\u2019t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet \u2013 but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them. It\u2019s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media \u2013 albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet\u2019s gone viral, the local newspaper\u2019s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,\u201d they write in their book. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.\u201d For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they\u2019re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn\u2019t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and \u201cnot let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS\u201d. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn\u2019t have last time. Knowles says: \u201cPeople have told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive. And there was passion and emotion behind the Leave campaign.\u2019 Any new campaign has got to get to the things people love and that\u2019s the NHS, values, education and much more positively framed.\u201d If it comes down to passion \u2013 well, here, Led By Donkeys think they will be in their element. And even though they are doing things legally these days, the subversive spirit remains. \u201cWe are always on the look out for something that would take us back out there,\u201d says Sadri mischievously. \u201cWe were slightly disappointed when the government decided to put its \u2018Get Ready for Brexit\u2019 posters on digital screens and not on actual physical billboards, because we\u2019d been honing our \u2018cut-out giant letters and re-word giant billboards\u2019 technique.\u201d \u201cThe ladder is safely stored,\u201d says Knowles, \u201cand is ready to come out again.\u201d \u2022 Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit is published by Atlantic (\u00a310).

      "bodyText": "Why are workers\u2019 rights at stake in Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal? The PM\u2019s renegotiated deal opens the way to a much looser relationship with the EU than envisaged by his predecessor, Theresa May, and allows for more \u201cdivergence\u201d with EU regulations. As such, instead of writing into the legally binding withdrawal agreement that the UK will abide by EU standards on workers\u2019 rights and the environment, these \u201clevel playing field\u201d commitments have been shifted to the forward-looking political declaration. In practice, it will be up to the government that negotiates the free trade deal \u2013 most likely after a general election \u2013 to decide how strong a commitment to EU rules it is prepared to make. What promises is the government making to protect workers\u2019 rights? While labour rights \u2013 like a blizzard of other rules and regulations \u2013 would no longer be underpinned by EU law, the government has promised to write a series of commitments into the Withdrawal Act (the legislation implementing Brexit). On Friday night, the government announced that ministers would be obliged to make a statement each time any new law could affect employment rights, and say whether they would comply with EU standards. And the government would also report regularly on changes to EU standards and whether the UK planned to mirror them. MPs would then be given a vote on these reports, to approve or reject the government\u2019s plan. Ministers also pointed out that the government announced an employment reform bill in the Queen\u2019s speech that would increase standards, and insisted they had no intention of reducing standards. However, Labour\u2019s employment rights spokesperson, Laura Pidcock, insisted those pledges were not worth the paper they were written on \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn claimed Johnson was \u201cfiring the starting gun on a race to the bottom\u201d. Johnson has also repeatedly stressed his insistence that while environmental standards will no longer be guaranteed by EU law, the UK will set higher standards, including in an environment bill, announced in this week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. What else might be up for grabs in future trade deals? According to Johnson in the debate on Saturday, not the NHS \u2013 which Labour fears could be opened up to exploitation by US corporations as part of a trade agreement with Donald Trump\u2019s White House. When he flew to the G7 summit in Biarritz in August, the PM outlined a long list of trade barriers he said faced British business hoping to export to the US market \u2013 but declined to say what he could offer to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d government in return. Johnson has repeatedly insisted NHS contracts will not be part of any future trade deal and put hospital funding at the heart of his bid for re-election. However, Labour has accused him of being willing to put it up for sale. What economic assessment has the government done of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal? Extraordinarily, it hasn\u2019t done any. Challenged by the Lib Dem Luciana Berger about why the government had failed to publish forecasts, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no level of analysis that is probably going to change her vote and her mind. Indeed, as a former Treasury minister one of the things I\u2019m always aware of, is indeed it\u2019s difficult to model a deal that was only made on Thursday.\u201d He added that it would be difficult to model changes to policy by the new European commission, and to the global economic backdrop.

      "body": "<p>After more than three years of parliamentary events touted as momentous, we will get one that definitely lives up to the billing \u2013 the first Saturday sitting of the Commons since the Falklands conflict, in which there will be a potentially knife-edge vote on a plan that could shape the UK\u2019s future for a generation.</p> <h2>What is the schedule for Saturday?</h2> <p>The Commons <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmagenda/OP191019.pdf\">convenes at 9.30am</a> with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f254e43d24c8e44b3c57a6ca48fd9cbaa99852e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f254e43d24c8e44b3c57a6ca48fd9cbaa99852e2/0_319_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking during a debate in the House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson will begin proceedings with a statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow.</p> <p>The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. If the government loses the vote, the prime minister could then seek a vote on leaving without a deal, which is the only other way to avoid the so-called Benn act \u2013 the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed or no deal is not approved.</p> <h2>Will there be amendments?</h2> <p>Some have already been tabled, for example one to extend the Brexit deadline. Another amendment <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterkyle/status/1185215551267921920\">has been tabled</a> to secure a second referendum, but this would be attached to the no-deal motion, so seems unlikely to go to a vote.</p> <h2>Will there definitely be an all-or-nothing vote?</h2> <p>The big decision could be delayed again. A potentially key amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and others would withhold full approval for the Brexit deal until all the associated legislation was passed.</p> <p>This would seem likely to require another extension, and would delay the real moment of truth for MPs. One reason for this amendment would be to prevent the possibility of hardline Brexit Conservatives approving the deal \u2013 thus removing the conditions of the Benn act \u2013 but then voting down the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, which implements the legally binding treaty, and so forcing no deal anyway.</p> <p>Labour is understood to be likely to back this amendment, and former Tory MPs including Amber Rudd and David Gauke have said they would vote for it.</p> <h2>Will MPs know the full implications of the deal?</h2> <p>Not really. The deal was cobbled together and agreed with the EU in a huge rush, and MPs will have only a few hours of debate in the Commons before making a hugely important decision. Downing Street has said MPs will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/18/boris-johnson-launches-frantic-sales-pitch-of-brexit-deal-ahead-of-commons-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8#block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8\">not see official economic impact assessments</a> of the plan in advance, despite some requesting this.</p> <h2>What happens if the plan passes?</h2> <p>If it passes unamended, this would still be the first stage of the process, and even with Downing Street promising that MPs would work around the clock as needed, there is no guarantee everything will be done by 31 October. No 10 would hope to present the bill to the Commons as early as Monday. If the deal motion is amended, for example by the Letwin-Benn plan, a delay to departure is more likely.</p> <h2>Do we get no deal if the plan is rejected?</h2> <p>Most likely not, even though Johnson seems set to frame the vote in these terms, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, briefly startled remain-minded MPs by telling reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/oct/17/it-has-to-be-now-jean-claude-juncker-claims-eu-wont-further-delay-brexit-video\">he did not think</a> another Brexit extension would be granted. EU sources <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-and-eu-reach-brexit-deal-without-dup-backing\">have said</a> that if Johnson\u2019s deal is rejected, meaning the Benn act would come into force, they would not reject a UK request for another extension.</p> <h2>Which MPs are key to whether it passes?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556/431_288_2943_1766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and leader, Arlene Foster, have said they won\u2019t back the deal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and leader, Arlene Foster, have said they won\u2019t back the deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the DUP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/dup-boris-johnson-brexit-deal\">definitely against</a> the deal, and a number of the former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already said they would back the bill, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision.</p> <p>The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/john-mcdonnell-expects-labour-mps-to-hold-firm-on-brexit-deal\">face intense Labour pressure</a> to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it was amended via the Letwin-Benn plan.</p> <h2>So will it pass \u2013 and if so, is it all over?</h2> <p>On the first point \u2013 no one knows. The final tally could come within a couple of votes. It is worth remembering that Theresa May\u2019s defeats on her Brexit deal ended up being heavier than expected. However, some momentum seem to be with Johnson. As to the second question: no, not at all.

      "bodyText": "After more than three years of parliamentary events touted as momentous, we will get one that definitely lives up to the billing \u2013 the first Saturday sitting of the Commons since the Falklands conflict, in which there will be a potentially knife-edge vote on a plan that could shape the UK\u2019s future for a generation. What is the schedule for Saturday? The Commons convenes at 9.30am with a statement from Boris Johnson on the Brexit deal he has negotiated with the EU, followed by questions. The motion on the deal follows afterwards, to be opened by another minister. It is only when this debate begins that we will know which amendments have been selected for a vote by the Speaker, John Bercow. The number of amendments will affect the length of the process, so the key vote could come any time from mid-afternoon to early evening. If the government loses the vote, the prime minister could then seek a vote on leaving without a deal, which is the only other way to avoid the so-called Benn act \u2013 the backbench-created law that would compel Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if his deal is not passed or no deal is not approved. Will there be amendments? Some have already been tabled, for example one to extend the Brexit deadline. Another amendment has been tabled to secure a second referendum, but this would be attached to the no-deal motion, so seems unlikely to go to a vote. Will there definitely be an all-or-nothing vote? The big decision could be delayed again. A potentially key amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and others would withhold full approval for the Brexit deal until all the associated legislation was passed. This would seem likely to require another extension, and would delay the real moment of truth for MPs. One reason for this amendment would be to prevent the possibility of hardline Brexit Conservatives approving the deal \u2013 thus removing the conditions of the Benn act \u2013 but then voting down the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, which implements the legally binding treaty, and so forcing no deal anyway. Labour is understood to be likely to back this amendment, and former Tory MPs including Amber Rudd and David Gauke have said they would vote for it. Will MPs know the full implications of the deal? Not really. The deal was cobbled together and agreed with the EU in a huge rush, and MPs will have only a few hours of debate in the Commons before making a hugely important decision. Downing Street has said MPs will not see official economic impact assessments of the plan in advance, despite some requesting this. What happens if the plan passes? If it passes unamended, this would still be the first stage of the process, and even with Downing Street promising that MPs would work around the clock as needed, there is no guarantee everything will be done by 31 October. No 10 would hope to present the bill to the Commons as early as Monday. If the deal motion is amended, for example by the Letwin-Benn plan, a delay to departure is more likely. Do we get no deal if the plan is rejected? Most likely not, even though Johnson seems set to frame the vote in these terms, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, briefly startled remain-minded MPs by telling reporters he did not think another Brexit extension would be granted. EU sources have said that if Johnson\u2019s deal is rejected, meaning the Benn act would come into force, they would not reject a UK request for another extension. Which MPs are key to whether it passes? With the DUP definitely against the deal, and a number of the former Tory MPs who lost the whip last month seemingly onboard, two groups will be vital. First are the so-called \u201cSpartans\u201d, the most hardline of Tory Brexiters. Some of these have already said they would back the bill, and others could follow \u2013 but with the DUP opposed, this is still a finely balanced decision. The other group set to be endlessly pestered by Johnson\u2019s team are Labour MPs from leave-voting areas who support a deal, such as Caroline Flint, Stephen Kinnock and others. They face intense Labour pressure to vote against it, but could still potentially be persuaded the vote the other way. These MPs might be more likely to back the deal if it was amended via the Letwin-Benn plan. So will it pass \u2013 and if so, is it all over? On the first point \u2013 no one knows. The final tally could come within a couple of votes. It is worth remembering that Theresa May\u2019s defeats on her Brexit deal ended up being heavier than expected. However, some momentum seem to be with Johnson. As to the second question: no, not at all. Even if the deal is passed, this is but the first step in a long parliamentary process, which would in turn shape an evolving and still very controversial departure process over many years. Prepare for much, much more of this. MPs to watch Steve Baker: the Tory hard Brexiters\u2019 club, the European Research Group, met first thing on Saturday.
