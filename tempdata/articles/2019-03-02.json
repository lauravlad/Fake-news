      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/glenda-jackson\" title=\"\">Glenda Jackson</a>, 82, enters the hotel bar in an ankle-length puffer coat and woolly hat that, in spite of her extravagant and long-held scorn for vanity, she complains makes her look as if she doesn\u2019t have hair. She is in New York for a Broadway run of King Lear, a fresh take on the title role <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/05/king-lear-review-glenda-jackson-old-vic\" title=\"\">she played in London</a> three years ago, although she has long since forgotten the lines. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, poetry isn\u2019t easier to memorise than prose. \u201cNo,\u201d memorising doesn\u2019t become harder the less you do it, and \u201cNo!\u201d \u2013 preposterous suggestion \u2013 one doesn\u2019t get used to the adrenaline of appearing on stage. \u201cYou never become accustomed to it!\u201d says Jackson, blinking vigorously before laughing with gusto. \u201cWe\u2019re all sadomasochists, let\u2019s face it. We all enter into this horrific, undiscovered space.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of all this, it should be said, is neither grand nor \u201cscary\u201d \u2013 as Jackson, or any woman expressing herself in terms stronger than mild disdain, is wont to be described \u2013 but impish, with a light touch of hooliganism. One gets the feeling Jackson never agrees with the premise of a question as a matter of principle. For years, people have been trying to describe her peculiar force with reference to her peculiar beauty, likening her face to, among other things, \u201ca Francis Bacon portrait of itself\u201d (the LA Times), \u201ca wonderful map\u201d (Jane Birkin) and, in a line from a Time magazine profile of the 1970s, \u201ca fire whose shadows torture the walls even as one is warmed by it\u201d, which is to say she is difficult to fit into pre-existing categories. Something about her \u2013 her severity, her glaring resistance to anti-ageing protocols, above all, her decision to quit acting to sit in parliament for 23 years \u2013 continues to be bafflingly avant garde.</p> <p>Oddly, Jackson most reminds me today of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen</a>. Both have played Lear and speak with what sounds, these days, like a period received pronunciation, bolted on by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in Jackson\u2019s case and the Royal Shakespeare Company in McKellen\u2019s, and which slips in moments of duress back to its northern origins (Jackson was born on the Wirral). Both are warm and funny, with the slightly exaggerated style of the mid\u201120th-century English stage actor. Typical opener: \u201cI was on tour with the RSC doing Hedda Gabler... \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66ffbc05db19a2682a4463562cb86a8824f23194\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ffbc05db19a2682a4463562cb86a8824f23194/0_723_3449_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhys Ifans (Fool) and Glenda Jackson (King Lear) in King Lear at the Old Vic, London, in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"947\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Rhys Ifans in King Lear in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m surprised she isn\u2019t a dame, I say to Jackson at one point and she looks wildly indignant. \u201cI\u2019m a republican!\u201d she says. Yes, but you\u2019ve already got a CBE, I say. \u201cYes, well.\u201d She smiles, briefly, at her own perversity.</p> <p>The Broadway production of Lear, directed by Sam Gold and co-starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ruth-wilson\" title=\"\">Ruth Wilson</a> as both Cordelia and the Fool, is an entirely new show. Apart from Jackson, there is no overlap with the Deborah Warner-directed Lear of 2016, although, as in that production, the actors will be in modern dress. It is, says Jackson, no help whatsoever having done the play before. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that after the last performance of whatever the play is, all the words are gone. I think that\u2019s redolent of my early years in rep.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cI spend every night learning my words.\u201d</p> <p>It is an extraordinary feat. Last year, I saw her in the Broadway production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/30/three-tall-women-review-glenda-jackson-broadway-edward-albee\" title=\"\">Edward Albee\u2019s Three Tall Women</a> \u2013 she was savagely good \u2013 in which she was on stage for the whole play and shouldered the bulk of the lines. (She went on to win the best actress Tony.) The physical demands alone must be stratospheric, although in the case of Lear, she says, \u201cthere\u2019s an enormous energy in this play. And, if you dig into it, it just drags and forces you along. It\u2019s like a fucking jet stream. You just have to be able to release it.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t imagine what weathering that kind of energy surge does to a person on a daily basis. Jackson looks incredulous. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s presupposing it\u2019s not a profession I\u2019m engaged in! It\u2019s sheer hard work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bd6bf9ed2019469404c9803ab57b447fc0209d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bd6bf9ed2019469404c9803ab57b447fc0209d2/0_1447_4480_3022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenda Jackson in Edward Albee\u2019s Three Tall Women, directed by Joe Mantello, at the Golden Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Edward Albee\u2019s Three Tall Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigitte Lacombe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from the politics of opening up Shakespeare\u2019s greatest roles to women \u2013 specifically, to women who are not 22 \u2013 Jackson\u2019s casting as Lear illustrates the limitations of how gender is policed and performed. \u201cWhen I was still in parliament, I would visit old people\u2019s homes and I just became aware that, at both extremes of age \u2013 babies and the very elderly \u2013 those absolutes [of gender] begin to fracture. And I think that\u2019s very interesting. I wasn\u2019t interested in \u2018gender-bender\u2019 kind of theatre, but I think in a play in which [Lear] says, I\u2019m 80 and I\u2019m losing it, that was quite useful.\u201d</p> <p>The greater wonder, of course, is that Jackson is in a position to be cast in anything at all. During her two decades as MP for Hampstead and Highgate (latterly Hampstead and Kilburn), it seemed fairly certain that her life as an actor was over. Even before that, during her early days at Rada, and long before her successes of the 1970s, which included two Oscars, Jackson was warned that she was unlikely to get much work until she was in her 40s. She was, she was told by the principal of Rada on graduating, a character actor, a sly reference perhaps to her origins as the daughter of a builder from Birkenhead, who before she got into drama school worked at Boots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a64e98d64824f268d019af7c4094aba6a25d610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a64e98d64824f268d019af7c4094aba6a25d610/510_79_2974_4066/731.jpg\" alt=\"IAN RICHARDSON as Jean-Paul Marat, GLENDA JACKSON as Charlotte Corday and PATRICK MAGEE as De Sade in MARAT / SADE (1967)\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Marat/Sade in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the standards of her own family, wanting to become an actor was an outlandish ambition. Where did she get her gumption, I wonder? \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was gumption, as such. Of course I\u2019ve rationalised this over the years. But I think I felt there had to be more to life than I was experiencing, and perhaps that I had more to offer than was being asked of me.\u201d After a friend dragged her along to an amateur theatre group, Jackson wrote to Rada and boldly asked to audition for a scholarship place. She got through the audition, only to be told that no scholarship existed. \u201cThen the manager of Boots wrote to Cheshire county council and they paid for me to go.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson\u2019s acting ambitions seemed strange to her parents. \u201cI don\u2019t think they ever came to see me in anything. If I was working in London, they wouldn\u2019t come down.\u201d Once, she thinks, they came to see her in a play in Crewe, but as far as she knows they never saw any of her films. She is sanguine about this, shrugging it off as she seems to most presumptions of injury. When Jackson went home to Birkenhead, her mother \u201cwould always check to see if I had holes in my shoes. That was the big thing. How bad was my financial situation?\u201d It was not an unreasonable concern for the first 10 years of her career, when Jackson was jobbing around in poorly paid stage roles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a589f51f74c384f603d42790fca691893a12d68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a589f51f74c384f603d42790fca691893a12d68/0_0_3136_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenda Jackson and Oliver Reed in Women In Love\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Oliver Reed in Women In Love, for which she won an Oscar (below).

After years in classical theatre, she was cast by Peter Brook in the 1967 film of his avant garde classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/21/marat-sade-review\" title=\"\">Marat/Sade</a> and, from there, appeared in a run of movies that established her as one of the most successful actors of the time, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/18/sunday-bloody-sunday-dvd-review\" title=\"\">John Schlesinger\u2019s Sunday Bloody Sunday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/08/ken-russell-women-in-love-1970\" title=\"\">Ken Russell\u2019s Women In Love</a>, with Oliver Reed and Alan Bates, for which she won her first Oscar. (The other Academy Award was for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070819/\" title=\"\">A Touch Of Class</a>, a dated-seeming romcom from 1973, opposite George Segal.) Her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066652/\" title=\"\">1971 BBC series Elizabeth R</a> is still remembered as one of the most electrifying performances ever seen on television.</p> <p>What is curious about Jackson turning away from acting is not that she had other ambitions, nor that her conscience \u2013 she has said she stood for parliament out of rage against what Margaret Thatcher was doing to the country \u2013 compelled her to change course; rather, it is her insistence over the years that there was almost no cost involved. Sensible people understand that celebrity is sordid and, apart from the financial rewards, delivers no fun. And yet to be feted, one minute, as one of the most talented actors of her generation \u2013 and, more than that, as a movie star and a great beauty \u2013 and the next, to be grumbling on the back benches of the House of Commons might be imagined, at the very least, to be existentially punishing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53684f170ac4ae268daadd0013da43d1c8590397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53684f170ac4ae268daadd0013da43d1c8590397/253_87_1808_2262/799.jpg\" alt=\"Glenda Jackson in the 1971 BBC series Elizabeth R\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the 1971 BBC series Elizabeth R. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when I try to ask Jackson if the shift out of acting into politics was a culture shock, she won\u2019t have it \u2013 neither the notion that there was any sacrifice involved, nor that she was living in a rarefied celebrity world in the first place.</p> <p>Nervously, I suggest to Jackson that she enjoyed a period of solid movie stardom in the early to mid-1970s and she blinks, painfully, to allow that this was the case. And she did the red carpet and the Oscars, and \u2013 \u201cNo,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cThey weren\u2019t like that. No, no, no, no. The first Oscars I was invited to was a small event.\u201d</p> <p>They weren\u2019t a beauty pageant in the way they are now? \u201cNo.\u201d Nonetheless, she was still a woman in an industry in which her looks were frequently commented upon. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, ever.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh, well.\u201d She puts her nose in the air. \u201cYou read different papers to me, because I don\u2019t remember that and I don\u2019t think I was ever given a part for the way I looked.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t what I meant. I meant that you were considered, by an industry that values these things to the point of corrosion, to be very beautiful, I say. Jackson looks at me as if I have said something monstrously rude. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, particularly, and the thing about England is you can do your job and go home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I will always defend my party, but we\u2019re not exactly covering ourselves with glory at the moment, are we?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t know what I am trying to get out of her here, other than some recognition that moving between worlds must have engendered some whiplash; that to be a woman in the public gaze entails some damage. She will permit that she avoided the trap of learning to love the spotlight. \u201cYes, it can be utterly destructive, no question. But I was very lucky \u2013 I was able to go between the two modes.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>She was helped, too, by her upbringing. \u201cBecause I was the eldest of four girls and, you know, growing up in the north-west of England, the heinous crime is to get above yourself. \u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019\u201d \u2013 she slips into broad Liverpudlian \u2013 \u201c\u2018she\u2019s getting a bit too big for her shoes.\u2019 One of the greatest blessings of my life is that I had a very strong work ethic. You don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. It\u2019s very simple. And that\u2019s been a great strength. You don\u2019t always do the work you want to do, but you have to go to work.\u201d</p> <p>There is no overlap, she says, between performing on stage as an actor and performing in the House of Commons. \u201cIt\u2019s lit. You\u2019re not in the dark. It makes a difference. We talk blandly about the fourth wall [in the theatre] and that is part of it. When it\u2019s a debate in the House of Commons, they know where you\u2019re coming from, you know where they\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s very structured; you can\u2019t say certain things. It\u2019s much more symbolic. Occasionally you get direct, genuine arguments, but that\u2019s quite rare.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c6a52e20863c866210f0da0a7333f5515d753fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c6a52e20863c866210f0da0a7333f5515d753fd/0_0_3588_4090/877.jpg\" alt=\"Actor and former MP Glenda Jackson, photographed against a blue background, 2017\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When my son told me he was going to write for the Mail on Sunday, I said, well, I\u2019ll have to emigrate!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Floyd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackson has said in the past that she was fond of Jeremy Corbyn when he was her fellow backbench MP, but hasn\u2019t been impressed with his performance over Brexit.

Anybody, please, tell me what are we doing? It all comes down, in the end, to trying to keep your job. Bizarre.\u201d She finds it hard to discern what the strategy is. \u201cIt\u2019s simply easier to say that there is none. It\u2019s crazed. I\u2019m a big admirer of her and I think the way she\u2019s been treated is utterly disgraceful. I don\u2019t only mean by her own party, but the way the press has presented her.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so surprised by this that I\u2019m not sure, for a moment, that we\u2019re actually talking about the prime minister.</p> <p>What, Theresa May? \u201cYes! I think it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful. There she is, slogging away, God love her.\u201d</p> <p>But she has vacillated\u2026</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t vacillate!

Vociferous enemy of Thatcher, vigorous anti-Tory and a woman for whom Tony Blair was too right wing: did she really say that she is an admirer of Theresa May?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve certainly admired her in the way she has handled herself over Brexit, yes! I do admire her for her tenacity, trying to deliver the referendum result to the people of our country, even though I disapproved of it.\u201d To hold a second referendum, she says, would be absurd. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop people then saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s have a third?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jackson\u2019s son, Dan Hodges, who is a columnist for the Mail on Sunday \u2013 \u201cWhen he told me [he was going to write for them], I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll have to emigrate!\u2019\u201d \u2013 is more pro-Brexit than she is, but no, she says, they haven\u2019t fallen out over it.</p> <p>And of course it is typical of Jackson to say the thing one least expects. She has been caustic about the limitations of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a>, suggesting that some of the shock and outcry at the sheer volume of testimony is disingenuous, given the scale of the problem. \u201cWell, come on,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo women [killed every week by a current or former partner] in our country? I mean, dear God, come on.

This is one of the things.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, Jackson stood down as an MP and, to her amazement, has been in demand in the theatre almost constantly since. It is a different kind of joy to political work, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a transient joy. It only happens when you do it, and it\u2019s gone once you\u2019ve done it, and you have to do it again. It\u2019s this endless torture.\u201d</p> <p>Has she been in performances where she has felt herself lose the audience?</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. Yes, sure.\u201d She smiles. And when it works? \u201cIdeally, there\u2019s a group of strangers who come to sit in the auditorium, in the dark, and then there\u2019s this other group of strangers who come out in the light, and hopefully, what you pass from the light to the dark is increased and sent back to you.\u201d</p> <p>Put like that, it sounds hideously uncertain.

      "bodyText": "Glenda Jackson, 82, enters the hotel bar in an ankle-length puffer coat and woolly hat that, in spite of her extravagant and long-held scorn for vanity, she complains makes her look as if she doesn\u2019t have hair. She is in New York for a Broadway run of King Lear, a fresh take on the title role she played in London three years ago, although she has long since forgotten the lines. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, poetry isn\u2019t easier to memorise than prose. \u201cNo,\u201d memorising doesn\u2019t become harder the less you do it, and \u201cNo!\u201d \u2013 preposterous suggestion \u2013 one doesn\u2019t get used to the adrenaline of appearing on stage. \u201cYou never become accustomed to it!\u201d says Jackson, blinking vigorously before laughing with gusto. \u201cWe\u2019re all sadomasochists, let\u2019s face it. We all enter into this horrific, undiscovered space.\u201d The effect of all this, it should be said, is neither grand nor \u201cscary\u201d \u2013 as Jackson, or any woman expressing herself in terms stronger than mild disdain, is wont to be described \u2013 but impish, with a light touch of hooliganism. One gets the feeling Jackson never agrees with the premise of a question as a matter of principle. For years, people have been trying to describe her peculiar force with reference to her peculiar beauty, likening her face to, among other things, \u201ca Francis Bacon portrait of itself\u201d (the LA Times), \u201ca wonderful map\u201d (Jane Birkin) and, in a line from a Time magazine profile of the 1970s, \u201ca fire whose shadows torture the walls even as one is warmed by it\u201d, which is to say she is difficult to fit into pre-existing categories. Something about her \u2013 her severity, her glaring resistance to anti-ageing protocols, above all, her decision to quit acting to sit in parliament for 23 years \u2013 continues to be bafflingly avant garde. Oddly, Jackson most reminds me today of Ian McKellen. Both have played Lear and speak with what sounds, these days, like a period received pronunciation, bolted on by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in Jackson\u2019s case and the Royal Shakespeare Company in McKellen\u2019s, and which slips in moments of duress back to its northern origins (Jackson was born on the Wirral). Both are warm and funny, with the slightly exaggerated style of the mid\u201120th-century English stage actor. Typical opener: \u201cI was on tour with the RSC doing Hedda Gabler... \u201d I\u2019m surprised she isn\u2019t a dame, I say to Jackson at one point and she looks wildly indignant. \u201cI\u2019m a republican!\u201d she says. Yes, but you\u2019ve already got a CBE, I say. \u201cYes, well.\u201d She smiles, briefly, at her own perversity. The Broadway production of Lear, directed by Sam Gold and co-starring Ruth Wilson as both Cordelia and the Fool, is an entirely new show. Apart from Jackson, there is no overlap with the Deborah Warner-directed Lear of 2016, although, as in that production, the actors will be in modern dress. It is, says Jackson, no help whatsoever having done the play before. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that after the last performance of whatever the play is, all the words are gone. I think that\u2019s redolent of my early years in rep.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cI spend every night learning my words.\u201d It is an extraordinary feat. Last year, I saw her in the Broadway production of Edward Albee\u2019s Three Tall Women \u2013 she was savagely good \u2013 in which she was on stage for the whole play and shouldered the bulk of the lines. (She went on to win the best actress Tony.) The physical demands alone must be stratospheric, although in the case of Lear, she says, \u201cthere\u2019s an enormous energy in this play. And, if you dig into it, it just drags and forces you along. It\u2019s like a fucking jet stream. You just have to be able to release it.\u201d I can\u2019t imagine what weathering that kind of energy surge does to a person on a daily basis. Jackson looks incredulous. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s presupposing it\u2019s not a profession I\u2019m engaged in! It\u2019s sheer hard work.\u201d Apart from the politics of opening up Shakespeare\u2019s greatest roles to women \u2013 specifically, to women who are not 22 \u2013 Jackson\u2019s casting as Lear illustrates the limitations of how gender is policed and performed. \u201cWhen I was still in parliament, I would visit old people\u2019s homes and I just became aware that, at both extremes of age \u2013 babies and the very elderly \u2013 those absolutes [of gender] begin to fracture. And I think that\u2019s very interesting. I wasn\u2019t interested in \u2018gender-bender\u2019 kind of theatre, but I think in a play in which [Lear] says, I\u2019m 80 and I\u2019m losing it, that was quite useful.\u201d The greater wonder, of course, is that Jackson is in a position to be cast in anything at all. During her two decades as MP for Hampstead and Highgate (latterly Hampstead and Kilburn), it seemed fairly certain that her life as an actor was over. Even before that, during her early days at Rada, and long before her successes of the 1970s, which included two Oscars, Jackson was warned that she was unlikely to get much work until she was in her 40s. She was, she was told by the principal of Rada on graduating, a character actor, a sly reference perhaps to her origins as the daughter of a builder from Birkenhead, who before she got into drama school worked at Boots. By the standards of her own family, wanting to become an actor was an outlandish ambition. Where did she get her gumption, I wonder? \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was gumption, as such. Of course I\u2019ve rationalised this over the years. But I think I felt there had to be more to life than I was experiencing, and perhaps that I had more to offer than was being asked of me.\u201d After a friend dragged her along to an amateur theatre group, Jackson wrote to Rada and boldly asked to audition for a scholarship place. She got through the audition, only to be told that no scholarship existed. \u201cThen the manager of Boots wrote to Cheshire county council and they paid for me to go.\u201d Jackson\u2019s acting ambitions seemed strange to her parents. \u201cI don\u2019t think they ever came to see me in anything. If I was working in London, they wouldn\u2019t come down.\u201d Once, she thinks, they came to see her in a play in Crewe, but as far as she knows they never saw any of her films. She is sanguine about this, shrugging it off as she seems to most presumptions of injury. When Jackson went home to Birkenhead, her mother \u201cwould always check to see if I had holes in my shoes. That was the big thing. How bad was my financial situation?\u201d It was not an unreasonable concern for the first 10 years of her career, when Jackson was jobbing around in poorly paid stage roles. It is strange, looking back, to recall just how famous Jackson later became, although one reminds her of this at one\u2019s peril. After years in classical theatre, she was cast by Peter Brook in the 1967 film of his avant garde classic Marat/Sade and, from there, appeared in a run of movies that established her as one of the most successful actors of the time, most notably John Schlesinger\u2019s Sunday Bloody Sunday and Ken Russell\u2019s Women In Love, with Oliver Reed and Alan Bates, for which she won her first Oscar. (The other Academy Award was for A Touch Of Class, a dated-seeming romcom from 1973, opposite George Segal.) Her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 1971 BBC series Elizabeth R is still remembered as one of the most electrifying performances ever seen on television. What is curious about Jackson turning away from acting is not that she had other ambitions, nor that her conscience \u2013 she has said she stood for parliament out of rage against what Margaret Thatcher was doing to the country \u2013 compelled her to change course; rather, it is her insistence over the years that there was almost no cost involved. Sensible people understand that celebrity is sordid and, apart from the financial rewards, delivers no fun. And yet to be feted, one minute, as one of the most talented actors of her generation \u2013 and, more than that, as a movie star and a great beauty \u2013 and the next, to be grumbling on the back benches of the House of Commons might be imagined, at the very least, to be existentially punishing. But when I try to ask Jackson if the shift out of acting into politics was a culture shock, she won\u2019t have it \u2013 neither the notion that there was any sacrifice involved, nor that she was living in a rarefied celebrity world in the first place. Nervously, I suggest to Jackson that she enjoyed a period of solid movie stardom in the early to mid-1970s and she blinks, painfully, to allow that this was the case. And she did the red carpet and the Oscars, and \u2013 \u201cNo,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cThey weren\u2019t like that. No, no, no, no. The first Oscars I was invited to was a small event.\u201d They weren\u2019t a beauty pageant in the way they are now? \u201cNo.\u201d Nonetheless, she was still a woman in an industry in which her looks were frequently commented upon. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, ever.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, I say. \u201cOh, well.\u201d She puts her nose in the air. \u201cYou read different papers to me, because I don\u2019t remember that and I don\u2019t think I was ever given a part for the way I looked.\u201d That wasn\u2019t what I meant. I meant that you were considered, by an industry that values these things to the point of corrosion, to be very beautiful, I say. Jackson looks at me as if I have said something monstrously rude. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, particularly, and the thing about England is you can do your job and go home.\u201d I don\u2019t know what I am trying to get out of her here, other than some recognition that moving between worlds must have engendered some whiplash; that to be a woman in the public gaze entails some damage. She will permit that she avoided the trap of learning to love the spotlight. \u201cYes, it can be utterly destructive, no question. But I was very lucky \u2013 I was able to go between the two modes.\u201d She was helped, too, by her upbringing. \u201cBecause I was the eldest of four girls and, you know, growing up in the north-west of England, the heinous crime is to get above yourself. \u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019\u201d \u2013 she slips into broad Liverpudlian \u2013 \u201c\u2018she\u2019s getting a bit too big for her shoes.\u2019 One of the greatest blessings of my life is that I had a very strong work ethic. You don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. It\u2019s very simple. And that\u2019s been a great strength. You don\u2019t always do the work you want to do, but you have to go to work.\u201d There is no overlap, she says, between performing on stage as an actor and performing in the House of Commons. \u201cIt\u2019s lit. You\u2019re not in the dark. It makes a difference. We talk blandly about the fourth wall [in the theatre] and that is part of it. When it\u2019s a debate in the House of Commons, they know where you\u2019re coming from, you know where they\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s very structured; you can\u2019t say certain things. It\u2019s much more symbolic. Occasionally you get direct, genuine arguments, but that\u2019s quite rare.\u201d Jackson has said in the past that she was fond of Jeremy Corbyn when he was her fellow backbench MP, but hasn\u2019t been impressed with his performance over Brexit. Now, she says, \u201cI will always defend my party, but we\u2019re not exactly covering ourselves with glory at the moment, are we?\u201d If she were still in the Commons, would she remonstrate with Corbyn? \u201cI\u2019d ask someone to explain to me what we\u2019re doing. Anybody, please, tell me what are we doing? It all comes down, in the end, to trying to keep your job. Bizarre.\u201d She finds it hard to discern what the strategy is. \u201cIt\u2019s simply easier to say that there is none. It\u2019s crazed. I\u2019m a big admirer of her and I think the way she\u2019s been treated is utterly disgraceful. I don\u2019t only mean by her own party, but the way the press has presented her.\u201d I\u2019m so surprised by this that I\u2019m not sure, for a moment, that we\u2019re actually talking about the prime minister. What, Theresa May? \u201cYes! I think it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful. There she is, slogging away, God love her.\u201d But she has vacillated\u2026 \u201cShe doesn\u2019t vacillate! She tries to bring together two opposing sides, who find it very hard to tolerate each other, at the same time as having to deal with 27 other countries.\u201d A week later, I call Jackson about this because I\u2019m still not convinced I have heard her correctly. Vociferous enemy of Thatcher, vigorous anti-Tory and a woman for whom Tony Blair was too right wing: did she really say that she is an admirer of Theresa May? \u201cI\u2019ve certainly admired her in the way she has handled herself over Brexit, yes! I do admire her for her tenacity, trying to deliver the referendum result to the people of our country, even though I disapproved of it.\u201d To hold a second referendum, she says, would be absurd. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop people then saying, \u2018Well, let\u2019s have a third?\u2019\u201d Jackson\u2019s son, Dan Hodges, who is a columnist for the Mail on Sunday \u2013 \u201cWhen he told me [he was going to write for them], I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll have to emigrate!\u2019\u201d \u2013 is more pro-Brexit than she is, but no, she says, they haven\u2019t fallen out over it. And of course it is typical of Jackson to say the thing one least expects. She has been caustic about the limitations of the #MeToo movement, suggesting that some of the shock and outcry at the sheer volume of testimony is disingenuous, given the scale of the problem. \u201cWell, come on,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo women [killed every week by a current or former partner] in our country? I mean, dear God, come on. Kids are being shipped abroad to get married \u2013 at least the Home Office no longer charges them.\u201d But surely it can only be helpful to talk more widely about women\u2019s experience of sexual assault? \u201cWell, is it? I mean, in one sense it\u2019s helpful because it had that peak. But it\u2019s not helpful if the impression that is left is that it\u2019s the kind of behaviour that is only done by people who are rich and famous. It\u2019s happening as we sit here, someone\u2019s getting it.\u201d She pulls an extraordinary face of disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s everywhere. We have raised [awareness levels], no question, but it\u2019s by no means universal and we still ain\u2019t got equal pay, have we? This is one of the things.\u201d In 2015, Jackson stood down as an MP and, to her amazement, has been in demand in the theatre almost constantly since. It is a different kind of joy to political work, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a transient joy. It only happens when you do it, and it\u2019s gone once you\u2019ve done it, and you have to do it again. It\u2019s this endless torture.\u201d Has she been in performances where she has felt herself lose the audience? \u201cOh, yes. Yes, sure.\u201d She smiles. And when it works? \u201cIdeally, there\u2019s a group of strangers who come to sit in the auditorium, in the dark, and then there\u2019s this other group of strangers who come out in the light, and hopefully, what you pass from the light to the dark is increased and sent back to you.\u201d Put like that, it sounds hideously uncertain. And so, just to reiterate: there isn\u2019t a temptation, when King Lear opens on Broadway next month, to rock up and think, I did this in London \u2013 this is a piece of cake? Jackson\u2019s eyes boggle. \u201cFucking Ada! No, there isn\u2019t! Jesus God!\u201d She\u2019s off, roaring again. \u201cCome on!\u201d \u2022 King Lear is at the Cort theatre, New York, until 7 July.
