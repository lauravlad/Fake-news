      "bodyText": "This article (Smoking ban tops list of 21st century successes for public health, 23 December) is enough to make you weep. Nothing but improvement until the Tories came to power in 2010, then so much going backwards: greater inequality, closure of Sure Start centres, and minimal alcohol pricing still not introduced in England. Homelessness has increased since 2010, and life expectancy has decreased. And the population has just voted for more of the same. Dr Heather Parry Watford, Hertfordshire \u2022 Labour don\u2019t need a new leader, new policies or a new ideology \u2013 they just need better slogans. \u201cTake back control\u201d won the referendum in 2016, and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d just won a general election. Both fatuous and mendacious, but punchy \u2013 which is all the electorate seems to need or want. Cherry Weston Wolverhampton \u2022 In the spirit of Alice O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s praise of Anna Burns (Be patient, keep faith: a mantra for life, Journal, 19 December), I find an ideal to aspire to in making stock, writing and life in general is to keep skimming until the scum stops rising to the surface, never stir it and keep it simmering but don\u2019t let it boil. Chicken soup for the soul. Patrick Carroll Helston, Cornwall \u2022 A letter (20 December) butchers the Latin language with veni, mentiti, vici. O tempora o mores. It would have to be mentitus sum were it to be anything. However, decepi \u2013 I cheated, deceived, ensnared etc \u2013 would do it. Graeme Fife Sevenoaks, Kent \u2022 Since we\u2019re going to have to get used to them, we might as well get the plural of annus horribilis right: it\u2019s anni horribiles, not \u201canni horribili\u201d (Editorial, 26 December).
