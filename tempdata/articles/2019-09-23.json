      "body": "<p>Brexit continues to turn everything it touches to dust. There are no wise people left, so it can only now take pleasure by making fools of fools. Easy pickings but good for the LOLs. It\u2019s come down to this for Labour. On the third day of its conference in Brighton, the best result for the party would have been for all three contradictory Brexit motions to have been passed.</p> <p>That way everyone could have gone home happy in a state of constructive ambiguity. The Momentum remainers who had backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 precisely because he had promised party members a say in forming policy would feel their voice had been heard. Those Momentum members for whom Corbyn had only ever been the once and future king would have made their mark. And the old guard of the national executive committee (NEC) who had always traditionally stitched up policy behind the scenes would be free to do so again. Come the Clause V meeting to write the next election manifesto, the NEC would have a free rein. Win-win for everyone.</p> <p>Only it turned out that the Labour party is even more self-destructive than anyone had imagined. The afternoon drama had begun with Emily Thornberry giving her keynote speech. One pitched more as a fading cabaret act \u2013 nudge nudge, wink wink \u2013 than as a shadow foreign secretary. Almost as if she knew her days might be numbered with her unequivocal support for Labour campaigning as a remain party at the next election and wanted to leave the stage with one last hurrah.</p> <p>Then came the debate on the three competing motions: the NEC statement committing Labour to only deciding what side to support in a second referendum after a special conference following an election won by Jeremy Corbyn; composite 13 committing Labour to supporting remain going into the imminent election; and composite 14 disagreeing with the need for a decision on what side to support in a referendum to be postponed because the Messiah had already given absolute clarity on his position. It was just conference\u2019s bad luck that no-one in the hall was enlightened enough to determine what it was.</p> <p>There was a moment\u2019s silence before Wendy Nichols, the chair for the debate who appeared to have been chosen solely because she could be relied on to be totally useless, called on everyone to engage in collective spiritual bargaining through transcendental meditation. Om. Nothing. Om, Om. Still nothing. Nichols then called on an interpretive dance troupe to explain Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position through Dadaist performance art. That wasn\u2019t much help either. Still, no one had ever pretended Jeremy ever took anything but the road less travelled.</p> <p>Things quickly turned nasty in the hall, as many of the grassroots members who were brandishing placards saying \u201cLabour members say stop Brexit\u201d began to suspect that the party hierarchy had packed the room with stooges.

      "bodyText": "Brexit continues to turn everything it touches to dust. There are no wise people left, so it can only now take pleasure by making fools of fools. Easy pickings but good for the LOLs. It\u2019s come down to this for Labour. On the third day of its conference in Brighton, the best result for the party would have been for all three contradictory Brexit motions to have been passed. That way everyone could have gone home happy in a state of constructive ambiguity. The Momentum remainers who had backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 precisely because he had promised party members a say in forming policy would feel their voice had been heard. Those Momentum members for whom Corbyn had only ever been the once and future king would have made their mark. And the old guard of the national executive committee (NEC) who had always traditionally stitched up policy behind the scenes would be free to do so again. Come the Clause V meeting to write the next election manifesto, the NEC would have a free rein. Win-win for everyone. Only it turned out that the Labour party is even more self-destructive than anyone had imagined. The afternoon drama had begun with Emily Thornberry giving her keynote speech. One pitched more as a fading cabaret act \u2013 nudge nudge, wink wink \u2013 than as a shadow foreign secretary. Almost as if she knew her days might be numbered with her unequivocal support for Labour campaigning as a remain party at the next election and wanted to leave the stage with one last hurrah. Then came the debate on the three competing motions: the NEC statement committing Labour to only deciding what side to support in a second referendum after a special conference following an election won by Jeremy Corbyn; composite 13 committing Labour to supporting remain going into the imminent election; and composite 14 disagreeing with the need for a decision on what side to support in a referendum to be postponed because the Messiah had already given absolute clarity on his position. It was just conference\u2019s bad luck that no-one in the hall was enlightened enough to determine what it was. There was a moment\u2019s silence before Wendy Nichols, the chair for the debate who appeared to have been chosen solely because she could be relied on to be totally useless, called on everyone to engage in collective spiritual bargaining through transcendental meditation. Om. Nothing. Om, Om. Still nothing. Nichols then called on an interpretive dance troupe to explain Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position through Dadaist performance art. That wasn\u2019t much help either. Still, no one had ever pretended Jeremy ever took anything but the road less travelled. Things quickly turned nasty in the hall, as many of the grassroots members who were brandishing placards saying \u201cLabour members say stop Brexit\u201d began to suspect that the party hierarchy had packed the room with stooges. Old habits die hard. Never hold a vote unless you know the outcome in advance. Something David Cameron should have remembered three years earlier. Speaker after speaker came to the podium to declare undying loyalty to Corbyn. Brexit had become a side issue, a neoliberal conspiracy to stop the country from talking about Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity policies.

You don\u2019t see those around any more \u2013 in the months when Jeremy Corbyn was dragging his feet about backing a second referendum, the message no longer seemed consistent \u2013 but it is worth recalling the slogan because it helps puts today\u2019s vote in perspective. A significant number of Labour members have decided that, when faced with a choice, loving Corbyn comes first.</p> \n  <p>I say \u201csignificant number\u201d because, without a card vote, we don\u2019t know what the exact voting figures were, and whether Corbyn would have won the votes without the support of the unions. The unions have 50% of the vote at conference and most of them were opposed to the \u201cback remain now\u201d composite 13. It was only going to pass if the vast majority of CLP delegates supported it. Last night that looked like a distinct possibility: of the 90 motions submitted by CLPs on Brexit, 81 of them were calling for Labour to back remain. But the decision by Momentum this morning to advise its supporters to vote against composite 13 (see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d8893ce8f08f30dc5bc0997#block-5d8893ce8f08f30dc5bc0997\">10.45am</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d88e9188f08f30dc5bc0e0e#block-5d88e9188f08f30dc5bc0e0e\">4.48pm</a>) seems to have swayed the vote. About 70% of CLP delegates are said to be Momentum supporters. Forced to make a choice, a largish number of them \u2013 certainly enough to overturn expectations \u2013 lined up behind the leadership.</p> \n  <p>Listening to the debate, it was clear that the argument that the party should unite behind Corbyn carried weight \u2013 and that passing composite 13 would be seen by the media as a terrible defeat for him.</p> \n  <p>But there were also legitimate objections to composite 13 on policy grounds. Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/23/brexit-latest-news-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-warned-it-would-look-awful-if-he-only-wins-key-labour-brexit-conference-vote-with-union-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d88e6558f08f30dc5bc0dc4#block-5d88e6558f08f30dc5bc0dc4\">4.38pm</a>) put this argument as well as anyone, saying it would be a \u201ccar crash\u201d if Labour was committed to obtaining a Brexit deal that it was already determined to campaign against.</p> \n  <p>The remainers think Labour will haemorrhage votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens at the general election under the Corbyn policy that will now remain unchallenged until the election. The Corbynites think turning Labour into a remain-only party would be even more disastrous. There is no way of knowing which analysis is more correct. And a huge amount will depend on what has happened to Brexit by the time the election actually happens. It is quite possible that both arguments are right.</p> \n  <p>Still, this is a very good night for Jeremy Corbyn, who has won a clear victory over his remain opponents in the party.

It is not planning to give every individual worker the right not to have to work more than 32 hours a week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Part of the plan is to ensure that workers can benefit more from productivity increases.</strong> McDonnell believes that for much of the last 150 years or so increases in productivity led to shorter working hours.

This is the composite motion backing the leadership position although, unlike the NEC statement, it does not say explicitly that the decision on the party\u2019s stance in a referendum should be postponed.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s actually rather less generous than it appears. That\u2019s to achieve the same level of social care that we get at the moment, just for more people. So it\u2019s not returning the system to where it was in 2010 which would cost an additional \u00a36bn because it\u2019s been restricted so much. You really do have to have quite severe needs to get that social care.</p> \n   <p>And secondly it\u2019s not going to save many people from the catastrophic cost that you can face if you go into residential care because it\u2019s not going to cover the cost of the accommodation and so on that you get there. So, whilst its expensive, it is nevertheless a relatively limited offer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the overall credibility of Labour\u2019s spending plans, Johnson sounded sceptical. He said that at the last election Labour was proposing spending increases worth around \u00a370bn a year, and tax increases worth around \u00a350bn a year. But Johnson said he thought Labour would only raise about \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn from its tax plans. And he said, in practice, Labour might have ended up spending more. He said the current Tory government is increasing health spending by more than Labour proposed, and that in reality a Labour government would have been spending more than it planned on health too. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at such a big set of changes in terms of what they were saying a couple of years ago it is really not so much a question of does it all add up fiscally, it\u2019s a question of is it actually deliverable, either in terms of the level of tax increases or deliverable in terms of particularly the very large levels of investment spending they are suggesting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T09:00:05.503Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8877418f08f9df5bdd99b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-23T07:43:41.717Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour will build a national network of charging points for electric vehicles at a cost of \u00a33.6bn to kickstart its planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/labour-green-industrial-revolution\">\u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d</a> if elected, the party has announced this morning.

Corbyn accepted remain as the party\u2019s position, members adored him for other reasons, and mostly this contradiction has been glossed over. At the last two party conferences Labour used classic procedural ploys to defuse a split on this issue; in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/24/labour-conference-accused-of-ducking-debate-over-brexit\">members decided to shelve a proposed debate on Brexit to avoid the need for a row</a>, and last year the party adopted a compromise \u201call options on the table\u201d composite on a second referendum that satisfied remainers while not actually committing the party to anything.</p> \n  <p>But this year it looks as though a split can be avoided not longer. As we explain in our overnight story, delegates will be asked to choose between two rival Brexit motions - one setting out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s preference, which is for the party to postpone deciding whether it will campaign for remain in a second referendum until after the election, and another saying the party should commit to remain now. As our story explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Corbyn\u2019s] proposal to put off the decision until after an election was endorsed by the national executive committee, by 16 votes to 10, after members were asked to send their agreement by email and without a meeting.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> government,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n   <p>However, pro-EU activists fought during a lengthy meeting on Sunday night to ensure there would be a vote on the conference floor on Monday on whether Labour should immediately adopt an unequivocally remain position.</p> \n   <p>More than 50 local parties swung behind a pro-remain motion, while eight backed a more neutral motion closer to the leadership\u2019s position. Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party\u2019s Brexit policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/corbyn-on-collision-course-with-labour-members-over-brexit\">Corbyn on collision course with Labour members over Brexit</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>At Labour conference trade unions have almost half the votes, and constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates have the other 50%. (A handful of non-union affiliated organisations have the rest.) Members are largely in favour of the \u201cback remain now\u201d approach, but the unions seem to be mostly behind the party leadership.</p> \n  <p>In a statement last night Michael Chessum, national organiser of <strong>Another Europe is Possible</strong>, which has been mobilising support for the \u201cback remain now\u201d motion, said that it would \u201clook awful\u201d if Corbyn won today just as a result of the union bloc vote. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ninety percent of motions to this conference are anti-Brexit, reflecting a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-remain. We are taking a remain position to conference floor, where we are expecting a close vote. Using union bloc votes to defeat the overwhelming majority of members may well not work, and would look awful. </p> \n   <p>There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn. We want a radical Labour government, and Corbyn in Number 10. The best way of getting there is with clarity on Brexit and a clear message to our members and voters that we are on their side.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is about to discuss this on Today.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.45am: </em>Conference opens.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has seen off an attempt by grassroots activists to force Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position ahead of a general election. Workers will enjoy longer holidays under a future Labour government as part of a 10-year plan to see the length of the average full-time working week drop by five hours, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has announced. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. And this is from Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour party behind a remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart. He is determined to negotiate a Brexit deal if Labour win an election, despite all the evidence that there is no Brexit deal that is good for our economy, our NHS and our security. By refusing to say how the Labour party would campaign in a second referendum, Jeremy Corbyn is letting down the millions of people who want to see the UK remain in the EU. The Liberal Democrats are the only main party going into the next election promising to end the Brexit chaos. If the Liberal Democrats win the next general election, then we will use that democratic mandate to revoke article 50 on day one and stop Brexit. Here is the SNP\u2019s Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins on the Labour conference vote. Jeremy Corbyn is stuck firmly on the fence, refusing to come down \u2013 and today\u2019s votes show the rest of the Labour party is happy to stay there. This is a real abdication of leadership. It beggars belief that more than three years after the EU referendum, and knowing the damage Brexit will do, Labour is still arguing over its position. Labour are failing to be an effective opposition to the Tories, never mind a potential replacement. It is now crystal clear that the SNP is the only party in Scotland that can stop Brexit and beat the Tories. People in Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the one being imposed on us by Westminster. The SNP will continue to work to stop Brexit and protect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future as an independent country. From the Lib Dems This is from the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. At Labour conference last year there were many delegates going around wearing T-shirts saying \u201cLove Corbyn, Hate Brexit\u201d. You don\u2019t see those around any more \u2013 in the months when Jeremy Corbyn was dragging his feet about backing a second referendum, the message no longer seemed consistent \u2013 but it is worth recalling the slogan because it helps puts today\u2019s vote in perspective. A significant number of Labour members have decided that, when faced with a choice, loving Corbyn comes first. I say \u201csignificant number\u201d because, without a card vote, we don\u2019t know what the exact voting figures were, and whether Corbyn would have won the votes without the support of the unions. The unions have 50% of the vote at conference and most of them were opposed to the \u201cback remain now\u201d composite 13. It was only going to pass if the vast majority of CLP delegates supported it. Last night that looked like a distinct possibility: of the 90 motions submitted by CLPs on Brexit, 81 of them were calling for Labour to back remain. But the decision by Momentum this morning to advise its supporters to vote against composite 13 (see 10.45am and 4.48pm) seems to have swayed the vote. About 70% of CLP delegates are said to be Momentum supporters. Forced to make a choice, a largish number of them \u2013 certainly enough to overturn expectations \u2013 lined up behind the leadership. Listening to the debate, it was clear that the argument that the party should unite behind Corbyn carried weight \u2013 and that passing composite 13 would be seen by the media as a terrible defeat for him. But there were also legitimate objections to composite 13 on policy grounds. Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett (see 4.38pm) put this argument as well as anyone, saying it would be a \u201ccar crash\u201d if Labour was committed to obtaining a Brexit deal that it was already determined to campaign against. The remainers think Labour will haemorrhage votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens at the general election under the Corbyn policy that will now remain unchallenged until the election. The Corbynites think turning Labour into a remain-only party would be even more disastrous. There is no way of knowing which analysis is more correct. And a huge amount will depend on what has happened to Brexit by the time the election actually happens. It is quite possible that both arguments are right. Still, this is a very good night for Jeremy Corbyn, who has won a clear victory over his remain opponents in the party. It is probably a good night for Jo Swinson too, as the Lib Dems and the Greens now have the undiluted remain field (in England, at least) to themselves. What Boris Johnson thinks is harder to guess, but the Tories have been trying hard to label Labour as an anti-Brexit, remain party (not because they think it will help Labour, presumably), and tonight\u2019s vote undermines that line of attack. Nichols takes the vote on composite 14 (the pro-leadership one). It gets carried. So the two pro-leadership motions have been carried. Some delegates are calling for a card vote. Wendy Nichols, the chair, seems to be resisting this. She says whichever way she goes, she will be in trouble. She says: \u201cIn my view it was carried.\u201d Then she corrects herself. She says it was lost. Earlier, just before she announced the vote, she said that she thought it went one way, but that Jennie (Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary, who is on the platform) thought it went another way. Nichols did not say who thought what, but when she announced the result initially (see 5.42pm) she said it had been lost. A delegate says this is one of the most important decisions facing the party. There should be a card vote. Nichols says the vote was lost. She wants the party to be right with itself. Delegates are now voting on composite 13. On a show of hands, it looks as if composite 13 has lost. The chair says that was lost. The conference has voted for the NEC motion on a show of hands. It was carried overwhelmingly. Some delegates are now singing \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Delegates back NEC statement calling for party to postpone decision on who to campaign in referendum. It is still possible that the contradictory motion, composite 13, could be carried. Delegates are about to vote on Brexit. A woman makes a point of order, and complains that a large number of people have just come into the hall. Are they entitled to be here? The chair says anyone who is not a delegate should leave. Starmer has now finished. At last year\u2019s conference he want off script, saying all options would be on the table if Labour did not get a general election, including a referendum with remain as an option. That went slightly further than what had been agreed. But today he was strictly on message. He confirmed that he would vote remain in a referendum (something he has said before), but he did not take a side on the issue at the heart of this debate - the split between composite 13 and the NEC statement. See 10.10am. Starmer is now on his peroration. Conference, the Tories have failed: they\u2019ve wrecked our economy, public services, and welfare state. They\u2019ve wrecked our international reputation. Their time is up. We have to beat them, and we will. We have to defeat Johnson, and we shall. And defeat his politics, to show that decency can triumph. We have to deliver a radical Labour government and give the people the final say on whether we remain in the EU. Starmer says Labour must recognise why people voted leave. But Brexit is deeper and bigger than our relationship with the EU. We will never get past Brexit if we don\u2019t understand why \u2013 when asked \u2013 so many millions said they wanted change. The people didn\u2019t just speak. They shouted. Millions told us that the current political and economic system isn\u2019t working. And they are right about that. The status quo is bust. Inequality and injustice are everywhere. We need a fundamental shift in power, and wealth, and opportunity. That\u2019s why our 2017 manifesto was so popular. We must build on it. Only a Labour government will end child poverty. Only a Labour government will confront the moral disgrace of homelessness. Only a Labour government will transform our economy to end insecure work - raise wages \u2013 and create good new jobs across the country. Only a Labour government will tackle the climate emergency, so we can look at the next generation in the eye and say \u2018we did not let you down\u2019. Starmer says he would campaign for remain. But he says he respects the rights of those to take a different view. Conference, you know where I stand on the question of remain: I\u2019ve said many times that I will campaign for it. But I profoundly respect those who take a different view. And conference, let\u2019s go into this with our eyes open. In 2016 Labour campaigned for remain. We did so because we are internationalists. We stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbours in Europe. We profoundly believe in peace, reconciliation, human rights and collaboration across borders. Socialist values. Our values. Then and now. And let those values guide us on the road ahead. Starmer turns to the election. The choice is stark. Lose, and the 2020s could be another lost decade. A no-deal Brexit, on top of a hard-right agenda that will strip back rights and protections and sell off public services. Win, and Labour can pull this country back from the brink: end austerity, rebuild our public services, and invest in our communities. The stakes could not be higher. (I am posting the quotes from the text sent out by Labour. Starmer is making some slight changes to the text, but what I am posting is not in any was significantly different from what he is saying.) Starmer says Labour has to find a way forward. Too much has happened in the last three years for this now to be decided without the consent of the public. We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn\u2019t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say. A referendum in which \u2018remain\u2019 should \u2013 and will \u2013 be on the ballot paper. Along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum. But if remain wins, we will remain a member of the EU \u2013 a full member of the EU. Starmer says a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the country. Theresa May\u2019s government was called a zombie government. But at least she occasionally won a vote. With this government, it is Johnson nil, Corbyn six. Parliament had to pass a law to stop a no-deal Brexit. And yet Johnson\u2019s first instinct is to break the law. Starmer says if Johnson thinks he will be able to break the law, he has another thing coming. As soon as parliament returns, \u201cwe will be ready\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. Last year the conference gave Labour a roadmap, he says. \u201cYou asked us to vote down Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, and we did, three times.\u201d And they kept a referendum on the table. But now they face different challenges \u2013 a prime minister with no regard for the truth. Starmer says he does not believe a word Johnson says. Johnson said Brexit would free up more money for the NHS. It won\u2019t. He said prorogation was not about Brexit. But it was all about Brexit, he says. We definitely will get the results of the votes tonight, Labour are now saying. There were suggestions earlier we might have to wait until tomorrow. Joanna Gowers, from Finchley and Golders Green, says she does not like the EU. She thinks it has promoted neoliberalism. She came to the party conference opposed to a second referendum. But she says she thinks the party cannot go into an election with a fudged Brexit position. Alex Fernandes from Tooting CLP says he is addressing the party as an international socialist and Portuguese migrant. He says, as the largest party in Europe, they should campaign for their vision of socialism within the EU. He says: We cannot have socialism without international solidarity. Leaving the EU will not help migrants, he says. He says they should dismantle fortress Europe from within. Asra Anjum from Poplar and Limehouse CLP says she is speaking in favour of composite 13. She is speaking as a BAME candidate. She says her CLP is majority BAME, and it voted remain. Samuel East from Liverpool Walton CLP said Boris Johnson would be praying for Labour to end the day as a remain party. Members should say no to composite 13, he said. Here are three journalists on how the debate is going. From the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason From the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne (who I think means over-estimate) From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall Urte Macikene, from Dulwich and West Norwood, says the vast majority of Labour members back remain. Without their support, the party will not win the election, she says. She urges delegates to back composite 13 and to make it a socialist, internationalist anti-Brexit party. From Prospect\u2019s Tom Clark The Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar has the text of the Momentum briefing to members on how they should vote on Brexit. While we are talking about Tom Watson, this is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. From my colleague Heather Stewart Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has been speaking at a fringe event organised by the Labour Campaign for Gambling Reform. He said he was speaking about an issue \u201cvery dear to my heart\u201d, but he couldn\u2019t resist a pop at Jon Lansman, who led the attempt to abolish his post on Friday last week. \u201cThe first thing I will say is that if you had taken a bet on whether I\u2019d be deputy leader speaking at this event on Friday night, you\u2019d have made a lot of money, and I really hope some of you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the person you\u2019ve got to thank if you did is Jon Lansman.\u201d He added: \u201cJust to let you know, I\u2019m going to get Jon Lansman gags in at every fringe meeting I do all week.\u201d He went on to speak about the gambling reforms that Labour wants to introduce in government, like the creation of a new gambling ombudsman and the introduction of a new gambling act that takes into account the huge changes the industry has seen over the past few years. Jill Murdoch said the TSSA union told the conference earlier that her union \u201cunequivocally supports\u201d composite 13. But Unite\u2019s Howard Beckett spoke in support of the NEC statement and composite 14, and in opposition to composite 13. He said: Composite 13 seeks to define us now as a party of remain and say that any negotiated deal, no matter what is in it, should be rejected in favour of remain. As anyone who watched Emily Thornberry on Question Time will know, it\u2019d be a car crash to send Jeremy Corbyn into a general election saying that he can negotiate a credible deal when our position is one to reject that deal. He was referring to this clip. Hannah Patterson, from Leeds North West CLP, says the party needs a clear stance. It is not good enough to wait until after the election before deciding to back remain, she says. She says Scottish Labour, Welsh Labour and Labour in Northern Ireland all want the party to commit for remain. Vote for composite 13, she says. You can\u2019t always judge how a vote will go by how many people are speaking on each side, but the leadership camp are doing a better job at getting people to speak up for their side than the remain camp. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Jeremy Corbyn is on course to win. Noah Tucker from Tottenham CLP says his local party wants people to back Jeremy Corbyn. He has been right on tactics, he says. He says composite 13 would put Labour in a \u201cnightmare\u201d position. It would not be able to get anything other than a very, very bad deal, if the EU knows that Labour will campaign against it. Yet the public could vote for it in the referendum. He says Labour should not let Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson speak for the 52%. Labour needs to be the people who speak for the 99%. Gary Ostrolenk from Camberwell and Peckham CLP says a Labour government will face an onslaught from its enemies. It will need the support of the entire working class. If it alienates the 50% of that class who voted leave, they will turn their backs on Labour. Labour will not succeed. He urges members to vote against composite 13. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has been given a different steer on when we might get the results of votes from the one picked up by Steven Swinford. (See 4.19am.) Michelle Ryan, from East Worthing and Shoreham CLP, says composite 13 would put the party in the position of having to campaign against a deal it negotiated. That position has been widely mocked, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn has also made it clear that he would prefer to be neutral. The Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford says, if there is a card vote, we will not get the result until tomorrow. Jean Roberts, from Brent Central CLP, says she voted leave. The EU is not a model democracy. It is run in the interests of corporations, she suggests. She says the party should unite behind the leadership and reject composite 13. These are from Sunder Katwala, a former general secretary of the Fabian Society. Juan Baeza, from Brighton Pavilion CLP, says members should unite behind the leader and reject composite 13. Rosie Rivers, a 17-year-old activist from Wealden CLP, told the conference she had a message for them that would make her unpopular. She was against the idea of holding a second referendum at all, she said. I know hundreds of people aged 16 to 25 and younger in my area who think it will create a divide that will be worse for us to grow up in. Kate Hudson from CWU says she is speaking in support of the NEC statement, \u201cour leader\u2019s position\u201d. When people are trapped in poverty and reliant on food banks, Brexit is drowning out the debates the party should be having, she says. She says, when Labour debates, \u201cthere are no enemies in this room\u201d. Labour\u2019s enemies are in Downing Street, she says. Sophie Wilson, a councillor from Sheffield Hallam CLP, says what her constituents need is a socialist government led by Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn\u2019s policy could not be more simple, she says. She says the party cannot ignore the votes of those who voted leave. She says it makes sense to leave the decision to a special conference after the election. She urges delegates to support composite 14. Duncan Enright says he is the first Labour mayor of Witney (David Cameron\u2019s constituency when he was an MP) for a generation. He urges the conference to back composite 13. Labour\u2019s position should be \u201cremain, revoke, reform\u201d, he says. Gordon McKay from Unison says it is almost 100 years since the Daily Mail owner said hate was the way to sell newspapers. One hundred years on, not much has changed. He says Unison will be voting for composite 13. But he says Unison cannot be accused of not backing Jeremy Corbyn. It supported him as leader in 2015, and again a year later. But Unison is committed to remain, he says. He says Boris Johnson and the other Brexiters want to privatise services. Does anyone think anything will get better under Brexit? Labour has to come to a view, support a second referendum and campaign for remain. Sophie Robbins from Twickenham CLP says trans people like herself have got more to fear than most from a no-deal Brexit. Hate crime has gone up since the Brexit vote, she says. From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith Two of the Brexit motions - the NEC statement and composite 13 - are contradictory. Catherine Pinder from the GMB says her union supports the Labour leadership\u2019s call for a second referendum. She urges delegates to support the NEC statement. See 10.10am. Richard Corbett MEP is speaking now. He says people should appreciate the extent to which Labour is united. It is united in opposing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit, and united in wanting a second referendum, and united in saying it would campaign for remain against Johnson\u2019s deal or no deal. The only difference is over what it would do if a Labour deal were on the table too. He says Labour has tried ambiguity. It tried it in the European election. But it haemorrhaged votes to the Greens and the Lib Dems, he says. He says it should commit to remain. We haemorrhaged votes to the Greens and the Liberal Democrats far more than we did to the Brexit party. It is an illusion to think that we could gain from gaining a slither of the smaller and declining number of Labour leave voters than we would lose at the same from the larger number and growing number of remain voters. After speeches for another foreign policy composite, the chair, Wendy Nichols, is now opening the debate up to speeches from the floor. She says she has about two and a half hours for the debate. There was loud cheering in the hall for the two speakers backing composite 13, but also for the two who were backing composite 14. It is not obvious that one side has more support than the other. Sion Rickard, from Aberconwy CLP, is seconding composite 14 now. He says he voted remain. But he says the party has to unite. He says the papers would love it if the party did not support Jeremy Corbyn. He says delegates need to trust Corbyn and his team on this issue. Alan Gibbons, from Liverpool Walton CLP, is moving composite 14 now. This is the pro-leadership one. See 10.10am. He says, after this debate, Labour members will have to campaign together. He says he voted remain. The Tories accuse Labour of holding up Brexit. But who has been in charge? The Tories. He says Labour will negotiate a better deal and give the public a choice. He says he personally will vote remain, but he will decide at the time. People need a Labour government, he says. Labour must be able to talk not just to the 52% or the 48% but to the 99%. He says when he is on picket lines, or boycotting the Sun, or feeding the homeless, or kicking fascists out of Liverpool \u2013 they need Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. So he urges delegates to support composite 14 and reject composite 13. Fiona O\u2019Farrell, from the Labour party Irish society, is seconding composite 13. She says Labour should support the motion on behalf of the people of Ireland, who would suffer if the open border gets undermined. At the conference delegates are now debating Brexit. Simon Hannah, from Tooting CLP, is moving composite 13. (See 10.10am.) He says he joined Labour when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. He is a Momentum member. He is no fan of the EU, he says. He says when Corbyn gave the EU seven out of 10, he thought Corbyn was being generous. But Hannah says it is clear nothing good will come from Brexit. The Labour movement is opposed to Brexit, he says. He says he is worried about the Lib Dems at the elections. Comrades, we cannot win an election by not taking sides. He says postponing a decision about who to campaign in an election will just generate confusion. He is loudly applauded. Alongside John McDonnell\u2019s speech, Labour has published two documents today fleshing out some of the ideas he was talking about. Here is a 28-page report (pdf) on universal basic services. McDonnell said Labour would expand the range of public services available for free. (See 12.25pm.) And here is a 12-page briefing (pdf) on the plan for a national care service. Here is the full text of Emily Thornberry\u2019s speech. Thornberry says it is not enough to address the injustices of today; the next Labour government must address the injustices of the past. She says Labour would apologise for the first Amritsar massacre, and hold an inquiry into Britain\u2019s role in the second. Labour would allow the Chagos islanders to return home. It would hold a judge-led inquiry into the UK\u2019s complicity in rendition and torture, she says. And she says she can announce two new pledges. She says Labour would compensate black African and Caribbean veterans who failed to get the same demob as white soldiers after the second world war. And it would pay a \u00a350,000 lump sum to veterans who were exposed to radiation during nuclear tests in the 1950s. It is not just their health that has suffered. Their children and grandchildren have been affected too. These payments would help with medical bills, she says. Thornberry says in government Labour would review arms sales. British arms should not be sold so they can be used to kill civilians abroad, she says. Thornberry says \u201cstrong man\u201d politics is an increasing threat to the world. She says it is not a surprise when the \u201cdaddy of them all\u201d, Donald Trump, is in the White House. She says Trump is leader of the free world. But how can you lead the free world when you support locking up toddlers, when you want to stop women having control over their bodies and when you support the annexation of Palestine. And she says no one has copied Trump more than the Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman. When he came to the UK, they rolled out the red carpet for him, she says. She says they needed a red carpet \u201cto cover up the blood dripping from his hands\u201d from the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and from the slaughter of civilians in Yemen. She says the age of impunity needs to end. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is addressing the conference now. She starts with a joke about the improbability of Boris Johnson being prime minister. She says that, in a future referendum on Brexit, she would campaign for remain. As [Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove] has said, we must fight with every fibre of our beings to say between now and October 31, and afterwards if there is a general election, that any terms of departure, from any government, must go back to the people for the final say. They should have the option to remain, and I for one will be out there campaigning to remain. And she pays tribute to her \u201cfriend\u201d and neighbouring MP, Jeremy Corbyn. We have been getting some more information from Labour about how the plan to introduce a 32-hour working week over a decade would work. (See 12.19pm and 12.21pm.) Here are some of the points that have emerged. John McDonnell is not proposing a French-style cap on maximum working hours. He was persuaded by the arguments in the report from Lord Skidelsky on working hours (pdf) that Labour published recently explaining a cap would not work. Instead, McDonnell plans to use two mechanisms to drive down average working hours over a decade - collective sectoral bargaining, and a working time commission. The working time commission, based on the low pay commission (which oversees the minimum wage and the national living wage) would recommend increases in minimum holiday entitlements. Over time, it is envisaged that these would go up. And collective sectoral bargaining - a landmark Labour pledge, which could have a huge impact how firms deal with their employees - would also play a part, because it would provide a mechanism by which working hours could be cut. The average working week is currently 37.1 hours. Labour wants to reduce this by five hours over a decade. It views this as a political commitment, not a legally binding one. It is not planning to give every individual worker the right not to have to work more than 32 hours a week. Part of the plan is to ensure that workers can benefit more from productivity increases. McDonnell believes that for much of the last 150 years or so increases in productivity led to shorter working hours. But in recent years workers have not benefitted from those productivity increases, he believes. McDonnell does not believe that moving towards a shorter working week will cost jobs. He believes increasing productivity can make a shorter working week affordable. His team has not tried to produce costings for the impact of this policy. A 32-hour woking week is equivalent to a four-day working week if someone works eight hours a day. But McDonnell is not presenting this as a move to a four-day week. He thinks in different sectors staff will want to reduce hours in different ways. And now it has been confirmed. Turning away from the Labour conference for a moment, the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg says we will get the supreme court decision as to whether Boris Johnson\u2019s five-week prorogation of parliament was lawful at 10.30am tomorrow. Here is some Twitter reaction to the John McDonnell speech from journalists. From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From Sky\u2019s Ed Conway From my colleague Jonathan Freedland From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From my colleague John Crace From ConservativeHome\u2019s Mark Wallace Yasmine Dar, a CLP representative on the national executive committee, is addressing the conference now. She is moving the the NEC statement about Brexit. (See 10.10am) She says passing this motion will not stop delegates being able to debate and vote on the other Brexit motions. She says Brexit should not be allowed to divide the party. \u201cPlease, comrades, support Jeremy [Corbyn] on this issue,\u201d she says. McDonnell is now on his peroration. When they ask you some time in the future: Where were you when people were left to sleep on our streets? When families queued at food banks to survive? When the Tories tried to sell out our country to Trump. When climate change threatened our planet and our very existence? I want you all to be able to say: I built the homes and public services our people needed. I made sure everyone was fed and cared for. With nobody forced to endure poverty. I saved the planet by tackling climate change. I helped lay the foundations of a new society. Foundations so deeply rooted that the Tories can never break them up. And when they ask: how did you do that? You can tell them: I supported Labour, I joined Labour, I voted for Jeremy Corbyn. That\u2019s how. Solidarity. McDonnell says Labour would give developing countries free or cheap access to green technologies, partly to make \u201creparations\u201d for colonialism. We recognise that the first industrial revolution meant Britain was the first major contributor to climate change \u2013 something that left a lasting legacy for the global south. And to begin making some reparations for our colonial past, I pledge we will provide to the citizens of the global south free or cheap access to the green technologies developed as part of our green industrial revolution. McDonnell says Labour would spend \u201cwhatever resources are necessary\u201d to meet climate change obligations. For my part, I will make sure the Treasury puts in whatever resources are necessary to meet our obligations. A sustainable investment board, coordinating the Treasury, BEIS department and Bank of England. \u00a3250bn of green government investment in a national transformation fund. And \u00a3250bn more of lending through our national investment bank, delivered at grassroots level by regional development banks and our new post bank. And while the Labour government will need to take the lead, we\u2019ll make whatever reforms are necessary to ensure the finance sector isn\u2019t pushing the other way by investing in carbon-intensive sectors. That means billions more raised through green bonds and support for a Europe-wide green new deal programme so that we can bring forward significantly that 2050 target. McDonnell turns to climate change. I believe when historians write about 2019, the most important political event so far has not been replacing one useless Tory prime minister with another. It\u2019s been the emergence on the national scene of climate change as amongst the most urgent political questions of the day. And he pays tribute to the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. And outside parliament I want to pay tribute to the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. I have been proud to march and demonstrate with them. They have shamed older generations of politicians into taking climate change seriously and with the urgency it needs. Now it\u2019s essential that the Labour movement continues to join in solidarity with those young people to help lead that fight. McDonnell says Scotland would benefit from Labour\u2019s plan, even though it already has free personal care. Of course, in Scotland, a Labour government has already introduced free personal care, so when we spend the billions needed to guarantee free personal care in England, there will be billions more for First Minister Richard Leonard when he takes office in 2021. A Labour government making millions of lives better across the UK, thanks to our transformative policies in Westminster, but also through the new resources for the Scottish and Welsh governments. McDonnell gives more details about the proposed national care service. So I can announce today that, after years of campaigning by trade unions and carers, as the first building block in our new national care service, the next Labour government will introduce personal care free at the point of use in England. Funded not through the Conservatives\u2019 gimmicky insurance schemes. But, like the NHS and our other essentials, through general taxation. And we\u2019re publishing the first steps of our national care service vision today. Investing in the workforce and ensuring they are employed on local authority rates of pay, working conditions and training to deliver high-quality care, as Unison has advocated. And over time, we will bring those services back into public ownership and democratic control. We will make sure that local councils have the necessary resources after years of savage cuts. Building up capacity in local government for both care homes and domiciliary care So we\u2019ll require all providers \u2013 public, private or charitable \u2013 to adhere to strict criteria on ethical standards. Because nothing is more important than dignity in retirement for those who have built our country and given younger generations the world we live in today. And I want to thank the hard work and leadership that Barbara Keeley has shown in driving forward our policy on this issue. McDonnell confirms the announcement about Labour offering free personal care. McDonnell says Labour would rebuild local democracy and revive local services. My generation inherited a treasure of public parks, libraries, swimming pools and leisure centres. Free or affordable for all. But in too many cases they\u2019re now gone. They\u2019ve been privatised or have priced out the families they were built for. These public assets meant a better life for millions of us. And were part of the strong welfare state that our movement fought for and built. Providing free at the point of use the things that make lives worth living. As well as the essentials like health, education, even those have come under attack in recent years But we mustn\u2019t limit our ambition to repairing the damage caused by nine years of Tory austerity. We must go much further. I\u2019m launching today our document on universal basic services. It lays out our belief that everyone has a right to a good life. That the state has responsibility to make good on that right. By providing public services free at the point of use. These services are part of our shared experiences. Experiences that are too important to be left to the vagaries of the market. Whether a family can afford them or not. As socialists we believe that people have the right to education, health, a home in a decent, safe environment and, yes, access to culture and leisure. McDonnell explains how Labour would go about this. As a first step we\u2019ll end the opt-out from the European working time directive. As we roll out sectoral collective bargaining, we will include negotiations over working hours. We\u2019ll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements. This will allow unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector. And we\u2019ll set up a working time commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment. But while millions are exhausted from overwork, there are too many others who can\u2019t get the working hours they need, so we\u2019ll also ban zero-hour contracts to make sure every employee has a guaranteed number of hours a week too. McDonnell says Labour will aim to reduce the full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade \u2013 with no loss of pay. We should work to live, not live to work. Thanks to past Labour governments but mainly thanks to the trade union movement, the average full-time working week fell from nearly 65 hours in the 1860s to 43 hours in the 1970s. As society got richer, we could spend fewer hours at work. But in recent decades progress has stalled. People in our country today work the longest average full-time hours in Europe apart from Greece and Austria. And since the 1980s the link between increasing productivity matched by expanding free time has been broken. It\u2019s time to put that right. So I can tell you today that the next Labour government will put in place the changes needed to reduce average full-time hours to 32 a week within the next decade. A shorter working week with no loss of pay. McDonnell says work is not just about wages. Work isn\u2019t just about wages. It\u2019s about freedom from drudgery; having dignity, respect and a voice in the workplace. That means a strong trade union movement and collective bargaining. But also, in the new public services we\u2019re creating, it means management by workers and service users rather than by remote bureaucrats in Whitehall. In large companies it means a third of directors being elected by workers and a tenth of shares being owned by those workers. It means doubling the size of our cooperative sector, and going further, I hope, in our ambitions. McDonnell says Labour would end in-work poverty. Labour has traditionally been committed to full employment. We have always believed that getting a job should be a means to lift yourself out of poverty. But under the Tories the link between work and escaping poverty has been broken. So I commit today that within our first term of office Labour will end in-work poverty. This is a current pledge. McDonnell explained how Labour would achieve this in a speech in July. McDonnell says article 50 should not be revoked without a referendum. I warn those who would revoke article 50 without a democratic mandate, ask yourselves what message that sends to our people. An old professor of mine, Bernard Crick, was once asked to define socialism in one sentence. He said socialism is the achievement of equality through democracy. We can\u2019t say to people, \u201cLabour wants you to share in the running of your workplace, your community and your environment, but we don\u2019t trust you to have the final say over Brexit.\u201d Nothing would do more to undermine their faith in democracy in all its forms. (There are few people in Labour arguing for article 50 to be revoked without a referendum. This passage seems to be aimed primarily at the Liberal Democrats.) McDonnell turns to Brexit. We aim to trust the people in having the final say on Brexit. A deal or remain. Some of you will know I have said I will campaign for remain. But let me make it clear that I profoundly respect those who support a genuine alternative. In our debates today I want us to demonstrate in the respect we show each other and how we bring our party together just how we can also bring the country together again. McDonnell says politics is going through a period of \u201cprofound insecurity\u201d. My fear, though, is that as a result of the behaviour, language and cynical opportunism of some politicians on the right, we have entered a period of profound insecurity and risk to our democratic system. We have seen before in our history what kind of forces can be unleashed by politicians who have a total disregard for the truth in their ruthless pursuit of power for power\u2019s sake \u2026 politicians who attack the very institutions and practices, no matter how flawed, that protect and uphold our democracy, parliament, the courts and the rule of law. The best antidote to those who attack our democratic rules and institutions is more democracy itself. McDonnell praises a friend who almost became leader of the Labour party by accident - Jeremy Corbyn. And what makes me so proud of him is that no matter what smears and personal attacks by the gutter press. He always continue to embody the kinder, gentler politics he advocates. McDonnell says he thinks Labour MPs should be supporting the unions, in parliament and on the picket line. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is delivering his speech now. He starts by paying tribute to all the members of his team, including Anneliese Dodds, who he says has found the \u201cmagic money tree\u201d in the Cayman Islands and is digging it up and bringing it home. She has been working on tax avoidance. Tom Watson thinks Jon Lansman, who tabled the motion at Labour\u2019s national executive committee without warning on Friday night in an attempt to abolish Watson\u2019s deputy leader post, is not the best person to complain about NEC processes being abused. (See 10.37am.) Ahead of the Brexit vote this afternoon Labour pro-remain campaigners are flagging up some figures from a poll conducted for the People\u2019s Vote campaign. It found that 72% of Labour leave voters said they would definitely not vote Conservative, and 48% said they would definitely not vote for the Brexit party. But only 14% of Labour remain voters said they would definitely not vote Lib Dems. Labour remainers think this shows that the fear of Labour losing millions of voters to leave parties is exaggerated; they claim the real risk is from Labour losing remain votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens. From the BBC\u2019s Peter Saull From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Without having been there, it is hard to know whether Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s complaint, that the journalists who were pushing their way past delegates were being \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, was fair or not. He seems to have been referring in particular to photographers and TV cameramen and when a large group of them are in a small space all trying to get a shot it can all get a bit rumbustious. A \u201cgoatfuck\u201d is the technical description often used. Still, berating journalists often does not go down well - with journalists. And only Corbyn can compress so much passive aggression into the phrase \u201cour friends in the media\u201d. Turning to Brexit, McCluskey urges the conference to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position, which is designed to ensure the party does not alienate leave voters. McCluskey says: Let me say here that Jeremy Corbyn is a thousand times right in trying to speak to our whole country at this time of crisis. When we have the Tories dismissing half of our nation. And the Liberals are writing off the other half. It is only Jeremy\u2019s Labour that puts social justice first, that says whether you are \u201cleave\u201d or \u201cremain\u201d matters less than your class. We should not let anyone define or divide us as leavers or remainers. What defines us is that we are socialists. And our vision of a better Britain, a better world, is within our grasp. And I beg you, comrades, keep your eyes on the prize. In a general election campaign people will see that only Labour offers policies to create a better and fairer Britain. Policies to heal our nation. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, the biggest union backing Labour, is speaking at the conference now. He starts with an attack on the Liberal Democrats. Austerity thrust on us by the Tories and their Liberal Democrat partners. Jo Swinson doesn\u2019t like Jeremy and the Labour party apparently, well, the feeling\u2019s mutual. Her party gave us austerity and destroyed our communities. She voted in favour of every attack on our welfare state. And we won\u2019t forget that. She reminds us that you can never trust a Liberal Democrat. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, addressed the conference this morning. He is in the \u201cback remain now\u201d camp on Brexit, as he made clear in a TV interview yesterday, but he largely avoided the topic in his speech. Instead he focused on domestic policy, making two proposals. Leonard said a Labour government would give the Scottish parliament power over employment law. He said: I am proud that our party will go into government with a new determination to shift power closer to the people. We will extend democracy not just at the ballot box, but in every workplace and in every community. And so let me be crystal clear, this democratic renewal, this redistribution of power we seek, this is not simply about parliaments and the members elected to them. It is about strong local government. It is about redressing the imbalance of power between tenant and landlord, between worker and owner, between citizen and state, between women and men. So the next Labour government will deliver a new Scotland Act, that will provide for the devolution of employment law with a UK wide floor. He said councils should be able to buy land for housing at existing use value. There is a housing emergency in Scotland and the price of land lies at the centre of it. So when we launch our housing commission report in the next few weeks, it will make radical recommendations which tackle the excess profits of property developers. Including a proposal to introduce a new law giving local councils, housing associations and housing co-operatives the right to acquire land at an existing use value. Good housing policy has always been at the core of Labour party values. It is where we came from. And under the Scottish Labour government that I lead, housing will become a national priority again. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. These are from Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The fact that Unison, which controls a sizeable chunk of the union vote at conference, is going to vote against the NEC motion and in favour of composite 13 (see 10.10am), means that there is now a greater chance than we thought this morning that the conference could unequivocally come down in favour of committing to remain now. In Brighton we\u2019ve been given a bit more information from party officials about the process for the Brexit voting this afternoon. Here are the key points. Three separate Brexit proposals are being put to the vote. They are: 1) The NEC statement, saying: \u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in [a referendum on Brexit] \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.\u201d 2) Composite 13 on Brexit. This is the \u201cback remain now\u201d one. It says: Labour must reflect the overwhelming view of its members and voters, who want to stay in the EU. Labour will therefore campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU in that referendum, while recognising the rights of those members who want to argue another view. 3) Composite 14 on Brexit. This is the composite motion backing the leadership position although, unlike the NEC statement, it does not say explicitly that the decision on the party\u2019s stance in a referendum should be postponed. It just says Jeremy Corbyn has made the way forward \u201cabundantly clear\u201d by backing a public vote. Labour accepts that all three motions could be passed - even though the NEC statement and composite 13 are contradictory. Today\u2019s votes will not automatically determine Labour\u2019s position at the next election, officials admit. The decision as to what goes into the manifesto will be taken nearer the time at a clause V meeting, where the NEC, the shadow cabinet and union leaders will agree the text of the document. If there are card votes, then results should be announced at some point int the evening - although it is not clear exactly when. Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn told Andrew Marr he would \u201cgo along with whatever decision the party comes to\u201d regarding Brexit. If the conference passes contradictory motions, that might not be straightforward. Here is the more detailed conference agenda for the day. 10am: Conference opens, with a report from Harry Donaldson, chair of the conference arrangements committee 10.10am: Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, speaks. 10.20am: Work, pensions and equality debate. 11.10am: Economy debate starts. Five composite motions are being debated, covering industrial strategy, insourcing, working hours, employment rights and the Royal Mail. And John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is winding up. 12.25pm: International debate, including the national executive committee statement on Brexit. 12.35pm: Voting on the morning\u2019s business. 2.15pm: The international debate continues. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is due open the debate, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is due to close it. As well as the two Brexit composites, composite motions on Yemen, an ethical foreign policy and human rights for the Uighurs are also being debated. 5.20pm: Voting on the afternoon\u2019s business. If there are card votes, as is almost certain for the Brexit motions, counting the card votes could take an hour or so. John McDonnell was giving interviews this morning to promote Labour\u2019s key overnight announcement, a \u00a36bn a year pledge to introduce free personal care. The Labour announcement is here, and my colleague Patrick Butler\u2019s story about it is here. On the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, said that Labour\u2019s personal care offer was \u201cless generous\u201d than it sounded. He explained: It\u2019s actually rather less generous than it appears. That\u2019s to achieve the same level of social care that we get at the moment, just for more people. So it\u2019s not returning the system to where it was in 2010 which would cost an additional \u00a36bn because it\u2019s been restricted so much. You really do have to have quite severe needs to get that social care. And secondly it\u2019s not going to save many people from the catastrophic cost that you can face if you go into residential care because it\u2019s not going to cover the cost of the accommodation and so on that you get there. So, whilst its expensive, it is nevertheless a relatively limited offer. Asked about the overall credibility of Labour\u2019s spending plans, Johnson sounded sceptical. He said that at the last election Labour was proposing spending increases worth around \u00a370bn a year, and tax increases worth around \u00a350bn a year. But Johnson said he thought Labour would only raise about \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn from its tax plans. And he said, in practice, Labour might have ended up spending more. He said the current Tory government is increasing health spending by more than Labour proposed, and that in reality a Labour government would have been spending more than it planned on health too. He went on: We are looking at such a big set of changes in terms of what they were saying a couple of years ago it is really not so much a question of does it all add up fiscally, it\u2019s a question of is it actually deliverable, either in terms of the level of tax increases or deliverable in terms of particularly the very large levels of investment spending they are suggesting. Labour will build a national network of charging points for electric vehicles at a cost of \u00a33.6bn to kickstart its planned \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d if elected, the party has announced this morning. My colleagues Fiona Harvey and Matthew Taylor have the full story here. And here is Labour\u2019s news release about the announcement. The GMB union will not be supporting the pro-remain composite in the debate this afternoon, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Tim Roache is the GMB\u2019s general secretary. McDonnell says it would not be responsible for Labour to back a no-deal Brexit. Q: The NEC wanted to hold a meeting on this yesterday, but it did not go ahead. McDonnell says he is not on the NEC. He says he has been told the first meeting over-ran, which is why a second one did not go ahead. Q: I\u2019ve been told Jon Lansman consulted the leader\u2019s office before he pushed for the deputy leader\u2019s post to be removed. McDonnell says Jeremy Corbyn has denied knowing about the Lansman motion. He says he supports the idea of having two deputy leaders. Q: Andrew Fisher\u2019s resignation shows all is not well with the party. McDonnell says everyone has a bad day at the office. He says he hopes that Fisher will stay on. Sometimes you can have a bad day in the office, sometimes your colleagues can drive you up the wall. He\u2019s staying until after the election at the end of the year and, if I have anything to do with it - this is just a message to Andrew - I\u2019m going to persuade you to stay. Q: But his criticisms were strong. McDonnell says everyone gets angry with their work colleagues from time to time. People lose their tempers. He is sure that this happens at the BBC too, he says. Not since John Humphrys has left, Martha Kearney, the Today presenter, jokes. And that\u2019s it. McDonnell explains the leadership position again. Labour would negotiate a new Brexit deal, then have a special conference where it would decide its position in that referendum. He says it is hard for people to decide their view when they don\u2019t know what the deal will say. Q: But you have. You say you will back remain. McDonnell accepts the point, but say people will want to see what the deal says. John McDonnell is on Today now talking about Brexit. He says he would vote remain in a future referendum. Q: If you think that, why shouldn\u2019t the party back remain? McDonnell says people should exercise their own judgement. Q: But if you, the shadow foreign secretary, the shadow Brexit secretary and most members want the party to back remain, can you still sit on the fence as a party? McDonnell says this is a democratic proposal. People have different views, he says. He rejects claims that the party is in the midst of a civil war. I smiled when you used the language earlier of civil war and revolt but there isn\u2019t any war in the Labour party. It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate. People have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important. But that\u2019s not people respecting each other\u2019s views as well. I keep saying: do not mistake democracy for division. It isn\u2019t - what we\u2019re having is an honest debate. One of the many surprising features about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader in 2015 was that he managed to get chosen by a party that is overwhelming in favour of EU membership despite, for most of his career, being in favour of the UK being out. Corbyn accepted remain as the party\u2019s position, members adored him for other reasons, and mostly this contradiction has been glossed over. At the last two party conferences Labour used classic procedural ploys to defuse a split on this issue; in 2017 members decided to shelve a proposed debate on Brexit to avoid the need for a row, and last year the party adopted a compromise \u201call options on the table\u201d composite on a second referendum that satisfied remainers while not actually committing the party to anything. But this year it looks as though a split can be avoided not longer. As we explain in our overnight story, delegates will be asked to choose between two rival Brexit motions - one setting out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s preference, which is for the party to postpone deciding whether it will campaign for remain in a second referendum until after the election, and another saying the party should commit to remain now. As our story explains: [Corbyn\u2019s] proposal to put off the decision until after an election was endorsed by the national executive committee, by 16 votes to 10, after members were asked to send their agreement by email and without a meeting. \u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government,\u201d the statement said. However, pro-EU activists fought during a lengthy meeting on Sunday night to ensure there would be a vote on the conference floor on Monday on whether Labour should immediately adopt an unequivocally remain position. More than 50 local parties swung behind a pro-remain motion, while eight backed a more neutral motion closer to the leadership\u2019s position. Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. At Labour conference trade unions have almost half the votes, and constituency Labour party (CLP) delegates have the other 50%. (A handful of non-union affiliated organisations have the rest.) Members are largely in favour of the \u201cback remain now\u201d approach, but the unions seem to be mostly behind the party leadership. In a statement last night Michael Chessum, national organiser of Another Europe is Possible, which has been mobilising support for the \u201cback remain now\u201d motion, said that it would \u201clook awful\u201d if Corbyn won today just as a result of the union bloc vote. He said: Ninety percent of motions to this conference are anti-Brexit, reflecting a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-remain. We are taking a remain position to conference floor, where we are expecting a close vote. Using union bloc votes to defeat the overwhelming majority of members may well not work, and would look awful. There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn. We want a radical Labour government, and Corbyn in Number 10. The best way of getting there is with clarity on Brexit and a clear message to our members and voters that we are on their side. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is about to discuss this on Today. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Conference opens. Delegates will debate economic issues. 12pm: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks. 2pm: Delegates start a debate covering foreign affairs and Brexit. 2.15pm: Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, speaks. 5.10pm: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, speaks at the end of the debate. At that point delegates will vote although, if there is a card vote, the result will not be announced immediately. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will focusing almost exclusively on the Labour conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>With an imminent general election, both the main political parties are riven by rows over Brexit and how tough a line to take. Yet the lesson of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">last election in 2017</a> was that the public gets to choose which issues really matter, not the politicians \u2013 and politicians forget at their peril that elections are about issues that are as broad as life itself. And this forthcoming vote could well be much more consequential than the last one: not just wider than Brexit, but bigger than it too.</p> <p>Brexit itself is merely the prism through which a much larger contest has been refracted. Over the past few years, the Brexit debate has shifted away from the question of whether the UK would secure a \u201cgood deal\u201d or a \u201cbad deal\u201d from the European Union \u2013 as if we were haggling over the price of a secondhand car \u2013 towards a more isolationist impulse. Now the Brexiters argue we should walk away with a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/nigel-farage-boris-johnson-no-deal-brexit-election-non-aggression-pact\" title=\"\">clean break</a>\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a real possibility that the 2020s will define our political and economic settlement for an entire generation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truth is that Brexit was never a unilateralist project but an Atlanticist one. For the Brexiters now in the cabinet, the project was never about splendid isolation but rather diverging from the European social and economic model, and embracing the American way of life. That means a sink-or-swim society, with much lower levels of social protection. Its moral principles are spartan: the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.</p> <p>So this year\u2019s election must be located in the deeper choices the country faces. Twice in the last century, one economic and political settlement has broken down to be replaced by another. Just as the crises of the 1930s precipitated the formation of the postwar consensus in the 40s, and the multiple crises of the 70s heralded the neoliberal settlement of the 80s, the 2020s could hold similar significance.</p> <p>It is possible to detect a pattern: a moment of crisis, a decade of collapse, and a period of rebuilding. More than 10 years on from the global financial crisis, there is a real possibility that the 2020s will define our political and economic settlement for an entire generation.</p> <p>The consequence of the 1945 election was that markets were tamed to serve people for 30 years. That achievement was reversed when, in 1979, a new era of market fundamentalism was unleashed. Is it possible to build a post-crash consensus in the 2020s that will carry us into the decades ahead? This could be the last general election of the neoliberal era. The alternative is that it perpetuates what Gramsci called the \u201cinterregnum\u201d \u2013 the period when the old is dying but the new cannot be born.</p> <p>Either corporate power and excess will be tamed \u2013 or inequality and injustice will deepen, with the spread of new technologies that increase the wealth and power of the new global elite. Either the finance sector will be pacified \u2013 or everyone else will live at the mercy of its investment and lending decisions, awaiting the next financial crisis. Either those with the broadest shoulders will contribute more for better public services, or those services will continue to be degraded, and public sector workers will see their living standards continue to fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f4f5316ed5e259661a41da5f5d1c91b35038e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f4f5316ed5e259661a41da5f5d1c91b35038e0/0_133_3879_2327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest last year against underfunding and privatisation of the NHS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest last year against underfunding and privatisation of the NHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have real choices to make about the society in which we live. Not only whether it cares for the poor and vulnerable who have been mistreated by austerity, but whether we expand the bounds of what we do together and for one another. Will we end, mend or renew our social contract?</p> <p>The debate on so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/uk-universal-basic-services-jonathan-portes\" title=\"\">universal basic services</a>\u201d \u2013 reimagining the norms for what the state provides \u2013 is the entry point. Will social care be provided free at the point of need or will the burden fall on individuals and families? Will public transport be made cheap and plentiful right across the country, just as it is in London? Will we make big datasets available to all researchers and entrepreneurs, or keep them walled away for the benefit of giant companies? Should internet access be universal and free? We have an opportunity to redefine which parts of life are made better by working together and what should still be left up to individuals.</p> <p>There is generational urgency to this election too. The past decade has been especially tough on young people: millennials are the first generation of the modern era to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/millennials-struggling-is-it-fault-of-baby-boomers-intergenerational-fairness\" title=\"\">poorer than their parents</a>, the legacy of growing up under austerity and neoliberalism. They are becoming more politically engaged and hungry for more profound change than is commonly imagined. But their demands are individual rather than collective, conservative rather than radical.

      "bodyText": "With an imminent general election, both the main political parties are riven by rows over Brexit and how tough a line to take. Yet the lesson of the last election in 2017 was that the public gets to choose which issues really matter, not the politicians \u2013 and politicians forget at their peril that elections are about issues that are as broad as life itself. And this forthcoming vote could well be much more consequential than the last one: not just wider than Brexit, but bigger than it too. Brexit itself is merely the prism through which a much larger contest has been refracted. Over the past few years, the Brexit debate has shifted away from the question of whether the UK would secure a \u201cgood deal\u201d or a \u201cbad deal\u201d from the European Union \u2013 as if we were haggling over the price of a secondhand car \u2013 towards a more isolationist impulse. Now the Brexiters argue we should walk away with a \u201cclean break\u201d. The truth is that Brexit was never a unilateralist project but an Atlanticist one. For the Brexiters now in the cabinet, the project was never about splendid isolation but rather diverging from the European social and economic model, and embracing the American way of life. That means a sink-or-swim society, with much lower levels of social protection. Its moral principles are spartan: the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. So this year\u2019s election must be located in the deeper choices the country faces. Twice in the last century, one economic and political settlement has broken down to be replaced by another. Just as the crises of the 1930s precipitated the formation of the postwar consensus in the 40s, and the multiple crises of the 70s heralded the neoliberal settlement of the 80s, the 2020s could hold similar significance. It is possible to detect a pattern: a moment of crisis, a decade of collapse, and a period of rebuilding. More than 10 years on from the global financial crisis, there is a real possibility that the 2020s will define our political and economic settlement for an entire generation. The consequence of the 1945 election was that markets were tamed to serve people for 30 years. That achievement was reversed when, in 1979, a new era of market fundamentalism was unleashed. Is it possible to build a post-crash consensus in the 2020s that will carry us into the decades ahead? This could be the last general election of the neoliberal era. The alternative is that it perpetuates what Gramsci called the \u201cinterregnum\u201d \u2013 the period when the old is dying but the new cannot be born. Either corporate power and excess will be tamed \u2013 or inequality and injustice will deepen, with the spread of new technologies that increase the wealth and power of the new global elite. Either the finance sector will be pacified \u2013 or everyone else will live at the mercy of its investment and lending decisions, awaiting the next financial crisis. Either those with the broadest shoulders will contribute more for better public services, or those services will continue to be degraded, and public sector workers will see their living standards continue to fall. We have real choices to make about the society in which we live. Not only whether it cares for the poor and vulnerable who have been mistreated by austerity, but whether we expand the bounds of what we do together and for one another. Will we end, mend or renew our social contract? The debate on so-called \u201cuniversal basic services\u201d \u2013 reimagining the norms for what the state provides \u2013 is the entry point. Will social care be provided free at the point of need or will the burden fall on individuals and families? Will public transport be made cheap and plentiful right across the country, just as it is in London? Will we make big datasets available to all researchers and entrepreneurs, or keep them walled away for the benefit of giant companies? Should internet access be universal and free? We have an opportunity to redefine which parts of life are made better by working together and what should still be left up to individuals. There is generational urgency to this election too. The past decade has been especially tough on young people: millennials are the first generation of the modern era to be poorer than their parents, the legacy of growing up under austerity and neoliberalism. They are becoming more politically engaged and hungry for more profound change than is commonly imagined. But their demands are individual rather than collective, conservative rather than radical. They want those things their parents enjoyed: the opportunity for an education unsaddled with debt; a secure job with decent pay; the chance to own a home of their own; and a planet left to live on. For now, the political choices made by the younger generation show they have hope that democratic and collective action can meet their demands. But what if nothing changes? It is not hard to imagine ageing millennials turning sharply towards the populist right if the broken status quo is sustained. Looming larger than all else is how we choose to respond to climate breakdown. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has set a challenge to the world to radically change course by 2030 before tipping points are passed. These are not just about climate, but about the preservation of nature from the oceans to the mountains. No political party should be permitted to enter the coming election without a credible proposal for what it will do. The truth is that we can only seize the opportunities of the 2020s through collective action. And democracy itself remains our last, best hope of doing so. In recent times, the institutions of our democracy have creaked under the strain of extraordinary division. It is often said that the UK has an \u201cunwritten constitution\u201d, but that diverts us from its true character: our constitution belongs to the ruling class, not to the people. It is a set of rules and conventions for how the elite will conduct themselves as they govern the masses. It is precisely because Brexit has detonated that elite consensus that there is an opportunity to renew democracy for the common good. For all the doom-mongering, there is extraordinary potential for democratic flourishing. Who could fail to be inspired by the young climate strikers taking to the streets to demand their futures? Who can fail to see how technology could take political power away from the billionaire press barons and put it in the hands of the people? For all the problems with unregulated digital platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, we cannot miss the bigger opportunity to harness the explosion of energy towards building a better society. The answer to our problems is more democracy, not less. We could start the 2020s by letting people have the final say on Brexit; by writing a new constitution that belongs to the people; and by asserting democratic control over the economy so that it serves society.

      "bodyText": "With yet another major company failing (Thomas Cook to collapse leaving 150,000 holidaymakers stranded, 23 September), the Quaker ethics that led to Bournville (Letters, 23 September) come to mind: \u201cDo you maintain strict integrity in your business transactions and in your relations with individuals and organisations? Are you personally scrupulous and responsible in the use of money entrusted to you, and are you careful not to defraud the public revenue?\u201d Furthermore, with a belief in the value of each and every person in a company, decisions were by agreement and time spent in debate led to effective implementation and innovation with commitment. If only this responsible approach were prevalent today. Liz Byrne Letchworth, Hertfordshire \u2022 Why isn\u2019t the government prepared to bail out Thomas Cook? The cost of \u00a3200m would save the proposed \u00a3100m cost of \u201crepatriating\u201d holidaymakers, plus all the social and welfare costs of 9,000-plus redundant staff in the UK, not counting thousands more worldwide. The company could be required to slimline, modernise and pay back this bailout in a structured way. The closure of parliament, and the focusing of politicians\u2019 minds only on the Brexit issue (which may well be a cause of the company\u2019s collapse), means that there has been no national debate on this serious matter. Marie Sansford Brighton \u2022 Thomas Cook was a nationalised travel organisation until the Tory government privatised it in 1972. The obvious solution would be \u2013 even at this stage \u2013 to nationalise Thomas Cook, something previous Labour governments of 1974-1979 and 1997-2010 should have done.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s rows over Brexit worsened on Monday, as a split emerged in Momentum over whether to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position and Unison said it would back the pro-remain motion instead. Before crucial votes on Labour\u2019s Brexit position at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Brighton, the leadership was desperately trying to shore up support for the policy of delaying a decision on how the party would campaign in a referendum until after an election. The party\u2019s largely pro-EU membership will vote first on whether to support Corbyn\u2019s position, then a more neutral motion expressing backing for Corbyn and finally a statement in favour of Labour having a clear position in favour of remaining in the EU. Pro-remain campaigners received a boost after Unison, one of the biggest unions, said it would be backing the motion in favour of campaigning to stay in the EU. But they believed it would be \u201ctight\u201d because of a huge effort by the party leadership and unions to get delegates to support Corbyn\u2019s position, which was endorsed by the national executive committee (NEC) on Sunday. Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, decided during a phone meeting on Monday morning to support the leadership and reject the remain motion. But the decision was not supported by Jon Lansman, the chair of Momentum and one of its co-founders, who said he was \u201ccompletely supportive of Jeremy\u2019s leadership but incredibly disappointed with the process by which the NEC statement on Brexit was produced \u2026 there was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership\u201d. \u201cOn one of the biggest issues of the day, this is a travesty. Across the membership there are many different views on Brexit, and on conference floor members should feel free to vote with their conscience,\u201d he added. It is understood the Labour leader\u2019s office had been working behind the scenes to put pressure on Momentum officers to back Corbyn\u2019s position and reject a clear remain stance. The vote, expected in the late afternoon or early evening on Monday, will pitch Corbyn, Momentum, and some of the biggest unions including Unite and the GMB, against much of the party\u2019s membership, shadow cabinet ministers such as Emily Thornberry, and Unison. Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, made clear he wanted to campaign to remain in any second referendum, but he attempted to play down the row on Monday by saying he was happy to delay a decision on how the party would campaign. \u201cI smiled when you used the language earlier of civil war and revolt but there isn\u2019t any war in the Labour party. It\u2019s about honest, democratic debate,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cPeople have high emotions on this because they feel it\u2019s important. But that\u2019s people respecting each other\u2019s views as well. I keep saying: do not mistake democracy for division. It isn\u2019t \u2013 what we\u2019re having is an honest debate.\u201d He did, however, differ from Corbyn in saying he believed that no future deal could be better than Britain staying in the European Union. McDonnell said he wanted Labour to continue to promise an EU renegotiation, followed by a second referendum, if it won the next election. McDonnell also described the decision of Andrew Fisher, a key policy aide to the leader, to quit his post as the result of \u201ca bad day at the office\u201d. Fisher, who masterminded the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, said he no longer had faith that Labour would be successful. He wrote in a memo to colleagues that members of Corbyn\u2019s team had a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d. \u201cSometimes you are going to have a bad day at the office. Sometimes your colleagues are going to drive you up the wall,\u201d said McDonnell, who added that Fisher was one of his closest friends and that he would attempt to persuade him to remain in the role.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is the </strong><strong>general assembly?</strong></h2> <p>The UN general assembly is the world\u2019s parliament, where all the UN\u2019s 193 member states are represented. Each sovereign state gets one vote so it is not exactly representative of the world\u2019s population but then again, its votes are not binding on the membership, except in budgetary matters.</p> <p>The general assembly is not nearly as powerful as the security council, which can pass binding resolutions, and is dominated by the five permanent members, the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, who each have a veto.</p> <p>But the general assembly can express world opinion, make recommendations to the security council and elect the council\u2019s non-permanent members. The 74th session takes place this month.</p> <p>The general assembly and the security council are two of six main organs of the UN. They sit alongside the secretariat (the general secretary, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019, office), the international court of justice (seated in The Hague), the economic and social council (a policy coordination body) and the trusteeship council.</p> <h2>Why is this week important?</h2> <p>The only time the world really pays heed to its great talking shop is the week commencing 23 September, when the high-level general debate takes place at its customary moment in the annual diplomatic calendar.</p> <p>The world\u2019s leaders converge on New York, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium and orate in front of the world. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year.</p> <p>In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off.</p> <p>For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d1d86581df8b598cacfe7a3d797d8d136154f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1d86581df8b598cacfe7a3d797d8d136154f8b/0_0_2898_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"speech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castro and Khrushchev in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marty Lederhandler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America\u2019s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/khrushchev-sent-wine-to-irish-diplomat-after-shoe-incident-at-un\">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/23/gaddafi-un-speech\">Muammar Gaddafi</a> all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro\u2019s record 269 minutes in 1960.</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/binyamin-netanyahu-cartoon-bomb-un\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb.</p> <h2>Does anything ever get done at the general assembly?</h2> <p>Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/24/nuclear-weapons-un-security-council\">chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first general assembly in 2009</a>.</p> <p>This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however.</p> <h2>What do New Yorkers make of it?</h2> <p>Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use.</p> <p>It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador\u2019s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang.</p> <p>One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi\u2019s camping intentions. The landlord\u2019s name: Donald Trump.</p> <h2>What should we look for at this year\u2019s general assembly week?</h2> <p>The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil installations.</p> <p>Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this.</p> <p>Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran\u2019s supreme leader.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors however, may take a different view.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3014e52f3275af8a04f1c6e843f2f3dc4ca7e256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3014e52f3275af8a04f1c6e843f2f3dc4ca7e256/0_132_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani (centre), with and vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri (right) and Ali Akbar Velayati shortly before leaving Tehran for last year\u2019s general assembly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, (centre) with members of his cabinet shortly before leaving Tehran for last year\u2019s general assembly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a diversion from domestic woes.

      "bodyText": "What is the general assembly? The UN general assembly is the world\u2019s parliament, where all the UN\u2019s 193 member states are represented. Each sovereign state gets one vote so it is not exactly representative of the world\u2019s population but then again, its votes are not binding on the membership, except in budgetary matters. The general assembly is not nearly as powerful as the security council, which can pass binding resolutions, and is dominated by the five permanent members, the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, who each have a veto. But the general assembly can express world opinion, make recommendations to the security council and elect the council\u2019s non-permanent members. The 74th session takes place this month. The general assembly and the security council are two of six main organs of the UN. They sit alongside the secretariat (the general secretary, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019, office), the international court of justice (seated in The Hague), the economic and social council (a policy coordination body) and the trusteeship council. Why is this week important? The only time the world really pays heed to its great talking shop is the week commencing 23 September, when the high-level general debate takes place at its customary moment in the annual diplomatic calendar. The world\u2019s leaders converge on New York, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium and orate in front of the world. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries. The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America\u2019s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. Nikita Khrushchev, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Muammar Gaddafi all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro\u2019s record 269 minutes in 1960. More recently, Binyamin Netanyahu made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb. Does anything ever get done at the general assembly? Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first general assembly in 2009. This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however. What do New Yorkers make of it? Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use. It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador\u2019s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang. One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi\u2019s camping intentions. The landlord\u2019s name: Donald Trump. What should we look for at this year\u2019s general assembly week? The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil installations. Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this. Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran\u2019s supreme leader. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors however, may take a different view. Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a diversion from domestic woes. A second meeting with Trump is likely as both men have an interest in not looking isolated on the world stage. Face time with a US president is always an objective for most visiting leaders, to show their electorates their importance on the world stage. The circumstances of such an encounter can also be important. In 2009, the then UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, was desperate for even a brief meeting with Barack Obama. The meeting finally happened but under humiliating circumstances. Brown got a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d with Obama in the UN kitchens. As Obama strode past the pots and pans and gas ovens, Brown had to try to keep up and talk, out of sight of the world\u2019s cameras. Trump could try to achieve something on his stalled North Korea talks at this general assembly, either some progress with the Pyongyang regime, or a meeting of security council powers, in a bid to fix the holes in sanctions enforcement and put the screws back on. Trump\u2019s speech is expected to focus on global religious freedom, and he could well refer to the current US priorities at the UN, fighting abortion rights around the world and for a conservative stance on gender issues. Any no-shows? Some leaders might not bother with the general assembly at all. Vladimir Putin is a regular no-show. The Russian president tends to come only once a decade and the last time was in 2015. A bigger question is whether Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, will turn up. He came at the last moment in 2018, but this year, with the US and its allies no longer recognising him as head of state and accusing his regime of numerous crimes, his presence in New York, even as the theoretically protected guest of the UN, would be a much more risky endeavour. Who runs the general assembly? Although it is the UN secretary general who gets the limelight for most of the year, the event gives the president of the general assembly, elected each year by the member states ahead of general debate, a chance to shine.
