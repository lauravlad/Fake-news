He also criticised their \u201cmachismo\u201d, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>All four other candidates on the stage - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab - are willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit as an option (although they would all prefer to strike a deal) and Stewart argued this was foolish. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. It is going to deeply damage our economy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the most hardline Brexiter on the platform, was strongly criticised by all other candidates for his refusal to rule out proroguing parliament if necessary to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This position (which is reportedly shared by Johnson) was described as undemocratic by the other candidates. <strong>Sajid Javid </strong>said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Hunt criticised Johnson directly for not turning up for the debate.</strong> At one point, referring to the empty podium used by Channel 4 to highlight Johnson\u2019s non-appearance, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five<strong> </strong>pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question.</p> </blockquote> <p>Generally, though, there was little comment from the panel on Johnson\u2019s decision to stay away - unlike when Theresa May refused to show up for a leaders\u2019 debate in the general election, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lf5NJISo0\">her opponents repeatedly drew attention to her not being there.</a></p> <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong>\u2019s take on how each candidate did during the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/who-were-the-winners-and-losers-of-the-tory-leadership-debate\">Who were the winners and losers of the Tory leadership debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>\u2019s all-embracing news story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/boris-johnson-rivals-vie-to-offer-their-visions-for-post-brexit-britain\">Johnson's rivals vie to offer their visions for post-Brexit Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d06a7438f08532f138d2da2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T20:33:42.735Z\">9.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is<strong> Katy Balls</strong>\u2019s take on the debate <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/leadership-hopefuls-turn-on-one-another-in-channel-4-debate/\">for the Spectator\u2019s Coffee House blog.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katyballs/status/1140354748501123072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No clear winner in tonight&#39;s Channel 4 debate \u2013 though one candidate has managed to get a positive result in form of an MP endorsement <a href=\"https://t.co/2gVeAirDqY\">https://t.co/2gVeAirDqY</a></p>&mdash; Katy Balls (@katyballs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katyballs/status/1140354748501123072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With [Boris] Johnson already winning the support of enough MPs to make the final two (so long as it holds), tonight\u2019s debate was really for the remaining candidate to battle it out for the second spot ahead of the next MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday. In that vein, there was no clear winner this evening. However, the [Rory] Stewart campaign did appear to get something good out of it. After the debate ended, Conservative MP Margot James \u2013 who had been backing Matt Hancock before he dropped out on Friday \u2013 took to social media to say that she had been so impressed by Stewart she would now back him in the leadership contest. There is a concern amongst some of the other cabinet candidate campaigns that Stewart is the one gaining momentum right now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d06a6048f08374cc578f473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T20:27:12.195Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the Spectator\u2019s <strong>James Forsyth</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1140352973664673793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of the most striking things about tonight\u2019s debate was how once it moved off Brexit, the candidates agreed on nearly everything.

And indeed, trying to establish a \u201cwinner\u201d for an event like this would be difficult anyway, because the candidates were addressing three audiences - the public at large, Conservative party members, and Conservative MPs - all of whom may have come to quite separate conclusions about who did best. In short, it was not a game-changer.</p> <p>And it was not hugely productive on the news front either. (These events normally aren\u2019t; see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/16/channel-4-debate-tory-leadership-candidates-take-part-in-first-tv-hustings-without-boris-johnson-live-news?page=with:block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00#block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00\"> 6.01pm.) </a>We did not hear anything particularly new about Brexit and - surprisingly, given that the Conservatives are a party of government, with a need to reinvent themselves - the debate about where the party goes next rarely got beyond the platitudinous.</p> <p>Still, there were interesting exchanges for anyone following the Conservative leadership contest closely. Here is my assessment of how the candidates did, roughly in order of who I think can be judged to have done best.</p> <p><strong>Rory Stewart:</strong> There were predictions before tonight that Stewart would be like Nick Clegg in 2010 - the outsider who struck a chord with the public because he exposed the obvious failings of his more prominent opponents - and, although he probably mentioned tariff schedules once too often, he succeeded tonight in puncturing the Brexit complacency of his rivals. His repeated references to the shortcomings of machismo as strategy will have struck a chord, and people probably liked his repeated references to listening. In a poll of the public at large watching, he would probably be the clear winner. But of course the public at large won\u2019t choose the next Tory leader, and this performance won\u2019t necessarily stop him being eliminated next Tuesday, in the next ballot.</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid: </strong>In a large debate to succeed you have to stand out and Javid\u2019s personal anecdotes - the references to being an outsider and a victim of racism, and to being the only person on the panel to have gone to a comprehensive school - would probably have gone down well with anyone looking at the Tory leadership contest afresh (ie, without having heard it all before). He also delivered some particularly strong attack lines against the Brexiters, saying that only a dictator would prorogue parliament, and that you can\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party.<br></p> <p><strong>Michael Gove:</strong> Gove is competing to beat Jeremy Hunt to be on the final ballot against Boris Johnson and his references to how well he can perform in the Commons, which may have sounded like self-glorification to ordinary viewers, may have made an impression on Tory MPs who take this stuff seriously. At times Gove sounded shouty and pompous (eg, his line about he will be able to deliver Brexit because he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d), but he was a strong presence in the debate, extremely eloquent as usual, and perhaps some viewers will have liked his \u201clove and hope\u201d answer on knife crime, which sounded like David Cameron in his \u201chug a hoodie\u201d days (it worked for him).</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt: </strong>Hunt probably made the fewest mistakes. He came over as less hubristic than his main rival, Gove, and he was the first candidate to take a direct hit at Boris Johnson for not showing up. But he did not stamp his personality on the proceedings, and anyone watching this who had not been following the news would not have guessed that, of the people on stage, he is currently the candidate doing best.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Raab:</strong> Raab is standing as the only person guaranteeing to deliver Brexit by 31 October. This may be a selling point with the parliamentary party, although with that audience he has lost out to Boris Johnson for the Brexiter voter, and with members of the public watching tonight, he probably did not come out best in the exchanges over the rights and wrong of proroguing parliament. It was Raab against the other four, and their argument - that suspending parliament would be wrong - was more persuasive, and more passionately expressed.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson:</strong> He comes last, obviously, because he did not show up. But will that damage his standing in the long run? Yes, if he continues to dodge media exposure. But he is taking part in a rival, BBC debate on Tuesday, and that may go some way towards neutralising the \u201cchicken\u201d attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a5971e72c01ad8f58ed26589ec4af3e8879154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a5971e72c01ad8f58ed26589ec4af3e8879154/0_78_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab (left) and Rory Stewart during the live Channel 4 debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab (left) and Rory Stewart during the live Channel 4 debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Anderson/Channel 4/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T21:00:23.409Z\">at 10.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0691818f08374cc578f3ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T19:01:27.010Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the first take story from the Press Association on the debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rival Tory leadership contenders have turned on Dominic Raab after he refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through Brexit by the end of October. </p> <p>In the first televised debate of the campaign, the five candidates taking part all agreed the next prime minister had to take Britain out of the EU. </p> <p>But there were sharp differences as to how that could be achieved. </p> <p>Channel 4, which staged the debate, put an empty podium for frontrunner Boris Johnson who refused to take part. </p> <p>He was taunted about his absence by Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> who said it raised questions about his ability to take on the job of prime minister. </p> <p>\u201cWhere is Boris?

And welcome to our blog covering the first televised hustings of the Conservative leadership contest. Five of the six candidates still in the race - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart - will be taking part. As you all must know, because his reluctance to face media scrutiny is becoming a major part of the narrative of the contest, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, has said he will be staying away.</p> <p>What are we going to find out? Well, perhaps not very much, because televised debates often have much less impact on political campaigns than people assume they will. What matters over the next week is how 313 MPs vote (because they still have to whittle the field down to two, for the ballot of party members) and, because MPs know all these candidates well, they are unlikely to be influenced much by what any of them say tonight. But debates can make a difference because they can produce one, or all, of the following three things.</p> <p><strong>1) A winner?</strong> More often than not after a debate like this supporters of X believe X did best, supporters of Y think Y did best, and people who are neutral are divided or unsure. But sometimes there is an obvious winner - for example, Nick Clegg in the first debate of the 2010 general election.</p> <p><strong>2) A story? </strong>Televised debates are always a story. But that does not always mean they always produce a story - a candidate saying something interesting and new, or some other defining event. But we always live in hope.</p> <p><strong>3) A defining moment? </strong>This could be the answer or exchange that produces a winner or a story, but sometimes what gets said in a debate can end up being a defining moment even though it does not seem so at the time. This happened in the 2015 general election Question Time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/30/question-time-leaders-cameron-miliband-clegg-election\">when Ed Miliband was asked if the last government had overspent, and he said no.</a> It was a version of an answer he had given many times before. But the clarity of the exchange meant it crystallised a concern that many voters had about Labour, and later it was seen as hugely damaging.</p> <p>It is also the case that debates are a good way of allowing people to evaluate politicians. In his classic 1990s book about politics, Ruling Britannia, <strong>Andrew Marr</strong> explains why seeing politicians being interviewed on television is so important.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Television is very good at telling the voter certain things about a politician or other interviewee, One can read the facing tics and expressions that suggest tension, lying, anger and so forth. One can make a personal judgment about an individual minister or leader in a way that earlier generations never could, unless they were part of the privileged political elite. If before, one could read X\u2019s speech given verbatim in The Times, and treat X solely on the basis of his language and arguments, now one can concluded that X\u2019s grandson, the new minister, is a sanctimonious creep. And in the real world, the fact that \u2018X is a creep\u2019 is a valid personal assessment and matters to most of just as much as his speechifying.</p> </blockquote> <p>All of this is even more true of televised leadership debates, which involve leading politicians having to engage with each other in a way that does not normally happen in the Commons or on TV.</p> <p>The Channel 4 hustings starts at 6.30pm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/krishgm/status/1140284340666011648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DominicRaab</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RoryStewartUK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Jeremy_Hunt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sajidjavid</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@michaelgove</a> with open invitation for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/C4Debate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#C4Debate</a> live at 6.30pm on Channel 4. <a href=\"https://t.co/9rg4gqD0Bl\">pic.twitter.com/9rg4gqD0Bl</a></p>&mdash; Krishnan Guru-Murthy (@krishgm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krishgm/status/1140284340666011648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a>.</p> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

      "bodyText": "Five of the six remaining candidates for the Conservative leadership have clashed for the first time in a televised debate. Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, stayed away, and the 90-minute hustings - which were lively, but mostly good-tempered - were dominated by Brexit, allowing Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and been running an outside/insurgency campaign, to stand out by repeatedly criticising his opponents for making unrealistic promises about being able to renegotiate Brexit. He also criticised their \u201cmachismo\u201d, saying: The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense. All four other candidates on the stage - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab - are willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit as an option (although they would all prefer to strike a deal) and Stewart argued this was foolish. He said: A no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. It is going to deeply damage our economy. Dominic Raab, the most hardline Brexiter on the platform, was strongly criticised by all other candidates for his refusal to rule out proroguing parliament if necessary to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This position (which is reportedly shared by Johnson) was described as undemocratic by the other candidates. Sajid Javid said: We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy. Jeremy Hunt criticised Johnson directly for not turning up for the debate. At one point, referring to the empty podium used by Channel 4 to highlight Johnson\u2019s non-appearance, he said: I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question. Generally, though, there was little comment from the panel on Johnson\u2019s decision to stay away - unlike when Theresa May refused to show up for a leaders\u2019 debate in the general election, and her opponents repeatedly drew attention to her not being there. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on how each candidate did during the debate. And here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s all-embracing news story. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is Katy Balls\u2019s take on the debate for the Spectator\u2019s Coffee House blog. And here is an extract. With [Boris] Johnson already winning the support of enough MPs to make the final two (so long as it holds), tonight\u2019s debate was really for the remaining candidate to battle it out for the second spot ahead of the next MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday. In that vein, there was no clear winner this evening. However, the [Rory] Stewart campaign did appear to get something good out of it. After the debate ended, Conservative MP Margot James \u2013 who had been backing Matt Hancock before he dropped out on Friday \u2013 took to social media to say that she had been so impressed by Stewart she would now back him in the leadership contest. There is a concern amongst some of the other cabinet candidate campaigns that Stewart is the one gaining momentum right now. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Here is Margot James, the culture minister, endorsing Rory Stewart after tonight\u2019s debate. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on who did best and worst in the debate this evening. (We agree on who came \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d, but her take on the mid-ranking performers is a bit different from mine. Which is no bad thing. These are subjective judgments, and it would be a bit worrying if we all thought the same.) And this is what political journalists are saying about the debate on Twitter. No one seems to think this will change much, although Rory Stewart may have won the Twitter vote. That won\u2019t necessarily help him. As David Cameron said after he won the 2015 general election, despite social media coming out for Labour, \u201cBritain and Twitter are not the same thing\u201d. That is even more true of the Conservative party and Twitter. A thread from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates A blog from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire And here\u2019s an extract Meeting the 33 MP quota required for the third ballot will mean [Rory Stewart] almost doubling his first round result and the balance of probabilities is still stacked against him. But tonight\u2019s debate had no clear winner. That is bad news for the bigger cabinet names and good news for Stewart. Having won the endorsement of defence minister Tobias Ellwood this morning - one of Matt Hancock\u2019s 19 supporters - Stewart\u2019s hope was that more would follow. His disruptive presence on stage this evening boosts the chances of such a windfall: as shown by the post-match endorsement of Margot James, another minister who backed Hancock in the first round. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From my colleague Heather Stewart From the broadcaster Gavin Hewitt From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield That did not feel like a debate with a clear winner. And indeed, trying to establish a \u201cwinner\u201d for an event like this would be difficult anyway, because the candidates were addressing three audiences - the public at large, Conservative party members, and Conservative MPs - all of whom may have come to quite separate conclusions about who did best. In short, it was not a game-changer. And it was not hugely productive on the news front either. (These events normally aren\u2019t; see 6.01pm.) We did not hear anything particularly new about Brexit and - surprisingly, given that the Conservatives are a party of government, with a need to reinvent themselves - the debate about where the party goes next rarely got beyond the platitudinous. Still, there were interesting exchanges for anyone following the Conservative leadership contest closely. Here is my assessment of how the candidates did, roughly in order of who I think can be judged to have done best. Rory Stewart: There were predictions before tonight that Stewart would be like Nick Clegg in 2010 - the outsider who struck a chord with the public because he exposed the obvious failings of his more prominent opponents - and, although he probably mentioned tariff schedules once too often, he succeeded tonight in puncturing the Brexit complacency of his rivals. His repeated references to the shortcomings of machismo as strategy will have struck a chord, and people probably liked his repeated references to listening. In a poll of the public at large watching, he would probably be the clear winner. But of course the public at large won\u2019t choose the next Tory leader, and this performance won\u2019t necessarily stop him being eliminated next Tuesday, in the next ballot. Sajid Javid: In a large debate to succeed you have to stand out and Javid\u2019s personal anecdotes - the references to being an outsider and a victim of racism, and to being the only person on the panel to have gone to a comprehensive school - would probably have gone down well with anyone looking at the Tory leadership contest afresh (ie, without having heard it all before). He also delivered some particularly strong attack lines against the Brexiters, saying that only a dictator would prorogue parliament, and that you can\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party. Michael Gove: Gove is competing to beat Jeremy Hunt to be on the final ballot against Boris Johnson and his references to how well he can perform in the Commons, which may have sounded like self-glorification to ordinary viewers, may have made an impression on Tory MPs who take this stuff seriously. At times Gove sounded shouty and pompous (eg, his line about he will be able to deliver Brexit because he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d), but he was a strong presence in the debate, extremely eloquent as usual, and perhaps some viewers will have liked his \u201clove and hope\u201d answer on knife crime, which sounded like David Cameron in his \u201chug a hoodie\u201d days (it worked for him). Jeremy Hunt: Hunt probably made the fewest mistakes. He came over as less hubristic than his main rival, Gove, and he was the first candidate to take a direct hit at Boris Johnson for not showing up. But he did not stamp his personality on the proceedings, and anyone watching this who had not been following the news would not have guessed that, of the people on stage, he is currently the candidate doing best. Dominic Raab: Raab is standing as the only person guaranteeing to deliver Brexit by 31 October. This may be a selling point with the parliamentary party, although with that audience he has lost out to Boris Johnson for the Brexiter voter, and with members of the public watching tonight, he probably did not come out best in the exchanges over the rights and wrong of proroguing parliament. It was Raab against the other four, and their argument - that suspending parliament would be wrong - was more persuasive, and more passionately expressed. Boris Johnson: He comes last, obviously, because he did not show up. But will that damage his standing in the long run? Yes, if he continues to dodge media exposure. But he is taking part in a rival, BBC debate on Tuesday, and that may go some way towards neutralising the \u201cchicken\u201d attacks. Here is the first take story from the Press Association on the debate. Rival Tory leadership contenders have turned on Dominic Raab after he refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through Brexit by the end of October. In the first televised debate of the campaign, the five candidates taking part all agreed the next prime minister had to take Britain out of the EU. But there were sharp differences as to how that could be achieved. Channel 4, which staged the debate, put an empty podium for frontrunner Boris Johnson who refused to take part. He was taunted about his absence by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt who said it raised questions about his ability to take on the job of prime minister. \u201cWhere is Boris? If his team won\u2019t allow him out with five fairly friendly colleagues, how is is he going to deal with 27 European countries?\u201d he said. The sharpest early exchanges were however dominated by Dominic Raab\u2019s insistence the option of proroguing Parliament should remain on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is likely but it is not illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment that we telegraph to the EU we are not willing to walk away at the end of October we take away our best shot of a deal.\u201d International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said shutting down parliament was \u201cundemocratic\u201d and \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and would not work. \u201cParliament is not a building. parliament is our democratic representatives and they will meet regardless of what the prime minister wants,\u201d he said to applause from the studio audience. Hunt said it was the \u201cwrong thing to do\u201d while Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cYou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy. We are not selecting a dictator.\u201d Raab warned that parliament could not stop a determined prime minister, saying: \u201cIt is near impossible to stop a government that is serious.\u201d That drew a sharp retort from Environment Secretary Michael Gove who told him: \u201cI will defend our democracy. \u201cYou cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of parliament.\u201d Each candidate has 30 seconds to make a closing staement. Gove says these are serious times. We need someone as PM who has been tested and who has proved he can deliver. I am ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead. Hunt says the country is in peril. Labour is planning a Venezuelan or Cuban Britain. He is an entrepreneur and he can deliver, unlocking the dynamism in this country. Stewart says he has travelled the country and heard the anger of voters. He stared a 100/1 outsider. He is now second in the odds. But he is still an outside. He says he should be in the final two, ot make Britain a country founded in \u201chonesty and trust\u201d. Javid says the Tories need to show they do not just tolerate modern Britain, but embrace it. He wants to lead the UK through Brexit and beyond. Raab says he is the only candidate committed to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. I will be posting a snap verdict, reaction and a summary. Gove says he knows about autism, because someone close to him has the condition. And he says he has a sister with a disability. (She is deaf.) Stewart says he agrees with Raab. We need to focus more on prevention, he says. He says if any of them become prime minister - and he hopes it is one of them that becomes prime minister - they will address this, he says. Stewart suggests any of the other candidates would be a better prime minister than Boris Johnson. Q: How would you get rid of the postcode lottery for people with invisible disabilities, like my son, who has autism. Hunt says the government needs to do more for people with mental health problems. And people with autism are more likly to have mental health problems, he says. Raab says the state needs to pick problems like this up earlier. Prevention is better than cure, he says. Javid says we have become better at picking up these problems, but we need to do more, especially for children with special needs. Javid says he is stubborn. It takes him a long time to change his mind. It took him 10 years to agree to get a family dog, Bailey (star of his campaign video.) Q: Isn\u2019t the problem that you are not a big enough figure? You weren\u2019t a big enough figure to get invited to the Trump dinner. Hunt and Gove both protest about the question, with Gove saying it was ridiculous. Gove says Saj does not need Donald Trump to tell him his is a big figure. Hunt says: My friends would say I\u2019m someone who looks gentle but is incredibly stubborn underneath. Stewart says he has learnt a lot in this campaign about his weaknesses. We should not just have leaders who posture, he says. We need leaders who listen. He says he speaks to people in tech, and they know more about it than he does. Q: Is it a weakness to change your mind? You seem to do it a lot. Stewart says he thinks, and he changes his mind. I think that\u2019s part of the business of being frail. I think that\u2019s part of the business of being human. Raab says he is restless for change. He mentions mentoring a lad at boxing club. He says we need restless optimism. Q: What do you say to people who think your biggest weakness is thinking feminists are bigots. Raab says he should not be judged by something he said a long time ago that has been taken out of context. He was making a point about an equal attitude to discrimination. He is the only candidate calling for pregnant women to be routinely offered a third scan, he says. Q: Rory Stewart has spoken of the wisdom of humility. What is our greatest weakness? Impatience, says Gove. He is a man in a hurry. He wants every child to have the best start. And we need to \u201csuper-charge\u201d reform of adult social care. Guru-Murthy says Gove is supposed to be talking about his weaknesses. Gove says he is talking about impatience. Q: Isn\u2019t your weakness hypocrisy, as the drug-taking revelation showed? No, says Gove. We all make mistakes. If you make a mistake, you should learn from his mistake. One reason he is in public life is to help people who have made mistakes. Hunt says everyone on the stage did things 25 years ago they would not want their parents to know about. He says, with the country facing Brexit, we should not be trivialising the debate by talking about issues like this. This is from the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames. Gove says the government\u2019s approach to knife crime should not be about law and order. \u201cIt should be about love and hope.\u201d Stewart says there are 10,000 things he would like people to do together if he becomes PM. He mentions three. First, preparing for technological change and AI. Guru-Murthy says he was asked for just one priority. Stewart says it would be better social care. It\u2019s a real disgrace, it\u2019s the great unfinished revolution of our society. Javid says public services would be his priority. He relied on public services to get where he is now. He was the only person on the stage to go to a comprehensive school. He went to a college, a technical one, not the one Stewart went to (Eton College, then Balliol College at Oxford.) Q: What is the most important thing you would do apart from Brexit? Raab says he would boost apprenticeships. Hunt says he wants to do more on social care. His grandmother died at the age of 100. Everyone should be able to die with dignity. That does not happen at the moment. He says social care is unfinished business. Gove says children are his top priority. He says there needs to be more technical education. And some of the jobs being done now will disappear. So the government must allow people to retrain mid-career. Javid says he knows what it is like to be an outsider. He says it is important to show anyone can be PM. Hunt says he is committed to keeping the UK together. Before he was involved in Brexit, he was involved in the campaign to keep the UK together. (That is a reference to his unusual cairn campaign in 2014.) Hunt says this is the fundamental question for the party. Do they choose a path that unites the country or divides it. He says Javid spoke movingly about this. But Hunt says he wants to make a different point. It is important to consider the young, he says. They have to unite generations, and recognise that it is much, much harder for the young to buy a house than in the past. He says a quarter of primary school pupils cannot read or write properly when they leave. The Tories should be the party that abolishes illiteracy, he says. Gove says he agrees with Hunt. The country needs to come together. The party needs to value everyone. He has always believed there is \u201ca treasure in the heart of every individual\u201d, he says. He says that many of those who voted for Brexit come from communities that are undervalued and families that are overlooked. From what happened to his father\u2019s business, he knows what it is to see a dream die, he says. Q: How will you reunite a divided country? Javid says this is the third anniversary of the murder of Jo Cox. One of her big ideas is that there is more than unites us than divides us. He says he gets attacked personally. It is important to have a cohesive society, he says. He says having a different messenger will help bring people together. Raab says the Tories have to show they can do more than Brexit. He would show the party is on the side of the low paid by cutting taxes. He would boost apprenticeships. And he would have a fairer economy and a fairer society. Javid says: You don\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party. Stewart says he rejects no-deal. He believes in a country that says yes: yes to trade, and yes to a deal. Hunt says we need a Brexit that can work for the 48% of people who voted remain, as well as for the people who voted leave. He wants to show the UK is a tolerant country. That is another reason to reject Farage. Javid says all candidates should unite behind whoever wins. But it is the job of the government to deliver on Brexit. Farage is not part of the government, he says. Raab says the Tories can put the Brexit party out of business by delivering Brexit. Hunt says Farage stands for more than Brexit. He wants a WTO Brexit, ie no-deal. He says the Conservative party is the party of business. It will be nothing if it cannot champion business. No-deal should not be the Tories\u2019 first choice. But it is Farage\u2019s first choice. Q: Would any of you use Nigel Farage in Brexit negotiations? Stewart says he debated Nigel Farage on LBC this morning. He would be happy to talk to him about Brexit. And he would talk to people like the unions too. He says: I think a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. He says all the other candidates have just admitted it would be hugely damaging to the country. So it is not realistic, he says. Raab says Stewart is talking down the economy. Stewart says Raab is going back to machismo, and \u201cbelief in the bin\u201d. He asks Raab what the tariffs on cheddar would be under Raab\u2019s deal. Raab says he would try to get a deal, by going back to the Malthouse compromise. Raab says, if he were prime minister, he would have an emergency budget involving tax cuts to prepare the country for no-deal. Raab says he would prepare for no-deal by passing tax cuts in an emergency budget. Q: As the traditional party of business, how can you contemplate a no-deal Brexit? Hunt starts with an attack on Boris Johnson for not showing up. If he cannot handle five quite friendly colleagues, how will he be able to handle the EU 27. Hunt says he has experience as a negotiator. If were were close to a deal at the end of October, it would be wrong to leave without a deal. He says he thinks he is the business person who can negotiate a deal. Q: What would no-deal mean for farmers and for Northern Ireland? Gove says he is the candidate with most experience of planning for no-deal. He says no-deal would cause turbulence. But the UK could get through it. He says he knows what a deal would look like. Stewart asks what this deal will look like. What will the tariff schedule be? Gove says, if there is a deal, there will be no tariffs. He will ensure the backstop is temporary. Q: How? They\u2019ve said no. They would say no, says Gove. In any negotiation each side hangs tough. He says in government, faced with a difficult job, he has shown he can deliver. Q: Why would they deliver a deal for you when they did not for Theresa May? Because I have shown in government that my conviction can carry me through. And I\u2019ve taken on impossible odds. Gove claims he can deliver Brexit because in the past he has shown he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d. Gove says he understands why people are frustrated. But he backed Brexit to empower our democracy. He says shutting the doors of parliament would be wrong. We must defend our democracy. Q: So what would you do? Gove says there are two types of democracy: Raab\u2019s, because he would suspend parliament to get no-deal through; and Stewart\u2019s, because he does not think the UK can get a bette deal. Gove says one of the problems is that people in government have not believed in Brexit. He does believe in Brexit, he says. I\u2019m saying I can get the European Union to change their approach. Gove tells Raab the UK cannot leave unless parliament votes for it. Raab tries to say Gove would undermine his negotiating stance, but Gove talks over him, saying you cannot suspend democracy. Stewart says everyone is trying to show how \u201cmachismo\u201d can solve this. I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by being realistic about this. But wishful-thinking won\u2019t work, he says. He says he tried recently to stuff three bin bags in a bin that was full. He tried the \u2018believe in the bin bag\u2019 approach. But it did not work. The bin was full. Javid says Stewart is not being realistic either, because he wants to invite 50,000 people to come up with a solution to Brexit. Hunt says proroguing parliament to deliver no-deal would be wrong. Javid agrees with Hunt. You don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy. We are not selecting a dictator of our democracy. We are selecting a prime minister of our democracy. Javid suggests only a \u201cdictator\u201d would want to prorogue parliament to deliver no-deal. Q: What are your views on suspending (proroguing) parliament? And if you don\u2019t suspend parliament, how will you deal with this impasse? Raab says there is no need to suspend parliament. Leaving in October is default. But every time you rule out suspending parliament, you weaken the UK\u2019s negotiating stance, he says. Q: Are you willing to do it? Raab says he does not think this is likely. But it would not be illegal. Stewart says Raab knows there is no way of getting his Brexit deal unless he suspends parliament. That\u2019s \u201cnonsense\u201d, says Raab. He says Stewart wants a people\u2019s assembly, the Venezuelan option. Stewart says Tony Blair tried to do this in 2002. But MPs threatened to meet in Church House, and Blair backed down. (That is not quite true. The issue in 2002 was about whether to recall parliament early, not prorogation.) Gove says he put everything on the line for Brexit - including friends. He says in three cabinet jobs he has shown he can deliver. And he is the candidate who will frighten Corbyn. When Jeremy Corbyn wakes up before Question Time, who is the person he will be most terrified of facing? That\u2019s me. Gove says he is the candidate who will most frighten Corbyn at PMQs. He says he is personally committed to delivering Brexit because of what happened to his father\u2019s fish business. Jeremy Hunt says this is the most important question of the evening. The Tories have to deliver Brexit. But defeating Corbyn involves having a leader the public can trust. Hunt says he set up his own business. Corbyn does not support people like that. Corbyn is against British values and against Britain, he says. He says Theresa May did extremely well in the last election to get 41% of the vote. But she did not get a majority. May got the Brexit vote. But the Tories will only win a majority if they reach out to the centre ground. We will only get a majority if we reach out to the centre ground. Raab says it is a matter of trust. The key thing is to deliver Brexit. Stewart says he hopes they will come back to Brexit, because he has questions about Raab\u2019s approach. Q: They all says they can renegotiate Brexit. Do you agree? No, says Stewart. He says his question to Raab is how he will take the UK out of the EU. There has been talk of suspending parliament. What happens if Corbyn tries to do this? Raab says parliament has just voted against taking no-deal off the table. He says it is wrong to take an option off the table in a negotiation. Sajid Javid says you have to deliver Brexit. But that does not just mean leaving the EU. It means addressing the concerns that led to the leave vote. And the messenger matters as much as the message, he says. Rory Stewart says he has spoken to voters. People do not want to vote for Corbyn, he says. He says action must come from realism. Dominic Raab says you have to deliver Brexit. Then you can do things like cut taxes, that Corbyn cannot do. Q: How do you intend to win against Corbyn and Farage? Michael Gove says there is nothing more important than beating Corbyn. He says he took Corbyn apart in the 10-minute speech he gave in the no confidence debate earlier this year. And, to remove the threat from Farage, you have to deliver Brexit. Gove says he can because he lead the leave campaign. Guru-Murthy is now introducing the candidates. He says one lectern is empty. That is because Boris Johnson declined to take part. But he is welcome to join at any time, says Guru-Murthy. Guru-Murthy says the audience will ask the questions, and he will ask follow-ups. Guru-Murthy says the next Tory leader has to lift the party from the pitiful 9% it got in the European elections. And he - and the next leader will be a he - has to have ideas beyond Brexit. He says the audience tonight are all people who say they are open to the idea of voting Conservative. The debate is starting. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is hosting. Channel 4 are \u201cempty podiuming\u201d Boris Johnson. This is not something that broadcasters usually do when a candidate refuses to accept an invitation to take part in a debate, normally because it is seen as a hostile act (and broadcasters are meant to be impartial). It will highlight Johnson\u2019s refusal to turn up. But the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes thinks it might look a bit silly. Some of the candidates have been tweeting. I\u2019m sorry the comments aren\u2019t open yet. There seems to be a technical problem. We are trying to get that fixed, and hopefully they will open soon. According to the Press Association, Dominic Raab declined to answer questions as he arrived for the Channel 4 Tory leadership debate in east London. Rory Stewart said he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to the debate. Asked about Boris Johnson\u2019s non-appearance at the debate, Stewart said: We\u2019re choosing a prime minister and the public has the right to hear from us and judge who had the qualities to be prime minister. Stewart said he was hoping to discuss \u201cwhat we can achieve after Brexit, the way we can make this country fairer, greener, and more united\u201d during the live debate. Michael Gove said he was \u201clooking forward to a positive exchange\u201d as he arrive. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid were driven in to the debate venue via a back entrance and did not stop for journalists\u2019 questions. Good evening. And welcome to our blog covering the first televised hustings of the Conservative leadership contest. Five of the six candidates still in the race - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart - will be taking part. As you all must know, because his reluctance to face media scrutiny is becoming a major part of the narrative of the contest, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, has said he will be staying away. What are we going to find out? Well, perhaps not very much, because televised debates often have much less impact on political campaigns than people assume they will. What matters over the next week is how 313 MPs vote (because they still have to whittle the field down to two, for the ballot of party members) and, because MPs know all these candidates well, they are unlikely to be influenced much by what any of them say tonight. But debates can make a difference because they can produce one, or all, of the following three things. 1) A winner? More often than not after a debate like this supporters of X believe X did best, supporters of Y think Y did best, and people who are neutral are divided or unsure. But sometimes there is an obvious winner - for example, Nick Clegg in the first debate of the 2010 general election. 2) A story? Televised debates are always a story. But that does not always mean they always produce a story - a candidate saying something interesting and new, or some other defining event. But we always live in hope. 3) A defining moment? This could be the answer or exchange that produces a winner or a story, but sometimes what gets said in a debate can end up being a defining moment even though it does not seem so at the time. This happened in the 2015 general election Question Time when Ed Miliband was asked if the last government had overspent, and he said no. It was a version of an answer he had given many times before. But the clarity of the exchange meant it crystallised a concern that many voters had about Labour, and later it was seen as hugely damaging. It is also the case that debates are a good way of allowing people to evaluate politicians. In his classic 1990s book about politics, Ruling Britannia, Andrew Marr explains why seeing politicians being interviewed on television is so important. Television is very good at telling the voter certain things about a politician or other interviewee, One can read the facing tics and expressions that suggest tension, lying, anger and so forth. One can make a personal judgment about an individual minister or leader in a way that earlier generations never could, unless they were part of the privileged political elite. If before, one could read X\u2019s speech given verbatim in The Times, and treat X solely on the basis of his language and arguments, now one can concluded that X\u2019s grandson, the new minister, is a sanctimonious creep. And in the real world, the fact that \u2018X is a creep\u2019 is a valid personal assessment and matters to most of just as much as his speechifying. All of this is even more true of televised leadership debates, which involve leading politicians having to engage with each other in a way that does not normally happen in the Commons or on TV. The Channel 4 hustings starts at 6.30pm. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Raab called himself a \u201crestless soul\u201d, Javid said he was too stubborn, and Gove that he was too impatient.</p> \n<p>Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, had declined an invitation to take part in the debate, and is not expected to join a hustings with Westminster journalists on Monday either. But he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/boris-johnson-urged-to-debate-in-tory-leadership-tv-hustings\">will join a BBC debate on Tuesday evening</a>, after the second round of voting, when the field will have been slimmed down.</p> \n<p>The least popular candidate will be eliminated after Tuesday\u2019s ballot among MPs \u2013 as will any contender who does not meet a threshold of 33 supporters, set by the backbench 1922 Committee.</p> \n<p>Only Johnson, Hunt and Gove achieved that target last week. Others have spent the weekend trying to win over erstwhile supporters of Hancock, who withdrew after scoring 20 votes in the first round.</p> \n<p>Hancock himself, who pitched himself as the right candidate to \u201cturn the page\u201d on Brexit, announced on Sunday night that he was backing Johnson after holding meetings with all the other candidates on Friday and Saturday.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Times, Hancock said he felt Johnson had the best chance of uniting the party and the country and would lead as a one-nation prime minister because \u201cthat\u2019s how he ran London \u2013 consistently \u2013 for eight years\u201d. He added: \u201cI have repeatedly argued for a strategy of defeating the danger of [Nigel] Farage by delivering Brexit and defeating the danger of [Jeremy] Corbyn by dominating the centre ground thereafter. That is Boris\u2019s plan and I wholeheartedly endorse it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some moderate Tory MPs had hoped for a \u201cstop Johnson dream ticket\u201d, but talks on joining forces foundered. \u201cRory, Michael, Saj and Matt all agreed they should band together \u2013 but each of them thought it was him that people should unite around,\u201d said one senior Tory.</p> \n<p>Further rounds of voting will be held on Wednesday \u2013 and on Thursday, if necessary \u2013 to weed the field down to just two men, whose names will then go forward to Conservative party members. The result will be announced in the week beginning 21 July. </p>",

And despite the public pleas of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for candidates not to abandon the Tories\u2019 reputation for fiscal prudence, no one mentioned tackling the deficit. Raab was repeatedly challenged by all four of his rivals for refusing to rule out suspending parliament if he considered it necessary to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit \u2013 something he said must be kept on the table. \u201cThe minute we telegraph to the EU that we\u2019re not willing to walk away at the end of October, come what may, we lose the best shot at a deal,\u201d the former Brexit secretary said. But Javid told him: \u201cYou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy \u2013 we\u2019re not choosing a dictator, we\u2019re choosing a PM.\u201d And Hunt said the idea was a \u201cfundamental misreading of what parliament stands for, and what the people in this country would accept\u201d. Javid, who will need to win over extra support if he is to remain in the race after Tuesday\u2019s second round of voting, painted himself as a fresh face from a different background who could communicate better with non-Tory voters. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone that can unite people \u2013 and my own background, my life experience is very different from Conservative leaders of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not from central casting.\u201d Stewart, whose quixotic campaign has involved walking around Britain meeting the public, received a warm response from the studio audience of floating voters, including when he complained that the contest has become a \u201ccompetition of machismo\u201d over Brexit. He also took a swipe at Johnson by saying of his rivals in the studio: \u201cI hope it\u2019s one of us who becomes prime minister.\u201d And after the debate, he won the backing of business minister Margot James, who had previously supported Matt Hancock. She described him as \u201cenergetic, determined and embracing the centre ground\u201d. Stewart claimed he was the candidate who could win over backers of other parties at a future general election. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of the fact that Labour and Lib Dem voters say they would vote for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something to be proud of, and I think we need to work to listen to each other, and above all to bring this country together.\u201d One member of the audience asked the candidates about their greatest weakness. Raab called himself a \u201crestless soul\u201d, Javid said he was too stubborn, and Gove that he was too impatient. Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, had declined an invitation to take part in the debate, and is not expected to join a hustings with Westminster journalists on Monday either. But he will join a BBC debate on Tuesday evening, after the second round of voting, when the field will have been slimmed down. The least popular candidate will be eliminated after Tuesday\u2019s ballot among MPs \u2013 as will any contender who does not meet a threshold of 33 supporters, set by the backbench 1922 Committee. Only Johnson, Hunt and Gove achieved that target last week. Others have spent the weekend trying to win over erstwhile supporters of Hancock, who withdrew after scoring 20 votes in the first round. Hancock himself, who pitched himself as the right candidate to \u201cturn the page\u201d on Brexit, announced on Sunday night that he was backing Johnson after holding meetings with all the other candidates on Friday and Saturday. Writing in the Times, Hancock said he felt Johnson had the best chance of uniting the party and the country and would lead as a one-nation prime minister because \u201cthat\u2019s how he ran London \u2013 consistently \u2013 for eight years\u201d. He added: \u201cI have repeatedly argued for a strategy of defeating the danger of [Nigel] Farage by delivering Brexit and defeating the danger of [Jeremy] Corbyn by dominating the centre ground thereafter. That is Boris\u2019s plan and I wholeheartedly endorse it.\u201d Some moderate Tory MPs had hoped for a \u201cstop Johnson dream ticket\u201d, but talks on joining forces foundered. \u201cRory, Michael, Saj and Matt all agreed they should band together \u2013 but each of them thought it was him that people should unite around,\u201d said one senior Tory. Further rounds of voting will be held on Wednesday \u2013 and on Thursday, if necessary \u2013 to weed the field down to just two men, whose names will then go forward to Conservative party members. The result will be announced in the week beginning 21 July.",

And my argument is, are those really the best that we as Conservatives can offer the country?\u201d</p> \n<p>Hunt\u2019s comments contrasted with a fresh warning from his fellow leadership contender Dominic Raab on Sunday that the Tory party would be \u201ctoast\u201d if it failed to take Britain out of the EU by the end of October.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a4b8465f-bb6b-46cf-9b61-d0767fe8bd40\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZeoPfUt2ShQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hunt said he wanted to negotiate a new package with the EU27. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to do this by 31 October, but it will be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to a 31 October hard stop at any cost, because I don\u2019t think you can make that guarantee.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hunt said recent discussions with EU leaders, in his post as foreign secretary, had convinced him there could be a negotiated way through the Brexit impasse.</p> \n<p>\u201cApproached by a British PM, someone they were willing to deal with, who had ideas to solve the Irish border, they would be willing to renegotiate the package,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn particular, they\u2019re prepared to consider whether you could get much more detail over the future relationship, so that you wouldn\u2019t need the backstop.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, Raab had highlighted the risks of \u201ccorrosion of public trust\u201d for his party, with the Brexit party leading in several polls.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Tory party will be toast unless we\u2019re out by the end of October. People need to wake up to this. We\u2019ve seen from the Peterborough byelection, we\u2019ve seen it from the European elections,\u201d he said, referring to \u201cthe frustration, the scandal people feel\u201d over the delays to Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Conservatives cannot win an election unless we\u2019ve delivered Brexit,\u201d he added, speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News.</p> \n<p>Raab also again declined to rule out proroguing parliament, if as prime minister he believed a no-deal Brexit was the right course and MPs sought to block it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we would want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very unlikely. But what\u2019s really scandalous about this, is where people have been trying to sabotage the will of the people, and break their promises left, right and centre.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brexit has dominated the early stages of the leadership debate. Michael Gove, who came third in the first MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday, has suggested he would be willing to delay by a few weeks or months if necessary to get the right deal, but Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, has insisted he will leave on time.</p> \n<p>Rory Stewart, Johnson\u2019s fellow old Etonian, who picked up the support of the defence minister Tobias Ellwood on Sunday, told the BBC he did not know what Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan really was.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the moment, in this leadership race, to say who \u2013 and it\u2019s a very brutal question \u2013 who do you trust to be your prime minister? How is Boris going to deliver Brexit? How?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what he believes \u2013 he won\u2019t talk to me, he won\u2019t talk to you, he won\u2019t talk to the public,\u201d he said, before reiterating his insistence that he would not take a cabinet job if Johnson were to offer him one. \u201cI would not serve,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Johnson is not taking part in Sunday\u2019s TV debate, after warning he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/boris-johnson-urged-to-debate-in-tory-leadership-tv-hustings\">feared it could be \u201ccacophonous\u201d</a> \u2013 but will join a similar event on Tuesday night, after at least one more leadership contender has been knocked out.</p> \n<p>Stewart said his approach would be to try to get the existing Brexit deal through parliament, telling MPs: \u201cThis is the last-chance saloon. Get it done.\u201d If that failed, he would convene a citizens\u2019 assembly to decide what should happen next.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these other people are just saying: I\u2019m just going to go to Europe, and I\u2019m going to shout, and I\u2019m going to get us out, \u2018Give me a deal,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Sajid Javid used an <a href=\"https://brexitcentral.com/heres-how-ill-get-us-out-of-the-eu-by-october-31st-no-ifs-no-buts-no-excuses/\">article in BrexitCentral</a> on Sunday to set out more details of his approach. He said he would aim to deliver \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s got through parliament: leaving Europe with alternative arrangements on the backstop\u201d.</p> \n<p>And he repeated his offer to subsidise any spending by the Irish government necessary to provide border checks. Johnson has also talked about alternative arrangements, but Raab said: \u201cI\u2019m not quite clear what Boris\u2019s plan is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raab has pitched himself as the most determined Brexiter, but many of the most ardent Tory leavers, including Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are backing Johnson instead.</p> \n<p>Raab sought to burnish his reputation as the most resolute leaver on Sunday, saying: \u201cAll those candidates that are going weak at the knees, and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this or that,\u2019 they\u2019re sending a message to the EU that, frankly, they can take us for a ride. We\u2019ve had three years of that, and, frankly, it\u2019s time to get this done.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/jeremy-corbyn-faces-revolt-second-eu-referendum\">Grassroots and shadow cabinet add to pressure on Corbyn over Brexit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And while he came fourth in the first round of voting, with 27 supporters, he insisted he still hoped to achieve the 33 votes necessary to progress to the next round, when MPs take part in the second round on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had extra support coming in, so I\u2019ve got a good base, and we\u2019re well-placed to build some momentum.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has said the Brexit deadline of 31 October should not be a \u201chard stop\u201d and that Boris Johnson is posing a \u201cstark choice\u201d, between leaving the EU without a deal and a general election. As the five remaining rivals to Boris Johnson prepare for a televised debate on Sunday evening, Hunt warned it would be wrong to commit now to leave the EU by Halloween, come what may. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI want to make an argument that what Boris is offering \u2013 a hard stop at any cost, on 31 October \u2013 means that he is effectively committing the country to no deal \u2026 or an election, if parliament chooses to stop that. And my argument is, are those really the best that we as Conservatives can offer the country?\u201d Hunt\u2019s comments contrasted with a fresh warning from his fellow leadership contender Dominic Raab on Sunday that the Tory party would be \u201ctoast\u201d if it failed to take Britain out of the EU by the end of October. Hunt said he wanted to negotiate a new package with the EU27. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to do this by 31 October, but it will be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to a 31 October hard stop at any cost, because I don\u2019t think you can make that guarantee.\u201d Hunt said recent discussions with EU leaders, in his post as foreign secretary, had convinced him there could be a negotiated way through the Brexit impasse. \u201cApproached by a British PM, someone they were willing to deal with, who had ideas to solve the Irish border, they would be willing to renegotiate the package,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, they\u2019re prepared to consider whether you could get much more detail over the future relationship, so that you wouldn\u2019t need the backstop.\u201d Earlier, Raab had highlighted the risks of \u201ccorrosion of public trust\u201d for his party, with the Brexit party leading in several polls. \u201cThe Tory party will be toast unless we\u2019re out by the end of October. People need to wake up to this. We\u2019ve seen from the Peterborough byelection, we\u2019ve seen it from the European elections,\u201d he said, referring to \u201cthe frustration, the scandal people feel\u201d over the delays to Brexit. \u201cThe Conservatives cannot win an election unless we\u2019ve delivered Brexit,\u201d he added, speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. Raab also again declined to rule out proroguing parliament, if as prime minister he believed a no-deal Brexit was the right course and MPs sought to block it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we would want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very unlikely. But what\u2019s really scandalous about this, is where people have been trying to sabotage the will of the people, and break their promises left, right and centre.\u201d Brexit has dominated the early stages of the leadership debate. Michael Gove, who came third in the first MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday, has suggested he would be willing to delay by a few weeks or months if necessary to get the right deal, but Johnson, who is the overwhelming frontrunner, has insisted he will leave on time. Rory Stewart, Johnson\u2019s fellow old Etonian, who picked up the support of the defence minister Tobias Ellwood on Sunday, told the BBC he did not know what Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan really was. \u201cThis is the moment, in this leadership race, to say who \u2013 and it\u2019s a very brutal question \u2013 who do you trust to be your prime minister? How is Boris going to deliver Brexit? How?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even know what he believes \u2013 he won\u2019t talk to me, he won\u2019t talk to you, he won\u2019t talk to the public,\u201d he said, before reiterating his insistence that he would not take a cabinet job if Johnson were to offer him one. \u201cI would not serve,\u201d he said. Johnson is not taking part in Sunday\u2019s TV debate, after warning he feared it could be \u201ccacophonous\u201d \u2013 but will join a similar event on Tuesday night, after at least one more leadership contender has been knocked out. Stewart said his approach would be to try to get the existing Brexit deal through parliament, telling MPs: \u201cThis is the last-chance saloon. Get it done.\u201d If that failed, he would convene a citizens\u2019 assembly to decide what should happen next. \u201cAll these other people are just saying: I\u2019m just going to go to Europe, and I\u2019m going to shout, and I\u2019m going to get us out, \u2018Give me a deal,\u2019\u201d he said. Sajid Javid used an article in BrexitCentral on Sunday to set out more details of his approach. He said he would aim to deliver \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s got through parliament: leaving Europe with alternative arrangements on the backstop\u201d. And he repeated his offer to subsidise any spending by the Irish government necessary to provide border checks. Johnson has also talked about alternative arrangements, but Raab said: \u201cI\u2019m not quite clear what Boris\u2019s plan is.\u201d Raab has pitched himself as the most determined Brexiter, but many of the most ardent Tory leavers, including Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are backing Johnson instead. Raab sought to burnish his reputation as the most resolute leaver on Sunday, saying: \u201cAll those candidates that are going weak at the knees, and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this or that,\u2019 they\u2019re sending a message to the EU that, frankly, they can take us for a ride. We\u2019ve had three years of that, and, frankly, it\u2019s time to get this done.\u201d And while he came fourth in the first round of voting, with 27 supporters, he insisted he still hoped to achieve the 33 votes necessary to progress to the next round, when MPs take part in the second round on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had extra support coming in, so I\u2019ve got a good base, and we\u2019re well-placed to build some momentum. The race hasn\u2019t really started,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn faces a showdown with his shadow cabinet over Brexit on Monday amid growing signs of a grassroots revolt if he fails to give full backing to a second referendum in which Labour would campaign to remain. Several senior figures, including shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, will demand a clear, full-throated commitment to another referendum, following the party\u2019s disastrous showing in last month\u2019s European elections, when it lost 11% of its share of the vote and half of its seats. Thornberry said she would make it clear that it was time the party accepted that the next Tory leader was not going to offer a general election but would in all probability try to press for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 in which case Labour had to demand that the issue be put back to the people and campaign to stay in the EU. Thornberry, who has already angered the Corbyn inner circle with her strong backing for a second public vote, said it was now clear that the election of the next Tory leader \u2013 probably Boris Johnson \u2013 was not going to lead to a general election. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: \u201cSo if that is right and given that we are likely to be in an impasse, I fear that whoever is leader of the Conservative party we are going to end up with no deal and we simply cannot have no deal without there being a referendum on it and with the option of Remain.\u201d Others, including deputy leader Tom Watson and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, are also expected to weigh in. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell is said by colleagues to be calling on Corbyn to make a keynote speech within the next few weeks to end the uncertainty. While Corbyn said in the immediate aftermath of the European elections that the party would back a referendum on any Brexit deal, he has since sounded less sure, talking again of his preference for an election and saying a second public vote would be \u201csome way off\u201d. Growing pressure is also coming from pro-EU Labour activists who are circulating anti-Brexit motions at constituency Labour parties (CLPs) for submission to the autumn annual conference in Brighton. By last night they said that more than 130 CLPs across the country had agreed to debate a motion which would commit Labour to \u201ccampaign energetically for a public vote and to remain\u201d, and to \u201csupport revoking article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal.\u201d A similar motion will also be debated soon in Corbyn\u2019s own Islington North CLP. It will note that the \u201cvast majority of Labour members and voters oppose Brexit\u201d and that conference \u201cbelieves that Labour party policy must reflect this view and that we cannot go into any more elections without a clear policy for the UK to remain in the European Union.\u201d The campaign by Labour activists is similar to that mounted last year in favour of a second referendum.
